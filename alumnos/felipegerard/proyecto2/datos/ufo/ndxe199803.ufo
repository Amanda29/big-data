They went out all at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An orangey-pink ball of light, looking like a meteor, streaked at and angle from north to south , then stopped just above the tree-line.  It sat there for about a minute.  Three rows of bright, white lights(like stadium lights) came on in no particular order.  This display stayed on about seven seconds. In the darkness, I suddenly felt as if I were being watched.I realized there was no sound.  I live in the country and usually hear all kinds of nightlife.  I ran in the house,shaking.  A few minutes later, I went out to see if there was anything.  Every animal within miles was making noise.  It was almost deafening.  I had just come back from town and was driving in my drive when I first spotted it.  I got out when it was sitting above the trees. I am a substitue teacher, married with one little girl.<n>

I met the witness, a Baraboo resident, on both March 31 and April 5, and we had sightings on both mornings, which were shared by one friend of mine on March 31 and two different friends on April 5. I will enter data on the more interesting April 5 incident in a separate posting to come. I have written about my experience in the forthcoming June issue of FATE, but wanted to place the information here since I am not getting a response from members of Wisconsin MUFON after three weeks since contacting them. This is apparently a _recurring_ incident. At 4:45 a.m. CST on March 31, I met the witness. I was training my binoculars on the southeastern horizon (an area known as the Baraboo Bluffs, in the vicinity of several radio and microwave towers) when I saw a orange-yellowish light soar a few degrees across the horizon. My friend, viewing with the naked eye, said she saw it zig-zag. I had the impression of an old-fashioned orange computer cursor that leaves a trail as it glides across a blank screen. It was bright, anomalous, very short-lived, and not easy to explain. We then runined any further opportunity to observe the light by driving off in the wrong direction, after which it was too bright and too foggy for us to see anything more. We concluded that the sighting may have been a UFO or other kind of anomalous ground-light activity. I returned to Baraboo on April 5 with two other friends. We discovered then that at least part of what our witness was describing, observing, and photographing was nothing more than good old planet Venus, in the southeastern sky. Disappointed, we waited around for a few hours and prepared to leave. But once again, while I was training my binoculars high in the southern sky on Venus (at 8:10 a.m. CDT), my friends and I had another strange sighting. This time, a bright white light seemed to emerge from behind the center of a thin cloud, a few degrees &#34;below&#34; Venus. It was tens of thousands of feet high. It &#34;swooped&#34; below the cloud (from our perspective) and seemed to leave a bright light impression or reflection before vanishing. I had the impression of the shape of a powerfully lit electric moth. Again, this was seen by myself, two friends, and the Baraboo witness. The whole thing seemed to resemble an extremely odd entrail from a plane, and I have not been able to look into this yet, but (1) we saw no physical craft, and (2) we agreed that it motion was far too anomalous, especially since it was 8 a.m. on a Sunday, and supposedly recurring. I believe there is some basis in truth for what the Baraboo witness has been reporting, but fact and fallacy have been difficult to separate. The Baraboo witness may report his extensive sightings soon by phone, but I personally can offer these two reports which were shared by a number of my friends, and seem to be consistent with most of the witness&#39;s claims. Since this is apparently a recurring event, I personally recommend that somebody with more resources investigates. I am available for more information.<n>

Whitish, 3 objects larger than, but not as bright as Jupiter as seen in the sky. Traveling from E to W in a triangle shape very swiftly in a straight line, no sound or blinking lights, observed for only approx. 3-5 seconds before lost in trees.    After thinking about it I can only assume it was a meteor that broke up into 3 parts; no tail, but I am aware some &#34;shooting stars&#34; have no tails.   No weird feelings, loss of time or any of that.     Please write back to ArtLight@Juno.com and let me know if you are the right org. to report this too, and also if there were any more reported sightings around that time. Sincerely,((Name deleted))<n>

The sighting may have been seen throughout California.  This was a launch from Vandenberg AFB and NOT a UFO.  You may already have information on this launch, but I thought that this may be of assistance in case you did not know of the launch.  See below...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if the launch was announced--I do know that there was no mention of it on any of the networks or radio stations, from what I could tell--but it occured between 9:55 and 10:00pm.  It was seen as a typical rocket flame for approximately 2 minutes.  When stage one completed burn, it became a red dot in the southern sky.  This lasted for approximately 1 minute, and faded from view. If you were unaware of this, I hope it helps with any reports that you may receive today.<n>

It was the color of a green glow stick, seemed to have a slight trail, and was followed by two flanking objects, same color, but much smaller, which traveled at the same speed. The trailing objects were about a thumb at arms length back from the main object, with the appearant size each of the planet Venus. They gave the impression of being debris from the main object. They trasversed about 40 degrees of sky, as visible through a large sky light, in less than two seconds. The impression was of a rapidly falling object. The fire ball itself seemed fairly solid, only green flame like fuzziness at the very edges of the object made fireball the best description. There was the slight trail, very small, but no pronounced smoke trail that would be expected from a meteor. Except for the size and lack of smoke, seemed possible it was a meteor. No change of direction was seen during the time of observation. Lost sight of the object as it disapeared from field of view, about 15% above the horizon...<n>

At approx. 7:30 PM we saw what looked like a plane or a rocket taking off or flying slightly up and souhtbound in the sky directly ahead. It had a large orange tail. It got to a cretain height and then stopped cold. It then moved across the sky parallel to the horizon very fast and covered a lot of sky quickly. It stopped again, sat there for a minute, then it moved downward, tail reappearing and swirling around it like a fishhook. It then disappeared. We could make out no characteristics of the object except that it was as bright as a star and the sun had set behind it in the sky.<n>

The object was always moving directly east. It changed color from orange to white and flew directly over our heads. It was about 1000 feet high. It was changing shapes. There was no noise. We have a clear video of this object.<n>

The tail was not as bright as  the head, and burned with yellow and red colors.  The speed of the object seemed slower than that of meteors in showers I&#39;ve seen, and it did not fall.  It appeared to  maintain a constant altitude throughout the view time.  The observor is an amateur photographer/watercolorist and retired civil engineer.<n>

We had just moved into the county recently from the county just north of where we were driving. We turned down a old road and were heading west when I pointed out a spiral cloud in the sky to my wife. I reminded her of a television show we saw a week or so earlier that talked about spiral shaped clouds that migratory birds use to gain altitude for long journeys. The show also mentioned that these so called twist tubes were said to attract UFOs. Our younger backseat passengers took note and my wife and I ventured into different conversation. About a minute or so later my brother and law&#39;s friend said slowly in a calm voice, &#34;hey guys, I think there&#39;s something in the sky by that plane.&#34; We all immediately looked into the sky and I saw an egg shaped disk approximately 1/6 the size of a commercial airliner which the object was following. Frustrated with trying to drive and look I pulled over hoping that this decision would not make me miss the event. When I stepped out I witnessed 9 to 10 seconds of object flight that convinced me that the truth really was out there. I saw the silver slightly elongated craft appear to taunt the jetliner as it moved back and forth quickly under the fuselage and stopping at window level. I would think that someone on the plane would have seen the object. I saw it go left of the plane a to the right of the plane&#39;s fuselage once, hesitating directly under the fuselage as it passed under. It then moved behind the tail of the plane, rolled out to the left, and faded up in altitude and out of sight quickly. When we all settled back into the car and took a breathe of air I barely had time before I excitedly pointed out two airplanes coming from the south or Dayton, Ohio area and how much quicker they were traveling than the robust air traffic in the almost crystal clear skies. Noone spoke a word as both! jets cr iss-crossed a path leaving jet fuel above an old aviary secret.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>

Light just hovered 10-20 degrees above horizon for ~20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Noticed a bright light in the sky, thought it was a plane but it did not move.  After a few minutes, viewed through  binoculars and saw that the light was actually a series of lights in the shape of a cross, with 5 or 6 lights vertically and the same amount horizontally.  The brightest light was where the horizontal and vertical lights intersected at the center of the cross. The light was stationary for the longest time, allowing me to call my wife and have her view it through the binoculars.  She saw the same thing. After about 20 minutes, it started to move away from us and faded out over the next 5 minutes.  It&#39;s position in the sky did not change as it faded, rather it appeared to move away from us.  My wife thinks I&#39;m nuts, though she saw the same thing.<n>

Tonight 11:30pm. {3/27/98} I was walking my dog in my development {New York, in clifton park, 30 min north of Albany} when i noticed a bright yellow light.  At first iI thought it was a airplane but then it moved from side to side and then it got as small as a star then it got bigger again.  it started to move away so i walked down to the end of the street to get a better look at it.  The light started to get bigger and bigger and i started to make out the shape of what it looked like.  As it got closer to me i started to run away.  It was shining 4 or 5 spot lights around were i was but just for about 3 sec. then it was following me and then it crossed {behinde me which was the road i was standing on} it looked like a top hat but all the coners were cut of like if u take a square and off a coner of it, and it had just to lines for the door going from the bottom of it to the top.  It also had little windows around the whole thing.  As i looked at it as i was running it was coming down on a angle.  it was about a 100 feet from the tree tops. It had lights all around the whole ship and one on the top of the ship. As it got closer it had a mist of the color cyan around it.  As I ran back to my house with my dog i noticed i couldn&#39;t see it anymore because the trees were in the way.  When i got back to my house I told my dad what happened.  We went looking outside my dad saw the bright yellow light in the distance and it was heading north then dissapeared.  I have attached a picture that i have drawn of what i saw.  I would like to know if u had any pictures that looked like this one and if there was any other ufo sightings in that areaaround that time.  Thank you for your time<n>

The next day at school, I discovered another friend saw it also. Please notify me by e-mail ONLY.<n>

I was so scared I jumped in the truck and took off, I didn&#39;t stay around to see where it went. It was not of this wourld. I am a mature 19 year old farm girl who isn&#39;t afraid of much. I called my dad and told him and mom what I had saw. I was really upset, this was not a happy experence because I was horrified.<n>
3/25/98 23:30|Alexandria|LA|Triangle|2 minutes|Five white  lights in V-shaped pattern seen along Interstate 49 just south of Alexandria|6/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89294.html|25|ndxe199803| Five white  lights in V-shaped pattern seen along Interstate 49 just south of Alexandria<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family and I were traveling southbound on Interstate 49 one evening; we had just left the city limits. Just outside of the city, there is an Alexandria water tower along the western side of the Interstate. We&#39;ve made this commute south to Forest Hill hundreds of times but tonight was different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 100 feet south of the water tower, there were five white lights in a roughly triangular shape. The lights were hovering roughly 75-150 feet in the air, above the tree line.  The sight of these lights disturbed my family, causing my mother (who was driving) to panic.  I rolled down the window to determine whether or not there was any sound associated with the lights; there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since we were traveling on an interstate highway, we never stopped moving.  However, there was other vehicular traffic that witnessed this event. In fact, other southbound vehicles were driving slowly to witness the event, as well (you could see many vehicles&#39; brake lights being applied).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother suggested that it was helicopters or flares but I quickly dismissed those suggestions: the lights were each roughly 10-15 feet in diameter, and no smoke or vapor was being emitted that I could discern.  I could not determine whether or not the lights belonged to an aircraft because the lights were very bright, which dazzled my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights remained stationary until our traveling brought our vehicle out of view of the lights.  It was an eerie experience that I have never forgotten and only now do I report it since recently discovering the NUFORC site.<n>

It disappeared suddenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and brother in law were talking in the front seat of our van while I sat in the back trying to figure out what these 2 lights were that remained at the same size and distance to the NE of the van. We were traveling N on the Turnpike and we were N of Fort Pierce at approx 10 PM Tuesday March 24th. The lights were the color of flame, very bright and appearing to be high enough up to stay in a fixed position as we headed north. We lost them, maybe in trees, then they appeared again to the NW of our position. We lost them again, then one reappeared. It was very clear, no trees, no hills, no clouds, just stars and this bright flame colored light. We watched these lights for about 45 minutes which would have been quite a distance at the high rate of speed we were traveling. While all 3 of us were staring at the light trying to figure out what it was is just disappeared and there was nothing to see but a large number of stars in the bright sky. We all agreed that is was unlike any thing we had seen before. Observers are (2) college graduates (Accounting), 44 year old female and 33 year old male self employed in the computer industry and a 26 year old male employed at a grocery chain distribution center.<n>

I looked at it more carefully, it was three bright white lights in a triangle shape at a slight angle, lights strobed from red to green across the body of the craft then it changed direction and headed away from me, when the light went green I followed it, I only had to move 10 miles per hour to keep up with it.  It disappeared behind the tree line and I thought I saw it drop two or three objects (bright lights) but I can&#39;t be sure, it emerged from the tree line, strobed again then disappeared back under the tree line, when it reemerged it was a single white light, it then once again passed under the tree line and I lost it after that.  Not moments after I noticed an unusual amount of helecopters in the sky.<n>

We saw through our windshields  two bright, orange lights appear to the north east about 30 degrees above the horizon. The right light was higer than the left. They moved slightly to the left in unison and blinked out. We stopped our vehicles and the lights suddenly reappeared  about 30 degrees to the left of their original location. Now the lights were closer together, more like two very bright auto headlights. Only they were yellowish orange. The color of sodium street lights. In fact that&#39;s what they reminded me of. We observed them in this position for several minutes then they began to dim then return to their original brightness. They went and reappared about a minute later about 30 degrees to the east. Then the left light slowly descended and went out. The other light remained in the sky for several minutes and then dimmed and went out. First observed at about 2150hrs. Last observed about 2215 hrs EST. Observed almost continuously for about one half hour. I worked at TRW for 11 years in their aerospace program. I have witnessed many launches from Cape Kennedy. These were not missles. They were very bright lights that moved independently,   were as bright as flares and the same color. Most of the time they were stationary in the sky. They didn&#39;t move in unison but when they  reappeared  they would be together in the same part of the sky. Sometimes one would blink out before the other and then when they reappeared one would blink on before the other.<n>

A light appeared from the edge of the ridge and climbed a few degrees. I went to the window and tried to discern where it was. A very bright light that should have lit up the trees but didn&#39;t. Therefore I figured it was at a high altitude. The light remained stationary for a few moments and then sped off to the west at an incredible speed. More lights have been observed here off and on. I am a surveyor and I am very familiar with identifying landmarks from the air. I am also trained in airial photo interpretation and I habitually try to bring everything into perspective. I couldn&#39;t do that here though. There was nothing to judge by except the ridge.<n>

It drew my attention &#39;cause there were an unusual amount of local private planes flying around. They were going to it, and coming back from it. Then the local small planes left and all that was there was the hovering craft.  A few mins. later I heard jets coming twords it and the before they got there it was gone. This all lasted about 5mins. The colors on the object were Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, and White. It was a disk shape and the lights surrounded it. Turning on and Off<n>

We were on the roof of the building in the Hot Tub when another couple joined us who we did not know. We chatted a little with them and they were visiting from Witchita Kansas where the Male was employeed at Boeing (As an Engineer if my memory is correct). My wife asked &#34;What is that!&#34; and she was looking up and over at a 45+ degree angle (cannot remember direction E or W). The four of us looked up and saw 7 lights darting around eachother like fire flies in the sky. I did not have my glasses on at this point and I said it was probably sparkler fire works from one of the theme parks near by. The make of the other couple said &#34;No, that is not fireworks!&#34; and he, his wife and mine got out of the hot tub and watched the lights dance in the sky. I rushed over to the table and retreived my glasses and was shocked when I put them on. The number of lights had grown to about a dozen lights very very high in the sky. The lights looked as though they were forward pointing lights on individual craft and as they changed direction and the light pointed away the light would disappear to us and another would appear as it banked its turn and came back down. We watched in quiet awe for half an hour. We were interupted by a security guard that came out and told us the roof/pool/spa was now closed and we had to leave. I asked him &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; and he looked up and says he has no idea. We agreed that the lights were well above commercial flight altitude. The security guard was an older man who said he was retired military and he had never seen anything like it either. After a few minutes he made us leave the roof. My wife and I walked all around the building looking out windows trying to see the lights but the angle was wrong. We have talked for many years now about what we saw. I am curious if there are any other reports during that time frame in that location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) Plano, Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Straight overhead.  Width, 2.5 fingers at arms length. (Thickness of fingers).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9:46 pm, Mar 20, 1998. I went out side to get something out of my truck and heard Geese flying over.  I was looking up, blocking the house lights so I could see better. Some times when geese fly over at nite in the dark you can spot them in the city lights glare. As I looked somewhat to the west I thought I saw some comming over me going east. But as the lights from town hit IT,  I could make out a perfect triangle. For a few seconds I thought my eyes were playing a trick on me and it was really a flock of geese flying back to roost for the nite. But the harder I Iooked, the more I realized it was a solid shape,  not a &#34;V&#34;.  It looked dark gray or black with only reflected light illuminating it. It continued east untill it was out of the glare of the city.  I continued to watch that direction to see if it blocked out any stars momentairly,  but it didn&#39;t, (that I could tell).  When it was directly overhead, it didn&#39;t pass over any brite stars, to block them out.  I couldn&#39;t tell how high it was but it was 2  1/2 fingers long.  That is, the thickness of my fingers at arms length. There were comercial jets in the area at their crusing alt. but I suspect this UFO was way lower then them because one finger could easily block them out.   Not 2 to 3 like the UFO. This is about all I saw.  Just here a few second...then gone.<n>

When the whole formation started twinkling and moved almost instantaniously. We pulled over to the side of the road to observe when the smaller lights started twinkling and turning red and darting away from the formation, with really small lights coming from the red lights. One of the small lights came within 20ft. of us just above the treeline. It was very small, the size of a headlight, no sound, no rays of light coming from it. When it came to the closest point to us we felt a rush of fear come over us then it was gone. We continued to watch the larger pulsing light move NE in intervals til it was out of sight.<n>

I had also been in an accident earlier that day so I was nervous of what I saw. About 5 miles north of trout run which is north of Williamsport Pa. on Rt. 414 heading towards Troy Pa. I observed a round fire ball abort the size of a Cessna 182 at 3000 ft above me at traveling at the same speed a 182 would cruse at that altitude. There are several mountain peaks in that area and the altitude was guess taking in consideration the way it came from behind the first peak and the distance I was from that peak. I contacted Pa. stare police about the fire ball because I was concerned that an aircraft was what I say that may have been on fire. I observed this object for several minutes as it crossed from left to right, eventually passing the peaks on the right. It followed the trajectory that a personal aircraft would, yes it seemed odd that a pers! onal aircraft could travel that far without crashing but I needed a reason to call the state police without sounding like a nut (sorry).

Appeared to be flying in close formation, but one kept coming in close to the other, varying the distance by 1/2 at even intervals throughout the observable portion of the trip.  No regular aircraft lights, not flying in a logan or greene or orham air lane.  Too high for civilian craft, and too erratic (and completely silent) for military.  Having been exposed to most types of aircraft (including missiles and experimental craft) in New Mexico (worked at White Sands and Holloman for some time), I can say that I have never seen anything like this.  The two lights apppeared like satellites, but moved too close, too erratic.  No flames, no missile contrails.  Overall, my estimate is 50,000 feet or more altitude, 2500 or more miles per hour nautical.  I cannot explain or rationalize, though they may be more missile testing, but were headed from land to land, not over an ocean.  VERY unusual.<n>

Stayed stationary for approx. 10 min. until another plane flew close, craft dropped altitude suddenly and took off at high rate of speed.  We could hear the plane not the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Dad and I were loading a U-Haul truck and a washer and dryer my best friend had bought from my parents.  We were sky gazing when I noticed an object following a plane at a high rate of speed.  My binoculars happened to be in the car and I got them hoping to get a better look.  When the object came close to the plane it quickly came to a stop and hovered. When I aimed the binoculars to it, it seemed like it noticed.  I felt like someone or something was watching me.  My dad felt it too.  So did my best friend who is a non-believer.  She was in shock.  The object was a cross between a cigar and a cylinder.  It had a red tip and the rest of it was a periwinkle blue color.  It was omiting a vapor like exhaust and had port hole windows that had a warm whte glow illuminating from them.  I looked at it for a good eight or nine minutes.  Another plane began approaching it from the north.  the craft dropped a severe amount of altitude and took off at a tremendous rate of speed.  We could hear both of the planes but we never heard a sound from the craft.<n>

Object was spotted out sliding glass doors. I calculate my field of view to be about 30 degrees of sky from top to horizon. The object transveresed this arc in 1 1/2 to 3 seconds in a straight line. There are pine trees about 50 yrds from my location, and as the object disappeared into that ridge line, it was not low enough to light the trees or ground, inspite of being very bright. It was about 3 to 4 times the brightness of Venus at it&#39;s brightest. Did not appear to be a flare, or meteor, although the speed seemed slower than meteors I have witnessed. I also witnessed an unreported white fireball, at least half the diameter of the full moon, from the same vantage point, EXACT same tragectory, in August 1997. Flight characteristics were similar. Although I found the first sighting very odd, I dismissed it as either a meteor, or some incindiary, because the first, August 97 gave off &#34;sparks&#34; as it flew. If it was a meteor in August, it seemed to large to have entered the atmosphere unreported.<n>

Prospect area of Holderness, I glimpsed a large greenish/blue fireball @0315. What surprised me the most was the rate of speed, much slower than a meteorite. This must have been due to being much closer to the earth. In relative size it appeared to be 1/2 the size of the moon. My first encounter with a fireball was on 2/15 @0515 on Rte. 113 in Holderness. This fireball seemed much closer and was white in color. I had never seen a fireball before and was quite astonished at the size and slow rate of speed. It appeared to be very low, almost directly overhead. The following night I glimpsed another at a much greater height.<n>

A large triangular shaped craft appeared seemingly from nowhere and crossed in front of us very slowly from east to west. We didn&#39;t notice any lights or sound.  It was flying very low to the ground and passed directly over our path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is an electrical engineer who grew up in the air force the son of a USAF pilot and had served 11 years himself before getting out and going to work for defense contractors and performing EMP/EMI/EMC testing on military aircraft.

Flaming eyeball floats across the horizon then a glow in sky makes a streak above us in a 60* angle|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67630.html|53|ndxe199803| Flaming eyeball floats across the horizon then a glow in sky makes a streak above us in a 60* angle<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never told anyone of this sighting other than my wife.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The exact date is unknown to my memory, but it took place in late 97 or early 98. In those days I drank and abused soft drugs.  As I and my friend were under the age of 21 and our parents did not condone this type of activity, we participated in a classic American teenage ritual known as “road tripping” where you drive around all evening drinking and listening to music.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One place in particular where we liked to stop was at a small tree nursery off the Iola black top between Farina and Iola IL.  The truck was facing east.  We liked to stop there because it was out of the way and it was very unlikely, if not impossible for any John Q law types to be patrolling, or concerned with.  It was here that our route, which started west of St. Peter IL, reached its’ intermission.  This means, it is where we finished half of the case of beer and always felt the need to peak the buzz w/ soft drugs in the form of a, marijuana joint.  The custom with my friends was if you couldn’t roll a J then you had to break it up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a winter month in 1997 at 22:00 to 23:00 hrs, when my friend completed his task of preparing enough marijuana for a joint.  He then presented it to me to roll.  I took the plate and all my concentration was on the rolling process.   Just as I am finishing my task I hear him belt out “what the f/;’ was that” I look up off of the plate but see nothing.  My friend was a nice guy, but always had a reputation for pulling our legs or being reckless with the truth. What was what I asked?  He said “you didn’t see that?” see what I asked? He was some what hysterical and clearly not acting for a gag or joke. A big f/;’ing flaming eyeball just floated by. I laugh and give him some pretty heavy static.  He said “no way man not this time a big f’;.ing flaming eye ball just floated by it zipped this way and then slowly floated across the horizon.  I still look at him like he is crazy “bullshit,” I said.  He continued with his rants of the flaming ball or “eyeball” flooded with the heavy use of superlatives. I by this time have finished the joint giving him more shit saying the weed wasn’t that good and so on.  I never saw the first sighting that he did but soon learned he was clearly telling the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left the tree nursery and turned left on the Iola blacktop back towards Farina IL.  Just after the turn onto the blacktop as if whatever it was could hear the shit I was laying on my friend, we both see a glow way out in the stars above us. It happened in slow motion, like a car wreck but was instantaneous, because I only had started pointing at it. There was no time to say do you see that, but we both could not take our eyes off of the glowing reddish, purplish, aura, that was way out there, like a star itself, kind of spinning or flickering.  In the same instant it was glowing and we were looking at it. It streaked from that fixed point right over us off to the right in an acute angle it seemed to remain in the sky but didn’t, like the shutter speed of the mind was slower than what happened. It made an acute angle and nothing made by man could do what we saw.  I never saw a craft per-say but the effect of one. The streak it made was elongated in blue red and finally yellow it made an acute angle roughly 60* and again, it was instantaneous.  We both were speechless “now do you f*(%ing believe me”  he yelled.  I stated that two people could not experience the same graphic hallucination. The government might have experimental craft but nothing could defy physical natural law like what we saw.  “No f*#ing shit” he said definitely an unidentified object.  We both clearly agreed it was not of the material realm we are apart of, because it did not observe physical laws.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He wanted to tell the other friends when we got back to town.  I made him rationalize that people already had an opinion of him as a bullshitter, and I didn’t want to be perceived as crazy, or a liar seeking attention, so I told him if he told any one I would kick his ass. He and I had a falling out but I have never told anyone what we saw that clear winter night.   I was instantly transformed from curious skeptic to believer on that night.  Since, doing pot and drinking and driving are illegal, I knew this story would never be taken seriously anyway. However, the sighting was very real. It made me think about the possibility of inter-dimensions rather than linear travel of them they it or whatever. Due to the way it was there for him, and then way out there like beyond the distance of the moon and instantly over us and so forth. Thank you for your time this is no joke or hoax.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Stopped to watch, for it emitted great light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving west bound away from mountains, but at an angle where mountains were seen from car.I had just dropped my daughter off at her Mother&#39;s house. Went to turn onto road, noticed bright light and thought a car had come around my side from blind spot. Slowed the vehicle and stopped only to realize that the lights were coming from over the hill. There were two of them and judging by the shape of the hills, these objects were fairly far apart, because they both sat over two seperate hilltops. They seemed to travel in an upward motion, building speed as they went. One broke away from its&#39; original coarse only to return to its&#39; original position in a split second. Both objects ran upward only to come back down right above the hilltop. they did this a few times before they went back down behind the hills. They changed colors as they went higher into the sky only to be more defining in shape. when close to the hilltop, the objects seemed more orange and yellow and where shaped like an ice cream cone, but as they got higher the color changed to a more blue and the shape was definitely oval and pulsed as it moved. My nephew thought it might be a military exercise, because we have a air force base right out of town, but I told him I did not think so, the military doesn&#39;t ever fly over housing areas, there were houses up on the hill, then we both were also confused because of the speed the objects were moving, then just coming to a dead stop after moving so fast so quickly&gt; They seemed to be defying normal gravity. I looked in the newspaper to see if any training was going on and nothing was found. I did see an articled in the paper about two weeks later , with reports of strange lights and sounds coming from the hilltop area with lots of people reporting similar things that I saw.<n>

They looked weird so I stared at them. About 5 seconds later, one of the &#34;Clouds&#34; dissapeared. It was gone. There was no trace of where it went. The other clouds stayed there. Just then I told my parents what I saw and they laughed and said I was crazy. I called my mom later that night and she believed me because she also had an encounter. That is all there is.<n>

The first time a saw this object we were participatung in an unrep (getting fuel) from an oiler ship. It was at night and i was on the flight deck with some of my other shipmates, I noticed that the other ship had a lot of lights on their mast, and I thought that was unusual. I kept staring then notice it was an aircraft of some sort, it was following us, seemed interested in what we were doing. I kept looking at it and when  told my friends to look it suddenly shut 1 light off and then the rest followed in order. It had about 5-6 lights arched or curved and they were white in color but thats all. about 2 days later I was going on watch out on the fantail of the ship(back). it was dusk not quite dark yet. we were getting a decomssioned ship ready for target  practice the next day and some of shipmates took a small boat out to that ship while we were dead in the water. my friend snuck away from the work to have a cigarette in the back where i was. we were talking when i suddenly turned to the port side corner of the fantail and right there, not even 50 yards away was the same object i seen 2 nites before. the lights were all I seen and they were curved about 2 ft. apart and there were 5-6 of these lights. there was no mass behind it, no shadow and especially no sound. no sound!and it was to near to us to have no sound. my friend seen it too and when i asked him if he was actually seeing it, he freaked out and ran off leaving me there by myself the entire night. the 1 thing I noticed was that it seemed to be interested in us or me and i have no idea how long it was there before i noticed it. once we did notice it, it let us look for a while but then it once again shut 1 light off and the others followed in order. then it was gone. no sound, no movement was seen. like it went underwater or something. I honestly think it knew I seen it that one other night and it wanted something, I oft! en wonder what it was,it was no aircraft I was trained to identify.and waht would have happened if my friend wasn&#39;t there that night. when I reported it to operations they said they seen nothing on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There were a few clouds but a lot of very blue sky. We were fishing on the SW side of the lake looking to the N. when Jim said look at the UFO. I very luckly look in the correct direction and saw the object quickly. It was falling parralell to a E facing slope that we were sitting beside. I thought it was going to crash. It then stopped for a second and then speed at about 2 oclock. It went into a cloud and never came out. This,what used to be a small cloud the began to enlarge and move directly over us like no other clouds around. I told Jim that something else was going to happen but it didn&#39;t. Not Yet anyhow. That evening because of warm temperatures the ice had become slushy and we had to abandon our snowmobile,ice fishing sled with all of my fishing gear, and 6 21&#34; Lake trout. Everything on the sled was very secure with four bungie cords. The next morning we drove out on another machine. We observed that there were not any tracks from birds or fopur legged animals. 4 out of 6 of our fish had vanished. I wonder ?<n>

We traveled south on Hwy 51 to the four way stop at the intersection of Church Rd. and Hwy 51. As we traveled south from Bullfrog Corner, I noticed a strange shiny light in the sky. The disk, metalic, moved from right to left, like a bee dancing. I watched for a few minutes to make sure. I informed my Grandmother, because I was that sure it wasn&#39;t a plane. She could not figure out what it was either. It moved in a southernly direction for a second. A green plane moved through the sky beneath the disk. The unidentifed object moved closer and then disappeared in the direstion of the plane. Down Church Road in that direction, in the woods, are large radar dishes fenced off from the road. A small airfield is at the end of the road.<n>

It was about 8am.I am a electrical tradesman and therefore consider myself a fairly well educated person. My neighbour who was with me has his own business and is also well educated. We both had open minds to the possibilty of UFO&#39;S. As we drove to Melaney, there was a substantial break in the clouds as we came over a ridge. To the east of us and at about 1 oclock in the sky, we clearly saw three blue triangles in close formation. We stopped and they appeared to remain in that formation for a short time. There was no noise assosiated with the objects. They stayed in that spot until we lost sight due to cloud cover. I lived for many years near a large Airforce Base and in that time saw many and varied aircraft. I also worked on the base at various times.

I was driving down County Road 14 to State 131 in Routt Co., Colorado, when I noticed a light in the sky.  We have a number of trains in the area and the best description I can give is that it was a slow moving train driving over the top of the Flattops ( a high plateau mountain range).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are no train tracks on the top of the Flattops.  It was about 4 am with no other vehicles on the highway.  There is no train that crosses the Flattops.  I was so intranced, that, even having to catch a flight in Denver, I stopped to watch. I have driven the road many times since and never had the same visual experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later I told a friend who described a light darting from the hills while she was walking in Vail.  We only communicate rarely, maybe once a year, but I was stunned that both of us would have experienced an unusual light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not until tongiht when I say the UFO special with Peter Jennings that I decided to do anything about my siting.  At first I thought I was following a star, but when I stopped it was more than evident that there was a moving object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this will help, please use it.  The dates are very fuzzy and I am only guessing, but if this adds to the data base all to the good. I know the time of day, but the year is in question.  I communited from Oak Creek to Denver from 1993 until 2000 traveling the same highway.  During that time I lived in NYS.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got out the video camera and zoomed right in on the object and to our amazement it showed a glowing sphere with symmetrical markings on it. It was like nothing we had seen before! But it&#39;s all on tape now!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live on a farm on the eastern side of Australia with a great, unobstructed view of the night sky. It was clear summer night with a full moon out. My brother and his girlfriend woke me to look at a large glowing object they had noticed looking out through their bedroom window in the lower eastern part of the night sky. It looked like a normal glowing star but much, much brighter and larger. I laughed saying it was a helicopter or something but they assured me that it had been there for a while. So I went and got my video camera and proceeded to film it. The object looked like a huge glowing ball but when I zoomed in on it you could see a huge sphere like object that was a light cream/grey color with symmetrical patterns on it. This instantly shocked us. You could not see the patterns with your naked eye or even with binoculers, as we tried, but using the zoom on the video camera (it&#39;s one of the latest model camera&#39;s with a great zoom) was totally amazing, you could see it very well. I kept filming the object and it would glow brightly (white) with green around the edges, then change to red around the edges, then the glowing would subside and the camera was able to pick up the sphere with the patterns on it again. The sphere also moved in and out on the camera screen getting larger and smaller as I stayed still on it. We don&#39;t know what it was, but were totally amazed by it! I filmed it for about 40 minutes and it was still there so we went back to bed as I acquired enough footage of it!<n>

At very close to 9:50pm as we were walking around the hotel complex (to get some exercise) we spotted something very strange just north and west and maybe 45 degrees up in the sky from our location. It appeared to be a tight cluster of very dimly lit white spheres that were rising out in the distance (south and maybe west of downtown Seattle near SeaTac Airport). The cluster was slowly rising straight up in the air over a period of about 4 minutes. The entire cluster also pulsed a total of three times within about a minute and a half of first spotting them while they were rising.  Even though the objects were a dimily lit white, they pulsed in very bright colors (mostly red) and at exactly the same time. They were also moving around in their tight cluster in such a way that made the whole of the objects seem to change shape and sort of wave around in the sky. Although it appeared to be just to the east of SeaTac Airport we had been watching most of the airplane activity in the area and this was nothing even comparable to any air activity that I had ever seen in my life! The cluster continued to rise until it climbed up into some higher cloud cover and we couldn&#39;t see it anymore. I&#39;m really curious if any one has ever seen such a site especially in the Seattle area?<n>

Now I could see 5-6 white lights in a sort of arch formation following us. Nobody else seemed to see this.

Please remember that it was dusk and I saw nothing but lights. I don&#39;t know how long it was there before we noticed it, but it was definately looking right at us. After about 2-3 min. of this it did the same thing again, it shut off one light(from my left) then the rest shut off in a row. Then it was just gone! Heard nothing, saw nothing. My friend freaked out and ran off leaving me there all alone to stand the rest of my watch all night. When I confronted my friend the nexy day, he refused to talk about it and ran off, clearly disturbed.

Directly above traveling in a east to west direction over San Jose and heading twards the coast I noticed four to five bright spheres. I focused on the birds again to make sure my eyes were not deceiving me, then back on the spheres. These objects were white and completely round in shape. No other characteristics were observed.It was hard to tell how fast they were moving. They were traveling in a box formation. One trailing object moved from left to right over another and then moved back to its original position. It was at this time I decided to go in the house a get my binoculars, when I returned they were gone. For the next couple of days I told myself that what I saw could not have been a UFO, but there were no wings, perfectly round and very bright in color. I have not told my family because they would think I was nuts. I had to make this report because I think its important. I know what I saw and they were not planes nor were they baloons. If you are able to find out what these were, I would appreciate it if you would let me know. Thanks, salarussas@msn.com<n>

I had also seen a strange looking airplane about twenty to thirty minutes prior to seeing the green sphere. The craft resembled a plane in nature but had strange x like wing pattern. I saw this x wing like plane first and dissmissed it as blurred vision from being on the road too long. The x wing type plane was seen through my front window while exiting I-95 at exit 3 to go the truck stop. I saw the green sphere getting back on the same exit, and thats when I began to question the first x wing like plane. I am not sure about the first plane like craft because it caught me off guard and happened quickly. The x wing craft appeared low to the ground and looked as though it could have been making a landing approach, again another reason why I had brushed this incident off at first. I did not have the cb on when I saw the first object, so I am not sure if it was seen by anybody else, or if my eyes were playing tricks on me. The green glowing sphere however I am sure about and had confirmed by speaking with other drivers who had also seen it.<n>

We had heard there were sightings in the area by the locals, so we watched the skies each night of our stay. Nothing at all unusual for the first 3 days. On our last day, I awoke at 4:30 a.m. and looked out the window to the south. It was a very clear night. I saw an extremely bright light in the sky that stood out over all the stars. I looked at it through the binoculars and discovered that it was actually 2 separate lights, side by side. I awoke my son and brother to verify what I saw.  They agreed it was 2 separate lights and absolutely NOT a star or a planet(s). The lights were dazzingly white and stationary. We watched them until the sun rose and finally couln&#39;t see them anymore because of the sun, although they were visible in the early morning daylight hour after all the other stars had faded.<n>
3/12/98 02:30|San Antonio|TX|Light|5 minutes|Scanned by an unusually large scanner|8/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24520.html|82|ndxe199803| Scanned by an unusually large scanner<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was involved in a UAV (unmanned arial vehical) developement program west of San Antonio about 70 miles.  The company I was employed by had a rather large Government contract to build the first fully atonamous UAV.  Over a two year period others involved had seen strange metallic balls during the day and red orbs at dust during the course of the program.  My personal experience took place on night while we were planning to launch the vehical.  My flight crew duties that evening was OB1 (ground observer 1), I was tasked with driving a Hummer (Hum V) on a specified course while the plane would lock on and track me while driving with various systems we were developing.  I and our chase acft. had just cleared the crew for take off when I noticed a light at eye level out in a field to the left of the hangar and runway. The light sort of wiggled and then disappered as I asked one of the other pilots with me in the hummer if he had seen it.  He responded by saying see what, of course it was gone and I just blew it off, when suddenly the light appeared agian and I once again said to my freind what is that when simultaneously a huge what looked like lazer light very white almost blue colored shot out in a giant fan configuration such as maybe a giant scanner.  I remember the light slowly crossing the two GCS&#39;s (Ground Control Stations) and eventually slowly scanning everything on the filed with one slow mechanized sweep.  When it finally got to us my partner had ducked under the dash of the Hum v and was trying to stay out of the scanner? If that is what it was, I thought well it can&#39;t be harmful so I held on to the steering wheel and let it scann me, I don&#39;t think it did any perminant damage, but it was very interesting it closed after it past us and it wiggleda bit and disappeared.  My freind and I were the only two to see it because we were the only two facing it, although it did scann everyone on the field.  Before the post flight debrief I asked him if we should mention it his response was &#34;what are you c! razy, I don&#39;t want to lose this job&#34;.  So neither of us spoke of it again.  I am a college graduate, commercial pilot, mechanic, electrician, jack of all trades master of none and this is not the only sighting I have had.<n>

While I was out I thought I could possably get a look at the commet. After observing the commet for a brief moment I turned a little to the north. I saw what looked to be a group of dim stars,at that moment they began to light up one at a time.I then called for my cousin to step outside and take a look. As he steped out all six lights left at once headed due south. All six objects were the same shape and moved as if they were all connected.<n>

I saw the second fireball on 03/03/98 at approximately 0225 hours, to the west of my location, again travelling south to north. The third was on 03/07/98 at approximately 0020 hours, slightly to my east, again moving from south to north. The fourth was on 03/09/98 at approximately 0445 hours, to my west, this one travelled from north to south. The fifth one I saw on 03/12/98 at 0110 hours, to my west and travelled from south to north. All these objects were intensely illuminated with a greenish or blue coloring. None of the objects showed the classic meteorite strieking appearence.  They did not break up as they moved, nor do they &#39;burn out&#39; as I have seen others do. They all seem to suddenly end and they are gone. I am a police officer and I have worked the graveyard shift in this area for the past 18 months. I have yet seen anything this frequent or this brillant in activity. I do not beleive they are &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34; per say, but there is definately going on over Colorado that was not happening before. Thank you for your time.<n>

They appeared to have no single light. They glowed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 3/11/98 at 10:03pm cst, my wife and myself were standing in our back(south-facing)yard, in the southwest side of Colorado Springs, Colorado. It was clear, moon nearly full, calm wind, 20 degrees. I looked to the west at about 30 degrees above the horizon at a group of stars to the north of Orion. As I turned back to face my wife something caught my attention inn the corner of my eye. I thought that it was a star cluster I had at first overlooked yet, there seemed to be movement. I turned to the west to squarely look at the object and discovered it to be moving at a steady rate of speed and altitude, from south to north. A path which came directly over Cheyenne Mountain and continued along the front range mountains until I could not see it any longer due to houses, etc.. When I first noticed that it was a moving object, I brought it to my wife&#39;s attention. She too percieved the same U.F.O.. At first sight it appeared to be a single chevron or delta winged configuration. However,the object consisted of seven cylindrical sections. Each cylinder tapered to nearly a point on each end. One in the lead with three others on each side. They were of a consistant grayish tone with perhaps a slight aura around each one. It was impossible to estimate the size or speed. First impressions were of a craft the size of a B-52 at about 5,000 feet, cruising at a speed consistant with approaching an airport for landing. Although, it easily could have been much larger and at considerably higher altitude. It was completely silent. There were no external lights. Preconceptions of aircraft flying with their wings perpendicular to the ground, at first, gave the impression that this was also true for this group of objects. Although it may have been a formation stacked vertically. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m suggesting this because of the moon light at the time. The color of the objects were consistent with moon glow reflection. A reflection which seems unlikely if the craft were side by side with one another. The overall shape of the seven objects appeared to have little or no foreshortening, which I would expect from the angle,if they were flying horizontal, side by side. I don&#39;t know. The entire event was 10-15 seconds long. At about 6 seconds into the event, the upper or eastern three objects broke formation for about 1 to 2 seconds before regrouping as they origonally were. The break in formation was rather wave-like in it&#39;s movement. The first object from the middle, moved first, away from the center object and slightly forward. With the next two objects moving outward slightly. And the outer- most object moving slightly further apart still. Then they all reversed the sequence to resume the original formation. At this moment, the objects involved in the laterral motion, appeared to have their aura&#39;s glow intensify for less than a second, then return to the same overall color. Then they went out of sight, due to houses, trees, etc..<n>

As we sat talking, a very bright light filled the car and appeared to move through the car from south to north. It lasted about 2 seconds.  We both looked around to see what kind of vehicle would have such brilliant headlights, but there were no other cars or trucks pulling in or out at that time.  We then discussed whether it may have been someone taking a picture.  Bu it was late, very cold out and no-one was appeared to be outside. At that moment, there were no planes overhead.  The light itself was silver-blue in colour and illuminated the interior of my car for those brief seconds.  Although we have no idea what the light may have been, my friend was able to relate the light back to two other events similar in nature.  So there you have it.<n>

It was shaped like a &gt; It had almost square plates spaced out evenly on the giant V.  I saw about 7 of them, one was on the point or say the vertex of the V.  It was flat and it was silent and swift. It was like it came into the range of sight and went right out or the lights were suddenly turned off.  It was so big that if I put my arms up into a wide V that was how much space it took up in the sky when you looked up at it.  Like when you see a plane you can put your thumb and finger next to each other about 1/3 of an inch and that&#39;s how it seems to be from where you are standing. It was silent and it just glided by so fast and went out of sight. Now my son was with me and he didn&#39;t see it, he only saw me run.  I ran to the back of our townhouse building, from front to back and on the side of the building was a young couple and they were kissing and the young man saw it, I&#39;d guess he was around 18 and I said &#34;What was that?!&#34; and he said &#34;I don&#39;t know did you see it, too.?&#34; and I said &#34;I sure did.&#34; and we didn&#39;t know what it was.  It was the most fascinating thing I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky.  I wish I would have talked to him more about it and found out his name and where he lived.  I kept waiting to hear something about it on the news but I never did.  A week or two later I was watching TV and this UFO show came on (I forgot the name of it) and they said that in the desert they had spotted something in the sky that was similar to what I saw and it was supposedely a big sighting they had found.  One more thing about the squares they weren&#39;t really shiny but they silverish and luminescent.  I never reported this, but I did tell a few people about it through the 6 0 7 years since I&#39;ve seen it.  I don&#39;t discount UFO&#39;s, I&#39;m also not a person who studies them.  I wish I could find somebody who is interested in this story and may have also seen the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

V-shape intense white light each. Cntr craft left,rest followed as observer stopped car below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am curious what is done with this type of information, especially since it is after the fact of the incident. My mother, a stable, religious, and previously non-believing (in UFOs) person, related the following story to me this evening: At approximately 7 p.m she was driving home and saw a straight line of intense white V-shaped lights in a perfectly straight line ahead, about 1000&#39; in the sky.  She described them as looking light &#34;football stadium lights&#34; only v-shaped, that close together and straight.  She ended up driving 10 blocks until she was nearly underneath.  She slowed down the car and rolled down the window to observe and try to figure out what they were, and at that point the center object left the formation proceeding straight forward, and the remaining object followed, still in tight, straight formation, and all were quickly out of sight. The one thing she thought very odd was that there was no sound at all from the objects, unlike aircraft. She is not the type to embellish or fabricate such a story, and did not even feel anything more than a curious amusement about this topic, but now is shocked, certain of what she saw, and a believer that what she saw was not any craft that she has ever heard of.  She related this to me to ask if I knew of any military aircraft that was quiet and matched that description because I served with the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing and knew of most military aircraft in the world. This is quite a story, and has really shaken her belief system.  I think it is fascinating and was interested to see if there is any way to check on air traffic activity during that period of time.

Had lights shining down from the craft as well as lights shining up into the sky. It was quite low over our car and approximately the size of a large airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My two daughters (ages 17 and 10) and I were driving from West Virginia to Florida for vacation and at approximately 7:00p.m. March 10 we were east of Columbia, South Carolina, heading east toward I95.  In the distance, somewhat to the right of the highway we could see a very bright light in the sky.  At first we thought it was from a radio tower as its altitude seemed to be only about that high and it was stationary.  As we got closer we could see no tower, just this incredibly bright light hanging motionless. We kept driving toward it and the road somewhat curved to the right and the light was then right over the highway in front of us.  It looked at first like an airplane but when we were almost under it we could see the shape.  It had four distinct sides with the brightest lights on the points but with lights all along each side.  It was slightly elongated, like a diamond shape, with the ends pointing east/west.  There were lights similarly placed on the top of the craft which were shining straight up. We pulled off the road when we were directly under the craft so my daughter could get our binoculars and camera from the trunk.  When we stopped, the craft slowly started to move away, to the east, and before we could get the binoculars out, it picked up speed and moved away. We had a very good look at the craft when it was above us.  It was a clear night with no rain or fog and there was a nearly full moon.  The altitude of the craft was quite low...maybe 500 feet above us.  None of us had a clear look at the substance of the craft due to the intensity of the lights from it.  My younger daughter thought she could see the triangular &#34;wings&#34; but was not sure about that.<n>

I was in training at Fort Gordon (military base) in the 31-R course (Tactical Multi-Channel Transmission Systems Operator Maintainer). We were on a very large open field that we called &#34;The antenna field&#34; thats right behind the PX at Fort Gordon, there&#39;s also some old barracks that are no longer used (more useless information: These old barracks were used [as the barracks] in the Clint Eastwood movie &#34;Heart Break Ridge&#34;). We were learning how to install the 9 meter antenna mast (used with a Radio Access Unit). It requires a minimum of 3 soldiers to install (although I&#39;ve figured out a way that ONE troop could do it), we had four soldiers and one of our two civilian instructors (GTE employees - working for the GTE Resident School, Now called the General Dynamics Resident School). I was holding the Kevlar anchor cable, getting ready to lock it down - we were almost done making adjustments, when I heard the soldier to my right (Private Shaw) SCREAM at the top of his lungs &#34;LOOK AT THAT %#*(^%  UFO!!&#34; (thats exactly what he said). I looked up and saw a HUGE light streaking across the sky at incredible speeds. I dont know what I could compare it to since it was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. The civilian instructor didn&#39;t even look up, and he yelled at ME for taking my eyes off the anchor cable! (he yelled &#34;((name deleted)) pay attention to what your doing!&#34;). So I looked down just long enough to lock the cable down (less than one second) and when I looked back up it was gone. Several nights later we were putting up a 30 meter mast and not every team would end up working because it took the entire duration of a class to do (and not enough masts for each group) so on this night my team was in a large white tent watching movies (most of which sucked) and eating crappy chinese food. I was bored with the movie so I went outside &amp; looked up (still freaking out because of the previous sighting several days ago). I saw a bright lig! ht in the sky far off in the distance. One would have mistaken it for a star if not familiar with the constelations (which I am). It was sitting inside of Orion - I knew it didn&#39;t belong there (there&#39;s only supposed to be SEVEN stars in the Orion constelation). It didn&#39;t move for about 5 hours - even as the stars moved away from it through out the night (I kept going back out &amp; kept track of it) it stayed in the same spot - it&#39;s position in relation to the constelations continued to change as the stars moved through the sky. I only stared at it for about 15 minutes each time (how long can you stare at ANYTHING before you get bored?). Towards the end of the night I went back outside &amp; noticed that the light was no longer there - but there were about 6 Black Hawk helicopters flying all the way AROUND the spot where it was. They were NOT passing THROUGH the area where the light was! (even though it was no longer there) But going ALL THE WAY AROUND that area! I know my description drags on &amp; on, but I have done my best to be as accurate as possible.<n>

After I had prepared for the flight we walked out to the street to get in my truck and leave and to my surprise when I looked up in the sky, the light from earlier was now lower on the horizen and appeared to be directly over the north complex of LAX, it now looked like a large metallic sphere. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing, nor could my wife(and of course, she told me so). I grabbed my binoculars from my vehicle to view the sphere and it was definitely metallic, was no longer glowing and was just hovering, at about 2500 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a commercial pilot and have been around aircraft since I was a child, this was nothing like I have ever seen.  To estimate the size I referenced it against a 747-400 above and behind the object traveling southeast and roughly state 50 ft in diameter, and thats very rough.  The sphere very slowly decended to a slightly lower altitude as we observed it, I decided that I was just going to go ahead and leave for the airport, assuming that if it was anything of significance it would be all over the news, but of course after returning that afternoon and watching the news, nothing.  That is the first and only time I have ever witnessed something like that, and it really has sparked my curiosity about such sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a NASA photo that looks exactly like what we witnessed that I came across on UFOevidence.org:   http://www.ufoevidence.org/photographs/section/space/Photo142.htm.<n>

They were appeared to be about the size of an eraser.  There were two on top and one on the bottom forming a triangle.  The moon was low in the sky and directly in front of me and the lights were a little lower than the moon.  They did not flicker and they did not move.  I had to turn north to get to my house and I looked over my shoulder as I turned and saw them.  It takes about 30 Sec. to get to my house.  I parked the car and jumped out and looked and they were completely gone.  I ran into the backyard and stood on the picnic table and searched the whole sky and they were gone and there was no moving lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were very bright and pure white.  There were no other colors and they did not flicker.  They were all the same size and appeared about the size of a pencil eraser.  There were two next to each other, horizontally, with a small black space inbetween.  There was one below that was positioned inbetween the top two, forming a triangle.  I was traveling east and watched them for about 20 minutes.  When sitting at a red light, I could determine that the three lights were stationary in the sky.  The moon was very low in the sky that night and directly ahead of me.  The lights were to the right of the moon (southeast) and just a little lower that the moon.  I had to turn north to go to my home and as I turned, I looked over my shoulder and could still see the lights.  I later timed it and it takes 30 seconds after I turn to get to my home.  When I arrived home, I jumped out of my car and looked for the lights and they were gone.  I immediately went into my home and to the backyard and stood on the picnic table and searched the sky.  The lights were gone and there were no moving lights in the sky, only stars.  I watched for quite a while because I live by Davis Monthan Air Force Base and I wanted to see if they deployed any planes, but they did not.  The base is about 3 miles from where I live. Last fall my daughter and some of her friends saw a UFO over Rincon Mountain and within minutes the air force base was deploying pairs of planes. I have a master&#39;s degree and am a 49 year old female.<n>

Similar witnessing by 4 Nat&#39;l Guard members of 184th Air Assault while on patrol within 80 miles of this location apx 8-9 weeks early.  Saw 4 similar lights that departed in opposing directions after travelling for some distance in a high speed straight line formation.  Radical high speed 90 degree turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was setting up my telescope ( huge 12.5 Meade light bucket ) with 20 year old son-in-law.  Night was especially clear and we were using my wide angle lense for moon viewing.  While I was focused on moon, SIL said, &#34;Hey whats that!&#34;  I turned, followed his pointing and coming overhead was a fast moving object.  It appeared slightly slower than a falling comet, but faster than any jet.  It was a single dot of white light that went in a straight line, but stopped, started and repeated this several times while I wheeled my telescope around to catch a glimps of it.  My SIL kept it in constant view by his naked eye and I aligned the Dobson mount and pointed the scope skyward at the object. It was nearly at the end of the horizon when I believe I caught a glimps of it.  It was only a fraction of a second, but I believe it was longer than it was wide and bright metalic.  No other detail could be determined.  While explaining this to a friend the next day I was advised he was 1 of 4 on patrol at apx 0400 hrs. in foothills about 90 miles away.  All 4 guardsmen observed 4 star-like objects flying high overhead until they shot away in different directions.  The were stunned.  In both cases we believe the object/s was extraordinarely high and there was no noise.  Sorry no other detail, just  the pin point appearance of a distant start moving fast!  Very fast.   FYI:  Beale AFB close by both sightings.  Also I am former pilot.  This was not a comet, strongly doubt it was a satellite, NOT a balloon or aircraft.  Served aboard navy missile tracker.  I know what rockets and sats look like.  Have no idea what this was.  I am not at all interested in having my name linked to some UFO sighting... no thanks, but I will at least share this story for what its worth.  Its 100% true, unembellished fact.

This object appeared to be shaped more like an oil barrel, with a flashing red light on the top. An airliner was heading south, away from it. The object appeared to be hovering, but was moving southernly. It was hard to determine the distance from the object to the ground, and to the other objects (i.e. myself and the plane). Note also that at Central and Webb (the next major intersectiion going east)lies Raytheon Aircraft. This object did not appear to be a plane or a helicopter. I was also parked at this light for about three minutes along with about twenty others. I must have looked pretty strange sticking my head out of my car window looking at this thing. The road going east (Central) goes up a hill at this point. There is also a crosswalk midway between Central and Rock, and Central and Webb. This object was not a crosswalk light. While I was observng object move southernly, object passed behind trees. After the light changed, I headed east. Object had disappeared. Plane was also out of sight.<n>

The haze was not a cloud! The objects were in the eastern sky and it was still light enough to where the clouds were.  All the clouds were to the west.  The light that was on the right was lower then the light on the left.  The objects seemed to be moving to the west very slowly.  They lasted from anywhere around 3 to 5 minutes.  Then the first moved away.  The first objected moved off to the and up to the right.  It was hard to see where it was going because of the haze, and then it disapeared.

Since I knew no one was there I became somewhat amused that the orange glow grew brighter while a shaft of light seemed to emanate upward from the origin of the glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was home alone with my two year old son and I&#39;m also a member of the local volunteer fire department.  Since I was already situated so close to the scene I thought I would jump into my vehicle after checking on my son.  He was in a &#34;jumper saucer&#34; and could safely be left alone for a few minutes so I grabbed a fire extinguisher and headed outside for my vehicle. For whatever reason I did not feel that I should call in and report a possible fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got back outside, the orange glow seemed to decrease however, the shaft of orange light intensified.  I honestly started to attribute this to the house being on fire and the main fuel source starting to concentrate the burn in the middle of the structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I headed to my vehicle to drive over the property, I looked over and saw that that the shaft of light had intensified and reached up to what I could best describe as a large rotating circular spoke similar to a wagon wheel as if I was viewing it on an edge which would make it somewhat of an ecclipse or oval shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I entered and started my vehicle and drove down my driveway for a distance of approximately 300 feet. I stopped and the orange glow was still present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was very aprehensive given that my son was alone in the house but I drove toward the neighbouring property where I could still see the light.  As soon as my vehicle left my driveway and turned toward my neighbours property, all the lights - both on the ground and above I witnessed went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Except, CC is further north and object launched from it leave a clear vertical vapor trail.  This object was very white with a cone-shaped white haze behind it - could have been moving quickly, it was hard to say.

One light was higher than the second light, and to the left of it. The lights were headlight-sized from my vantage point, but were incredibly high. Because of my perception of height, I had judged the lights to be much larger than any aircraft known to man, possibly being hundreds of feet in diameter. I did not observe any contrails or vapors eminating from the lights. The time of day was beginning to turn to twilight and the skies were blue. I was driving eastbound on Forest Hill Blvd and first witnessed them around the intersection of Jog Rd. At first, the lights appeared to be static, just staying in one place. Then, the lights appeared to begin to rise slowly upward and began to fade in intensity. The lights then disappeared, but there was an incredibly large hazy halo left behind for each light. The lights were gone before I reached the intersection of Military Trail. For weeks afterward, I tried to find further information on this incident. I did recall some online articles trying to discount it as military missiles, which from experience could not have been fired from Cape Canaveral. I think the article went on to say that it was ship fired missiles and another article said they were missiles fired over the Florida Panhandle from one side to the other side. Problem being, that I did not witness any East, West, North, or South movement of the lights. I did not witness any vapors or contrails. The only thing those lights did was appear to remain static at a great height, then rise straight up.

The sky only had a few clouds in it.these clouds could be seen clearly due to the moon was high and bright.I came to notice the lights in the sky due to the fact they turned night into day...These where large white lights, Not like the flames of a rocket...As well as they appeared in the sky, Not launching from the ocean.. As I stated I was fishing,[There was nothing blocking my view}.. To me the lights seem to be almost conected as if part of one object. These lights seemed to be several miles off the coast of sebastian..These lights overpowered the moons light. I would clearly say these lights where brighter then a night time shuttle launch as well. They did not seem to move at all.Just stayed in one place,not moving like rocket..No sounds at all.The only sounds was of everyone on the jetty trying to figure out what it was..No rumble sounds like a rocket,no flames,no smoke. It seemed to me when the lights where going out they { Rolled Up }..They did not turn out..This is when it seemed to be one object to me. The way it just seened to roll up as if it was turning to the southeast..This is when things got loud. Several fighter jet {I would say comming Patrick Air Force Base} where not wasting any time heading in the direction where it the was..I had counted two groups of around 12 planes.. They where moving very fast, Yet I could see the flames coming from the jets.The planes came back by about 30 to 40 minutes later..This time flying much slower..I remimber people joking that they didn&#39;t get there in time,Or seen what it was and ran...The only naval operations I believe took place was to try to get a look at the object or odjects..Why would you send US jets to a test sight if they where launching missles? There is a no fly zone every time they have a launch at KSC...My farther was in the navy for over 25 years.I grew up in a navy life style I have see many launchs in my 36 years of life...This was no launch...This object I would say was the biggest thing I ever seen in the sky ...This is something my friend and me tells everyone we know..<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am sure of the time because we were about five minutes from the event, and we exited the bus at the event at 18:50. I looked out the window of the bus and saw the 2 fairly bright white lights, that looked to be about 30 feet in diameter in the sky to the left of the bus. I told my wife to look, and she asked what are those lights. The other people sitting on the left side of the bus also saw them. I thought as did other people on the bus, that they were rocket boosters from Cape Canaveral, although I made the comment that these are the first rockets I ever saw that have no propellant or con trail. It looked exactly like looking directly into the tail end of a rocket booster. We didn&#39;t give it any more thought until we returned to Los Angeles and saw a news report of the event on the Monday evening news and found out that there were no missiles fired from the cape. We saw both objects for about 2 minutes. The seemed to be about 300 yards apart, and one was next to a cloud, the other in the open sky.The light away from the cloud just went out about 5 seconds before the other light moved behind the cloud and disappeared.

The event lasted approximately 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the date and time listed above, my girlfriend and I were travelling from Clearwater, Florida to our home in Tampa. That would place us travelling almost due east.It was approximately 6:45 to 6:50 pm when I noticed these two objects at about 45 degrees above the horizon. The objects were appeared to be trapezoidal in shape...wider at the bottom than at the top.  I asked my girlfriend if she saw what i saw...and she replied that she did.  Since we were heading toward the causeway we had an unobstructed view of these objects.  They appeared to me to be silvery and I asked my girlfriend if they looked to be in a haze and she thought perhaps they were.  I looked up through the sunroof of the car and saw the moon as clear as could be....there was no haze in the sky.  We continued to watch the objects, which appeared to be side by side.  They then separated for a bit, moving very rapidly.  Then after about 3 minutes or so they darted towards the north and disappeared in the blink of an eye.  These objects seemed to be very large.  At first I wondered if they were military aircraft, as we were heading towards McDill AFB in Tampa.  I asked my girlfriend and she agreed with me that neither one of us had seen any aircraft like those and that they seemed to move too fast. I am a 39 year old male with a 20 year sales background.  My girlfriend is 34 and has a 15 year sales background.  We are both college educated.  Neither one had any alcohol prior to our siting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC:  probable missile launch.))<n>

The light on the left was slightly lower than the one on the right. There was no sound from the objects and they appeared stationary 45 degrees above the horizon. We had seen dozens of small aircraft and large jets before and after this sighting and could hear their engines as well as see the red and green wing lights, the strobes, and the landing headlights. The two objects I am writing about had no colored lights, no flashing strobes, and made no sound. I definitly felt they were nothing I&#39;d ever seen in my 38 years on this earth. A small fast moving cloud ( moving from south to north ) passed in between the objects and us ( no more than 5 seconds ) and when it passed the 2 objects had completely disappeared with no trace. This whole episode lasted between 20 and 30 seconds. I am 38 and live in West Chester Ohio and was vacationing in South Floria the whole week. I have been traveling to South Florida for 20 years and have never seen anything like this before. I am an avid skywatcher and work in the IS department of a major health informaton storage company. My nephew is a 16 year old with a good head on his shoulders. I am dying to know what so many people saw that Saturday night and I&#39;ll never forget what I saw!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC:  Probable missile launch.))<n>

One of the children pointed to the sky and asked me what those lights were. I looked up and saw what appeared to be two helicopter spotlights hovering / hanging motionless at slightly different altitudes in the eastern sky well above the tree line on the horizon. The light on the left was higher than the one on the right and there wasn&#39;t any noise coming from them. It became apparent to me shortly thereafter that these &#34;things&#34; were not helicopters. As I observed them, the light on the left began to dim and I noticed a shallow beam of light emenating from it. The faint beam of light broadened and narrowed as it swept slowly from left to right. This went on for maybe 10 seconds as the light to the right began to do the same thing. The dimming light on the left (towards the north) began to close in on itself slowly, sort of like the shutter on a camera, wrapping itself in a shroud of fog as it vanished. The second light, within seconds thereafter, did the same thing. Neither object moved up or down or side to side during this event. They simply vanished in the same position they were in initially. The entire event lasted approximately 3 to 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were moving in a westerly direction at the same speed, but different heights. The light on the right was slightly lower than the one on the left. No sounds were coming from the lights.  They looked as if they were shining a light in a downward glow.  Suddenly the lower light on the right pivoted  approx 180 degrees and disappeared, leaving an illuminated doughnut shaped glow, that lasted approximately 10-15 seconds and then dissapated. The other light never stopped moving. It continued going in  the same direction at the same speed. for at least 15 seconds after  the doughnut glow disappeared.  Then just like the other light, it turned away from us and disappeared, leaving the same doughnut glow, which as the first, lasted around 15 seconds and dissapated as well. No object observed just 2 distinct lights.  After the lights turned away from us they simply disappeared, they didn&#39;t seem to fly away, or go in any direction, they just disappeared, leaving the dought shaped signature, and our thoughts running wild.  Like nothing we have ever seen before. This was also witnessed by our neighbors who were having a party. 10 of their guests also witnessed the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC:  Probable missile launch.))<n>

No craft visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Returning home from work on March 7, 1998, I turned east on Bullard Parkway off 56th street in Temple Terrace, Florida.  My attention was drawn to two bright white lights aboput 30 degrees above the horizon and visible in my windshield.  They were strangely out of focus or hazy.  They moved independently from one another, i.e. they tilted.  Each was more or less formless, but also strangely each seemed to have a shaft of light pointing down as though each light was fastened to the bottom of an aircraft and pointed straight down.  But the shafts of light were not vertical cylindars, but truncated cones of white light.  Neither pointed down very far.  I estimated that they were less than one mile away and perhaps 2000 feet high, given their brightness.  I became concerned tgaht I would drive under them and lose sight of them, but it did not occur to me to stop off the highway and get out to look up. As I drew closer they were higher in my windshield, so I moved forward against the steering wheel to keep them in sight.  Before I reach my turn off the right hand light faded and disappeared, then the second light faded and disappeared.  They were rather peculiar, so I was at first reluctant to tell my wife, but I finally did before we went out for the evening.  I checked the sky as we left home about 7:30 but they were not to be seen.  I was relieved to see a haze in the sky then, as that would explain their foggy or out of focus appearance.  On the other hand the cloud layer was much to high to have had an effect.  I do not wish my name to be used!<n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC:  Probable missile launch.))<n>

Both objects appeared to be stationary and it was difficult to tell the distance. The objects as they appeared to us were about ten times  the size of a star. The object on the left was slightly lower and equally spaced from the object on the right. We had an unobstructed view. We stoped the car and observed both of the objects for about 20 seconds. The object on the right then disappeared, leaving behind a donut shaped cloud.

In the eastern sky, at approx. 40 degrees above the horizon, there were two spherical objects emitting a bright white light.  The objects were clearly defined with a haze surrounding them.  The closest analogy I can think of is the appearance of a flashlight in fog.  The sky was generally clear and the airplanes preparing for landing were clearly distinguishable. The airplane lights did not exhibit this same haze so I don&#39;t think the haze surrounding the spheres was the result of any cloud cover.  The two objects were hovering near each other but at slightly different elevations.  The sphere to the left was slightly elevated over the right sphere.  We slowed down to watch the objects, initially assuming that it was some unannounced launch from KSC.  However, the objects didn&#39;t move. They appeared to hover in the same position.  This period was long enough for us to observe them and conjecture as to what we were seeing.  The two objects disappeared suddenly.  When we got to the restaurant parking lot, several other people were standing around discussing what we had just seen. Orlando news covered the reports and showed video taken in Ft. Myers.  This video is an accurate representation of what we saw in Orlando.  Local news also reported that Patrick Air Force Base released a statement that the objects were the result of &#34;naval operations&#34;.

It was just before sunset and the sky was darkening at the apex when a light caught my eye coming from the  southeast.  It looked very much like the Hale-Bopp comet that was present in the sky last summer.  The light was bright in the end pointing north and it seemed to spread out and fade away from the object in a southern direction.  When it appeared I thought it might be an asteroid, but it remained visible in a somewhat stationary position for too long.  I quickly asked my girlfriend who was in the car with me to look up and she was immediately able to point it out.  For the next two minutes or so it remained visible and seemed to very slowly move from right to left in our field of vision.  Then suddenly it seemed to turn away from us swinging the tail of light towards us and then it sped towards space and quickly disappeared.  We watced the sky for about an hour longer and saw nothing of the object again.  My girlfriend and I are both in our early twenties and are recent graduates of UNC and NC State respectfully.

They were a small distance apart, one slightly lower than the other. They were there for a few minutes, then one suddenly disapeared, followed closely by the second, which lingered for about 20 more seconds, than disapeared as well. Now I&#39;ve heard many cover up stories to prove that this was no ufo, but I am prepared to give facts towards what I saw. These lights were too high to be airplanes, and they weren&#39;t fireworks, missiles from submarines, rockets from Cape Canaveral, or fighter jets issued by Patrick Airforce Base (which is down the road) because it was too high for any of these objects to be. The two lights were brighter than anything I had ever seen in the sky, not to mention there was absolutely no sound whatsoever coming from the objects. They just appeared, moved slowly across the sky, then vanished within a blink of an eye. People across the state as far as Tampa witnessed these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Two very bright white lights appeared to be coming toward me from northeast, like landing lights but in space. Both turned in formation and headed south, apparently entering ionosphere where a bright light blue aura appeared in front and broad badminton birdie shaped cone of blue appeared behind each. I shouted to others to come outside and bring videocamera. My thoughts were that these objects looked like Hale Bopp and might be comets; but, they slowed down upon apparently entering ionosphere and maneuvered in loose formation. Four other people came outside and observed the objects as I videotaped them moving south in the eastern sky and then turn to the east and apparently depart the ionosphere again. I zoomed video out to get exact ground reference point so that celestial geometry could be figured. The next morning I calibrated videocamera clock with GPS time. I later talked with observers 21 miles away and 50 miles away who saw similar objects around same time. The videotape is digital and quite good. Today I read your web page accounts and agree with most descriptions of objects orientation and behavior, except that the objects I observed definitely came from northeast, turned south, and then apparently left ionosphere heading east. This does not seem to be typical ICBM behavior. It is of note that the brightest aspect of the objects was on the leading edge, and illumination was much less in rear view. This is also not typical ICBM illumination pattern, which is brightest in stern view.

I hurried home and told my family, my wife and 2 of our children witnessed it, by this time the object had moved further away(south west), we took turns looking through binoculars. My wife thought it looked like colored balloons revolving around the top of the object. We called the police department and no one else had seen it at that time.  It was a triangular shape at the bottom, maybe about 20 to 25 feet in diameter, but it&#39;s shape almost seemed to fluxuate, with rotating objects above it. It was not floating in the air current, it was definately intelligently controlled.

It was just over the tree line, no more  than 100 feet above, and it flew directly over my head. It was the size of a house, matte black, spherical, mechanically  silent. The only sound it made was the sound of flames That we&#39;re shooting off of it, rather loudly. I actually heard the flames and looked  up just  before  it passed overhead. It was monumental, perfectly silent , and amazing to witness. it flew just overhead, and by the time I yelled at my wife to look up it had passed, and was obscured by the trees. A stunning sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

3/3/98 20:00|Bali (Indonesia)||Sphere|3 secs|white sphere in Indonesia|8/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18928.html|140|ndxe199803| white sphere in Indonesia<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were holidaying in indonesia when were  had dinner in a restaurant on a beach.  The airport was nearby and we could see airplanes taking off and landing all night.   My husband happened to be looking in the right place at the right time when he saw a white spherical object in the sky.  He pointed it out to me.  It was travelling in a very straight line parallel to the  horizon  about 45 degrees up.  It was travelliing at a speed of about ten times faster than the airplanes and it made no sound.  It went  across the sky in a couple of seconds. Because  the speed to the planes was a reference we knew it didn&#39;t compare to any man made craft.  It then seemed to just fade away like it was exiting the atmosphere.<n>
3/1/98 22:00|New Albany|IN|Light|1 minute|Bright Welders Arc Light In The Night Skys Over New Albany Indiana|2/24/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16498.html|141|ndxe199803| Bright Welders Arc Light In The Night Skys Over New Albany Indiana<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ive been seeing this object now for over 3 years till this very day and also see it about every night and wanted to share it with all who may have seen the same object or may find this object very interesting as i have. To see this object it&#39;s best to get outdoors about 15 mintes before dusk and anytime there after before midnight. allthough ive seen it at all hours from dusk till sunrise. This object may appear as a star in the night sky with no movement at times. The object appears mostly as a slow moving star at first and seems to have i very high altitude and moving along as the speed of a high flying commercial airliner. Sometimes it will stop in mid movement also for as long as 15 seconds take or give a few. The most startling thing about this object is it will turn a very bright welders arc bluish white for sometimes as long as 15 seconds then go dim to a very faint like star and go completly accross the horizon till dissapearing. This object will appear at any point in the night sky. Sometimes at the zenith, sometimes at the horizon, any location in the night sky this object may appear. I have observed it 1 time to go from a very bright spotlight like light to a sapphire blue in color. Im still seeing this object to this day along with 5 other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the description is reminiscent of a twinkling star.  PD))<n>
3/1/98 20:00|Cebu City (Philippines)||Other|1 to 2 months|End of the Century UFO|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50203.html|142|ndxe199803| End of the Century UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all I&#39;d like to say that Iam rather glad to see this website as I was just browsing through, and I thought that It would be a good idea to share a piece of my experience that occurred quite some time ago around the years 1997 or 1998 to somewhere in 2003 where I last saw certain starlike objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects that I saw were not that strange as it appeared at the sky. Most however won&#39;t notice these things because they seem to resemble like ordinary stars. When we heard about this comet in the news somewhere around those years 1997, 1998 that it would appear clearly in the nightsky. Me, my brother, my dad and two of my cousins would go out to watch how beautiful it is. Not until we keep looking around that we notice other objects in the sky moving irregularly the same way how houseflies behave in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects looked like stars but it moves then it slows down, some even cross paths. We thought that they were airplanes at first then fighter planes then it got too weird and it flew too fast at that distance we decided they were sattelites and their reflections. We never stopped seeing these things in the sky for the past years but we didn&#39;t mind them that much since we always knew there were other beings out there that needn&#39;t challenge our beliefs. But just seeing these things stimulates ones mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father however who works at a government based envirorment protection agency kept seeing several flying objects in the sky as he and his team perform their duties in the remote regions of the province. It was no surprise that many of his friends wondered and were in doubt to what these were and concluded there on that these were alien crafts. My father back then sometimes comes home and tells us that he and his friends saw several UFO&#39;s in greater numbers that what we see here in the city. Mainly because it was darker in province where their lights cannot be obscured by our the city&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So one day my dad couldn&#39;t take it anymore called our local meteorological station called PAGASA and begin to report and if by any chance they could somehow pick-up flying objects in their radar besides our aircraft. They answered &#34;No.&#34;  I haven&#39;t seen the same flying objects in sky recently which is quite disappointing but I always try to look and stare up just in case. Yet I was glad that we weren&#39;t the only ones out here seeing strange flying objects in the sky. People tend to try and talk about these things once you start and it&#39;s surprising but its true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

3/1/98 03:00|Leesburg|GA|Unknown|45  minutes|U.F.O. spotted ouside Leesburg, Georgia hoving over trees before  rapidly diving dove and up again.|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14009.html|144|ndxe199803| U.F.O. spotted ouside Leesburg, Georgia hoving over trees before  rapidly diving dove and up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two friends and I were heading North/Northeast on New York RD about 10 miles outside of Leesburg, Georgia when I spotted something out of the back side window. All I saw were lights and I thought it was just an airplane, but I watched it anyway because no one was talking. I lost it behind the trees about 5 minutes later. We reached the end of New York Rd. and got out to sit and talk. We saw the aircraft again and it was hovering above the trees not far from us, and it was not making any sound. It would hover in one place and dive straight down and back up again very fast. Then it would move over a bit and do the same thing. It was very quick with its movements. I&#39;ve never witnessed an aircraft moving in such a way as this one did. We soon lost it in the trees so we decided to drive in the direction it was heading, about 15 minutes later while heading south on Lesley Highway back towards Leesburg we spotted it again to the West of us near a radio tower. We followed it until it started to accelerate, at this point we observed a series of lights blink on and off. Three lights blinked on one side(?) and then 3 on the other. I do believe the lights changed too, from red to orange to white(not necessarily in that order). After this it quickly accelerated and disappeared. We didn&#39;t see it anymore after that. The 3 of us had not been drinking or using any kind of drug when we witnessed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/1/98 03:00|Sunderland (UK/England)||Rectangle|5 minuites|Oblong craft, moved slowly across night sky out to sea. No noise or lights|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30700.html|145|ndxe199803| Oblong craft, moved slowly across night sky out to sea. No noise or lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3.00am early morning in March 1998 (Exact day unknown)My wife and I were in our front garden taking our cat to do her business(She was a very old cat and was deaf and we used to take her out to look after her incase she wandered off onto the roadway or got lost) It was a very still morning, cold and there was no cloud cover. I dont know why but i looked up into the night sky and saw what I can only describe as not being from this earth. The object was massive and was oblong in shape. bearing in mind it was dark I had to focus to  get a view of it. I spoke to my wife and she looked up and  was as mesmerised as I was. The craft moved slowly towards the east (out to sea) there was no noise at all and no lights displayed on the object, It seemed to stand out from the night sky and my wife and I would say that it was of silver colour. I would estimate the object being the size of say a football pitch. We watched it for about 5 minutes until it disappeared out of sight. (Field of vision as opposed to distance) We have never really spoke of the incident(outside of family and close friends) but it did have a profound effect on us. We are both professional people, and i would say well adjusted. We firmly believe now in the existence of crafts that are say outside of the norm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
