Look like commercial aircraft but no movement.  Watch objects for a couple of minutes slight movement.  Decide to stop and look thru binochulars but objects disappear as car stops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I where driving to Las Vegas, NV for a family get together.  It was late afternoon around 3:00pm.  We were driving west on I-15 approx. 15 miles west of Mesquite, NV when I noticed what I thought was a commercial airliner off to the South and approx. 50-60 degrees up.  The sky was clear not a cloud anywhere.  The object was &#34;metallic&#34; or &#34;white/silver&#34;.  Like a jet when the sun is gleaming off it.  I continued to glance up at the object and I relized it was not moving and had no contrail.  I said to my brother jokingly there is a UFO up there.  He pushed back the sunroof so he could look.  As I remember it took him a little while to pick the object out.  Then another object though not as bright appeared. At one time I could see 3-4 at one time.  They would fade out then come back either were the where or close.  We remembered we had binochulars so my brother got them out.  The car was vibrating too much to tell what they where.  We decided to stop.  As we did ! come to a stop the objects disappeared.  We waited awhile since they had been coming and going out of view.  But, they never came back.  We proceded on our way did not see them again.  We thought they may have been jet fighters at a very high altitude so as to appear as no movement.  Or possibly military aircraft dropping flares.  The first object was the brightest and lasted the longest.  It was moving VERY slowly to the south as it faded away.  Did anyone else see these objects or simular objects in this area?  Since it has been 4 years ago my memory of it is&#39;nt as sharp as it was.  One strange thing I did&#39;nt think of at the time was there was very little traffic on the highway.  Usually, as I have made this trip numorous times at Thanksgiving time the traffic is heavy.<n>

On this particular evening, my brother and I had just exited a thick patch of trees after a long day of deer hunting. It was nearly dark,the first stars were out and we had about a mile walk back to our truck. Being aware of anomalies in the area, we were always on the lookout for ANYTHING out of the &#34;ordinary&#34;. Well, upon looking to the eastern sky , we both saw 3 &#34;stars&#34; that seemed to be brighter than the rest. These lights were stationary at this point and seemed to be regular stars out in space. I remember saying to my brother that maybe they were planets and we would check it out at home.We then continued on our hike to the truck and went home- nothing unusual.This is where it starts getting strange. One week later almost to the minute,my brother and I emerged from the same patch of trees after hunting all day.As we again surveyed our surroundings, we again noticed the 3 stars from the week previous in the exact same place they had been then.Only this time they were a different color(orange) and seemed to be moving slightly in conjunction with each other. Really interested now,we watched as the formation of lights gradually picked up speed coming in roughly our direction (west).We then realized that we were in a bad situation and started for the truck at a fast walk. Keeping an eye on the object, we observed it change direction to a more northerly heading and fly toward a low cloud formation, into which it flew. By this point we could tell that this was no ordinary aircraft(as a student pilot with 10 yrs in ! aviation ,I&#39;m familiar with nearly all known a/c).The object was close enough for us to see a structured triangular fuselage dark in color. It made absolutely no sound. Upon the object entering the cloud, there was a flash of light similar to lightning but flourescent green in color. This was immediately followed by the object emerging from the cloud in roughly a 10 degree bank. As the object made it&#39;s way clear of the cloud, we observed the &#34;cloud&#34; literally change shape until it appeared like a tornado but horizontal to the earth not vertical, with the &#34;foot&#34; of the funnel pointing toward the object. At this point we broke into a sprint for the truck. As we ran, the object literally DRAGGED this &#34;tornado&#34; to the west. We could see that the whole eastern horizon was black now.Just as we reached the truck we were hit by huge gusts of wind  and debris from the east and visibilty was around 2 feet. Concerned now, we piled into the truck to find that this reliable vehicle was completely dead( it was just like in the movies). With the nearest help miles away, we readied our rifles( made us feel better) and waited. Total elapsed time so far approx. 6 min.The dust storm and confusion lasted for about 10 min then the wind stopped and the dust settled. As visibility improved and things became quiet again, we could see...We could see objects- lots of them. Besides the original triangle a/c which was now making a 40-50nm circular flight pattern, we could see discs trailing the triangle, all moving independently.(We were by now using our 10x50 Zeiss binocs) and could see that the discs were definitley metallic in nature. The most impressive object however was a gigantic cylinder that descended from nowhere then hovered approx 500ft agl around  a 1000 yds distant, over a field. Peter, I swear to you on my Father&#39;s grave that along each side of this thing were &#34;windows&#34; in which it seemed like there was movement! It was around 2 football fields in length, approx. 700-1000 ft in diameter,  and bright silver in color.The &#34;front! end&#34; gl owed blue, intensifying the farther one got from the center and the &#34;rear end&#34; glowed red in the same manner.What drew your eye though was the yellow and orange strobe exactly centered on the &#34;bottom&#34;.We watched this object in pure horror for about an hour until it ascended straight up and out of sight .It did not disappear in a split second but rose rapidly taking less than a minute to completely vanish.Well, back to the other objects, which were by now in the company of several F-15&#39;s.It was VERY EASY to differentiate between the jets and the other objects. The F-15&#34;s flew around for about a half hr.then headed NW in a tight formation and the triangle followed close behind, all disappearing over some hills to the NW-we never saw them again.The discs continued to maneuver throughout the area.We had pretty much resigned ourselves to our fate by this point and now felt the worst was over.It all became rather entertaining by midnight.We spent a cold night in the truck, falling asleep eventually watching these discs and their erratic flight. In the morning, our parents showed up to look for us and we gave them the whole story. They believed us but advised us to say nothing. I just cant live with this secret any longer and felt it may be important as I believe I was a witness to some kind of WX manipulation Technology. I moved away soon after and hav&#39;nt been back. I understand from friends that &#34;things&#34; are still happening there.<n>

I was walking and turned the corner, and there was 3 illuminated orange triangles, flying in formation.  One in the front and two on the rear, forming like a triangle. But they were 3 seperate triangles.  I noticed them quickly, because they were so low to the ground. About two of the apartments stacked high. 50 feet up (or low).  They moved slowly and silently towards a church between the two buildings I was standing between. They slowly turned around and slowly came back towards me (with my mouth wide open) and then they slowly got higher and then they shot off and disappeared.  They had to be traveling at the speed of light. 45 minutes after the one of the wildest things I&#39;ve ever experienced I went back outside and I saw 3 small engine planes flying around the area(within 2 miles). I don&#39;t know if somebody else saw but someone had to have.<n>

As a former scientific observer aboard Soviet fishing vessels, I know how much paperwork is generated in that environment, and an official observer would certainly have recorded the event in his/her records.  A photo of the object would have been taken, as well.  We will wait for a response, and for further evidence, which supports the assertion above.  Frankly, we are going to have to see evidence on this one in order to believe it at face value.  PD))<n>

I looked up in the black sky and seen soom lights there were three white lights and a row of colored lights in the back,red,green,blue,yellow and think there was ornge.  As it came closer i could tell it was a triangle shape.It came down tree top leavel about 25 yards away from me on the other side of the creak.When it started across the creak the row of colored lights went out.  Then a beam of light came out of the middle.  When it got wright over me i could not see the ship just the out line and the ligts it blended with the night sky.It made no sound what so every.  It was only about 15 feet from me.I never seen any thing fly so slow.It seamed to last only for about 5 minutes.  About two years latter i relized when it was leaving it was starting to get day light.  So now im wondering what happend because it hade to last alot longer than what i could remember.  So what happend to me i guess ill never know.The worst part is not knowing.  I only told a couple of pepole of course they all laughed at me and told me i was crazy.  I know what i saw and its the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

As one approached, I returned to truck for camera and saw  bright lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 5am, before daylight, my brother-in-law and myself separated to deer hunt on the edge of a very large corn and hay field bordered by a cat-tail marsh and enormous red maple and  white cedar swamp. I saw what I thought were headlights coming from some distance across the field and hurried to reach a hill. I intended to get there ahead of anyone else since it was a choice location to observe the surroundings for deer. Once I arrived at my spot on the 25&#39; hill I sat down to await daylight, my compound bow nearby.Again I noticed the lights toward the east and moving along just over the ground at adistance of several hundred yards, left to right.The two of them were white and appeared to me to be attached to a silent truck or an ATV. As they moved they passed behind brush, became erratic,as though someone was running with handheld flashlights.The lights went out and I assumed whoever it was had reached their destination. Moments later a single light re-appeared, this time rising above the horizon and toward me, I moved to get down from the hill as it grew larger and higher in the sky. I then realized it was nothing I had been thinking it was. At perhaps 20 yards, with it over my shoulder, I tried to put some distance between us. I headed toward my truck and a camera with difficulty in the darkness, As I looked back it was descending, glowing over the marsh, and then there was a silent explosion of bright light as though a wick had burned through the sky and reached a large quantity of flammable material. The sky was clear and the air absolutely still, Once I reached the truck I could again see a low light moving across the field as before. I then saw a bright &#34;star&#34; well over the horizon in the direction I had come from, but, I thought at greater distance. It began descending slowly and I tried to photo it but it faded while I fumbled looking through camera. At about 5:45 am there were again low lights over the field, then two lights side by side in the sky growing in intensity, brighter like two suns, only small. I could now see my brother-in-law and went toward him. The lights went dim until gone- took 5 seconds to disappear in the sky. Daylight was gathering, we watched as more small lights like headlights moved along erratically out in the field, then out of sight.  As soon as it was light enough to make out the landscape, a fog formed, which was a remarkable transformation from the clear pre-dawn. In conclusion, I feel the lower lights were probably &#34;swamp gas&#34;, ignited in the hay field and following a &#34;fuse&#34; back to it&#39;s source under the water in the marsh. As tidy as that is, I&#39;m troubled by the sky lights. My brother was visiting from Vermont that night where he works for the state, he suggested I write an account of my experience that very night, which I have referenced here,in order that my story wouldn&#39;t get confused with other people&#39;s comments, etc.                Background: I have hunted, fished and hiked for 22+ years, I work oudoors before daylight often till after dark,I am a com.fisherman. Have hiked and hunted northern and southern wilderness areas in the dark and by compass, In short, I have spent countless hours in the woods watching the sky and stars,Iv&#39;e seen the sun come up over the ocean close to a thousand times. I&#39;d prefer to not be personally linked to this.<n>

I stopped almost directly underneath it and got of the car, however it made no noise, and was perhaps 200-300 feet in the air, my best guess at size would be 200 yards long. Now for the strange part!, my wife only remembers the lights, my father and his girlfreind dont remember anything! We were on our way to a local casino for a slot tournament, but we were aproximately an hour late for the tournament, even though it seemed we stopped only for a few minutes!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

11/15/93 14:30|Encinal (northeast of)|TX|Rectangle|1 hour|Large mother ship sighting and smaller UFO chased by military fighters.|9/17/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31442.html|11|ndxe199311| Large mother ship sighting and smaller UFO chased by military fighters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While hunting in a very remote area of south Texas in a deer blind about 12 feet above the ground I noticed a circular light to my left in the late afternoon. I looked toward it very briefly as I was preparing to come down from the blind. In my mind I registered the light as the rising moon but then I thought to myself that the object was too big to be the moon, even if it was low in the sky. When I turned my head to look at the object again it was gone. I saw this light for a mere second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About fifteen minutes later my four buddies came for me in a pick-up truck. As we were looking at a wild boar that someone had shot I looked at the night sky and saw a very large array of white lights in a horizontal line low over the horizon that seemed to be at least a few miles away. The lights emitted no sound whatsoever. For this UFO to look so large to us and seem to be so far away seemed impossible. I can only describe it as being some type of mother ship and in fact reminded me of an aircraft carrier just floating over the horizon. All of us saw this object and were telling each other &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; As we watched this UFO for about a minute the lights would change from white to yellow. And they would turn off and on again each time in a different sequence and in alternating groups. Five on, two off, three on, all off, etc. Then suddenly a fog or smoke cloud appeared over the lights and they all went off. About four seconds later the same lights appeared much higher in the sky almost at forty five degrees to the horizon. Prior the lights were just above the horizon. It would seem impossible for such a large object to rise that high that fast. We all mentioned to each other in amazement how that could have happened. Within a few seconds the lights went completely off and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a short time (about five minutes) we were on our way out of the ranch and heading to the highway. I kept looking at the sky hoping to see that ship again when suddenly I saw another smaller craft high overhead turning in a wide circle to my left. I could distinctly see the back of it and saw a diamond shaped light with lights inside of it that were in a horizontal line and turning on and off in sequence toward the center. This UFO was being chased by two military fighters! This was very easy to see in the night sky and I looked at this with binoculars. All my buddies saw this also. We just kept driving and I kept watching this awesome display until they faded out of sight. The jet fighters lingered in the area for a while circling in CAP (combat air patrol).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain totally anonymous.  Date is approximate.

I worked with her in a factory in LaGrange for several years. It was just before Thanksgiving. I had to drive through Rome City on St. Rd 9 going north. Just before you enter the town you are on a hill and it declines as you drive into it. There is a perfect view of the horizon. I have no idea what caused me to even notice what I saw but all I know is I have never mentioned it before only to a few close relatives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a metalic, silverish eggshaped object in the western astmosphere, it hovered there and didn&#39;t move. Since I was driving I tried very hard to figured out what I was seeing and to watch the road. It was a great distance from the ground and I couldn&#39;t even begin to say how far. Since I had a perfect view from east to west I saw another object that was identical in the east. Suddenly the object in the east moved at a very high rate of speed and joined the object in the west. There was no trail of vapor that comes from planes,no sound, nothing. It shot across like a laser beam to the other. But it left no trail of any kind and I know from the speed it was not a plane. Both objects then hovered together in the west and them they just took off westward and were gone! All this happened quickly and it shook me up so much that I almost stopped at the police sttion in Rome City to report what I saw and to this day I regret not doing so. I saw something that I can&#39;t explain. I have never seen anything move so quickly or looked liked these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I watched it for a fews secs and then pointed up a said to her:  do you see that, she exclaimed in an excited voice - it is a space ship. The moment she spoke another similar object appeared, it has been flying direcly above or under the other, it shifted side-ways and then after oscilating a few times back and forth towards the other craft it was like it locked its trajectory next to the other one and both then flew on together till I could no follow them by eye anymore because of the blocking of the view by garden trees. I could not estimate their height or diameter. I do not consume alcohol, I do no use drugs I consider myself a regular person.

At our usual fire spot we saw a couple of lights through the trees,I thought they were from a road near by but not sure. My friend fired 6 shots of blank starter gun in the air and, suddenly the lights started to ascent over the trees, now near panicking we saw that the lights were from a big black triangular object. It then hovered just over trees and flew over us very slowly and very silently, the wind stopped,it seemed that this thing &#34;created&#34; silence. Now panicked we started to run like crazy when in a clear spot we were spotted by a kind of searchlight, it was the object , it had spotted us, camo in a forest. We ran a 45 min. walk in less than 10 min. We are convinced that our camo suits kinda &#34;protected&#34; us from being abducted. The next day there was a couple of army copters flying very low over the area it happened. This is the first time I file a report fot this, no one believed us and we were afraid of the government. Very bizarre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It looked s|9/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39102.html|16|ndxe199311| Driving home from work one evening late around 2am on hwy 44 evansville indiana I noticed in the night sky a strange light. It looked so out of place that I kept my eye on it as I drove towards it down the highway. It was about 5 miles away from me moving very slowly. I turned onto I 65 towards my home which would cross the path of this light.I was looking everywhere up in the sky for it until it came into full view crossing the road infront of me. It was gliding along treeline height. I was amaized but also not afraid for some reason and I flashed my lights on and off at it. Iwatched the triangular shaped object floated noiseless over the road before my  car. I then pulled into a church parking lot and got out to watch it float maybe 15 feet over the treeline. It had 3 white lights on the triangle points and one larger one in the middle. It was smokey black and did not seem to be reflecting the streetlights from the church parking lot. NO sound came from this object. It flew towards Evansville north side. After 4 or 5 minutes I could not see it anymore because it was creeping over the trees. I have never seen a UFO since but have had 3 other strange experiences which I feel are UFO related.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked out my window to the backyard and saw this, I guess cigar shaped object hovering over the Petroglyphs.  I went out the door to get a better look.  My first thought that it was a blimp, due to the fact that I was from Los Angeles and they were seen many times in the skies there.  The object had colorful lights, which was not in step with the airplanes or helicopter lights.  The object was just hovering, and then it struck me, THERE WAS NO SOUND COMING FROM THIS OBJECT.  I was still on the phone with my friend and was telling her all about what I was seeing.  I started getting concerned and moved back into my home as I have two small boys.  I continued to watch this object and when it started to finally move, it moved very slowly and then it went away in a flash.  I called the police and asked them if Kirtland AFB was testing some prototype and they said they had no knowledge.  Meanwhile, my friend was still on the phone.  I am an Executive Secretary by trade and the next day at work I told some of my co-workers, and they all laughed. But I know what I saw.  I will report another incident that occured during  the last major meteor shower last year.<n>
11/1/93 23:30|Trio|SC|Circle|2 minutes|Huge bright object with no noise rose up out of woods behind my house!!|3/6/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16631.html|18|ndxe199311| Huge bright object with no noise rose up out of woods behind my house!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was late at night around 11 or 11:30PM and I was sitting on my back steps off my porch having a cigarette and talking on the phone to my boyfriend. We got off the phone and I was finishing my cigarette when this HUGE thing rose up out of the woods behind my house with no noise but lots of lights spinning around the center of it.It was less than an acre in the back yard so however far that is, that&#39;s where it came from. It came up and out at an angle so I saw the bottom and then it straightened up and came across my yard and over the house. It was only on the tree tops (pine and pecan) so it was VERY low and made NO noise at all. I was watching and backing up to get inside at the same time. I wanted to keep watching but was TERRIFIED!!!! I ran inside and told my grandparents and they didn&#39;t know if they should believe me or not but the next day my grandfathers friend which lives across the street from him had been outside and he saw it too and said &#34;it was so low and so bright that you could have found a needle in the grass&#34;!!! so anyway that&#39;s my story. Haven&#39;t seen anything like that since but have had other things since childhood happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Source is anonymous.  PD))<n>
11/1/93 23:00|Sacramento|CA|Triangle|20minutes|Spectacular triangle's seem in the sky|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63439.html|19|ndxe199311| Spectacular triangle&#39;s seem in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 1993 when this event happened. I was living in down town Sacramento, California. I don’t remember what time of year it was, but I lived on the corner of 13th street and F street. I always took my dog out for a potty walk, roughly between 10 and 11p.m. Across from our place was a vacant lot, that I always walked him in. I took him out that night as I always did and walked across the street to the vacant lot. It was a cool evening and the fog was hovering above the roof tops, when I noticed above me, in the fog, lights. I looked up and was amazed at what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three sets of triangular lights, each triangle was made up of three long strips of light, formed into each triangle. What ever it was, where ever they came from, was huge, I don’t even believe I could accurately describe the size. They were enter moving about each other, they were red and blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could only compare what I was looking at, to some type of computer graphic design you might see on the web. I was so amazed that I ran back into the house and asked my then 15 year old son to come out and look too. He did, and we both stood there in the middle of the street amazed, at what we were watching above our heads, the lights moving in and out of each other, and changing about, while what ever was making them, hid in the fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t own a video camera at the time, or I would have tried to film the spectacular sight that was occurring. We stood there, my son and I, for a very long time. Two of our neighbors emerged from their apartment, and at first look, they laughed at us, like what the heck are they doing standing in the middle of the street. And then they too, glanced up to the sky above us, and muttered something to the matter of profanity when they too saw the lights. It was at that moment that the lights disappeared. I have never in my life before or since seem anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We spotted a really bright white light appearing in the sky just about a roof of a house opposite us. At first we thought it was a fire work and waited for it to go off. It did not and so we watched it some more as it came over to where we were. As it flew over us, we heard no sound at all. It was cigar shaped and it was huge. Limited lights of white and red dotted around the craft and it flew right over our house. We watched it as it slowly went over then ran to the front door but when we got there there was nothing to be seen, no lights, no craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports submitted that we are aware of.
