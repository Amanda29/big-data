2/16/65 21:00|Metairie|LA|Circle|20 seconds|Two circular objects/craft, luminous on their outer perimeters, flying in a staggered formation, sighted above back yard residence.|4/12/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97102.html|1|ndxe196502| Two circular objects/craft, luminous on their outer perimeters, flying in a staggered formation, sighted above back yard residence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a young boy between 9 and 10 years of age, residing in what is called the Westgate area of Metairie, Louisiana.  I believe the Parish is Jefferson County at that time.  Our family lived on the Metairie side of the street, while Kenner was on the other side. My dad was working as a Buyer/Purchasing Agent for The Boeing Company supporting NASA on the early Saturn Rocket and Apollo space programs at the Michoud Assembly Facility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I remember my dad was reading the newspaper that I believe was the &#34;New Orleans Times Picayune.&#34;  Dad told me a newspaper article said that one of the Pegasus Satellites would be visible in the sky that evening.  This was incredible, because I was so fascinated with all that was going on with the US Space Program and had many Vernher Von Braun and astronomy books.  I was so excited about the news of this Pegasus Satellite that would be visible in the evening sky, that I ran over to my neighbor buddy&#39;s house to tell him about this news.  We were so excited about this, that we were out early in my back yard looking up in the dark clear sky before this satellite was to appear overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were waiting to get a glimpse of the Pegasus Satellite, all of a sudden two circular illuminated objects flew slowly directly over our heads.  The best description that I have, is they were flying in a staggered formation and looked like two circular illuminated objects, illuminated just on their outer perimeters, and there was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  Their distance or altitude to be between 300 and 500 feet.  The direction of flight was from right to left as we were looking directly to the backyard.  We were so astonished that we ran in the house to tell my dad, he laughed about it, although my mom went outside to look and the objects were now gone.   This experience that I had as a young boy has bothered me for years, because of time gone by can cause uncertainty in believing, and as I have always wondered if any other residents of Metairie or Kenner had made any recorded reports of UFOs.   I figured because of the &#34;New Orleans Times Picayune&#34; newspaper article that many residents had to be out looking in those evening skies, someone may have seen these objects too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know which Pegasus satellite we were looking to see at the time, as there were actually three that were launched to study micrometeoroid densities for the early Apollo Space program.   My research tells me that the three Pegasus satellites were launched between February 16, 1965, and July 30, 1965â€¦<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

2/15/65 17:00|Chicago|IL|Oval|5 minutes to 1 hr|Object hovered over electric transformer for a few minutes, then quietly move over us. No sound. Aprox size of basketball held at arms|8/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30494.html|2|ndxe196502| Object hovered over electric transformer for a few minutes, then quietly move over us. No sound. Aprox size of basketball held at arms<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom and I were walking to the library around 7pm on a weeknight when we spotted a circular shaped object coming towards us from the south (I was 7 yrs old, my mom 27 at the time). It stopped over a transformer above us a few feet west of us and maybe 500-700 feet above us. It just hovered there for a few minutes. We thought it was either waiting for a plane to pass by or drawing power from the transformer. After a few minutes of hovering it slowly moved going east, passing over us heading east towards Lake Michigan. The thing that I can not explain is how quiet the object was. Nothing I know of can move, stop, change directions and move again so quietly, not a sound. The size of the craft was about the size of a basketball held at arms length, and I&#39;d guess it was no higher than 500 or so feet. I remember the color being a yellowish changing to orange color that changed back to yellow, then orange. My mom remembers more lighting on its edges, like a ring of lights (I remember when we were looking at the object her saying that to me, and I never did see the ring of lights, she said it might be because of our height difference, I was a short 7 yr old then). My mom also believes that we lost as much as an hour that night. We went to the library to pick up a book and come home. Normally a trip like this would take 30 minutes at the most, but we were gone over 2 hours. My father asked what took us so long, and we didn&#39;t think we were gone more than 30 minutes and didn&#39;t know what to say. The next morning my mom contacted the Air Force and filed a report. She was made to feel like she was seeing things or saw swamp gas or an airplane. Now 40 years later, we still remember that night. I have a college degree with honors, a pilots license, a scuba license and am an amature astronomer. Nothing in my education or experience can explain what I saw that night. I&#39;ve seen bright Venus, comets, planes, weather balloons, hot air ballons, flocks of birds flying high over the city at night that looked ! like a flying triangle, but nothing that can move so quietly like that object. Currently I&#39;m involved as a volunteer searching for SETI with my computer at home. I find it interesting that so many people have seen UFO&#39;s and we prove them. It&#39;s as if they don&#39;t want to be proven. If we are dealing with a species more advanced than us, it might be impossible to know what to look for, since we don&#39;t know what it is we need to look for. It&#39;s like the indians looking for the calvery on horses, but the calvery come by jet instead, here and gone before you know what&#39;s going on. What my mom and I witnessed has yet to be explained, it was a UFO in every sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  We will invite the witness to have his mother submit a report, as well.  PD))<n>
2/2/65 06:00|Seattle/Belfair|WA|Sphere|2 hours|Huge, bright orb in sky over Seattle in 1960s.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29476.html|3|ndxe196502| Huge, bright orb in sky over Seattle in 1960s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened between 1964 and 1967. It was before the sun came up and through the trees at Belfair near Hood Canal there was a huge sun like object low in the sky, perhaps to the west.  It did not move and I watched it until daylight when it just faded away into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time Frosty Fowler has doing his radio show from the Seattle Space Needle and he commented on it several times. Thousands of people must have seen it. Frosty wroked for KING radio so maybe you can track him down. After all these years I&#39;m not certain of the date it happened but it was scary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We would welcome other reports from residents in Washington State who might have seen the object, or who might have heard the broadcast.  PD))<n>
2/1/65 07:30|Indianapolis|IN|Circle|unsure|1965 in Indianapolis, In- planet looking object was seen hovering over 2 story home,no lights or sound|6/23/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37701.html|4|ndxe196502| 1965 in Indianapolis, In- planet looking object was seen hovering over 2 story home,no lights or sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aprox. 1965 or 1967, I lived in the Indianapolis area of Indiana. I was in first or second grade. I was walking to school one day when I saw an object above a house. It was above a two story home and much larger than the home it was above. The object looked like a planet. It had two diffent colors or at least darker and lighter areas, but no lights or windows. It made no sound at all. It just hovered above the home, didn&#39;t get higher or lower, and just rotated in a circle above the home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing on the side walk in front of this home. So, I got a good look at this object.I remember looking at it for windows or lights. I watched it for awhile, and then decided I should go home and tell somebody. When I got back with my parents, it was gone. They told me others had reported it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t be exact on the year, but I think it was 1965. And, it must have been winter because when I got to school, I remember the teacher telling me I was late and hurry up and take my coat off. I remember the coat was a heavy winter coat. I also have no idea on how long I watched the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still wonder what it was after all of these years. I hope someone else saw this and knows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
