At first, I thought it was a radio tower light, but as we traveled further down the road I noticed that it was moving slowly in the sky.  We slowed down the car and it hovered slowly over us and then over the neighborhood until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  It had a big center light with three other lights in a triangle fashion.  The center light was white and the surrounding lights were flashing red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> September 30, 2010.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry I thought I had included that<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sent from my iPhone<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

9/30/10 22:30|Monticello|GA|Light|approx. 30 sec.|singular light running across the sky too fast for satelight and too slow for shooting star with no blinking lights.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78106.html|3|ndxe201009| singular light running across the sky too fast for satelight and too slow for shooting star with no blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 36 hours ago, I was standing out in my front yard of my new farm.  I was reading &#34;The Old Farmers Almanac&#34; and it said to look in the southern sky at nite to get a fantastic view of the planet Jupiter, as it is the brightest lite in the sky at this time of this year.  I stood and easily found it.  I called my wife outside to look at it.  We admired the bright planet for a few minutes and went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that nite at about 10:30-11:00 pm., I went outside to investigate what I thought were some dangerously close coyotees, (I have 2 dogs and 3 cats).  When realizing that there was no apparent danger I looked up again to take another look at Jupiter when I noticed a rather quick moving light going across the sky heading in a straight line (north-by-northeast I would say).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Normally, I would think nothing of it as Atlanta is a huge airway and we occassionally see aircraft in the area. However,  this light (as I pointed out to my wife), had no signal lights or other identifying features.  It was moving too quickly to be a satelight (as I have seen them before).  It didn&#39;t look like a shooting star as it was moving to slow for that.  It also had no tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way I and my wife can discribe it is a far off light moving quickly from horizon to horizon in a staight line much like an aircraft would do, but without any other tell-tale blinking lights.  Until the day I die I suppose I will always wonder what that was two nites ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/30/10 22:30|Terrebonne (rural area)|MN|Light|at least an hour|Bright white round light,doesn't move, gets very bright then almost fades out then repeats this for a long time.((NUFORC Note:  Star?))|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78089.html|4|ndxe201009| Bright white round light,doesn&#39;t move, gets very bright then almost fades out then repeats this for a long time<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thursday, September 30, 2010  My partner, ((name deleted)), called me outside to witness a large bright white round light in the eastern sky at 22:00 PM.  The light was white and round and very bright but it is stationery and is fading in and out. It dims so it can barely be seen and then it gets very bright.  We watched it for half an hour and it continued to fade in and out.  There are no clouds in the sky and many stars can be seen as we live in a rural area and it is quite dark outside.  I videotaped it on my pocket camcorder.  It was still visible when we came inside the house to look for our other, larger camcorder which we haven’t located yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two weeks ago we witnessed the same shaped object in the night sky but it was moving from west to east very rapidly.  It wasn’t a plane as there were no blinking lights.  An airplane approached from the east and the object just kept getting dimmer and dimmer and was gone before it reached where the airplane was coming from.<n>

I am 59 white male with a BA degree and own my own business.  My son-inlaw and daughter also saw it and they are in their mid 30&#39;s with high school diplomas.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/30/10 21:55|Grafton|WI|Triangle|7 seconds|Delta shaped body glowing in a misty or foggy golden white light  flying above at a high rate of speed|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78092.html|6|ndxe201009| Delta shaped body glowing in a misty or foggy golden white light  flying above at a high rate of speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking southbound on a moonless but otherwise clear night at just about 10pm, I witnessed a triangular shape move rapidly from west to east above me at what would appear to be a very high rate of speed. Its east to west path would have been approximately 43° 19&#39; 11&#34; N / 87° 57&#39; 11&#34; W. Determining its elevation would be difficult but it was low enough to either reflect ground-based city light from its faceted edges or it was glowing a ghostly, almost mist-like &#34;low wattage&#34; line of bulbs the edge of the wings. The color of the light was a golden white. It was almost like watching a perfectly triangular shaped flock of white seagulls although there was no sound, no wing flapping and all were perfectly aligned like they were coasting in unison with wings outstretched. The shape of the bowtie-shaped facets were illuminated by something akin to the tiny bulb used in a nightlight which is about 7 watts. Birds would not have been 1) Silent, 2) Able to coast ! in perfect unison, and 3)have identical wing markings. I have reasonably ruled out birds flying in unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object has been observed now three times each time moving from west to east around 9-10pm (21.00-22.00) Each time it appears to have a misty or foggy glow in light just barely brighter than a distant starlight. The first two observations I believed were due to some kind of reflection of a streetlight in my contact lens. Tonight, however, I saw it for about a full 7 seconds and watched it move across a greater portion of the sky overhead. Note that the city of Milwaukee is about 18 miles due south of the observed location which may have been the source of reflected light on the delta shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As someone who has traveled by air for over 30 years, I know aircraft pretty well. As a salesman to the U. S. military, I have been on bases around the U. S. and in Europe and have never seen anything resembling this object. I listened very carefully for sound trailing the path of the object but there was none. Once it reached a point about 40 degrees above the eastern horizon, it appeared to go black or it simply disappeared. As it disappeared the other two times I have observed it, too, it might be that its facets no longer reflect light back to the ground beyond a certain observed angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have 20/50 vision so I can see good but not perfect so I grabbed my high def camera thinking I&#39;m not going to be one of those guys that sees this and doesn&#39;t get a picture and took a still shot of it. Then..what I saw on my camera tripped me out I was like...I HAVE to video this..so I looked down to change my camera from picture to video and when I looked up..it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled down my window and popped my head out to see if I could see it, but it was gone. It either flew away really fast or turned off all its light and blended in with the night better. I heard no sounds other than street cars. Not saying it was aliens..but it was definietly something I&#39;ve never seen before..and I have a good picture of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is a link http://i995.photobucket.com/albums/af79/POPPA_ROTZEE/DSC02162.jpg  And then I tried to zoom in to see it better..here it is<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://i995.photobucket.com/albums/af79/POPPA_ROTZEE/UFOzoomed.jpg  I also have the still on my camera that shows it looks exactly like this in origional form and wasn&#39;t tampered with.<n>

9/30/10 19:00|Burlington|WI|Diamond|1 hour|Flashing Lights Moving and Stationary In the South to Northwest Sky|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78110.html|12|ndxe201009| Flashing Lights Moving and Stationary In the South to Northwest Sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 30 September 2010, I observed an interesting celestial phenomenon, the like of which I had never seen before.  I will describe this event so it becomes part of the historical record of such events which occur and might be explained if other people also observed it or know of events or occurrences which can identify or explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My home is located in the town Burlington, WI some on Bushnell Road.  My lot is about 3 acres in size and has treed and open areas, along with my house and three other outbuildings.  From many places of my lot, I have excellent visibility of the sky in all directions.  I can easily get to all of my lot from any of my structures in just a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned home from work approximately 6:30-6:45 PM and entered my detached garage with my automobile.  Immediately, after entry, I let 2 of my dogs out of their kennels to get their evening run and spend time with them.  After about 15 minutes I returned them to their kennels in the garage and gathered items from my automobile and garage to bring them into my house.  I entered my house through the attached garage service door and put my items down on the stair landing in the garage.  I then let out my pup from his kennel in the attached garage to have his run as well.  Again after abut 10-15 minutes, I returned him to his kennel and then I brought my things into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Knowing I had to look for something in my detached garage, I returned to it and quickly found what I needed and set it aside to use later.  It was approximately 7:00-7:15 PM as near as I can estimate since I did not look at my wristwatch at that time.  When I left the service door in my detached garage I happened to look up in the western sky.  I observed a red and white flashing light and figured I had seen an airplane and this was through the trees.  However. I did not see it emerge from the trees and so I kept watching the sky above the tree as I was walking to my house.  Suddenly, I saw the same light phenomenon as I reached a point when I could see a large expanse of the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This flashing light group appeared to have red and white flashing lights some short distance apart on both sides of what I will describe as a horizontal access.  It also had white flashing lights at either end of a vertical access.  My cartoon of this description is attached.  At first I thought this was simply an airplane heading approximately NW according to my position of observation.  Suddenly, this thing stopped moving and seemed to hold its position in the sky.  I continued walking westward and cleared any trees and other high obstructions to my view of the westward sky.  I was in my neighbor&#39;s yard at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing made horizontal tracks in the sky in each horizontal direction.  I will designate this as right and left directional movement.  It moved at least 10 of its lateral width&#39;s to the right, back to its original position and then at least 10 of its lateral widths to the left and then back to its original position.  It could move quickly ~ 1 second for the complete right or left directions or very slowly ~ 10 seconds for the same movement.  It could also do this vertically, which I would designate in the up and down directions.  I watched this for about 15 minutes.  Then this thing seemed to fly off in a NW direction and stop again.  I watched it do the same maneuvers and started scanning the skies to the north, west and south which were visible from my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my surprise, I saw several of these objects in the sky!  They were all doing similar maneuvers and as I counted them, I was sure I counted approximately 8 to 10 of these things.  The were positioned from the southeast to the northwest from what I was able to discern.  All of them were able to make the same movements as I previously described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was moderately excited to have observed these things and I went inside my home about 8:15 PM to rest and recall what I had seen.  As I said, I have no idea what these things are and I first thought maybe the military has a new flying object and was testing here in Wisconsin.  Also, could these things just have been air traffic in some kind of holding pattern for Chicago/O&#39;Hare or Milwaukee/Mitchell airports.  I heard no sounds coming from these things as well but I will also state, these were quite high up in the sky and maybe inaudible to me.  I cannot think of any other information to put into this short report.  Below is a stylized layout of the flashing lights I saw on that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below is a sketch of what I saw in the sky, which are the flashing light positions.  The crossed lines are for my reference to draw the &#34;thing&#34; to some degree of scale as I can remember.  If there is an explanation, please let me know what it is.  Thank you.<n>

I was so in awe of the glowing blue lights with two large balls in front and center and very slowly changing shades of red, pink and magenta,  I just eagerly awaited it to fly over so I could describe it to some friends that work for an airline so they could identify it.  It just looked like a fancy private plane rimmed in neon blue lights to me. Then instead of flying over as I expected it darted backwards and upward in an instant to what seemed what have to have put in in Allen, TX, just north, flew amazingly higher, and of course became much smaller. Next it started darting up and down at unbelievable speeds and darting extreme straight right and left as it was lowered and raised again. Then it disappeared underneath the tree line. I waited for about 10 minutes and never saw it agai! n before returning home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was absolutely plain and clear, there was nothing &#34;iffy&#34; about it to me, and there is no &#34;common&#34; explanation for it. Nothing would ever change my mind about what I saw. I was hoping it would make the news today...but I didn&#39;t see anything, couldn&#39;t even find a blog about it...So for whatever anyone would like to share, I thought this ought to be logged.  I know this would not be the popular thing to share in very Conservative Plano, lol....But I just wanted to share, I know I could not have been the only to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So for whatever it&#39;s worth...this was my experience...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Same place as two years before. 1 or 2 miles away near the horizon, just above the trees-was a tiny bright orange orb. Too big for a star, too big for a planet and too close. I could see it pulsing or hovering slightly, almost like it was respirating. After watching for 3 or 4 minutes without blinking I thought: &#34;Oh- here we go again!&#34; Just then then it slowly started to fade and in 15 seconds was gone. It seemed the show was over then 20 seconds later about 5 degrees to the west (two fingers at arms length-measured by the treetops)another orb slowly faded in and then takes 5-10 seconds to slowly move into the original sighted position. I started to concentrate on it and communicate. Now it was another 2 or 3 minutes since it was back and my hand slapped the truck door in astonishment. It then very slowly faded in place and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were standing outside the car when my fiance pulled me down underneath it.  It was only about 250 feet above us, triangular with a strobing kind of head light.  Totally silent with orbs of light glowing beneath it.  We could clearly make out the workings of the ship.  We saw it land in the dry lake area called the &#34;saltese flats&#34; where it gathered quite a bit of fog and then rose back into the air, and flying literally back into space it seemed.  Then 3 stars that had always been in the sky came together in a triangular formation and took off after it.  My fiance and I will never be the same and it was probably one of the more traumatic experiences of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Spokane is a hot spot, people. Since what we call the encounter we&#39;ve purchased the best binoculars we can afford and often times the &#34;helecoptors&#34; we see in the sky are actually triangular ships with the lights made to look like helecoptors.  We see crazy shit every night and wonder if we&#39;re the only ones watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone needs to get to Spokane to check this stuff out because, as I said, it&#39;s every night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiance and a couple of our friends that grew up in the area &#34;green acres&#34; are recently sure they&#39;ve been abducted as children, and now again as adults, myself included. Too many coincidences.  All the same experience.  Hypnosis involved with discovery as well as natural memory recovery.  Half the time we feel like we&#39;re losing our minds until we remember that we&#39;re sane people and this stuff is really happening.  Local authorities thing we&#39;re bad shit crazy, but oh well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We would LOVE to be contacted by you guys so at least then we could get some answers.<n>

It was no more than 300 feet away from my brother and I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound was like a breath of air after being held under water for two minutes. Just an unpleasnt almost screatching breath in your ear. Like nothing i have ever heard before.

These lights were possibly 1000 – 2000 feet above the ground and moved slowly from north to south across the eastern edge of Morningside in Sioux City.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were low in intensity, were white, and did not blink.  I could not see the shape of the object, only the pattern of lights.  The object made no sound and seemed to glide through the air.

However, after I realized that it had traversed from approx. 20 degrees above the north horizon to approx. 20 degrees above the south in about 3 seconds, I decided that it must be something else. It was silver color (not red- orange) somewhat a triangular shape about the width of two fingers at arms length and twice as long with streaming to the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Initially we were concerned it was an aircraft on fire, but it continued to fly without incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It moved relatively slowly from side to side and at one point appeared to be spinning or doing some type of maneuvering. We ruled out the possibility of it being a bird, as there were no wings and it was quite large. It was also obviously not any sort of balloon or toy. I had never seen anything like this before.

Watched it the first one fly over.  It had more lights on it, could not make out it&#39;s actual shape.  could not even accurately describe it as an airplane, because the lights didn&#39;t seem configure in what i assume to be a &#34;typical&#34; manner.  shortly after first one advanced overhead the other one suddenly sped up and appeared to smoothly &#34;zoom&#34; across the same path.  I believe they were headed SW.  I thought th! ere was a humming noise, but there was a low flying jet that flew from the complete, opposite direction.   It seemed to intersect it&#39;s path and did have a different sound, but it muffled any noise i tried to distinguish from the two objects.  I saw red lights, a bright yellow and possibly a green one, it was early and my eyes were blurry.  I have pictures, but i couldn&#39;t get them close up, the are only bright yellow orange objects in the distance.  the peculiar thing about them was the hovering and then speeding up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

9/28/10 22:20|Redding|CT|Light|30 minutes|I saw a bright light that slowly moved through the sky and seemed to have striations that looked like lightning bolts eminating from it|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78045.html|33|ndxe201009| I saw a bright light that slowly moved through the sky and seemed to have striations that looked like lightning bolts eminating from it<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight I saw a light that appeared to be south east from my location but much higher up than the planes and jets flying below. From my vantage point it appeared to be over long island. What struck me about the light was the brightness especially considering we have a storm blowing through tonight. I was surprised to see this light through the thick clouds that were blowing over. Other stars would get covered over but this light would shine right through the clouds. After I noticed it and really started taking a look at it, I could see lines of light coming from the source that could be described as tentacles or lightning bolt shaped. I thought those lines could have been a trick on my eyes but I blinked and changed perspective and the lines coming from the light stayed clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After getting very interested, I got my camera to film it. Unfortunately after that I was not able to see the light at it&#39;s full brightness and my camera had a hard time picking it up. By the naked eye, I could still see those lines coming from the light. It seemed very weired that I could see them as the clouds were still blowing through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light wasn&#39;t moving with the same pattern as the stars. When I first noticed it and started observing, the light moved but I didn&#39;t have a good position marked to figure out how far. It wasn&#39;t fast though and certainly didn&#39;t go shooting off in any direction. When I went in to get my camera and came out, the light was in a much different place but still generally in the same area being south east of my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to get photographic evidence of the light and set myself in a position I could remember with trees in the foreground. Although I was able to capture the light on my camera, I don&#39;t think it will be very useful because it is so dark out tonight and at that point the light seemed to be aimed somewhere else and thusly was not as bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Things that were striking about this light are: * The color of the light was not at all like the stars or the planes flying over. I&#39;d describe it as an LED light while the stars were incandescent. There was a blue color in the light, it seemed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> * The pattern the light moved in reminded me of a search pattern but the source was far too high for that to be the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> * The striations coming from the light were truly bizarre. It was like seeing the source of multiple lightning bolts coming from a single source but lasting for minutes at a time. When the light was dim, I could still make out the lines but they weren&#39;t as easy to identify. It seemed that every time the light shone bright, the striations were the same configuration however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> * Although it wasn&#39;t immediately obvious, the light was moving. The pattern it was moving in was more like it was making observations of an area and then move on. I never saw it shoot off in one direction or another but it would either slowly move while it was bright or go dim and then be bright in another spot that was maybe 5 or 10 degrees off from it&#39;s last spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not pulled the camera video onto my computer yet but would be willing to post it onto a server for you to observe. Please email me for that information. Also please understand that I do travel for as long as a week at a time so please be patient if I do not respond right away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was warm and clear, maybe hi 60&#39;s and we (husband and I, (I&#39;m a homemaker) were showing our son the big dipper constellation.  We were all looking up in that general direction for about one minute, when I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d like to note that there is a sort of lighthouse style arm or ray of light, very faint that rotates over the apartment complex that we live in.  I&#39;m not sure of its source.  But it&#39;s always there night after night, probably/maybe from a local building.  The arm of light is such that if the cloud cover is low, the light seems to skim the bottom of the clouds.  The light makes a full rotation about every 7 seconds.  I just went outside (it&#39;s now 23:20) to time it and it wasn&#39;t on.  So not sure what that is about.  I&#39;m not outside this late very often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking up and following the faint pale search light with my eyes as it was skimming the sky (right above my head, I was looking straight up)  when in the lights path was a chevron shape of lights ( it reminded me of those black military stealth bomber planes in the shape of it.)  The sighting lasted about 5 seconds and it seemed to be smoothly flying across the sky heading from east to west.  The lights were tiny and a faint yellow/white color.  The stars making up the big dipper were brighter and bolder.  It&#39;s hard to recall but maybe there were 10 or fewer lights.  As it traveled away from me it was even harder to keep my eyes on it (the lights bordering the shape got less intense as it flew away)  and about 5 seconds later it seemed to disapear into the blackness of the night sky.  I couldn&#39;t follow it as far as I could follow an airplane in the night sky.  I&#39;d like to note that it made NO SOUND.  I was excitely trying to direct my husband to see it, but, like I sa! id the event was so quick and had my eye been still looking at the big dipper itself, I&#39;m pretty sure I would have never caught a glimpse of it .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then the object suddenly stopped and spun around in a circle about 3 times and quickly flew off in the direction that it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object seemed fairly close.  I would say about 500-1000 ft. easy.  It seemed to be getting bigger as it circled around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is about as much information that I can provide.  The object was moving very fast.  I could hardly keep up with its movements.  It took off toward the northern sky section.<n>

After approaching from the west it stopped for a time see ref #1;  The object then proceeded to move south see ref #2 in which it moved right to left and also in a circular motion at all times it should be mentioned the object used the same motions; stop, move either left to right and in a circular motion.  The object was observed against a ship light for reference to make sure the object was moving; also the star before the big dipper juts-up the star which is not part of the big dipper in the handle was also used for reference.  The object proceeded to move north past the ship light see Ref #3 which the ship light for the whole time to this period was fixed; after the object moved to the right of the very bright ship light the ship started moving due south ref #4.  At this time I cut a hole into a piece of paper and secured it placing my face at least 6 inches away from the hole to double check to see again if it was my eyes playing tricks, but the object was moving as mentioned above moving out of the range of the cutout.  One note at no time did the object move north of the last star in the handle of the big dipper as if it was a boundary.  Also the object seemed to move west at one time to chase a very faint light south to north moving like a strobe on a aircraft which one could barely make out the light it was so dim.  You almost had to catch it out of the corner of your eye.  Ref #5 and #6; leaving the coastal position after about a hour or hour and a half I was beyond the tree line when the object came closer and was brighter than before; it moved very rapidly form right to left (north to south) and then back north disappearing behind the trees.  I then spotted somebody with a very bright flashlight as though they were searching for somebody. ! end of encounter.<n>

Before going to bed we decided to take our dog for a walk since the rain had stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was at about 8:30 pm.  As we walked the sky was strange.  It was as if the sky had been split in two as the low pressure system and dark clouds took up half the sky while the other was crystal clear with a blanket of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since all of the street lights were out the clear part of the sky was incredible.  I paused for a minute and looked up.  What I saw was a small white light traveling extremely fast through the sky.  It was apparent that this light source was extremely high in the sky.  It was a single white light with no blinking red or other colored lights. I watched it for a second or two then commented to my son and husband about the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son looked up and immediately saw the light.  He agreed with me that it was traveling at a much faster speed than any airplane you could see in the clouds.  Several seconds later my husband saw it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it go on a trajectory from West to East and it probably only took about 30 seconds to completely cross the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen lots of airplanes in the air.

All the sudden I saw what looked like a bright light about 1000-2000 feet above me. I had not seen where it came from.  After a minute it was joined by 2 more bright objects. I tried to look at them to see if they were gulls, or something else.  They did not move in the pattern a gull would.  I also thought about balloons, but again they do not move the way these did, no floating etc, these moved in deliberate movement. First 1 light, then being joined by another and just sitting still, no movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of minutes of watching the 3 bright lights, all the sudden there were at least 13-15 or more of the objects. Then they began to form triangles some were standard all the same length triangles an then some were much longer and the end lights were closer together forming an elongated triangle.  I watched them come together, move apart, form patterns of triangles and then just move back and sit there. There was one light, and then it was being joined by another and just sitting still, no movement. Then they began moving to form triangles and groups of 3-7 objects in a circle pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was getting ready to go back to work and one of the managers of the place I work came by, I asked him if he could see anything, he said “ no “ and I said come over to where I am standing, and he did and then he said “ Yes I can see something “ I said “ What is it?” and he said “ its not planes, and it’s not birds and I don’t know what they are, but if I had a gun, I would shoot at them”  Just what I needed a trigger happy witness.  So that was when they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a Canon 12x SX 200 IS camera and I did take a couple of pictures but the sun was so bright and it was hard to see anything through the lens.  I have been trying to see if I can find some photo enhancing software to look at the pictures. There is obviously something there in the pictures.

The object seemed to twinkle with red, green and white light.  As I continued to watch I noticed there were three of them, in a loose triangle formation.  The two which made the “bottom” of the triangle formation were nearer the tree line a moved out of sight within a few minutes.  I called my sister who lives close by, and asked that she go outside and look at it. She saw the same thing and said it might be a helicopter. I said it wasn’t because it wasn’t moving or making a sound. Then she said “If they come to get you, give me a heads up I might want to go too!”  It wasn’t a helicopter. The object just hung there in the night sky flashing red, green, and white lights.  I have seen this before in the same spot, looking out the back door. I also noticed the same phenomenon driving home from my neighboring sister’s house late maybe a week prior to this. There is never a sound, but the dogs always go crazy barking once they get out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

We looked at it through a telescope and it appeared to be a flattened round object with very bright multicolored lights on it and it was spinning.  It did not appear to be moving.  I have looked at the stars for years and I know that it was not a planet nor was it the space station.  I have never seen anything like it.  My telescope does not have the capability to take photographs so we could not take a picture.

All you could see were the white and blue blinking lights zooming across the sky toward the south.  Suddenly witness 1 shouts “Oh my god do you see that!” and grabs my arm. At that moment I noticed an object moving across the sky toward the south at about a 65 degree angle from the plane. I froze and we just watched it go across the sky till it disappeared over the horizon, maybe 3-4 seconds. The object was a mere shadow in the sky, I believe the best way to describe it would be similar to the sci-fi invisibility suits that mirror the image or scene behind itself, but the mirrored image is bent or slightly distorted. The object was not obvious in any way, you would have only seen it if you were focusing in that area of the sky.  The object was shaped like a boomerang and I could see faint, no brighter than a dull s! tar, red lights lining the front of it (the angled or bent portion of the object).  The lights did not blink and they all appeared exactly the same.  As the object moved across the sky it did not change altitude, course, or speed.  The object was closer to us than the plane and moved at a slower speed relative to the plane. However, the object did move at a good speed, I noticed the object when it was directly above me and watched it to the horizon in about 4 seconds. From where I stood, the object appeared to be about the size of a football field so I figure it must have been even larger when considering distance. I never heard a sound from either plane, and my two dogs did not appear to notice/hear anything. At first I thought I was hallucinating until witness 1 said “No, didn’t you see the red lights?”  At that point we had not said anything regarding what the object looked like. We immediately went inside to draw, independently, what we had seen before discussing it wit! h each other.  Our pictures were the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background: I am a full time student at Texas State University-San Marcos. I will complete my BS in Biology this May 2011. I have a minor in psychology which has already been completed. I am a very scientifically oriented person and have never taken UFO sightings very seriously before. I tried to rationalize what I saw in every way possible, but still returned to the conclusion that it was alien to this world. I thought maybe a giant flock of birds- no flock flies in such a perfect shape or carries red flashlights; maybe a military plane like the stealth bomber- there are no nearby military bases and I don’t see the point of designing such a big aircraft to fly stealth (it would be detected by radar at such a large size); so maybe what I saw was an unconscious inference (some of our perceptions are the result of unconscious assumptions we make about the environment) and was really just some planes flying in a chevron shape way up leaving contrails- I have never seen an aircr! aft that has only one steady red light (which would be the case if there was more than one plane) and the rest of the object did not look anything like contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness 1: Witness 2 and I were on the back porch enjoying at the nice night. We saw a plane passing overhead and then all of a sudden I spotted something out of one’s imagination, a shape in the sky that looked like an oversized boomerang.  This ship-like object almost looked like a stealth bomber without the sharp angles, but ten times the size.  It cruised across the sky a little slower than the plane and really high up. It had small red lights like faint stars on the very front of the shape. This shape was the same color as the night sky; it was like a ripple moving across the sky. The way it moved was like nothing ever, it made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background: I graduated from Texas State University in 2009 with a BESS in health and fitness administration and a minor in business. I am the administrator of a podiatrist office/specialized running store in New Braunfels, TX.  My father is a Ranger, so I have spent a good majority of my life living on military bases and seeing the jets fly by. This was not like anything I have ever seen on any military base!

I grew up in Colorado and so have knowledge of   unknown lights and objects in this state as many were published in local newspapers, especially during the 70’s. I have seen one strange object back in the 90’s but it would be very difficult to describe and so I won’t even bother.  But last night I was surprised at my father’s home on his back deck. The sun was very low on the western horizon and may have even slipped behind the hills. I saw a very bright light in the western sky - I could not make out any fuselage or wings or blinking lights or contrail, but I did quickly decide it was reflecting the sunlight because it changed to a sharper metallic brightness and then the light was gone. The object had moved beyond the reach of the sun’s rays as it traveled in a southeastern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object with some difficulty because it was a faint white, cigar in shape, but not clearly defined.  It was nearly invisible in the pale sky, but I continued to watch the course of it until it finally just faded altogether.  It seemed to be sailing along very smoothly without any wobbles or directional changes. I cannot tell how fast it was traveling, but it covered about 130 degrees of the dome of the sky in 25 - 30 seconds.  I think it was very high in the air but I cannot substantiate that opinion.  It seemed to gain altitude as it traveled west to southeast because it became so faint and hard to distinguish. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that I first saw it at 1,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Are comets or shooting stars a green blob circle of light that shoots across the sky?  I&#39;ve seen shooting stars and a meteor shower before. Neither were green.

I was driving my car when I saw something bright and red in the dark sky.

At that point I knew it was not a flare. Then as I got in a curve, I lost it for a while behind houses.  I accelerated a bit and it was there again. I took the road to my right because it was going down and I didn’t want to lose it again. It was still coming down in front of me as I was accelerating more.  It was dark and I had problems estimating the distance and the size of the object but it seemed big.  In front of the road I was on, there is a field and a little forest behind it. The object was then partially blocked by trees and when I didn’t see it anymore, I saw a lot of ! red light strings coming upwards through the trees. I stopped my car and tried to see what was there but I didn’t see anything.  Everything went very fast and I think it lasted about three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After watching them for over an hour we noticed a plane that would get close to the objects, but not directly up to them.  The plane kept moving around these objects, yet they did not move.  I eventually went to bed, and the objects were still there before I left.   I talked about what I had seen with a lady at work this morning. She had also noticed the same objects.<n>

I was standing on the side of Pacific Coast Highway, facing north. It was a very clear day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tilted my head back while I was stretching (otherwise I wouldn’t have noticed), and saw white lights, or dots (mostly round in shape) in the sky.  They were very high in the air, too high up to be birds. They made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights, or dots, seemed to disappear and reappear as I watched.  I would look away, and then look back, and they were still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for a period of 3-5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw as many as 18 of the objects, and as few as 3.  They would literally disappear and reappear as I watched.  At one point, I could see only three, and they were in a triangle formation.  Then suddenly the rest reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects also seemed to multiply. I would be staring at one, and it appeared to split into two. The grouping seemed random, but very close together.  Almost like pockets of white dots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not straight up in the air, but almost straight up. If “straight up” means 90 degrees, then I would say they were at about 70 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved, but not like airplanes.

The aircraft was flying at about a quarter mile high in altitude and was moving at a slow pace southward.  The shape of this object was very odd, it seemed to have a very slow moving vertical &#34;helicopter blade&#34; in the back that was glowing, and a sphere shaped body in the front but was large.   We could not hear any noise from this object but it just hovered right along its path until it was out of our sight. we considered following it but it was too late in the night.<n>

I was in the process of picking up a load in the middle of a cotton field at approximately 10:15pm central time. As I was walking around checking all of the valves on the tanks, I happened to notice a brilliant red light in the sky.  At first I thought it was a plane but as I watched I realized the light was stationary.  It was approximately 1/2 mile from my location and approximately 1000 ft off the ground.  This lasted for about 2 minutes before 2 more lights appeared slightly higher in the sky and slightly to the left.  These were yellowish orange color. The lights just faded in till they reached there brightest point.  At this time the red light faded out at the same rate as the 2light yellowish lights appeared.  As soon as the red light had disappeared completely, 2 more yellowish orange lights appeared slightly higher up and to the left of the already visible yellowish lights.  This time as soon as the li! ghts reached the brightest point, the previous 2 yellowish lights faded out just as the red light had done.  The first 2 lights were on approximately 2 seconds before the next 2 lights became to show up.  Once the second set of yellowish lights were on for approximately 2 seconds they faded out at the same rate they came on.  The sky was then dark for about 10 seconds before the red light came back on.  Fading in just as the other lights had done. Then the pattern continued at random intervals for the remainder of the event.  I tried to capture video as well as pictures.  Every time I placed the camera up to take a picture the lights would not come on. As soon as I put the camera back in my truck, the lights returned.  The field I was in while viewing this is completely flat with no trees to block my view.  The night was completely clear with no clouds, had a light breeze, but cannot remember what phase the moon was in.  There were no lights close to me to cause any reflections or i! nterference with my line of sight.<n>

One of the neighbor kids ran into the house to get us, yelling come see this.  We ran outside and the kids pointed to the sky. We looked up, and that is when we seen ten orb shaped balls.  They were the color of fire.  It did not seem like there were lights on the orbs, they seemed to be glowing.  They were in some type of formation. Then they just disappeared.  They didn&#39;t fly away, they just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We immidiately called 911 to find out what was happening.  They told us that so many people had called about this incident.  They said they did not know what was happening, and they told us that they had called the ufo center hotline.  When we got off the phone with 911, we looked up the ufo hotline number and called them ourselves.  We left our name and number on the answering machine. Some one called us back within a half hour.  He said other people had called too, and that they were trying to find out what is going on.<n>

My friend ran into the restaurant and told everyone what we saw and at least three people came out and saw this.  There was traffic on the street and I saw some of the drivers looking up at the sky but I don’t know if they were looking up because we were or because they saw the formation of lights.  I tried to take a picture with my cell phone but it was too dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation moved as one unit, there was no sound,  and no blinking lights.  Once it moved over our heads heading south, it seemed to just disappear.  It is hard to explain the formation, there was one light in the front and one in the back the other twelve lights were in a two by two formation in between, but not side by side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a mostly clear night. The temperature was approximately 50 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 57 year old retired secretary, my husband is a 60 year old retired steelworker, and our two friends are in their late 40’s.

Our first thought was that we were looking at a shooting star until we saw the object come to almost a complete stop.   The object then accelerated and faded  away only to reappear a few seconds later.  The object accelerated again and disappeared in the sky heading southwest toward the sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the object that we saw was a round very bright orange light.  It look like it had a tail and a ring around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were admiring the lights of the bay from near Malaga Cove when we noticed a bright orange light coming toward us (but to the west) from the direction of Malibu. The orange light was constant and not blinking.  Behind the light was a tail similar to a meteorite, but the object was not traveling nearly as fast as a meteorite would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about three seconds, a red light came out from the rear of the object and disappeared.  Then the tail waned and the light dimmed and then went out completely.   Within one second, the light re-emerged with a large puff of smoke that was visible in the moonlight.  The light then accelerated and disappeared after approximately three seconds<n>

It was flying from the northwest on a low trajectory, looked like maybe five miles out over the ocean.  When I first saw the object,it seemed to burn brightly, and when it came closer,it dimmed and then shot of at a quick climbing trajectory to the southwest.Ran inside to grab the camera,but it was gone pretty quick. San Clemente sits adjacent to camp pendleton marine base just to our south,but I know they only fire artillary that we&#39;ve heard but never seen,and this seemed to come from laguna beach or dana point when I first spotted it.  San Clemente Island located about 50 miles to our southwest is used as a bombing range, so I wonder if this was a rocket from Vandenberg Air Force base way to our northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any info you could find would be! helpful, otherwise I think i might have just become a believer, and so would my wife!<n>

I thought It was a launch from VAFB but 20 seconds after I seen the flames they went out and a lite came on.  I watched for about twenty more seconds and it went dark.  About 15 - 20 seconds later the lite came back on, but the object had increased it&#39;s altitude as it came in my direction.  It appeared to make a 60 degree right turn as it was moving out over the ocean.  This occured over the channel islands.  There are 7 radars stations between VAFB and John Wayne airpot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve lived in the county for 24 years and have seen launches from VAFB and this was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen. VAFB is about 85 miles from where I live.  When the lite first came on it was about 3/8&#39;s of an inch in diamiter.  This nite had a wisp of clouds but otherwise was clear.  There is a great deal of air traffic in this area, but all planes and jets have red and white strobes unlike this object which had a lite that p! ulsed slightly.<n>

It was traveling in a fairly straight line horizontally to the ocean at about 30 degrees flying north to south. The light on the aircraft was a bright yellow and the vapor trail was the same color.  I lowered my widow to be sure that what I was seeing wasn’t a reflection on the window.  Certain it was a jet I turned the car off and expected to here the sound of a thundering engine but it was completely quiet.  As it passed midpoint the light began to fade very similarly to how I’ve seen  satellite fades in the passed so I re assessed it as possibly a satellite reflecting the sun but about two seconds after it faded the light flared up again with what appeared to be a puff of smoke and  slowed down considerably.  The sky was relatively clear however the puff of smoke could have been ! a small cloud that simply wasn’t visible prior to the flare up. As the craft passed silently in front of us it slowly faded once again.<n>

By that I mean, the object, sighted directly south of Deer Park  Washington at  a distance of approximately 8-10 miles displayed a bright white orb emitting brilliant red. white and blue  sparkeling flashes.  It hovered motionless for a few minutes after first being spotted.  I ran into the house for my  camera, but when I returned in less than 30 seconds, it had moved approximately five miles to the south and  continued to move in a nominal ballistic arc sweeping westward. The brilliant flashes lights were no longer visible  and only a single small flash continued to be emitted from the UFO. We agreed between ourselves that this was no  helicopter because of the intensity of the white light and the brilliance of the flashing colored lights.<n>

It was low in the sky and moved without sound.  The core of the object was shaped like a peace sign or the middle of sand dollar.  The core was a bright orange/yellow, like the color of a flame.  The core emitted something that was like exhaust in all directions which created a circle around the core making if look a bit like the center of a jellyfish.  Based on watching other planes in the sky, I would guess it was three to four times the speed of those planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One to two minutes later, I saw a fighter jet travelling at a slightly slower, but very fast speed following the same path the object had taken.

This is the second time I have seen this.  It looks like a large rectangle, one dimensional, flying right over the tree line.  It is similar in appearance to a sign pulled by a plane, but close to square, not a long rectangular banner.  The color is gunmetal grey.  It seems a bit fluid in the wind, but maintains shape and corners.  No lights.  There is no airplane pulling it and nothing tethering it below.  It disappeared below the treeline as I was driving.  It was hard to keep an eye on due to the fact that there was quite a bit of traffic, just like the last time I saw it.  I am not crazy and was disturbed that I have seen it twice under similar circumstances.  I had never seen a UFO before or floating rectangles.  The sky was partially overcast both times, but a much lighter grey.<n>

At approximately 11:15 am near exit 300, I noticed a cylindrical object ascending in the sky at 45 degree angle from the north toward the south.  I thought at first that it was an airliner but there were no wings and no tail.  It appeared to be dark gray at first then shimmered as if reflecting the sunlight.  Then the object de-materialized from the inside out starting on the left side moving to the right until the cylinder had completely disappeared.  Though there were clouds in the sky, they were small with plenty of blue sky between them.  The object did not fly behind a cloud, it vanished while I watched.  The entire episode lasted about 3 seconds. The object was about the size of a quarter held at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m a father in my mid-30s working in healthcare.

No blinking lights, just solid glowing. I feel pretty confident that this was no airplane or helicopter or rocket.<n>

Suddenly something moved across the freeway just in front of us from right to left, but never made it to the center wall...it just vanished into thin air.  It was obviously a living creature approximately 12 to 13 feet tall and extremely thin. It ran with a speed faster than I can even estimate. I have seen things before and have UFO sighting experience but my fiancee is traumatized. She said &#34;I have never believed in UFOs or anything of that nature, but I know beyond any doubt I saw an Alien being&#34;. It was also slightly transparent, as we could see throught it as it ran in front of us.  Even though I am a believer and know what I have seen in the past, this has disturbed me.  We didn&#39;t talk much about it at first, I think we both wanted to pretend we didn&#39;t see it, but she will not drive that stretch of freeway alone at night now. We&#39;ve decided we need to talk to so! meone...but who?<n>

I noticed it was a full moon and something in the sky caught my attention.  There was an object in the sky very visible and noticeable. I began to slow my motorcycle down to get a better look at it.  The object was circular, with yellow/green lights rotaing in a pattern around it.  It appeared to have two separate halves, like a top and a bottom.  The object was moving a fair speed and and i began to accelerate on my motorcycle to stay with it.  It was a large object, and close to ground. It appeared to be moving and stopping irregular.  I came to a stop light at PCH and the Incline, and raised my visor on my helmet to get a better view.  The object was silent and the patterns of lights changed once again.  At this point the object was pretty much directly above the santa monica pier.  I passed through mcluren tunnel and did 80mph all the wa! y home.  This object was moving at least two times faster than I, as it moved deeper into mid La.  I stayed behind this object as long as i could before it got too far and my exit approached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was moving too fast to be a blimp, it was too low and quiet to be plane or helicopter. IM not sure what it was but it gave me chill bumps every second it was in my sights. I called santa monica PD when i got home to see if they had any other reports. as  of 10 45 PM:  No one else reported. This object was too bold and noticeable for anyone not to have seen it.<n>

Suddenly the lights separated from each other and returned back to the original formation going southeast towards Anaverde, Palmdale, CA from over the 14 fwy. I only saw this for about 30seconds. They made no sound; I only heard the freeway traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The neighbor’s dogs also started howling at the time of the sighting. I’m still kind of freaked out.<n>

We were driving North bound on highway 95 and in the distance I saw what I thought might of been a beacon of some sort but then noticed it had to be way to high. Est altitude about 1500 agl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer the craft would have a light that would face us white in color but that was it at the moment. Once we were upon the craft it was moving slowly over the highway coming right over our car and then it had 3 lights that would change going white red white, then white white red and finally red white white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly pulled the car over and got out to see if could hear anything and there was absolutely no sound.  I could not tell the exact size of the craft but from the lights it looked to be rectangular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It headed like it was dead reckoning on highway 95 southbound and we drove off.<n>

As we walked up the hill a block northerly on Main Street I spotted an orange colored object in the sky moving approximately north easterly.  Commenting on how I never saw a plane that color, I realized that the orange color was more like a medium flickering glow of a coal furnace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it for a minute or so, I saw a second one approach and then a third.  Looking back the opposite direction through the trees I could see that others were coming.  They were in the 10 to 11 o’clock position above the horizon.  There was virtually no wind and it was of course dark.  They seemed to be following each other but not actually regimented.  Some appeared closer to each other and some seemed to be higher or lower.  They seemed to be coming from the southeast and traveling northwest in a large loosely S formation over a couple mile distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All objects appeared to be the same except in size which may have been attributed to distance or height.  I estimated thirty or so UFO’s over a fifteen to twenty minute period.<n>

Yesterday, September 24, 2010, I went to my store to work and left in the evening around 7:40 to 7:45 PM.  I had not been drinking and I do not use drugs, prescription or otherwise.  I was with my business partner when I left the store.  My store is located in the center of town near Dock Square.  Our car was parked about two blocks away on Main Street.  It was a clear night and quite dark.  The moon had risen but was a bit obscured by low mist in the sky.  It was very clear overhead.  That part of Main Street is quite dark as it’s residential.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were almost back to the car, we spotted something moving across the sky.  We were facing north.  The object came out of the southeast and headed north or northwest.  I would say that I was looking up at about a 75 degree angle as it passed overhead.  The object was moving somewhat slowly.  At the center of it was an orange glow, medium bright in intensity.  The glow flickered.  It seemed to me to be more like the flicker of a candle or a fire than what I might describe as pulsating.  The flicker seemed irregular and not like a pulse.  I could see the orange light reflecting on a part of the object that was above the source of light and could not see any part of the object that was above that.  I was not just looking at a “ball of light” or at a light source.  There was a definite apparatus surrounding the light source.  My first impression was that I was looking at a home built ultra light, but there was no sound from it whatsoever.  The object moved above us and con! tinued on toward the northwest until it was just a speck in the distance.  At that point I was observing it at perhaps a 30 to 40 degree angle.  While it was closest to us, I would say that it appeared about half the size of the full moon, maybe a bit bigger.  The light did not streak in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was then very surprised to see another one just like it.  The path, appearance and behavior were exactly the same as the first one.  Within a minute or two we had seen about eight of the objects.  They were not evenly spaced in time or in space but clustered at random, always one behind the other in a follow the leader formation.  Some went by one at a time.  I thought again that I must be looking at ultra lights and that it was perhaps an event put on by a flying club but it seemed odd to me that they would fly at night.  I wondered if they were related in some way to hot air balloons but there was no balloon.  I have been up in a hot air balloon and I know the pattern of the occasional hot flame blast the this was not like that at all.  And hot air balloon blasts illuminate the balloon above the basket.  There was nothing but dark above the light source.  There was also only the faintest breeze (at street level) but the objects were moving along at a faster pace than the! breeze would indicate.  And, as I mentioned, they were silent.  Also, I would say that the path that this “parade” of objects followed did not appear to be a straight line but more of a long curving arc (but that may have been an illusion from my vantage point).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the objects move overhead for about fifteen to twenty minutes.  Each time we thought the event was over, we would spot another one or another pair coming out of the southeast and toward us.  I didn’t count the objects because, at the beginning I didn’t know there would be more than the first few.  But I believe that in all there were at least 25 of them and no more than 30 or 32 of them.  No one of them appeared or behaved any differently from the others.  I have no idea if the first one we spotted was the first one to pass overhead.  This might have been going on for a while before we got there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My impression was that I was looking at something “low tech”.  There were no unexplainable motions or rapid changes in direction.  They just drifted overhead as if floating on a steady but strong wind current.  This may have seemed this way to me because of the complete lack of any sound coming from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, when we were convinced that no more were going to come, we got into the car and drove around the block to drive in front of our store.  We saw three women on the sidewalk (this is the commercial part of town near Dock Square) who looked to be in their late fifties or early sixties.  They were pointing up into the sky in the same direction and at the same angle as I had seen the flying objects.  My partner stopped and let me out of the car so I could ask our employees (the store was still open) if they new of any event.  None of them knew anything.  One of them told me that the Bush family (George W.?) is in town this week but the pattern of what we saw made no sense to me as a security event.  I wish I had spoken to the three women first because when I came out of the store, they were gone.  It was moderately busy in the square and no one else was looking up, but there were no more flying objects at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of curiosity, my partner called someone at the Biddeford air field, a small strip for private planes just a few miles north of Kennebunkport.  They knew nothing of any event and no one else had reported seeing anything unusual.  I remember looking at my watch when we left Kennebunkport.  It was 8:58 PM.<n>

I looked up because something in the periphery of my vision appeared.  I saw an intense green fireball traveling west to east at a very high rate of speed.  I could not guess the altitude; it was about the size of my small fingernail.  It appeared like it came over some houses to the west and then into the vicinity of the parking lot, where it blinked out, just before it disappeared a bright orange spark came shooting off of it.  There appeared to be a hazy orange aura surrounding the fireball, which was in the shape of a square more than a ball. There was a small trail of the green material following it that disappeared when the object blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound, no smoke given off, no evidence after it disappeared.  There were no aircraft in the area at all.  I could not guess at the speed, it travelled over the length of the parking lot in less than half a second.  It did not appear to change direction.<n>

The best way to describe this one is the shape of a couch pillow but metallic and it spins at a certain rate all the time. It moves in all directions and the wind has no effect on it but still spins at the same rate. I have this thing on video three different times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok now for the best sighting, this thing had the shape of the Star Trek symbol but my best description of it would be if Batman had a jet plane this thing would be it.   I saw it in detail with my binoculars and could not believe what I was seeing, a batwing jet black with an oval tanish color body attached to the wing, no noise, no markings, no means of propulsion, stealthy.   My other sighting was right above my house on a Saturday noonish time.  I had just walked out of my garage to meet to friends and I looked up an! d there was two disc shaped black objects sitting still in the sky, wind was blowing some but they stood exactly still, both friends saw them also and then they just disappeared.  I also have what looks like a crop circle in my backyard in the grass.  My girlfriend who has seen the metallic pillow and I woke up one morning and we both said to each other it felt like we both had been in a very deep sleep, maybe like being tranquilized, one I have never felt before and the strange thing about it is we both told each other at the same time.

I was parked facing south on the west shoulder of 1000 Bowman Springs Rd. in Kennedale, Texas at 0223.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed what first appeared to be a very bright flickering star to the east at about 45 degrees on the horizon.  Then I thought it might be a plane. I noticed it move slowly to the left then stop.  I took my binoculars from my bag and looked at the object.  It was then I could see that what appeared to be flickering were rotating white, blue and sometimes red lights.  The object appeared saucer-like in shape and made no noise.  It would hover, then move left, right and up several times during the duration which lasted 33 minutes. A jet came into the frame also.  I could tell the jet because of the shape, the lights and the headlight out in front.  As the jet approached, the object moved away to the left. When the jet passed, the object moved back. There was a bare tree branch in the foreground I used as a reference point, and could clearly see the object move.  At times it became bigger and one other time it moved straight away until barely visible, then came back to where it had been, but bigger.  The object seemed to have one bigger, central or top light, with the other lights going around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object move around until a low cloud covered it completely from view. When the cloud cover cleared, the object was gone. It WAS NOT a star! It was a full moon with the moon in the west sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was hoping someone else would come by so I could show them.  I tried video on my phone, but it is no good. I would be interested to know if someone else saw this. It could have been seen by nearby Mansfield or Arlington as well probably.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been observing a star, possibly Sirius.

I went to the bathroom and then went back to the edge of my bed and just happened to peak out my window, when i did that I looked into the sky and saw a bunch of very small glittery lights coming out of the sky. My first thought is wow a meteor shower.  I have never seen one so I woke my wife up and said come look at this, it’s a meteor shower.  She said she couldn’t look because she did not have her contacts in so she went back to sleep and I went back to the window.  It took a minute but I finally realized that there was a very loud ongoing jet sound/rumble.  Now I do live next to an air force base, but I have been living next to the base for 18 years and have never heard a jet that loud, that late at night for that long.  I kept watching the lights thinking I’m seeing a meteor shower and there is a jet in the distance, but then the swarming shower started moving.  I th! ought that this was where the tiny meteors were falling to but when I really focused on the lights I noticed that they were all repeating their patterns.  As the lights got further away, the jet noise seemed to get softer and eventually was gone as the lights were not visible anymore.  Just after that I could hear a jet taking off from the base for a few seconds and I then went to bed.  The lights were white, they looked like glitter balls or fire flies buzzing around.  This happened right over my neighborhood and the lights moved over the base and then over some mountains in an eastern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/23/10 19:30|Tumacacori|AZ|Chevron|1 hr 30 minutes|Phoenix Lights Over the Tumacacoris, Southern AZ, Sept. 23, 2010:  Both Amber Light Lines and a Chevron.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77970.html|104|ndxe201009| Phoenix Lights Over the Tumacacoris, Southern AZ, Sept. 23, 2010:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both Amber Light Lines and a Chevron.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Beginning at 7:30 pm MST, I saw single or double bright and large amber lights low over the horizon in two locations miles apart, over what appeared to be the Northern Part of the Tumacacori Highlands in Southern Arizona, North of Cerro Pelon.   It is possible that the display occurred further to the WNW of this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I viewed the display from 2 miles east of the Tumacacori Mission.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 7:45 MST, I saw one of the double light displays (the one to the North, from my vantagepoint over the northernmost point of the Tumacacoris) turn into a huge line of at least six or seven amber lights, sequentially lighting right to left over 5 to 10 seconds, and then vanish.   Within a minute or so, this sequential display repeated.   A minute or so later, a second light display began at the more southerly site, and also repeated itself.  This site appeared to me to be just North of Cerro Pelon in the Tumacacoris.   Until 8:10, I saw no more sequential light displays, and went inside to search Phoenix Lights on the Internet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 8:40 I returned outside, and at 8:42, at the more southerly site, saw a huge chevron shaped structure with at least three amber lights defining it appear and then slowly rotate its point upward during about 5-7 seconds, and then vanish.   A low flying plane or helicopter then headed rapidly southward at low altitude along the Santa Cruz River, skirting the entire Tumacacori Highlands from far northern end to southern end.  At 8:44, a very bright white light/shooting star like object dropped from the sky near the more northerly site, but from higher altitude, falling vertically and not across the sky like shooting stars normally travel.   At 8:45, a single amber light appeared at the more northerly site.    At 8:52, two sequential displays of amber lights occurred in a short time frame at the southerly site.   At 9:07, two sequential displays of amber lights occurred within a short time frame at the northerly site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior to noting the single and/or double bright amber lights on the horizon by 7:30 pm MST, I had already noted what I presume to be a military helicopter sitting in position high over the central Tumacacori Highlands.  It is not unusual to see such helicopters here in the Borderlands every night, but what was peculiar was the exceptionally high altitude of this helicopter.   As the amber light display started and continued, the helicopter (with its flashing white, red, and green lights) slowly moved NW towards where the southerly display occurred, and then seemed to hover well above it.   The helicopter disappeared behind (West of) the Tumacacoris at about 9:15 pm MST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather conditions here this evening were cloudless, winds were reported as calm at reporting stations in Amado and Tumacacori, and the humidity was about 70-75%.   The display started after the moon had risen, and the light from the harvest moon was exceptionally bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In sum, I believe I witnessed at least two large UFOs some miles apart, at two distinct sites, each lighting with 6 to 7 bright amber lights in a perfect line.   At the more southerly site, I also once witnessed what appeared to be a chevron as it moved through three dimensions, and I am not sure if that UFO is the same object that appeared to be a line at the southerly site, or a third distinct UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To speculate, because of the unusually perfect atmospheric conditions, and because of what I believe was a military helicopter overhead before the display began and apparently tracking it, I would surmise that the military was conducting some secret low altitude tracking or communication experiments.  The moonlight might allow them easier observation/recovery, and the good atmospheric conditions might minimize extraneous perturbations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer is a retired Ph.D. research scientist, highly specialized in the micromolecular, NOT the extremely macromolecular.<n>

It was moving from left to right across the sky. It appeared to be in the upper atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know for a fact it was not the space station because this was moving way to fast.

It was a clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had noticed that on clear nights I could see the moon set over the ocean from our bedroom window, so I pulled open the shades as I was getting ready to get into bed.  I saw a bright orange, (like fire), round light, which I thought at first was the Coast Guard Helicopter, heading north, towards our house, up the beach.  I called out to my husband to look out the window in the living room, as I watched it coming north, very quickly, then straight out from the house, then continue to head north up the beach.  At that time it seemed like it was actually farther away than I first thought, and as it continued north, it faded away, similar to the way a satellite does.  The light traveled from south when I noticed it, to the north when I saw it fade away, in a total of about two or three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then I saw another one coming again from the south and heading north on the same path as the first one.  I again called out to my husband to look.  He turned out the lights in the living room and stepped out onto the deck, with the binoculars, to watch it, and I followed, trying to get my camera turned on and the lens cover off.  The second one was just as fast as the first, followed the same path, and there was no sound that we could hear over the waves of the ocean.  There were no flashing lights, only the one bright orange light that appeared to be all around, as it was not like a head light or tail light.  My husband said it looked like the fire from a hot air balloon through the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, the second one disappeared just as the first one had, and then a third one followed.  I could never get one in my site with my camera, and no more came after that, that we know of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We reported our sighting the next day at the Coast Guard station in Depot Bay, but they did not know what it could have been and suggested that perhaps it was the after-burner of a jet.  That would not have been possible as far as we could tell, because it was not at the tail of something.  The whole thing appeared to be at light or a fireball, not a front or head light, or a tail light or engine fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The observation lasted maybe two minutes.<n>

I looked up in the sky and I seen what looked to be a fireball, it was moving slow at first, it almost looked as if it grew in size or came closer.  I then called my mother on my cell and told her to look outside, her and my sister both observed this object. The object changed direction abruptly and sped up a little, it didnt appear to be moving at a fast rate.  I then proceeded to phone my father and told him to get his range scope, as I was telling him this the object either shrank or it went upwards out of the range of my vision.<n>

I spotted two extremely bright &#39;stars&#39; in the sky.  One was on top, and the other was below it slightly off to the left. I found this odd because it was a cloudy night, and no other stars were visible. Also these were the brightest stars in the sky, and I have never seen two stars in that position, especially that bright before. They were the color of street lamps, a orange-ish, yellowish color. I pointed them out to my friend. I kept driving for less than a minute, than I looked back at them and I noticed the bottom star had moved. I told her to watch it and tell me if it&#39;s moving.  She started to scream and told me I needed to pull over and see this. So I pulled down a street just before 11 mile in warren MI.  The top star was gone and now this objected was moving away from where it used to be. It was a smooth triangle shape. There were three lights on each corner of it. The lights seemed to be! dimming in and out, but not really flashing. The top one was white and the side ones were light blue-ish and I think light reddish. The body of it was blackish. I could make out a black body because the sun wasn&#39;t fully set at this time. it moved north for about 30 seconds till the lights faded away and it was gone. I looked at the other star and it was dimming. What happened next was the dimmed light became the point of this object and then the whole body of it emerged, it looked just like the first one. It followed the same path and then disappeared in the same spot. At this point my friend was very shaken up, so I started to drive off and I saw another &#39;star&#39; in the sky moving. It was moving around at a pretty steady but fast pace, but I lost sight of it in the trees. I&#39;m not sure what I saw. I just want to know if anyone else saw what we saw.<n>

Then the light got bigger and much brighter.  Then it slowly descendwd, stopped again for about 10 minutes or so then was seen through tree tops before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was cold enough to wear my jacket to but not yet winter, I remember that. There was a small amount of clouds in the sky on this evening and they were all a little ways apart from eachother. The person I was walking with said what is that and pointed at the sky. When I looked up I saw what appeared to be a rectangular like object about the size of a small plane with a triangular like top to it that came to a point. This craft looked like it was inspecting this one cloud. There were no wings and no noise. It had blue, green and pinkish streeks coming from the back that looked kind of like what a rocket has behind it when it takes off yet it was not thick nor looked like it was exhaust of anykind. The object was a light metalic silver. It moved around this cloud in such a way and in such speed unlike anything any of our normal average citizens know about that exist in ! our world. Then it just went POOF! Dissappeared just like that, right in front of our eyes. I do know we have nothing that can just dissapear in the blink of an eye, a flash of a second right in front of you. If I could draw a picture it would be imagined like this. The cloud was pretty small and the object went up, stopped, went down behind the cloud, back up through the cloud, then around it and back up then stopped, hovered by this cloud touching the edge of it with its nose and then back behind it, then it went back out and hovered for a second then POOF, it dissappeared. The movements were not of this world. It did not make turns. It just went up then down then through and around and out, its hard to explain it perfectly how it moved. It just did not move like any jets, planes, rockets we have and IT WAS NOT A DAMN WEATHER BALLOON either. There is no EXPLAINING this one away for me. I was not scared at what I was seeing I was amazed. I have always thought they existed ! and I had the privledge of actually seeing one which I am very! proud o f being able to say I have seen one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Shortly after going outside she called me to the door and asked what is this and pointed towards the Air Force base NORAD, I looked up and sitting above the base was what looked to be an oval shaped object it was very large about the size of a tank or bigger and it seemed to just be sitting there in the sky. It was very shiny and the color was dark to med grey  but metallic. We watched it for about 10-15 mins, the clouds soon moved in and the object vanished behind the mountain. We both looked at each other and said o my god that was a UFO and agreed not to talk anymore about it. On 09/25/10 we went over to a friends house, after chatting for awhile one of our friends asked if we had seen anything werid over NORAD a couple of days ago we both looked at each other and laughed and our friend said what!, and started te! lling this story about this craft he had seen over NORAD just days before. Soon after we shared our story and after listening to the friend we soon discovered that all of us witnessed the same object on the same day over NORAD. I want to add that all 3 of us live very close to Cheyenne Mountain where NORAD is located and all of us are 100% sure that what we witnessed was not a plane or any type of known air craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They turned abruptly and disappeared.  They were white and appeared cloudy looking.  They were shaped like boomerangs.  The sky was clear and crisp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd thing is though the whole time we were out this morning my dog was acting very skittish.  Kind of the way a dog gets during a thunder storm.  The sighting lasted approximately 10 seconds.<n>

And went to take a picture but in the viewfinder i saw these round yellow eyes, and took a few more pictures thinking since it was motionless it was just a reflection.   Well we went around the block came down the sidewalk and by the time we got to the corner there was something moving in the sky over the south side of the town square.  I took a few pictures thinking i got nothing  but found when i got home and enlarged them that either three objects that were yellow lights or one object with 3 lights was moving eastward along the rooftops of the south end of the square.   There was also on our way home a transformer blown up i guess, its sides were ripped open, this up on the power and light pole.  Id never seen one so damaged and took 2 pictures getting a fairly clear one the second shot.  Again at the time we saw nothing clearly we c! ould identify due to the glare of another light. on a pole close by,, but it seemed like something was hanginging out the side of one of them.   I figured since it all seemed roughly the same color it was just a shattered section of the transformer sticking out oddly.  but again after looking over our pictures in enlargement we found in this image a very clear head like shape, that had large black eyes , and a tiny nose and mouth, its skin seemed very close to that of the transformer, maybe more tan, also the head seemed very wide at the top and the chin was tiny. anyone seeing it would think it was looking down at us.  during that evening and two others of the same week we got photographs of objects at different positions over our town square, one very close to and in the same image with our courthouse tower.  It had a coppery color and looked like a curved shape with a red light mounted on it in the corner of the photo.  It reminded me of a fin.  Also there certain lights! that went out as came down the sidewalk, there order was inco! nsistant , and one was the doorway light to a shop i at one time rented.  3 lights in all went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We went to get more firewood and upon walking towards the firewood, we both looked up to observe a white, fuzzy cloud like object with a clear nucleus flying across the sky in a slow manner, but faster than a regular cloud.  There was no wind nor any other objects including clouds in the sky.  We observed the object traveling S/W until it faded and disappeared.  Approximately a half hr. later, we heard on Fox News that National Security had launched a rocket with a &#34;secret&#34; satellite onboard.  Not sure it the object we saw in the sky was the satellite or the rocket, or maybe something other.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have vast experience in making observations and interpreting them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On September 20, 2010, at about 9:15 pm; I was in my backyard letting the dogs go before bed.  I looked up in the North East direction in the sky and observed a large object moving very slowly in the sky, towards my direction.  The object was traveling low in the sky and appeared to have a large fireball tail trailing it. I could see aircraft in other parts of the sky at this time, and the object appeared to be lower than some of the aircraft that I observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my fiancé to come and look at this object because it was like nothing I have ever seen.  It was huge, the size of a comet; which was my first guess as to what it was.  As we continued to watch this object getting closer, the flaming tail turned white and then began swirling around the object.  The object then came to a complete stop, as the white trails continued to swirl around it.  The object itself appeared round and glowed brightly, like a star.  It then simply disappeared right in front of our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The nature of my job makes me a skeptic of sorts.  I have heard of many UFO sightings for which there have been logical explanations.  However, I cannot think of anything that occurs in nature or that is manmade; that would perform the way that this object did in the sky that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It really looked like a red meteor! I expected, that as a meteor, it would quickly burn out.  However, it then stopped and stayed in one place, still red. Meanwhile the tail had vanished, and looked like a satellite.  Then it went out altogether.  Could it have been a satellite burning up?  Then why would it maintain it&#39;s red bright color, with no tail, then extinguish?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I expect that many others also saw it, as it&#39;s a pleasant night and many folks might head out for a stroll.<n>

I keep my eye on it driving by the open strawberry fields with not many cars on the road. It looked like a burning fireball in the sky as it got closer to me in my direction.It was coming it at around 500 to 1500 feet ruffly 3-10 miles out closing fairly quickly.  It looked like a bomb fire maybe the size of &#34;America eagle&#34; commuter plane. It floated slightly up and to the left then began to change shape and less concentrated. It then stretched out a very long hayleys comet like tail like a tapered cylindrical tube.  The new dimensions of the craft were ruffly 5x to 7X its longer then its brightest point as a flaming sphere.  I never took my eyes off of it as i was going straight down a almost empty 2 line rural road.  It appeared to have a light redish yellow haze or residue.  The end of the tai! l hung about 15 to 20 degrees below the natural horizon it then appeared to lose its tail and consolidate it&#39;s self into a perfect sphere still retaining its shape. It began to get smaller and smaller until it was directly over head and about the size of an average star. It still had a gray yellowish mist that slowly faded away.  I then reached the beach area going down 5th street and could nolonger see because of the street lights. a min later i was home looking in the sky for it reappear but it never did.<n>

I thought, oh there&#39;s the jet... as I kept watching, I noticed it really wasn&#39;t moving... just kind of hovering, and there were colored lights pulsating around it, green, red and white. I grabbed my camera, but the pictures were coming out blurry. I got the video camera, and took some footage with that, hoping we can enhance it later on the computer. I also grabbed my camera again, and took a short video with that too. I watched this thing just hang there in the sky, pulsating, for over 40 minutes... around 12:50AM there was cloud cover and I could no longer see whatever this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, as an added twist to this story, my ten year old Son had told me, and my Husband that he kept seeing a flashing light out side. He seen this flashing light out side the same room I seen my sighting from later that night. Our Son told us this at about 10PM just as my Husband was about to leave for work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have reviewed the video footage, and indeed there is three different colors of light at this one point in the sky.<n>

It disappeared momentarily and reappeared for an instant moving horizontally. I did happen to DVR the event and reviewed it. it&#39;s just a light with no discernable features but didn&#39;t look natural.

The moon was 3 days before full-moon, the skies were clear and I looked up at the stars.  A single unidentified object was seen moving in an erratic fashion to the Northwest of Vero Beach, FL.  It was about the size and color of a bright star, but I could not determine the distance or actual size of the object.  It is unknown what produced the light of this object (whether it was light, the propulsive portion of the object, or if it was a reflection from the light of the moon).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My gaze was at an elevation of 30-35 degrees, so it was easy to observe without straining my neck.  I would estimate it was over central Florida, in the direction of Kissimmee/Orlando but it could have been closer or farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For almost 35 minutes, I watched this object.  At times it appeared to be stationary although it might have been moving directly toward or away from me.  Movement consisted of circles (sometimes clockwise, other times counter clockwise).  It also moved in a straight line at times and sometimes moved with a sudden forward motion, then slowing, then pulsing forward again.  The movements I observed were more suggestive of how a boat might move in the water, rather than any kind of plane, helicopter, or other aircraft.  It was also able to move in one direction, stop briefly, and then move at an angle varying from 20-270 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was particularly interesting was that this object never moved any further than about 10 to 20 degrees in the sky from the area where I first observed it.  It remained in that area until I left with the cat for the evening, at about 0040 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other observers with me during this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.

It came out of nowhere, literally.  It was obviously propelled, moved in a straight lateral line, and was not sitting there or hanging stationary like a flare.  It was moving Northeasterly and glowing a bright brilliant red (i.e., as if the sky was on fire).  It moved swiftly towards the lake and Canada. Event lasted 20 seconds until object was too far away to see any longer. It was obvioulsy moving in a manner which indicated a purpose.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It didn’t fly fast, but more like floated fast across of us.  I would say that it was about 13 feet high in the sky and 500 feet away, it was very close.  I don’t know the exact size of it; it was very hard to tell. There was only one flying object.  The object did not look like anything I’ve ever seen before or made of anything I’ve seen before.  Almost like it was made entirely of pure energy and light, but there absolutely was something there in the core of the flying object.<n>

I was heading east and right past Underhill Blvd I saw 3 orange lights in the sky in the shape of the big dipper.  I thought it was cool that I could see it and then realized that it isn’t the big dipper!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then 2 more came into sight.   I pulled over to the left in a parking lot and got out of the car to look.  They were moving slowly in the same pattern – the 3 of them and the 2 trailing.  They were bright orange, not flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three men came out of a restaurant and I asked them what they saw and they said “I guess it’s a plane” I said are you sure, they said no, but they don’t know what it could be.  It had to be about 10 minutes since I first saw them and then they slowly went out of sight towards the North sky.  There might have been a glow around the edges.  I took out my phone to take a picture, but the parking center sign was too bright.  It was ve! ry cool!<n>

When I was reaching for my phone, the sphere started to move. I became stuck like no way this thing is moving.  I could yell for everyone because I was stuck on stupid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m seeing soemthing that noone will ever believe. The sphere went pretty fast traveling south at a steady pace. It traveled across for just under a minute, when all of of sudden it just disappreared in the sky. By the time I called my kids it was gone.  Just like that.  This is no joke.  JUST GONE.  I have never seen such a sight.  JUST GONE  Not even when we going camp and the sky is lite up with stars.  Every night, I am outside looking around.   Already purchase 2 telescopes because what I saw was amazing.  There was no government testing of objects that night.   There is no way we could have something that advanced.

It was still daylight so whatever it was that produced the light must of had a lot of energy.  These three lights began to act irratically judging the distance to be at least a mile away I&#39;d say they were going from one side of the sky to at least 5 football fields over in a matter of seconds.  Due to the horrific crash there were at least 2 helicopters covering the scene.  They could have been news choppers but they were black.  As the lights flew around the choppers it seemed like the choppers were trying to follow and make sense of the ufo&#39;s.  after bouncing around in the sky one of the lights became brighter and appeared to go from a standstill into full speed with no acceleration time on chopper tried to follow as it left the light returned to its similar associates.  Then about ten min after first noti! cing the anomolies the lights circled one another and just as the other one had burst into full speed before all three proceeded to exit though fast their line of exit was not straight up but probably at a 60 to 70 degree angle assuming the horizon is zero.  The helicopters followed furthuring my assumtion that they were not their for the crash.  Maybe the lights led the drivers eyes of the church van away and thats why they crashed.  There were also documented sightings of these lights in ny city around the same time my friend and I saw the ufo&#39;s I am a 25 y/o male with some college and 20/20 vision.  My friend Is a 26 y/o male with a college degree 20/20 vision and this is the first encounter either of us expierienced<n>

He was pointing west, up in the sky. At first I couldn’t see what he was talking about …then as it moved closer I could see a dark object slowly moving from west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it might be a balloon just drifting in the wind but the object wasn’t gaining any height. It was moving horizontally to the ground. It was a black object against pale grey clouds. It seemed to be rotating and had a slight wobble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object passed overhead and continued to move eastward. Neighbourhood trees eventually blocked our vision of it. I’ve seen balloons pass overhead and they usually rise straight up till they are out of sight or burst. This travelled across the sky at a constant distance from the g! round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know how big it was or how high it was off the ground. It was kind of oblong, dark black in colour, rotated with a slight wobble, no noise was detected. It stayed below the cloud level. One person tried to take a picture of it on his cell phone but it wouldn’t show up. It was about ½ to ¾ of my thumb-to the first knuckle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really makes this odd is that we had just been talking about strange things that go on in this world…..and then we see an object float by….hum<n>

It looked like a helicopter possibly but was kind of small.  As I got closer, there were birds flying around but the object was stationary in the sky.  Even closer I could see that the object was indeed not moving and was just hovering 20-25 feet above the center lane of the highway, about 1 mile north of the Lehigh Station Road exit.  I drove right under the object, and kept trying to stare at it until it was above my windshield and I could not see it anymore.  It was metallic and may have even shined in the sun light.  Its shape was almost like a rounded jacks piece, or one of those hand-held massagers that has the three prongs at the bottom.  I immediately called my friends to explain what I just saw and that I would not have called if it was not something I thought was important.  I later contacted various news stations in the area, and they confi! rmed with me on September 21, 2010 that at least one other had seen a shape similar on September 20, 2010, and that two city police officers had also seen the object.  over the weekend in an adjacent county (about 30 minutes west) witnesses claimed that there was an object hovering over the highway and cars were actually pulling over because they thought it was a plane trying to land on the highway for an emergency.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Although it seemed to not be moving it began to dim and we noticed a shadow on the right side as though it was turning the light dissapeared and my wife could see a tiny dark dot where the light was. I was driving so i could not see it .  We pulled over and it was gone.  This light was very bright like jupitor the sky was clear not a cloud in the sky and the sun was to the left of the object.  We know it was not an airplane or satelite. If anyone else saw this light please get in touch with us.  Thanks<n>

I thought this was a significant location since the mall parking lot was empty, and illuminated by lights and painted lines on the concrete, almost like a landing runway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was glowing yellow, and flying very fast from west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound, and the object moved faster than a plane, which generally appears to fly at a steady pace which can be tracked in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object moved as fast as a baseball thrown, and no noise was evident, as a plane or helicopter would, and was unlike anything I’ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A striking characteristic was how it moved in the sky.  It moved in a very deliberate manner, slightly jaunty, as if surging and exploratory, not with a real sense of direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it was so unusual and captivating, it was similar to seeing a rare, strange animal, with its color and movements.<n>
9/18/10 03:00|Butler|MO|Sphere|one hour|brass colored sphere  moving around power pole and transformer,  next to Convenience Store at corner of  our block|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78007.html|169|ndxe201009| brass colored sphere  moving around power pole and transformer,  next to Convenience Store at corner of  our block<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was up restless and wandered through the house in the dark, and looked out the north side window of our living room.  It looked normal except it looked like a bat or bird was moving around the the power and light pole at the corner of our street half a block away.   But as I thought about it I realized it couldn&#39;t be a bird it was too large only a hummingbird could hover this way and this looked volleyball sized or possibly basketball sized.   I went and got my camera and  pulled the curtains up over the rod so they would be out of the way.  and made sure the light in the kitchen was off, so there was complete darkness in our house,  I put a piece of tape over the colored light on the front of the camera and looked closely at the window condition, it was still clean from a recent cleaning inside and out.   And that really didn&#39;t matter because if what i was seeing was a water drop it wouldn&#39;t have been floating around between the Casey,s Convenience store,! and the transformer pole and light pole next to it.     I even got my tripod and set it up to eliminate as much  movement as i could.   In the view finder i could see a brass looking ball the size mentioned, it reflected light like something metal,, and had a faint circle on its side that had a dot on it,, or at least it appeared that way.   I watched it taking pictures without the flash, and got maybe 5 descent  shots of it, finally  up close to the pole not touching it, or being supported by it, and it looked like a faint line had come out of it and was touching some part of the transformer equipment, I don&#39;t know its workings so that is as detailed as I can get it was touching the bottom back side of one of the canister shapes mounted there.   It stayed in this position the rest of the hour to hour and twenty minutes I watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A day later that transformer or the light pole failed and our block was in darkness for 4 days.  since power was returned I&#39;ve not seen anything odd when I got up during the night to check on it.  But there has been other activity around that spot  I&#39;ll put in a separate report.<n>

They both described the object as a small light that was changing colors around its edge.  Binoculars were used to better identify the object.  It was round about like a pea at arms length, but had different colored lights around its edge that stock out on stems as he described it, resembling the shape of a tic, those little insects that dogs get when walking in the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was to the north; just to the right of due north and up about 20 degrees from the horizon, the next night the same object was seen again but slightly more to the right of the first sighting.<n>

All we could see was a triangular shaped object moving from north to south.  It was extremely low and quiet and with no lights at all.

As I was standing there facing west, I clearly saw 3 red lights in the form of a triangle moving towards the NorthEast.  It is extremelt clear out at this time.  I sprinted inside and looked at the clock to confirm the sighting time. 9:56pm.  I literally jumped out of my shoes and scared the hell out of my wife who was brushing her teeth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few moments, maybe 60-70 seconds, she found the video camera and I raced back out side, her following as she had seen them the Halloween night as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Much to my dissapointment, the lights were noplace to be found.  My wife gave up looking after a few and said call her if I see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Standing outside, I noted the conditions. What stood out right away to me was the complete lack of air traffic in my area.  There are always planes somewhere to be seen in the sky.  Nothing. Not a sound. After about 10 mins I gave up but I did notice that as I was coming in, planes began to appear again. It stood out because it was so odd to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Night was crisp (65deg) and skies were clear with a light haze to the west.  I believe Mars was in the western sky low on the horizon.  But the Lights I saw were clearly much closer and could no way be interpreted as being a part of what I saw.<n>

At first I believed someone had set off a firework display, but immediately realized something was odd about it.  For one, there was no sound at all, no pop or boom that would accompany a firework going off.  Also it lasted only a split second and it was very condensed. It did not expand and then slowly fade out as a firework would.  This was simply there and then it was gone as if it winked out or it was moving very fast.  I only saw it for literally a second, but i remember there were multiple bright colors of lights. I would describe it as a smear in the sky of bright pink, green, blue, maybe others.  Individual points of colored lights of various brightness. I just kind of stood there a few moments waiting to see if i could see it again.  I got in and out of the car a couple times to make sure i wasn&#39;t just seeing a reflection or something.  The sky was clear and there w! as no lightning or any weather effect that I could determine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize a split second sighting is essentially useless, unless somebody else happened to see something odd last night, but whatever it was, it struck me as odd.<n>

Also the flight pattern was extremely irregular; very slow and went from low on the horizon to very high. Never touched ground.  Also it either hovered very high or flew in a straight pattern for an extended period because it didn&#39;t look like it was moving.  Finally, after hoovering or flying straight at a high altitude for a few minutes the light shot off 5 to 6 smaller redlights in a slow succession like chaff from a plane. The light  began blinking aggressively less than ten times and completely disappeared from sight. Two people saw the light in the sky however this will be the only report.

We stopped at my son&#39;s friend&#39;s street and they were talking. The sun was setting in the West and my son told me to look at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw about 5 things on the sky that looked like comets. They all had a tail, multicolored (but mostly red)but they were not crossing the sky, at first they were all still on the same area of the sky where the sun was setting (we couldn&#39;t see the sun anymore)and making short moves. Then one started heading east and flew right over us but it was really high on the sky to the point that I couldn&#39;t tell what shape the body actually was, my 10 year son said he could see it and it was a round body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another one headed south and the other 3 stayed in the same area where we first saw them, 2 of them completely still like a star but with the comet tail flying,the other one started going up and the tail got longer. Then one of the two that were still at first started going down and then they both changed direction and the one that was going up started going down and the one that was going down started going up and it looked like they were going to crash against each other and I was expecting something like a firework explosion from it but at the last minute they passed each other on paralell paths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my husband on the phone and was waiting for him to walk up to us and I lost track of one of the 3 remaining objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other 2 stayed there still again but as I was talking to my husband they disappeared as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband said he saw the one that went east and I took 4 pictures with my cellphone, the first picture was right after one of them flew east and the remaing 4 were still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second picture was of one of them flying south and 3 remaining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third picture has the 3 that remained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fourth picture has one of the 3 starting to go up right before they played chicken and that was the last picture because at that point I called the house phone to tell my husband to come see it. My phone&#39;s call log tells me I dialed the house at 19:44.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very overwhealming feeling because I believe that there is life outside this planet but I never thought (in my wildest dreams) that I would ever see one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

July, August, and September were very dry months so I was watering the grass.  As I sat there, an AF passenger Jet flew  by heading  towards Wright Patterson AFB.  The Jet was painted pure white so I assume it was an AF air ambulance.  It was at about 3000 feet altitude heading slowly towards the base.  I watched it for a long time until it became a small spot as it neared the base.  My eyes and sight then returned back to the spot where I first saw the AF Jet.  Then I noticed a circular disk hovering above the path and displaced somewhat to the south from the path the AF Jet followed towards WPAFB.  Perhaps at an altitude of 5000 feet and 1000 feet to the south.  This disk was only about 40 feet wide but it was thick and the edges were very rounded.  It appeared to be metallic and aluminum-like.  There was a disk-like hump in the middle of and on top of the thick bottom disk.  And this disk had very w! ell rounded edges also.  This whole structure was pitched down at an angle of sixty degrees as if it had been viewing the AF Jet that flew by.   Now here is the kicker about this craft.  I could not see the rear portion of this craft because it seemed to be hidden by the sky.  This craft seemed to coming through a hole in the sky and I could not see the rear of this craft.  As I watched it I said to myself “ this is interesting.”  Then after awhile, it appeared that the craft moved back into the hole in the sky.  I could not see it anymore.  I then watched this position in the sky for a long time but the craft did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This object made no noise at all, no trail or anything else you would expect from an aircraft.  We know the differance between commercial, military aircraft flying through the sky high or low, fast or slow but this was truly something of its own and amazing!  It was a dark color, grey or blakish.  Chevron or triangle shape.<n>

However, it was still close enough to determine that the front plane was a passenger style or cargo plane, and that the planes behind were definitely delta-wing jets.

9/17/10 03:00|Cambria|CA|Light|45-60 seconds|2 BRIGHT and FAST Round Orange Lights over the skies of Cambria, CA on September 17, 2010|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77881.html|186|ndxe201009| 2 BRIGHT and FAST Round Orange Lights over the skies of Cambria, CA on September 17, 2010<n> <n><n> <n><n> Allow me to preface this by saying that I have always been a skeptic of things existing outside of our own world, understanding or knowledge base. You see, I am a practicing Physician, a licensed Medical Doctor, and with all my decades of schooling, I have always been taught to prove things with the Scientific Method, for otherwise, if they cannot be proven or repeated, they do not exist and hence, cannot be called a Law, let alone a hypothesis. My life changed dramatically, however, this evening; September 17th, 2010 at 3 am…the day I am writing this narrative.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog was yearning to go outside. I had been awake working on the computer at the time, as I usually do my best thinking in the evening, and I did not have to report for duty the next day. Finally I said OK to my dog and we proceeded to walk outside and into the South-Easterly direction where we always begin our walks. The house faces East and we walk to the right and down our street. It felt about 60 degrees Fahrenheit. There was no wind or breeze at the time and there were no clouds or fog at all in the sky at that time. Less than 2 miles East is the Pacific Ocean. There are pine trees in our neighborhood and some reach 70-100 feet high. However, we had most of the trees removed from around our house due to a recent incident where a tree fell and caused massive damage to some structures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening, upon reaching the bottom of my driveway, I could not help be see a bright orange “ball” in the sky in the South-Easterly direction. It was peering through a distant tree at the time, but it was so bright and beautiful that it could not be ignored. I stopped in my tracks and said aloud,” is that the moon…how could it be so bright or so orange when it is that far above the horizon?!” I moved to my right to get a better view from the street and without any tree in my way, but I did not need to move far as this light was moving…and fast! Within about 3 seconds I saw an identical light behind it, perhaps slightly smaller than the first. Mathematically, one cannot calculate their exact distance away from the Earth, their rate of travel, or their absolute size in space without having a known reference point, something relative to the object in question for reference, or some other known variables to calculate the equations in physics for time, space and travel. Both o! f these were traveling in the exact same path, the second appearing perhaps just slightly lower in the sky than the first. There were no sounds at all…no breaking of a sound barrier, no evidence of combustion or fuel consumption, and there was no sun or moon to be seen anywhere in the sky. These two VERY bright things were being lit-up from within, and not from any reflection or refraction of light. In fact, these were so much brighter than anything I have ever seen in the sky before, including the evening Space Shuttle and rocket launches that I have gone to see in the evenings of the past. I could not make out any specific structure, shape or entity, however, these two “lights” appeared round in shape. I have taken years of Science classes, including Physics and Chemistry courses in college, and I have always taken what I would consider to be an amateur interest in Astronomy by taking elective courses in college, reading literature on the subject and watching scientific p! rograms that relate to our knowledge of the skies above. Note ! that I h ave no problem with my hearing and that I do wear glasses to see afar. My spectacles are always on when I walk my dog so that I can see if there are any wild animals in our path so that my dog does not chase them or get sprayed by a skunk! I had a flashlight in hand but I never turned it on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Naturally, I began to question myself…”Is that a planet, a star, a jet plane, a rocket or missile or, because of its speed, is it a meteor?!” There was clearly no trail on either “light.” There were no sounds at all…no cars, no planes, no thunder, no sirens or city lights, as I am in the woods here! All I could make out in the distance was a very slight crashing of the waves along the rocky shoreline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen this color orange, except maybe when I burned some certain gases and elements in the Chemistry labs. They were so bright (and beautiful)! Both were about the same intensity and hue. Again, there were no trails and no sounds emanating from these, or from my surroundings otherwise. I concluded during my observation that these were not meteors when the second “light” went out for a period of 3-5 seconds and then came on again, just exactly as bright and intense as it went out! It did this two times before I ran to get my wife inside the house. How could a meteor burn out and then come back again just as bright as it went out, and with the same exact trajectory?! The skies were clear and nothing obstructed my view at this time. The second “one” was actually following the course of the first exactly! The one in front stayed illuminated during my entire observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have NO questions in my mind in terms of “what” I was seeing. Please note that I do not take mind altering drugs and that I was not half asleep at the time. I was able to see the clear sky perfectly with my glasses on, as they correct my vision well enough to see planets and constellations without a problem. On occasion I get a reflection out of the corner of my glasses, but this was no reflection! These 2 “lights” were in the sky heading North-Westerly, at such a great speed and without a sound! I even peeked my eyes over my lenses to be certain that I was not mistaken in any way! It was total darkness and in fact, I had not turned on the front porch light and no lights or motion detectors from the neighboring houses were on or activated at that time. Further, there was no question that these were in the sky and traveling at speeds faster than I have ever seen anything fly across the sky before! This includes NASA’s Space Shuttle and the Blue Angel’s Boeing F/A-18 Hornets! at an air show when they make their final pass over the crowd!   I had to have someone else see this! I hesitated for about 25 seconds or so because I did not want to leave them or for them to go away or vanish without me witnessing it. Faster than I have ever moved before, I ran into the house waking my wife with a great sense of urgency. Within about 15 seconds, she was in front of the house with me but by then I did not see them anymore. So I told her to run and follow me alongside the back of the house, in the direction they seemed to have been going, and she did. She confirmed part of what I saw, however, below I will have her document her own experience of what she witnessed tonight with her own eyes! What I saw at that time, from the side of the house, was one bright orange light right through the dense tree that is growing in back of our house. Normally I can’t see a star, let alone a planet, through that pine tree on any other night due to the density of the needles on the tree! These “things” were appearing to travel in a direct! ion over the Pacific Ocean and in the exact same course, or trajectory, where I would expect them to be if I were to extrapolate their path within the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In conclusion, this changed my life forever because now I know that just because we cannot prove something with science, doesn’t mean that it can’t exist. As a scientist, I want proof that whatever these were, they were either something created by humans i.e. the government or some private industry, or that they simply were not. Please! Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) is about 90 miles to the South of me, so I am most curious if they had any activity, documentation, recordings, launches or sightings at that time…3 am on September 17th, 2010. It is fresh on my mind and I shake when I type because I have never been so moved, perplexed , amazed and astounded in my life before…all at the same time! This defies everything I have ever learned and witnessed in my 44 years of life and wonder. I have seen the electromagnetic effects of the earth in the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) and this was nothing like that! As I search for an explanation, I know VAFB is not scheduled to la! unch the Atlas V until the 20th of September.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please recall that I witnessed two of these “things” and that the one “in back” flashed 2 times at about 5 second intervals during my direct and uninterrupted period of observation. There were no trails, no sounds and no vibrations of any sort. There was no fog, no cars, no clouds, no search lights, no ambient or direct lights and my vision was not impaired by anything for a at least a full 50 degree visual angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Without knowing the height of these, the speed is difficult to calculate or imagine. If it was within our atmosphere, I would expect that the sound barrier would have been broken at that rate of travel. Above our atmosphere, even a rocket traveling at a thousand miles an hour could not cover this amount of distance across the sky in that period of time. And they were not going up. They were going across. There were no blinking lights nor any other colors that I could see. I most sincerely hope that somewhere the skies are being recorded at a telescope in California, Arizona or Hawaii that might have documented this event! Or perhaps someone else who witnessed something in the skies this evening will come forward with their independent observations just as I did. My patients may call me crazy and the scientific community might label me an outcast. But I am certain about what I saw and I can’t even conjure up an explanation for this based upon a scientific paradigm. Also, the ! probability of something like this happening to me again in my lifetime is negligible. Therefore, I was compelled to write this down and document it with the greatest degree of accuracy as soon as possible so that unlike a dream, this will never fade from my memory and nor will it become distorted over time or subject to any pressures of embellishment. I am thrilled that my wife got to see a fraction of what I did, but I wish that someone else could have seen this entire event the way that I did. Certainly there was more to it than just what I saw. But I am grateful that I saw as much as I did!   Thank you for taking the time to read about my experience. Having a lot of credibility to lose within the medical community, I would never put my career on the line to make up such a story, nor do I (obviously) have anything to gain from reporting this information. I simply want to share my life-changing experience with those who are curious or who have experienced unusual phenomenon in their own lives. But most of all, I hope this might bring some awareness to the scientific community that we are very likely not alone and perhaps this can act as a catalyst to raise more questions and trigger more research and investigations into finding out if there is a simple explanation for this…or not! My wife reports her brief encounter below. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On September 17th 2010 at approximately 3:00am my husband ran into the house screaming that I must come outside immediately. He did not say why. I followed him to the front of the house where he told me to look into the sky where I saw nothing. He then ran alongside the house, tripping on his way up the steps, where he pointed into the sky. I was on the 2nd step and I saw through the tree in our back yard, a VERY bright, large orange light. I took another step up the stairs and moved my head to the side to follow the light and I saw it without the tree in the way. The total time was about 3-5 seconds for me. It looked like it was going up in the sky and in the direction over the ocean. Then it was gone. I told him what I saw and he told me his story. They matched. We took a walk right after that with our dog for about an hour. We looked in the skies, talked about what we saw and we watched about 5 shooting stars within that hour of our walk. This color orange was unlike anyt! hing I have ever seen in the skies, both in terms of hue and intensity. It was as intense as that of the orange part of a blowtorch. It was moving fast. I can’t say if the light went out or it disappeared from my viewpoint.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There we no lights whatsoever.  It slowly passed above me and kept on it&#39;s course.  I went inside the house and wondered if I should wake someone and if it would be gone by the time I got them outside.  I was not afraid but was very excited at the same time.  I do not know if it was military or not,  I do not believe we have the technoglogy to power such a massive object without it emitting some sound,  I heard absolutely nothing from this object.  Unfortunately I did not think to run in and grab the camera.

My brother and I dropped his friend off and then stopped and watch the lights some more.  They increased out of nowhere to 6 and then formed a V shape in the sky.  I took pictures on my phone but they did not come out.  These were not planes it was as if they were standing still.  They were not street lights or anything like that.  These things were HUGE!<n>

I and my family (5 in all) witnessed seeing a disk like object in the Southwest sky quarter way up and above the mountains between Ehrenberg Arizona and Blythe California.  We are in a valley rimmed by high desert mountains, so we have very clear night time astronomical viewing.   This was not a military jet, blimp, planet or star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon had not come up yet so our desert skies were very clear and dark. The object was in the direction of the old JPL Labs site (closed) in that area.   My husband saw it first and called me out to look. I called the rest of the family to witness and brought out my 7x50 binoculars to see it better.  Through the binoculars, we could see it was disk shaped, red rimmed with two bright yellow glowing lights.  After about 15-20 minutes, it disappeared. A colored drawing of what we saw has been sent.   Shortly after, I saw three blinking lights moving into the same area from slower moving military aircraft.  From past experience from seeing such blinking lights, I believe these were military helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared again 9/17/2010 in the same general area in the sky but higher up.<n>

I was about to merge in the the line that allows you to get on to I-10 east. I was inbetween the pass right by Raging Waters. As the valley view of pamona opens up, I always look at the hill on the other side. I notice that the hill only has trees in the shade. I think that is kinda odd everytime i see it. So I look up and see this flashing light. I am not sure how high above the hill it was flashing. It was high enough in the sky to be a star. plus it wasn&#39;t the right time of day to be seen. It flashed about 10 times then I never saw it again. It happened so fast that I could get the passanger in the car to even see the light. I text my friend a message right then and there to get a time stamp.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/16/10 15:00|Fort Wayne|IN|Oval|less than a minute|oval or disc-like shaped metallic object that was moving faster than a plane horizontally across the sky|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78090.html|193|ndxe201009| Thursday September 16, 2010 at approximately 3:00 p.m., I was driving north on Broadway with my 13 year old daughter in the front passenger seat.  She was gazing out the window when she suddenly shouted, “What’s that?!” and “Look!”  She kept pointing east and up beyond what I could see from the driver’s side of the car.  She described what she saw as an oval or disc-like shaped metallic object that was moving faster than a plane horizontally across the sky before it accelerated and shot off in a vertical motion and disappeared.  The sky at the time was clear with few clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/16/10 05:15|St. Louis area|MO|Unknown|10 seconds?|Long-distance viewing of something that seemingly defied the laws of physics???|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77857.html|194|ndxe201009| Long-distance viewing of something that seemingly defied the laws of physics???<n> <n><n> <n><n> I typically go out on our back deck to smoke a cigarette / drink coffee after waking up.  This morning, I noticed what appeared to be a &#34;star&#34; of some kind in the southern horizon, positioned at roughly 45 degrees elevation in the sky.  It was basically a small, faint &#34;dot&#34; and dimly lit with bluish-white light.  At roughly that same instant, I noticed the object was moving; my immediate half-awake thought was &#34;airplane.&#34;  But just as quickly, I realized there were no flashing navigation lights visible.  For the next few moments, it continued tracking roughly southeast at what appeared to be a relatively CONSTANT rate of speed.  It then suddenly accelerated out of my view, appearing to travel &#34;straight out&#34; away from my location - and into space?  Upon contemplating what I just observed, there seems to be no other plausible explanation:  (1)  Orbiting objects (such as the ISS or satellites) would simply continue tracking across the horizon; appearing from one side of your vision, then disappearing at the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (2)  Celestial bodies (comets, meteors, etc) or man-made objects launched / in orbit around our planet, are generally subject to the laws of physics.  Therefore, their rate of travel would be relatively constant, exhibiting a &#34;smooth&#34; and gradual movement across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (3)  Considering the above, I have never observed any such object &#34;suddenly accelerate&#34; to what would have to be an incredible (almost incomprehensible) speed.  I have seen the space shuttle / ISS in orbit, and roughly know what 17,500 MPH looks like from the ground; at first, this thing was going about that fast.  Moreover, and the part that really has me scratching my head; this is the first time I have observed anything seemingly travel AWAY from our planet and into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very strange indeed, and I don&#39;t quite know what to make of it...<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/16/10 04:00|Piscataway|NJ|Unknown|8m|Object seen over Interstate 287 in Piscataway NJ|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77860.html|195|ndxe201009| Object seen over Interstate 287 in Piscataway NJ<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 09/16/2010 at 4am I was responding to a page from work when I looked out of my hotel room window from the 5th Floor at the Radisson Hotel in Piscataway and noticed a brilliant white-lightish-orange light suspended approximately 1000 feet over the highway (287) that runs just along the hotel.  My distance to object was 1000 feet horizontal and 100 feet vertical based on nearby billboards I used for reference.  The light was stationary at first.  It appeared like an orange sodium vapor light if viewed at much closer range, about the size of a quarter held at arms&#39; length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I come from a family of pilots, and had an 8 year-long job in a family-business involving lighter than air aircraft.  Based on prior experience, I was surprised that I could not hear helicopter sounds from the direction of what I was seeing.  I assumed this was State Police or a Lifeflight directed toward I287, so I kept watching to see what was going on.  I could hear the airflow coming from the cars on the highway.  Otherwise, there was complete silence.  About three minutes into the viewing, the object shifted to the right side by 50 feet from my perspective.  Again, I was surprised because the precision of the movement, without wobbling or wavering as is usual with hovering helicopters, was unusual.  There was still no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Intrigued, I kept watching for another 5m.  After 5m (now it was 04:08), the object began a slow arc over the highway and moved soundlessly deeper into Piscataway and out of my view.  It took 2m to complete its travel outsaide of my sight.  About 20m later, I noticed a helicopter occupy the same spot and follow roughly the same trajectory.  However, this time it was clear that this object was a civilian helicopter because I could see its navigation and collision lights clearly.  I also saw a passenger jet aircraft during the same time at a higher altitude, with its collision and navigation lights as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not get a firm grasp of the shape of the original object.  Its lights did not illuminate it well enough.  It seemed to be the size of an MH-53, which is on the larger side of helicopters and is the size of a small bus. I took about 30 pictures of the object and the follow-on helicopter with my iPhone 3G.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light Details:  Front of object: steady forward directed white-orange-lightish light, similar to an orange sodium vapor streetlight Back of object: three lights; red, green, white Pattern: in back, two white pulses (either side of a boom or fuselage I could not see) followed by a red pulse underneath Time observed: 4am - 408am 9/16/2010<n>

I opened my window and there were no engines or motor sounds. As I was watching it, the lights dimmed and began moving away and the lights completly went out. I kept watching and finally went back to bed, only to look awhile later and it came back. I dont know how much longer it stayed there, I ended up falling asleep. It just sat in one position with this light going towards the ground. Really weird. It looked like it might have been over Trumbull CT, the town next to mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was the moon but something looked off.  The circle was slightly oval, seemed lower and was brighter than the moon.  Plus half of it was dark.  It looked like it was divided in half.  Half dark and half golden - yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside my house and a few minutes later looked outside and noticed the “moon” was higher and farther away.  I ran to get my mother.  When I came back outside the object was orange and moving very fast across the sky.  By the time my mother arrived outside the object was just an orange flash behind the trees.  The object then disappeared from sight.  The object was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I submitted another report to NUFROC a few minutes ago about seeing a HUGE reddish – orange fireball in the same area.  I accidentally entered 1 &amp; 2 witnesses because I was going to submit these reports together but changed my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I declined to be contacted for these fireball sightings because there is nothing else I can add.  I have seen an actual “spaceship” on different occasions in the same exact general area and reported them to MUFON.  I just decided it might be a good idea to report to both sights.  All of these sightings occurred about 25 minutes from Scott Air Force Base.<n>
9/15/10 22:45|East Greenwich|RI|Triangle|1 minute|Three bright white lights in a triangular shape - with a red pulsing light at the rear moving over highway - LOW|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77878.html|198|ndxe201009| Three bright white lights in a triangular shape - with a red pulsing light at the rear moving over highway - LOW<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling home on 95 northbound out of East Greenwich Rhode Island last night after spending a few hours taking my jeep down 4x4 trails.  As RT.95 merged with RT.4 northbound, I noticed a strange arrangement of lights in the sky just east of me, prob. less than a mile away, and less than 1,000 feet above the tree line heading N.E.E over the tree line at Apprx. 10:45 p.m..  As being a Rhode Island resident all my life, and always living less than 12 miles from T.F. Green Airport, Im used to the normal Airplanes and Airliners either coming in on approach, or taking off from that airport - and seeing the normal navigation lights - the strobing blues or greens.  But this was different - It was a light arrangement of which i had neverseen before,  And It Shocked ME !!  Three Bright White Lights forming a triangular shape, with a pulsing red light at the rear of the object that directly in line with the two outer white lights which were actually strobing in sy! nc with each other !!!  I have never seen this kind of arrangement my entire life, and it baffles me ! I am so interested in seeing if anyone else had reported it, and i also felt so compeled by this event that i drew an exact picture as i remember it from the event using windows art. If you would like to view the picture i can email it upon request, and also if you could help me out on what this could be if it wasnt a ufo, I would really appreciate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks !!!<n>

They were in the area of this very bright narrow diamond shape which i first thought was just a bright star until it moved downwards, This went on for approx 45mins.  I have tried to photograph them but think it may have been to dark for the picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were in an area of isolated land over the moors and fields, the very bright light literally just disapeared along with the smaller lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very clear night with no clouds in the sky.<n>

It flew very close to the moon, but was still the brightest thing in the sky, and it was not fully dark out.  I looked to see if the ISS was due to be here tonight, but it was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe it was a satellite, but it was so bright, and appeared to be to low, but that is a judgment call on my part.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Seconds later I noticed a bright white light in the north over the trees heading south. I watched the light waiting to see strobe lights flash.  No strobe lights were seen. The unidentified object was very bright.  Like when planet Venus is exceptionally  bright. Only this light was moving at a steady rate.  Then the light stopped dead in its tracks.  Hovered for a couple of seconds then started getting smaller.  It turned into a red dot and disappeared.  I believe the illusion of it getting ‘smaller’ was really the object going directly up into space, hence it getting smaller.  There were no sounds coming from the unknown light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

By then , it was so far that it was about a dot!  They said the didn&#39;t see any thing so I went home about 5 min. before dark would come!

They were a dull white and about as big as a star, but we thought they might bve an aircraft at a high altitude since there was no sound and no abnormal flight patterns.  We then saw an aircraft that seemed to appear by the northern horizon and fly over us at a steady, slow speed (about 100-300 mph?)to the southern horizon before disappearing.  It was a triangular shape with three red light at each point, they didn&#39;t blink.  It was odd because the aircraft made no sound and it seemed that the flat side was facing the direction it was flying, not the point or tip of the plane, like how a plane flies.  After it passed (about 10 seconds) we did not see any other objects like it nor those small white lights (that were also flying at the same speed and direction) in the sky.  We think it might be a type of stealth bomber, because som! e of its characteristics match the UFO, and we also live close to an air base.  If you can tell us of any stealth bombers in the area that night it would be greatly appreciated.<n>

The first thing that came to mind when I saw the shape was a stealth bomber but as I studied it, the two bottom corners were rounded like a boomerang and it came in on the back to a flat edge (not full triangle). The coloring is hard to describe. I had to stare really hard to make out what looked like a camo pixel design of dark greys and blacks, but not painted, more like each color was a separate panel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying fast enough that this only lasted about 30 seconds (despite its size) before disappearing into the dark after passing overhead. During the entire time I had not moved and felt like almost numb as I watched it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have searched UFO sightings and military planes but nothing comes close to what I witnessed in shape and size for ones posted online are either a complete pointy triangle shape or skinny boomerang shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am posting it now because of another recent UFO sighting (not the same type unfortunately) has increased my interested in this phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to discuss this with someone who has had the same sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We thought they were just flying by us until another nighbor pulled into the parking lot and informed us they were orbitting around us in a circle. If one would fall behind the one in front of it it would speed up until it was back at the same distance behind the other as the rest. They were intelligent and the best way to describe them is like airballoons with the fire flicking inside the balloon, or like orbitting sky lanterns. Red and flickering like candle light and one of the  most amazing things we had ever seen. The entire neighborhood was outside starring up at the sky for a good hour or more. The police were called by one neighbor and we were told it was embers from firework show that had ended, . . . two hours prior! I pointed out, embers would be floating through the air  like feathers, these were orbitting until the last cycle when instead of going a! round the circular path they had been traveling for a whole hour before they just kept floating off to the east until the last one faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It started from the horizon and flew up and slightly south. I watched this light move at a constant speed. As it got higher it started to fade and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I searched the sky for the object trying to see if I could locate it anywhere else in the area I had last seen it. From the time I first viewed it to the point of it disappearing was about 10 seconds. When looking for the object I noticed a new white light in the sky above the location where the other light appeared. I also noticed 3 smaller lights flashing below it flying north to south and south to north. These smaller lights flew seperately and independently. They would disappear and reappear in a different location and flew slower then the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the bigger light for about 30 minutes as the smaller lights flew under it. The bigger light did not seem to move at all. After 30 minutes the bigger light faded to a smaller red light, still in the same location. The smaller lights disappeared one at a time just before the light turned red. The red light then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I didn’t pay too much attention to them until I wound up on long straight road where these 3 glowing orange spheres caught my attention. They were noticeably brighter than all the stars and the glow of a full moon in a clear nights sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 2 other fainter red glowing lights which I figured were planes to the left of my point of view from the 3 glowing spheres. I was driving east and had a good view of the horizon for a while where I couldn’t stop glancing up at the glowing orbs in the sky. I thought that was a strange occurrence and tried to make sense out of what those were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back at my house soon after seeing the spheres and took a quick shower. I left the house right away and headed to my friend’s house. I pulled up on top of this hill in my neighborhood and the orange glowing balls were in the same location as when I saw them about 25 minutes prior. I stopped my car and watched these orbs as one stayed in the distance and the other two started moving in towards one another. They get close together when the left one starts to ascend as the one on the right starts moving back to where it was. I paid particular attention to the closest light and it was so bright that it had a glow to it that almost looked like a crown on top of the burning light. They continued to make these strange maneuvers until I left about ten minutes later. I then drove to my friend’s house and pointed these orbs out to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see these orange balls move over the tree lines and move about the sky fairly quickly compared to any planes or helicopters. They certainly weren’t limited to moving in a straight line or having to take a while to change their trajectory. They thought it was a weird sight to see, and my friend had said that he also has seen strange lights in the sky in that eastern direction before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went inside and I left later on in the night. I had my eye out for the lights when I left but they were nowhere to be seen. I haven’t seen them since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Composed 9.26.10<n>

As I walked to get his bowl to give him food I observed a bright red light in the south west sky in the Williamston area close to I-85, that looked to be several thousand feet up,  and thought it looked odd to be so bright.  The ball of light  was the size of a golfball and later marble in relation to a star.  As I continued to look at the light it then dropped within a second to just above the tree level and hovered,  I then ran back to my back door and yelled for my wife to come look so that I would know that I was seeing the same thing.  She then looked and only saw the object hovering and commented on how bright it was.  As myself and her were watching it the light then emitted another light below it which was bright orange in color.  The lighted object then began to dance from left to right up and down! My wife became frightened after she realized the same thing I! apparently did and knew that the way it was moving could not have been a helicopter or airplane due to the speed and movements it was doing.  The object then dropped lower below the tree line into a heavily wooded area and I could then see what looked like several bright headlights shining through the trees.  As that happened I could then tell it appeared to be within a mile of my house.  I then called my neighbor and another and asked for them to come outside and see what we were seeing.  As all seven of us were watching it, the object then lifted back up very rapidly several hundred feet and disappeared.  It then reappeared across the sky for a few moments and “danced” as it did earlier for five to six minutes.  It then disappeared for the second time.  We watched for almost two hours to see if it came back, but it did not.  It was officially the weirdest thing I had ever seen!  I did contact our local news agency and asked if they received any calls asking about the obj! ect we all saw and they stated they did receive more than a fe! w.  I wi ll be watching hoping to see it again!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

When I looked to the west southwest, I saw a bright white light in the trees.  I ran to get a pair of binoculars and when I returned, it was gone.  So I watched to see if it would return and it did, but this time it had moved to the right of the trees and was an orange color, then it blinked out.  Then I saw it again and it was white and orange in color, but now was back in the trees, and then it blinked out again.  It kept doing this for about 20 minutes.  The last time it appeared was just left of the trees and it was a very bright white light and then it blinked out and that was it.  There was no sound either from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was not a meteor, as the light appeared constant and controlled. I pointed it out to my girlfriend but she couldn&#39;t track it before it faded out. Curiosity had me scanning the sky at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a minute, a brighter light caught my attention near the treetops, due north. She saw this one. It was a pure, bright, white light. More intense than any star or planet currently visible. We watched as it appeared to rise from its position and move across the sky towards SE, only not in a straight trajectory. The Baton Rouge airport is tens of miles west of my house, and an airplane (at or near cruising altitude) was also apparent, serving as a means of comparison. Seeing that the light was not fading, I quickly went back to the door of the house to get another witness. The man saw it, and wondered out loud what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The craft disappeared from sight instantly when it reached passed the right side of the mountain. The color of the craft was light silver on top and dark silver on the bottom. The craft appeared to be saucer shaped/disk shaped. When I saw the craft move, it appeared to move up and down slightly as it progressed in it&#39;s direction as if it was hovering. The craft was about half way up in elevation compared to the mountain peak as it was moving left to right. No trails or lights/beams were seen. I did not see any other craft after the one described above disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To high to make an identifiable shape as it seemed to constantly change shape, but best described as diamond shaped. As it came south it seemed to slow to nearly stationary before picking up speed and going east towards Battle Creek.  During the time I watched various high altitude aircraft pass beneath the object and all those were easy to identify as different types of aircraft (airliners, jets, planes landing at Kalamazoo&#39;s airport).  Best guess if object was possibly over 50,000 ft.  Object was either extremely white or silver metal reflecting the sun.  It&#39;s possible with the way the shape seemed to shift it could have been a weather balloon, but with the altitude it seemed to be at doesn&#39;t seem possibly that the human eye should have been able to pick it out.  Didn&#39;t have any ability to opportunity to photograph object.<n>

I almost felt like, whatever it was, detected I was watching and it immediately attempted to go away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There did not seem to be anybody on the farm at the time, and everyone on the freeway were driving, and there most likely weren&#39;t anyone looking around, unless a vehicle had passengers looking around, so I may very well could have been the only one to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time, there were no ready crops or anything visibly planted yet.

It was going WNW towards the Pacific Ocean. There was no sound, no lights, no vapour trail, and no sonic boom, even though it was gone over the horizon in 6 seconds, the large size of it made it appear to be in slow motion. It was flat black, but a bit luminescent.  I am a retired Hwy Patrol Officer and a credible witness.

A church sits right off the 4 lane road on the left at the top of the hill.  I was in the passenger seat &amp; looked up.  What I saw was just pure confusion.  My first logical thought was &#34;IS THAT A PLANE GOING DOWN?&#34;  The object was completely &amp; steadily vertical.  Simple, very uncomplicated plane type shape.  Vertical, cylindrical, 3 lights.  Shadowy aura, blurry background; almost computer pixel-y looking.  More 2-d than 3-d, if that makes any sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was right above the church&#39;s roof.  The driver did not want to stop so I kept looking in the rear view window, I could still the 3 lights behind the trees as we headed down the hill.  I convinced the driver to turn around,.. we returned &amp; there was nothing out of the ordinary.  It was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was almost like an apparition.  Because we were SO close to this thing it was extremely confusing as to why neither me nor the driver could focus our eyes on it.  Everything around it was clearly there, but looking at this thing was just too much to process.  It was very jerky, fast moving - but at the same time not moving at all.  Seemed very busy, the energy was busy.  But it did nothing at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was too stunned &amp; confused during &amp; afterward to even THINK of grabbing my camera out of my purse.

I saw what appeared to be an airplane fall strait down from the sky about 4 mile&#39;s in front of me. As I traveled closer I realized that it had fallen in or around Mountain Island lake.  This object appeared to be an airplane because it had blue, red and white flashing lights.  However I was unable to determine the shape. Several motorist were pulled over near hwy 16 exit for Mountain Island lake and more on down.  There seems to be several wittiness.  Nothing on the news.  Also there were several aircraft in the area. One appeared to be following it at the time it went down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9/13/10  12:31 or 9:31 PM<n>

It did appear to be exhibiting some side to side movement, rather than flying in an exact straight line, but not like a zig zag or anything, more like some one driving that keeps moving side to side in their lane, just slightly off of center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched till it disappeared behind tree line<n>

I looked up to observe the stars.  I noticed the big dipper and looked for the north star.  What I thought was the north star seemed to have flashing red and blue lights.  I thought it could have been an airplane (I do live near an airport). but it seemed to just hoover.  It moved from side to side, hid be hind trees, then started to fly away, but then again just hoovered.  I could see the lights but being as dark as it was could not make out shape or size.  There seemed to be 2 or 3 airplanes chasing after it.  I could tell they were planes from there light patterns.<n>

The object then began making noise consistent with a single-engine propeller driven aircraft.  Prior to the lighting configuration change, the object had been silent.

There were no red or, flashing lights of any sort, just three bright lights in a triangle.  I could not see any actual craft or form, just the three white lights that formed a perfect triangle.  It came from the South and went directly over my vehicle, I couldn&#39;t make a good estimate on how high it was, however, it seemed rather low; the lights were extremely bright, almost like helicopter search lights.  It moved rapidly to the North, and was out of sight just as quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: This was very close to the Sioux Falls Airport.<n>

Now the three of us all looked up and saw 1 ball in the sky,wich, from our view from the ground,had the size of a marble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was white,grey,lightblue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A soft color that made it looked like a pearl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And from our view it moved horizontal,straight line,from right to left.(NW-SE)  The object moved fast,accelerated and with an amazing speed it flew from one end to the other end of the sky.That was in just about 3 seconds!! (There was no sound)  I knew that i had seen a few videos on the internet of this kind of sightings before.The ball looked exactly like an orb as can be seen on orbwar.com.!   My belief...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personally i too believe that it was Human-made. and that there was advanced technology inside.(f.e. because of acceleration) I believe the ball was a cover for both vision and sound for what was hidden inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A result of advanced,American,stealth technology,hidden from public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed of the object puzzles me even most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe that someday in the near future,there will be many more of those balls to be seen flying in the sky.WW III.This war will affect all nations of this planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It will be a chemical war.The preparations are happening NOW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ufo&#39;s like these orbs will not have aliens from outerspace inside, although the human beings inside may look like robots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When people someday will see many balls like these flying in the sky, they will be called ufo&#39;s (unidentified and unknown by most of us) and they will be mistaken for alien visitors from outerspace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (We can destroy ourselves,right? Don&#39;t need green marsians for that)  Ufo&#39;s are examples of HUMAN imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point,tech.inventors found out that not flying saucers but circle-shaped aircrafts are best for space and air travelling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A circle is a sign of perfection and without any corners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why do you think that all the planets moving through/in the universe are shaped like balls?  So this is what i think and believe..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways- i do fear this future of possible,advanced chemical war...<n> <n><n> <n><n> So what do YOU believe???

The way i found out for sure was one day im bringing the trash in at 7:30am and i look up like every day and there was nothing i could see. i was walking back in and i just take a 2nd look and there were 3 thick lines of white smoke that i could see for a very long distance, but within 1min to 2min the very long thick 3 smoke lines had evaporated, it looked like to me. Which brings me to tonight, my brother and i saw the 1st craft in the sw sky like we have seen before at dark. Although we were shocked to see what we saw as it faded in and out from bright light to no light about every 4min during which time it was rotating slowly with dim colored lights under it, colo! rs ive never seen in the air. We start to see it move more aggressivley, moving all directions in very short, fast distances. it looked to us as if it was shivering like when its cold. very fast shakes but never moving to far. It did that for 5 to 6 min then it vanished, we were watching very closley and we took our eyes off it for 3-6sec and it was gone. After 5min my brother goes inside to eat and i keep looking hopeing i will see it again. Around 30min i see it again but not moving or anything it was very still with very dim colored lights on the bottom, i beielive the colors were a orange, red , and yellow, but again it was dimmed down and hard to determine. So i stand there in the middle of the street just looking up. I began feeling more or less tickeling feeling on my neck and back, also a very scary fearful feeling in my head like i was surrounded by sharks and they were taking a long time to eat me. (if you can kinda understand that just toying with me in a way). I! turn around very fast and looked pin point at this bus leagnt! h flat o val about 50 miters from the ground hovering and moving very slowly forward in the direction of the other craft. It had 2 big square lights at each end of the back of it like tail lights but far brighter then anything on the other craft.(the square lights were bright white almost with a hint of blue, cause i starred at them after it passed over my neibores 4 houses down and remember about 50 to 70 miters of the ground. A very amazing thing happened to me when that 2nd craft came in to real clear view, it looked like a oval pancake with 2 jumbo sized helicopter prepelers on it spinning very fast, but 100% compleatley silent. The 2nd craft followed in the direction of the 1st craft untill they became out of sight over some woods and a neiborhood. After that i ran home to think about what happened. and right when i was running across the street 3 small roundish balls, they had like a shinney gray color a color that i could not relate to anything that i have seen before. As i lo! oked at the objects they begain 1 at a time to extend this long bindable rod of some sort, still connected to them. No noise was made by them. They gradually lifted of into the sky at a slow rate untill they eventually were out of sight, took about 20min. So by that time we could hear a load of helicopters moving in that direction. And that was about it, i wish i could remember more, i was just so damn scared and in shock it felt like. I trully regreat to inform you that i have no physical proof. The only proof i kinda have is that it has been returning alot over the month. I promise i will get the evidence you need.

My parents witnessed this with me and no explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well on Sunday night, the object returned, only this time, we were closer to the object.  I noticed it while at the bank, it appeared as 2 bright blue lights, a electric blue in which no other plane I have ever seen has had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife who was around the corner getting yogurt, and then also saw the object. I took care of bank business as I watched the object move east and I thought it was going to disappear.  When I met with my wife a moment later, we clearly saw the object almost directly above us, and thought it was a helicopter until it completed a roll move and was clearly 3 bright blue lights in the shape of a triangle with red and white lights on the belly. In the few minutes seen, the object would roll back and forth showing the triangle s! hape, but then rolling back and appear as just 2 lights.  My wife, my mother in law, and I all stood in awe as we watched the object slowly lower itself as if about to land, I ran to grab a better camera as the shots and video taken on my iphone were unclear due to the night sky, to truly make out the triangle, but the color of the light was captured.  Before I could get back, my wife yelled that it had suddenly dropped at a high rate a speed behind our view.  There are softball fields where this would have landed, but upon driving to the area, the only thing I found were the end of the softball league games, and several police officers in the parking lot.  I assumed they were there for softball boozers, not space invaders.<n>

We watched the light for about 15 to 20 seconds before it dimmed and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was bright white at first I thought it might be an airplane with its landing lights on as bright as it was but as it moved away from us we could not see any strobes or anti-collision lights then it started to dim and was gone.  The time was 0148 UTC or 2028 local time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather is 80 degrees and the sky clear the course of the object would have put it north of Offutt/Sac AFB.  This was no aircraft that I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an aviation enthusiast and amateur astronomer.<n>

It did not appear to be a meteor, and seemed to be inside our own atmosphere.  The actual craft or object disappeared in about a second, but left a trail (much like a jet-stream) that took several seconds to fade away.  The stream did not stretch for the entire length that the object traveled, but only about a quarter of it.  The stream also appeared to glow a bit, like the tail of a comet.  The entire duration of the sighting, from first sight until the stream faded away, was about ten seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was 1:38 in the morning and we were not under the influence of intoxicants of any sort. It was a clear night with no clouds in the sky.  A bright object appeared in the sky and we all saw a bright purple and green ball shoot through the sky at a very high speed.  It resembled a ball of plasma. It appeared to be close to the ground but not knowing size, it is hard to judge. It had what appeared to be a steam-like trail (similar to that of a jet) but had a glowing quality.  The trail was erratic and began and ended at definite points.  The object appeared for a second and disappeared the same as it appeared.  The trail stayed in the sky for close to four seconds and then disappeared at once. It did not dissipate from one end to the other.  It was not a shooting star, or meteor.   It was nothing like any of us have ever seen and strongly resembled the sighting from Naperville, IL.<n>

They were coming from the south and heading northwest and were quite high in the sky and much larger than any stars.  They seemed to be in some sort of flight formation with one following the other in twos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, the photos do not show the glowing spheres of orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered it that could be because the glow is caused by some sort of gaseous matter.<n>

I watched it until my view was blocked by some trees, at which time it was about halfway down to the horizon.  It maintained the same perfectly rectangular shape, and maintained an extremely steady speed in a perfectly straight line, the entire time.  I did not hear any sound from it.  I did not see any sunlight reflections on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Planes from our main airport fly over this area very often, and it was at about the same height and moving at about the same speed as those planes often are.  However, it was definitely a perfect rectangle and not a plane (although it was about the same size as the jets I often see, or maybe a little larger than that), and it didn’t move irregularly at any time as I have seen wind-borne debris do (and th! ere was not even a breeze at ground level at that time).  I was only able to see it for a minute or less before my view was blocked by the trees.  I was formerly a litigation paralegal for over twenty years, have a Bachelors degree, own my home (where I observed this object), and was not ill or under any influence from alcohol, medication, or any form of drugs at the time I observed the object.<n>

I though, holly @5*! it is, so I dashed and grab my video camera and got about 2 minutes of video following the object from its path NW to SE until I lost it over some trees and horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 09-13-2010 I was taking out the trash at about (7:41pm CST)and looked toward the sky where I seen sighting 1 and to behold it was up there again.

I saw an object that appeared to be a plane at first, but it was moving too slow to be a plane and the lights were very different.  There were 3 lights and they alternated their flashes and sometimes all lit up at the same time. The first one came from the East towards the NW.  it continued on until it was past some trees then it returnedheading towrds the NE. Another one came from the NW and there was also another one seen in the eastern sky. These crafts were moving at an abnormally slow rate and abnormally low to the ground.  I dont believe that there would be som many airplane in the sky at once like that, especially as close as they came to each other.  Even after one of the crafts was flying away i could still see it for about 20 minutes way off in the distance with it&#39;s odd flahing lights. One of them seemed to move up and down rapidly with the lights flashing rapidly.  As i returned home i saw anothe! r one in the sky.  While in my bedroom i opened the blinds to see what was out there. I could see one set of the same flashing lights i had seen earlier off in the distance. I saw one come from the right and gradually descend slowly as it went and then it rose up gradually. I saw one more come from the left until it was straight ahead of my view and then it changed directions and went back to the left.  The stars were very bright on this night. I saw a set of stars that looked like a box kite and all of the stars were flashing. The north star was the brightest ive ever seen it.  These crafts seemed to be disked shape but may have been slightly chevron shaped. There were three flashing lights that flashed at different intervals.  All other observers that night believed that those were not ordinary spececrafts that we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object displayed bright white lights in the form of a triangle with non-blinking red lights on what appeared to be short wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of us observed the object and concluded based upon our combined experience that what we saw was not something manmade, obviously a UFO.  Since we have been examining the night sky for a repeat performance, but we agree it was probably a once in a lifetime event.<n>

It hid and revealed itself in the distance while somehow flipping flatly into a triangular shape and it had white round lights all over!  It seemed to just float/glide, and would move very quick across the sky.  We followed it for about 3 miles, and when we stopped in some undeveloped housing area, we caught a very clear view of it hoovering over an empty field.  There was also a plane that was moving at a very fast speed chasing the object.  But as it got closer to it, the triangle would move out of the way very quickly.  We then heard a very strange noise and as we turned our radio down, it sounded like a high-pitched hum.  That&#39;s when we said OH S*** and almost wrecked our car turning around and getting the heck outta there.  We didn&#39;t have a decent camera with us to get any evidence as we wer! e just leaving a nearby restaurant.  We tried taking pictures with our camera phones, but because of the darkness and cheap 2 megapixel camera, we couldn&#39;t see the thing clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first we assumed the noise was emanating from some interference with our equipment, but we ran tests and found that this was not the case.  None of us could pinpoint the source of the sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly,  in the pitch black, we saw a huge bright, white light in the sky.  I looked up and my first thought was that it was a planet or a comet.  But whatever it was moving too erratically.  It couldn’t be a plane either, it was zipping across the sky at an amazing speed.  At first it whizzed in a fast Z-shape pattern before moving into a graceful arc right over our heads.  I could see that it was 3-dimensional, maybe a sphere, but the white light was too bright to know for sure.  It flew over our heads and disappeared behind some trees.  The car soon started and we drove out onto the road to see if we could follow it, but it had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Luckily our video camera captured the whole thing.<n>

When there was a plane comming from the West headed to the East, the object was comming from the North, I could not hear any noise from the object and both objects seemed to be about the same height in the air. When the plane went by and the object was moving South-East there was no blinking lights only what look like a dome in front and it was lite up but not bright where you couldn&#39;t see anything of the object, after the plane moved away from the object and I didn&#39;t see any blinking lights or hear any noise I flashed my flash light at it with four blinks, no response I did it again and about 1 to 2 secounds the objects light went off, and I couldn&#39;t see it against the stars. It didn&#39;t leave a trail and I still didn&#39;t hear any noise, there was a football game going on to the East of the object so hopefully some one else saw it to.

The object appeared to bobble several times while continuing forward.  Without notice or any obvious turns, the object went straight up and was completely gone in a second or two.

It caught my eye because the string seemed too long to be a helicopter or any other craft that I would expect to see flying over the water.  The altitude was far too low for a large plane.  I went on to the store and returned home by the same route within about 6 minutes.  Venus was bright and low in the sky, and the moon was a huge crescent low on the horizon, and I wanted my son to see them.  I went into my house and called my son to come see.  We got back into my car and circled the block so he could see from the same approach that I had.  Then I really noticed that over the water there were lights, red, blue (or green) and white, the white strobing, in a triangular pattern, flying really low over the water.  I pointed them out to my son, and ! tried to make sense of what they could be.  I rounded the corner to my house and parked, and my son went in as he had no interest in the lights.  I walked down to the waters edge to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the triangle formation break up, the two leading points continued forward and the trailing point turned and reversed direction.  That was the first time I would see that it was not a single craft, but multiple small crafts.  It was dark and I could not see the shape of the crafts at all, I could only see the lights.  I watched for about 5 minutes and could see that there were at least 6 fairly small craft, flying over the water, three very close and three more in the near distance.  They flew back and forth, and in random patterns and did not reform the triangular formation.  There was no wind, and the water was very calm, and I could not hear a sound from engines.  These things were silent, agile and maneuvered in ways I have not seen from aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back to my house to get my son to come and see what was going on.  He refused, maybe a little scared.  I immediately went back (this distance is about 175 feet, and the waterway is visible from my yard) to the waterfront and at first I thought they were gone.  They had gone high, and were hovering in a partial circle above the water but also over the land area back in the direction of (but beyond) my house.  I was able to spot them because of the strobing lights, and though high I could still see the red and blue lights as well as the strobing white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple out walking their dog came along and I pointed the craft out to them and told them what I had seen.  They also saw them hovering high, and didn’t have an idea what they could be.  I stayed out for another 5 minutes or so, I could see them easily over the water and as the circle went behind me over land I had to walk around to see them because of the many large trees, but there were at least 6 that I could see.  There may have been more, but I could not see all of the sky from where I stood.  My son then came out of the house after me, so I went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think the first string of red lights that I saw may have been the 6 of them flying in line, but turned so only the red light was easily visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Norfolk Naval Station is directly across the water from where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was able to only detect an outline of the craft as it was directly over head.  No noise except for when it was over head.  The sound was that of wind moving over an object in unison with it&#39;s position.  It appeared to be flying rather low though once it was overhead and I was able to hear the craft it must have been a few hundred feet or yards high.  It moved fast though not so fast that I was able to view it coming in and go over till it was no longer in sight.  It was almost as if it was a drone or video controled like craft.  The first thing that popped into my head was the drone craft utilized in Pakistan.  Anyway, I could not believe that it was happening to me and I was able to actually see this craft as best as I could considering that it only had two lights (front and back) and an outline of the craft along with it&#39;s low flying abilit! y with no real engine noise except for the sound of wind or sort of like a windmill rotating extremly fast though absent of motor noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It looks like a bright star at first sight, but when staring I noticed the cross shape created generally by a star with rays of light was not like this.  The verticle line was bright white, however the the horizontal line had a red glow to it.  It stayed in the same area for quite a few hours and I kept a regular check, I called my auntie who was already sleeping to wake up so that I would at least have a witness, at first she said it was a dying star and thats why it got brighter, and said it was the reason I thought it was moving, but then she too s! aw it jolt suddenly to the side.

As I was looking through my binoculars I saw a bunch of separate individual lights that glittered and kept shifting around. All the while I kept trying to debunk it. I thought it might&#39;ve been a cell tower but it was too high. I just stood there watching the shifting and glittering lights. They would blink off and be in another spot entirely, but in the same vicininty as each other. Wild. I&#39;m not sure what I saw. But, it was definately NOT a reflection of something because the lights where bright in their glitter, sharp and distinct. I do not go out of my way to look for these things.

Due south and located initially in Sagittarius, we spotted two, tiny moving objects heading directly north. The objects were very close together from our perspective, and moved – one in front of the other – about three times the speed of a satellite. We had just seen a satellite about 15 minutes before that, so it was easy to make a speed comparison. Just about when the objects reached zenith, both of us realized the two objects moved closer together and then began moving around each other. This continued until they were out of view, about when they were between Draco and Cepeus.  There was no sound accompanying the fly-over.  Their speed remained constant, and were no blinking lights, though their position relative to each other changed. Their visual magnitude (apparent brightness) was a 4 or 5. The sky was pretty clear – there ! were no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Phoenix.  Orange glow was spotted about 15 degrees west of my location moving easterly at high speed.  It disappeared at about 20 degrees above the horizon in about 5-6 seconds at what I believe was approximately 2000 to 3000 feet in elevation above my home.  No sound or shockwave was evident, no vapor trail, only the sound of chirping crickets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was cloudless and winds calm.  As the object moved directly overhead the neighborhood dogs began barking as if startled and as soon as the object disappeared they stopped.  Airplanes in a pattern for Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport were plainly visible along with the outline of the aircraft and cross the pattern at about 5000 feet at 150 knots.  No outline was visible with the glowing object which I would describe as the glow of a toaster against a wall and not that of a nozzle of a fighter jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed a similar object hovering in the same neighborhood about 2 weeks earlier then moving to the north at a very low altitude and speed as it disappeared behind a home.<n>

It just so happened that on this evening  I was looking towards the NW form my backyard and noticed a light in the distance going back and forth, up and down in a zigzag pattern.  I live near Midway Airport and I could see the planes in the distance and the object that I saw did not have the distinct green and red flashing tail and wing lights?  To my amazement to lasted around five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it was no longer visible to the naked eye, I noticed a bright white light further west and much higher in the sky moving east slowly, again no indication airplane flashing lights as I looked at it through by binoculars.  I followed it in the sky for about a minute before it suddenly disappeared right before my eyes.  Needless to say to sky was completely clear and there was no moon out either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was one of the best UFO sightings I have seen yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It moved slowly to the right and stopped.  They it slowly moved left and again stopped.  I knew this could not be a plane!! I pulled over to the side of the road to watch.  After a few seconds it rose straight up into the air and disappeared.  I have never seen anything like this in my life!<n>

9/9/10 06:21|Lake Panasoffkee|FL|Circle|40 seconds|I saw an object that looked like a Planet traverse the morning sky|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77722.html|312|ndxe201009| I saw an object that looked like a Planet traverse the morning sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning September 9th 2010 at approximately 6:21 AM  I saw a round object streaking across the night sky here in central Florida. I live in Lake Panasoffkee Florida it was a clear sky. I was outside stargazing at the Pleadies  and Orion constellations with my Bushnell Binoculars I was facing due south when out of the southwest came a sparkling object I would say at the 10:00 O&#39;clock position I immediately tried to hone in and adjust my binoculars it was beautiful and scarey at the same time. For almost 40 seconds the object I observed was like a planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just couldn&#39;t believe it. At first I thought this was a huge meteor but the longer I watched it, the more it became clear that this was actually a rogue looking planet with a blue hue to it. I was literally shaking after it disappeared. I was witnes! sing a UFO coming out of the Southwest going through the top right corner constellation of Orion. I ran in the house to call NASA I left 2 messages. I googled where to report UFO&#39;S and found your site so I called and left a message and here is the account of what I saw. It is my 3 rd time witnessing a UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> !st time I was 14 in 1972 in Detroit Michigan my mother and I witnessed a spaceship on the corner of Junction and Toledo it had shaded 2 city blocks and looked exactly like what was the ship on Independence Day Movie I was in shock my mother grabbed me through me up the steps in the house and locked the doors closed the shades and all I could say was mom call the FBI call the Police oh my GOD. She said I was never to tell anyone ever! So I didn&#39;t Until I heard George Noory say he saw it Livonia Michigan my jaw just dropped I knew my mother and I were not the only ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2nd time was several years ago I was driving a semi truck long distance in Arizona and I ! was in Tucson  Arizona watching the triangular shapes of sever! al light s in the night sky I stopped at a truck stop and this time I reported it to the police the lights were there and you could even see them when we got to Phoenix. No sound from them at all. But it sure could move a breakneck speeds. Now I want you to know I don&#39;t drink or smoke but this morning I bought a pack of cigarettes. I am 52 years old and what I have said  is the honest to God&#39;s truth I will take a polygraph Please let me know if anyone else saw this event this morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Warm Regards, From Central Florida<n> <n><n> 9/9/2010 at 8:25 am<n>
9/9/10 02:00|Spanaway (south of)|WA|Egg|aprox 30-45 secons|Strange glowing light and noise from two crafts in Washington state|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78323.html|313|ndxe201009| Strange glowing light and noise from two crafts in Washington state<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early in the morning of the Ninth of September, I was with my friend driving on Pacific Highway somewhere between Spanaway and Mt. Rainer. I had to work late that night and my friend had come to pick me up and we decided to go on a late night cruise. We had done the same thing on a number of nights before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think that it is necessary that before I continue any farther that I explain one thing. This area is populated by two military bases. Ft. Lewis and McChord Air force base, or what is now know as Joint Base Lewis McChord. Obviously military flight and aircraft is very common in the area. I don’t know how many reports this organization receives a year from this area, but I imagine that it is a lot. I also want to make it clear that for reasons I am not going to specify, I can’t say why I, along with my man friend, was out driving through the country on this late summer night. I myself am a member of the uniformed service.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were parked on a side road with very few houses around. We had frequented the area a number of times before. Nothing out of the unusual had ever been acknowledged. While we did experience low flying aircraft, I was always able to identify the type of craft. I think that is why we didn’t notice what happened next until it was almost right in our face. The noise might have been apparent for a minute or two before we noticed it, but I don’t think so. It was not the usual sound of airplane engines or turbulence from low flying helicopters. It was unlike anything I have ever heard as far as aircraft is concerned. It wasn’t exactly so peculiar that it would send up a flag of suspicion right away. Maybe, in the background of the low playing radio and conversation it wouldn’t have been noticed. My mind certainly wasn’t preoccupied with extraterrestrial objects at that particular moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound was definitely the first thing that stopped us in our tracks. It was like a low, vibrating humming sound that you could almost feel, just as much as hear. We both noticed it at the same instant, and as we looked at each other with curiosity and alarm, the first craft came into vision. I don’t want to say that it was a light because, it wasn’t exactly a light. It was more of a glow. A deep fluorescent, greenish glow. I say greenish because; it was almost like a color that I had never really seen before. The light didn’t appear to come from a front, side or back engine source. It radiated from the entire circular craft. In an even distribution, it just glowed. It couldn’t have been more than 1000-1200 feet above us. It was moving at a constant slow speed, probably less than 100 miles an hour. I remember that the light didn’t illuminate the area around us. That was part of what was so goddamn strange about it. This might not make sense but, the light was an intense, ! localized glow. It did provide some illumination on the ground but, not as much as I would have expected. As it continued to move in front of our position we then noticed a second craft approximately two hundred meters behind the first. The glow from the crafts didn’t provide enough light to get a detailed view of any other features that the craft may have had. There was no overlapping shine. They simply looked circular, but not quite a circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened next was what caused us to get the hell out of the area as quickly as possible. With no warning, and no sound of an engine of power source gearing up, both crafts quickly intensified illumination and then elevated their speed to a level that I can’t even begin to estimate. As quickly as they came, they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next few minutes were mostly a blur. I remember getting back on the main highway and gassing it as fast as I could back into Spanaway. Most of our dialogue was attributed to a few words of astonishment and vulgarity. It was several minutes before we started rationally talking about what had happened. Needless to say that sleep didn’t come that night. As we calmed our nerves and discussed what had happened, my partner came to the realization that we should keep the events to ourselves. I thought that was crazy, especially because I know others must have seen the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I write this report now more than a month since the event occurred. I have started the report several times and decided not to send it. I scanned your report data base and didn’t see anything else in regards to this event. I write it now with the hopes that someone else has reported it and it just has not been posted. If this is the case, then you will know that this is not a hoax. If you choose to contact me for further details, I ask that you respect my motives for trying to keep this somewhat confidential as far as names are concerned. Thanks for taking the time to read my encounter, and if there is anything else you could tell me, it would be greatly appreciated.<n>

We were looking at the Manhattan skyline right across the river (approx. 38th street) just North of Empire State Building.  The night sky was completely empty of clouds, but I noticed what originally looked like a cloud moving North to South across the NYC skyline. It looked to be only a few hundred feet over the tops of the highest buildings.  It was moving with more speed than I have seen a cloud move but slower than the speed I usually see helicopters move at over the city.  There was very little if any wind. Although it had a greyish/white cloud-like look, it was formed in a somewhat distinct shape...close to what the hokey UFO saucers are depicted as.  I watched as it crossed behind the highest building in my direct line of sight and it seemed to either dissolve or head away from me (toward the EAST) rather than continue along! the same North to South route it had been on.  The entire sighting lasted about 2-3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
9/9/10 00:15|Key Largo|FL|Light|2-3 Mins.|2 strange lights seen over Key Largo|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77724.html|315|ndxe201009| 2 strange lights seen over Key Largo<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 12:15 am on the 9th of September I stepped outside to have a few drags on a cigar when something caught my attention in the northern sky, it was a low twinkling light.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  I proceeded to scan the night sky.  Just then I noticed two small twinkling lights of the same size in the horizon dancing and flickering.  They were lower than any star or aircraft that would be in the sky.  Possibly only several thousand feet in the sky.  The one light was more toward the north.  The second light was lower than number one and emitting more of a “sparkle” the objects appeared to be circular in shape.  I watched for approximately 2-3 minutes while the lights danced around each other.  From what I saw I am almost positive these were not satellites or any type of terrestrial aircraft.  The bottom light appeared to be glowing or sparkling a red/orange color.  In one quick instance the bottom light stopped dancing and at an incredible speed too! k off into the sky and disappeared within 1-2 seconds.  By the time I had noticed this, the light that was above the one that vanished had dimmed to nothing.  Almost disappearing like the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On several occasions I have seen similar things happen the way it did that night. I live in very close proximity to the ocean.  Other people I have spoken with have seen similar occurrences.  I know there is an Air force reserve base 25 miles north and a Naval air station in Key West about 95 miles south. This is just an observation of an event I witnessed.  There may have been another person across the canal who saw the same thing.  I remember seeing some one outside across the canal only a few minutes prior to seeing these strange lights.<n>

They stay there for like 5 to 10 minutes then fade out for 15 minutes, But then come back for 15 minutes then repeats the process until it wont appear. It only is out some weeks for a couple times over 2 months. Then you wont see it for like 1 month or 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mostly visible on Clifton Hill, because I think the lights from all the business places lights up that part of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is in a line form but the one in the middle is off the line closer to the oneside, and forward a bit. When the strobe lights from the beer garden (on clifton hill) hit it only the middle one will reflect the light, and the others are just visible without the strobe like a orange hole in the sky (The one on the left when facing north is more visible but not bright, If u know what I mean?). It will stay there for like 3 hours straight above your head until it fades away and doesn&#39;t come back. Sometimes it&#39;s like 6:00 p.m, 7:30 p.m, 10:00 p.m, and maybe 11:00 p.m when it first comes out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The channel 4 news did a story on it from the videos that got from on youtube, from like 5-10 different people +.They said it was frozen ice particles creating the delay flash back resulting in a reflection, BUT WHY WOULD U BE ABLE TO SEE THE OTHER TWO WITHOUT THE LIGHT REFLECTING OFF OF IT???????????. It&#39;s like a 1/4 the size of the moon (SO NOT A STAR) , and is not a sattelite visible at night time. They also suggested the balloon incident from the states for publicity, but why do they stay up there perfectly still. No planes crash into wires when flying under them, plus the objects are way to high up to be seen. They must be extremely big for me to see them that high up, and so big in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last sight was a week or 2 ago in beginning of september 2010.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been curious to what this is for like a year, because when seen with your eyes all explainable conclusions are not there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I saw a circular row of orangest white lights about 6 miles away the lights were moving slow and as one light would disapear another would apear. While this was going on I was on the phone with my boyfriend. He ran outside trying to see the lights, but couldn&#39;t from where he was at.  The lights only lasted for about 30 seconds, but left me with chills and almost in tears.  As I got into Maricopa city the lights appeared again about 2 miles away now they had the same affect one dissapearing as another appearing lasting on seconds just like the last, but heading the opposite direction now. Still on the phone I had my boyfriend look for the lights once again, but he still could not see them.  As I arrived home he was standing in front of the driveway waiting for me while pulling into the drive way he yelled at me to hurry and get out he was standing looking right toward the west at lights with the same color same ef! fect about two miles away, I got out and we continued to watch these lights for a couple more seconds which then dissapeared and never came back as we know of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe what we saw was a ufo I never have seen anything like it in my life, and I&#39;m curious to know if anyone else has seen something like this to.

I was approximately 2 miles from exit 148 when I noticed the break lights of a car in front of me slowing down.   I also noticed 3 other cars on the side of the road.  Then I noticed doors opening and people getting out of their cars.   I was in the right hand lane and quickly moved over to the left lane wondering what those people we doing on the side of the road.  It was then that I noticed the lights in the sky.  My first thought was “Oh my God, that plane is going to crash it is way too low!”  Then I realized it was not an airplane.  There were 4 small white lights that formed a diamond shape with one light leading the others.  Above the four small lights, as if forming a pyramid was a much larger flashing light.  The lights were above the tree tops maybe 100 to 200 feet in the air.  The lights were moving west moving very slowly.  I had the windows down in my ! car and there was no noise coming from the lights.  I could see no object definition only lights and I only saw it for a couple second driving by.  I proceeded to pulled off the interstate at exit 148.  I got out of my car to see if I could see the lights again, but I could not.  I quickly drove home and told my wife what I saw.  I watched to local news for any kind of explanation and even checked online for any clues, but there was none  I have a Bachelors degree in Aviation Science and a private pilot’s license.  I spent over 6 years working at airports.  I am very familiar with airplanes and airplane lighting.  Things I noticed about the lights that told me it was not any kind of airplane I had every seen.  There were no red and green wing tip lights.  The flashing lights were at the top where as on an airplane the strobe lights are on the bottom.  They also flashed very fast.  The lights moved very, very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened a little over a hundred miles from Langley AFB.  There are also many navel bases in Norfolk, VA.  We have seen numerous military helicopters flying in our area like the CH-53 Sea Stallion and they are very, very loud.  This is nothing like that.  In fact this is like nothing I’ve ever seen.<n>

Very large and within hundreds of feet from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving with my friend from downstate Michigan to the upper peninsula late at night when a series of adjacent stars became increasingly bright.  I watched the stars for a couple of seconds, and then a unusual figure almost popped out of the sky.  The craft was very atypical of what one may expect from a UFO; I was like watching rhombuses and trapezoids shifting positions, like each shape was its own pane.  Each pane was outlined in a bright white light (about 5 stars thick [in perspective from the Earth]) and the center was  empty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was also very large (about 5 suns in perspective from the ground), and was within hundreds of feet from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled the car over in shock, and the gliding tesseral object stopped. I panicked, and I drove off as fast as possible.  Later, I researched the object I spotted and did not find anything that even looked similar to the one I saw.  The one piece of research that was interesting was on light travel.  The online article states that stars could be used to transport in theory; this craft may of well done that.  Overall, the experience was both scary and ominous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It lighted up green, white and orange and would grow dim, then light up brightly. My husband described it as “electrifying”. I first noticed it in the west of the big dipper towards Elliston. Then noticed it in the northeast part towards Troutville . Last night we saw it towards Elliston and then saw two jets in formation flying in its direction. About 10 mins later it was gone. About an hour later I went outside and sure enough, it was in the northeast part of the sky towards Troutville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have tried taking video of it, but will need to get the tripod out to get a stable shot of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet??

Saw  5 then 6 lights in SW sky .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being startled from relaxing inside the house last evening,we heard a startling long drawn out  thunderous echo outside.  Sound I will describe as between Thunder,a Jet fighter and the Space shuttle that went on echoing for 45 seconds to a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out to investigate looking in the direction I thought the sound was going (N to NW) but I saw nothing. When I turned back past an oak tree I looked into the sky in the opposite direction(S to SW)and saw 5 lights very close together at about 70 degrees. These lights were far off looking and seemingly twinkled or blinked and were different colors. I called my gf out to see,she saw them and was taken back as how unusual it was.  As we watched,it first was 2 pair of lights side by side and one lower.  They appeared to change formation with a 6th one showing up above those. This lasted for a few minutes and then cloud cover made it impossible to see any longer. Also...If it has any connection...about 20 minutes earlier! before all this, a really loud helicopter with a bright spot light flew over and around for aprox 2 minutes and then disappeared.<n>

I was observing the stars when I saw a plane typically fly by in the eastern skies, I recognize the planes immediately because they all have blinking lights and are quite noticeable next to the steady light of the stars. A few moments after the plane passed a small cluster of stars, I noticed one constant and unblinking light that broke away from the group and begin to head directly north.  The light was orange and had the appearance of a star, though it was clearly moving faster than the airplane.  I watched the light continue heading north for about 3 minutes, stepping backwards to see over the trees nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later as I was observing the western skies, I noticed another plane heading south when I see the same orange/star like object heading south as well, it appeared to be closer this time and moved at least twice as fast as the plane it passed.  This was a short sighting due to the number of tall trees in the area, however it was of similar quality to the initial sighting.<n>

The light was large and did not move but hovered in one spot. I watched the light for about 10 minutes and then it was gone!  It did not leave a trail or fly off. It was just gone!  About 5 seconds later it reappeared in the exact same spot.  I watched it until I had to turn onto Route 2 West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued driving on Route 2 West I saw another one in the southern sky.  This one did not move either but hovered there twinkling very bright. It was low and quite large. The sun had not gone down yet – there were no stars in the sky.  Plus it was so much bigger than a star. As I got closer to the Shirley Prison I saw two more appear in the North.  One was slightly higher than the other and to its North. It a very strange way, the higher object moved left to align itself directly on top of the lower one. There is no way this was a plane as they were very, very close to one another. There were no flashing lights as a plane has. These objects were twinkling bright. Like a giant disco ball. Once the two were aligned one above the other, they moved together to the right in one smooth motion and then they were behind the tree line and I lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was alone in the car and wished so badly to have someone to share this phenomenon with! Was I the only one to see it? This is my first experience with something like this and I have been driving this same route home for over 12 years!<n>

At the time I thought it to be the International Space Station as I’ve watched it travel overhead and the brightness and speed were very similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to follow its progress across the sky until when it reached nearly overhead, it disappeared for a moment and then reappeared as two identical lights traveling along the exact same course at the same speed as before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects appeared to me to be in orbit and when the one object became two they were separated by about a ½ fists width at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home from work later that day I checked one of the orbital spotting websites and did see that the IIS was traveling overhead near the time we viewed the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been an avid night sky watcher for over 35 years and in all those years I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before; I have no clue what could have caused what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

9/6/10 21:30|Nanaimo (Canada)|BC|Light|15 minutes|Brilliant light plays hide-and-seek with cruise ship on its way up the Inside Passage to Alaska|2/18/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80039.html|342|ndxe201009| Brilliant light plays hide-and-seek with cruise ship on its way up the Inside Passage to Alaska<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were on a cruise through the Alaskan Inside Passage aboard the MS Norwegian Pearl. It was approximately 9:30pm PDST. The night sky was clear with no mist, fog or clouds anywhere in sight. The seas were calm. Our position which I checked via GPS after the incident and then factored in the time and distance traveled subsequently was about Longitude -128.38.26 W, Latitude 51.02.23 N.  Our stateroom was an outside cabin on the port side towards the bow of the ship.  We went out on the balcony to view the stars and the water.  No moon was visible and the staterooms to either side of us had no outer lights on so visibility was excellent.  According to the ship’s GPS broadcasts over the stateroom TV the ship was traveling at 22 knots with a compass bearing of about 338 degrees.  Ahead of the ship and about 10 - 20 degrees off her port bow and above us, I noticed a bright light heading in a straight line along the side of the ship at about 11 o’clock.  It was! coming directly towards the ship but on a parallel, not an intercept course.  The light was far brighter than any star, and much brighter than Venus on a clear night.  It was also more of a dingy, yellowish white rather than the white or bluish light of stars and planets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no flicker to it nor was there any changing of color.  I directed my wife’s attention to the object and noted that it was approaching the ship but only very slowly; far less than the speed at which an approaching aircraft would have been moving.  We both looked for any sign of flashing strobes or of the standard red/green lights lights on conventional aircraft but there were none.  If I had held a new pencil out at arms’ length the eraser would have just been big enough to cover the object, but just barely so.  The object passed above and along the length of the ship and passed by our position over a period lasting about 5 minutes.  Both my wife and I continued to look carefully for any signs of a strobe or navigation lights but there were none, not when it was in front of the ship, not when it was directly perpendicular to our position and not after it had passed us by. We also listened closely for any sounds of engines.  There were none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the seas were very calm and any wind consisted mainly of that generated by our ship’s own forward motion, ambient noise levels were negligible.  We would easily have been able to hear a plane or helicopter engine.  Since there was no cloud cover at all we had no way to accurately determine the object’s altitude.  I think it was probably no less than 1000 feet and probably no more than 3000, but that’s a very subject estimation.  The object did not block out light as it went by any stars, so we could not verify that there was any darker, bulkier object associated with the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 minutes the object simply faded from view over the course of less than 10 seconds.  One moment it was very bright, then next it was fading, fading, fading, gone.  As it faded out there was no deviation in any direction from its original course.  We looked carefully to see if there might have been some very nebulous, low-lying clouds it might have moved behind, but we could still clearly see stars in the same area the object had disappeared in.  They were not obscured by any clouds. The object simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I stood discussing what we had just seen and kicking around all of the possibilities. We were confident it had not been an aircraft in any conventional sense.  It was completely silent and had none of the normal running lights required. We considered whether or not it could have been some sort of balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fact that we were approaching it at 22 knots and yet it took about 5 minutes to travel such a short distance to get past us suggested it may have been moving in the same direction our ship was traveling only at a slower speed so that we were slowly catching up to, and passing it. Still, we thought, if we had grossly misjudged its altitude, perhaps there was a remote chance it was some type of balloon and the slowness of its approach had been due to extreme altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We discussed what we had seen for about another 5 minutes when all of the sudden the object reappeared in its full brightness at about the same position relative to the ship that it had vanished at.  This time it kept exact pace with the ship and fell no further behind.  It was, however, now moving very slowly on an intercept course perpendicular to the ship.  It took about 2 minutes to traverse a distance roughly equal to the length of my thumb held out at arms’ length at which point its course curved around towards the north and continued on around to the west, then curved back all the way around again to head to the east, and towards the ship, the whole maneuver describing something like a big letter S in the night sky.  Both my wife and I noted this course change at the same time.  It was not a trick of the eyes.  It was clear and unambiguous.  There was still no sound and still no standard aircraft lights of any kind associated with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once again it began to fade from view, only this time the fade was slower.  It took nearly a full minute for the object to fade to the brightness of a very dim star but it was clearly visible the whole time.  Once it had reached this level of brightness it continued to move towards the ship for another 2 to 3 minutes, fairly slowly, and visible at all times.  When it had traveled perhaps twice the distance of my thumb again, it disappeared entirely and did not return.  We waited for several more minutes on the balcony to see if it would reappear.  When it did not, we headed inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed highly unlikely that any type of balloon would have drifted at high altitude past the ship then held position and followed the ship while executing first a 90 degree turn so as to head towards the Pearl, then a letter S type maneuver, only to head back towards the ship again while keeping pace with it. So we ruled out the balloon hypothesis.  There were no clouds any earth-bound light could have been reflecting on.  Chinese lanterns and satellites don&#39;t perform varied aerial maneuvers.  Planes make noise and could never have traveled so slowly, and helicopters make even more noise.  Even ultralights could have been heard, and it is doubtful one could have performed the tight turns this object did and even more doubtful anyone would be foolish enough to be flying one that far out to sea at 9:30 at night playing games with a cruise ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We couldn’t come up with any plausible explanations.  The ship never deviated from its course the whole time so were were not being fooled by the motion of the ship causing apparent motion of the object.  There was no sound, no other lights, and no flickering or twinkling of the object’s light. We ruled out all the things we’re sure it was not. We just couldn’t come to any firm conclusion as to what it actually was.<n>

It was stationary.  I said to myself, &#34;What is that?...It must be some kind of light for one of the playing fields out in the park...but where is the pole to hold it up?&#34;   There was no pole.  As I looked closer I said, &#34;That cannot be a UFO this close to downtown Houston!&#34;  I was within about 3 miles of downtown.  The craft was facing downtown, which is east of the park.  Actually, they were pointing east southeast.  I was about the length of a city block inside the 610 Loop on Memorial.  They should have been visible from Loop 610 as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few other cars drove by, but none seemed to look up or notice them at all!  I looked around to see if the other cars were weaving or pulling over or pointing out the window.  (And no, I do not drink alcohol. I was totally sober, no drugs, either.)   I saw airplanes casually flying above all five of these UFOs and they were commercial craft...on their way to Hobby Airport.  This is how I knew the UFOs were pretty low in the sky.  The one nearest me was gigantic.  It was big enough that if I extended my arm full length from my body and held the hand flat, it would not have covered the craft completely!  I was on Memorial Drive, and there are no shoulders, but there was an unused left-turn cut out, (unused because it was night time and that part of the park was closed).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled in there, cut the engine, and got out my cell phone to take a photo.  I noticed there were four others above the one larger one, therefore they looked smaller, but they were the same type of craft.  They were all facing downtown Houston, and seemed to be in formation. I rolled down my window to take a photo, and when that was done, the big one was gone.  I felt quite dizzy. I looked through my windshield and the big one had moved laterally to my right.  I felt confused, and then said aloud, &#34;Oh, they do not want their picture taken.&#34; I sat there a minute, then I said, &#34;Well, there is nothing to be done here.&#34;  And I drove home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home, I sat down and watched TV and then went to bed.  It was not until later the next day I called anyone to tell them what I had seen, though I posted it on FB asking if anyone else had seen five large UFOs over Memorial Park the night before.  No response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a month or two later, I called my friend, ((female name deleted)), and told her what happened.  I commented that it was so odd that I just went home and didn&#39;t tell anyone at first.  I never called the media or the police.  It just didn&#39;t occur to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Niara is an abductee herself, has written about this kind of thing for the Durango Examiner, and she offered to hyphotize me (over the phone) to see what we could find out...if there were more that I was not remembering. So we scheduled something, and she took me into a light trance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was more that I had not remembered, of course.  I was sucked up out of the car  window and taken away for 28 days, and then returned to my car a few seconds later. (They can traverse/manipulate time, apparently.) I got to see what they looked like. I was taken to another planet. If you believe me and want to learn more, contact me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you do not believe me, I could not care less.  My intent for reporting this is doing a public service.  I do NOT want any publicity, please. I will talk if you want to contact me.  I can answer more questions.<n>

I have been trying to find out how to inquire what would have been in that airspace at that time of night that matched the description of what I saw, which is two bright lights suspended in midair over Willard Bay, just west of I-15, past the Flying J gas station.  The lights were suspended only a few hundred feet off the ground.  The suspended lights did not match the physics of any known aircraft that I am aware of.  In other words, they were not moving in any one direction and they did not make any sound. I passed my cell phone to my wife and asked her to take video, using my Blackberry&#39;s video camera, of what we were seeing.  We were only able to obtain about 30 seconds worth of video footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we passed them, I did see some structure to the lights, but I could not see much, as I was driving at about 70 miles per hour on the freeway.  Upon passing them, my wife and I looked for them in our rear-view mirro! r to continue watching them, and at that point, we were both unable to see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not seeking anything, other than a rationale explanation of what the lights could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  &#34;Curious&#34; in Box Elder County, UT<n>

We were parked on the south side of Ocean Parkway, half a mile west of the entrance to Cedar Beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No lights on the highway made for outstanding sky visibility, so we were stargazing for a while.  I saw a regular shooting star that lasted half a second, with a standard quick tail streak, directly north, at a good 80 to 90 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, about five minutes later, at 60-degrees upward from the horizon, and directly northeast, a pulsating light approximately the width of 1/10th the moon, very bright / white - began traveling in a southeast direction in the sky, maintaining altitude.  The light was definitely not relative to standard aircraft lights including helicopters.  It was pulsating every two or three seconds, switching on, then dimming itself off.  This effect lasted approximately two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about five minutes later, we both saw what we first suspected was going to be a shooting star  - except, it had no tail streak at all, and it lasted for far too long, and seemed to slow down gradually as it finished.  It lasted about three or four seconds.  The object zipping across the sky was saucer shaped, in a way.  There was a red/beige tint to the object, and it appeared to have an outer circle, and a more solid inner circle.  Object was at most – a fifth the diameter of the moon (outer circle), but gradually dimmed into nothingness.  It’s also suspicious because the beginning of the path of this object happened to intersect with the trajectory of the original pulsating UFO’s path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five minutes after this effect, that same pulsating light began moving in a western direction, from exactly the same spot that saucer-like shooting star dropped in the sky. This lasted a few more minutes until it dimmed out beyond our visibility.<n>

It was also flying kind of low, around 500 feet.  I sat down in a bench trying to find out what it was but it was too dark to see anything beside the lights.  i assumed it was in a triangular shape because in the direction it was traveling or hovering had a rectangular shape light and then 2 other rectangular shape light in the back and the red, green and white lights were in middle of the ship. after a few minutes a light came out of the ship, it looked like a fired fly just flying around the ship but it was moving pretty quick and then it banished into the ship after that I just proceded to wal! k home<n>

Four of us, (all but my sister Andrea) saw this last night. It was a very warm night and we were sitting on the deck outs...ide of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a beautifully clear night and the stars were bright. We had only candles lit to keep the bugs to a minimum. My nephew looked upwards at the sky and said, &#34;Dad, what is that?&#34;  At that moment, we all looked directly overhead to the sky. Traveling from the south heading almost directly to the north very possibly heading 360 degrees and 90 degrees off of the eastern horizon, all four of us clearly saw two objects. These two objects were traveling in synchronized formation. The lead object led the second object forward and to the left at a distance of about 500 to 1000 miles, depending on the exact altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects maintained identical course and speed. Both objects appeared to be similar in appearance to the surrounding stars excepts that they were at least 2 times brighter than Jupiter which was in the eastern skies and the brightest star in the skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is difficult to judge the exact altitude of the two objects but they were at least 100,000 feet above sea level and probably higher. Compared to other aircraft in the skies, they were at least three or four times higher. They were traveling at about 4,000 mph or greater.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects flew completely synchronous. When they approached almost directly overhead, they slowed to approximately 1,000 mph together. They then initiated a change of direction, heading perpendicular to the Earth directly upwards out towards open space. They then proceeded outwards at a remarkable rate of speed exceeding in our estimation 5,000 to 10,000 mph. As the objects exited our view, their star like appearance gradually reduced down in a dimming fashion to a bright pin point and then became invisable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had the good fortune to be present at a space shuttle landing at Cape Kennedy Florida. The re-entry of the orbiter into the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is the only thing that I have ever seen that might be comparable to what we saw last night with regard to speeds, altitude and controlled direction of flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four individuals who were together on our deck saw this event last night.  We all are in agreement about the details as discribed. I have been on this planet for almost sixty years and I have never seen anything even remotely simmilar to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are not making any claims as to exactly what it was that we saw or their origins.  We do believe it to be reasonable to conclude that since the two objects were flying synchronous, changing both speed as well as direction, simultaneously, that they had to be communicating with each other.  We also believe it to be reasonable to conclude that the objects were being intelligently controlled.<n>

When we put it in slow motion it looked like we could make out the shape of the object which looked like more of an egg shape on the left side compared to the saucer looking shape when it first came into view.  It moved too fast to be an airplane and I can say that with confidence because Airplanes are not supposed to fly that close to the bridge and also as soon as the show is over you can see an airplane fly through the back with a c! onstant flashing light compared to the constant brightness of the ufo. I would say if we had a 1080 p tv we could get a better view due to the larger pixels of our tv<n>

We observed the object flying due north at what I would estimate to be an approximate altitude of 1500 feet.  What caught my eye was the color, orange.  It appeared to have four cone-like downward projections of orange.  My grandson stated he thought perhaps it was a hot-air balloon.  I pointed out that was a good guess, but as it was traveling too fast (about three hundred mph at that altitude) and in a staight, non-wavering line, not to mention at night,  that a balloon was unlikely.  The thought of an aircraft on fire came to mind when I first saw it, but it continued to travel straight and maintain altitude.   It then dawned on me there were no navigational lights what so ever.  The object disappeared! over the visible horizon (fair lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former U.S. Air Force Intelligence Analyst with a vast knowledge of weather and aviation phenomenon.<n>

He looked at it and then saw several other lights. i looked over and saw them too. about 4 or 5 of them.  We looked to the right and saw a bright light going about 5 times the speed of the helicopters.  it was out of sight in about 5 minutes.<n>

She looked up and asked me what the lights were in the sky.  I looked up and saw two lights moving around below the cloud deck.  I thought they were birds with the sun shining on them.  But they were not moving like birds, they were flying around each other and in and out of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot explain what we saw, but after about 15-20 min they were gone.  I could not get a pic of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were small spots of light moving in a pattern to tight and fast for a airplane or helicopter of any kind.  And there was no sound from them.<n>
9/5/10 18:35|Wells|ME|Fireball|4 minutes|Orange soundless object sceen in night sky above southern costal Maine town in early September 2010.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77669.html|363|ndxe201009| Orange soundless object sceen in night sky above southern costal Maine town in early September 2010.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 18:35 hours on Sunday the 5th of September 2010 myself along with 5 other witnesses spotted an unusual object in the night sky. Our location was at Wells Beach, in wells Maine looking out towards the eastern sky over the ocean. The object appeared in the southern sky and proceeded to move in a north-easterly direction. The size of the object was hard to speculate, the nearest thing I could compare it to would be the size of a helicopter flying at approximately 500 feet above sea level at what appeared to be a half mile out to sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the object was unknown, all that could be seen was a bright orange fire-ball.  The object made no noise, as a helicopter or airplane would. Its speed was too fast for a helicopter but too slow for a jet.  A smaller sensna style airplane was out of the question once again because of the lack of noise. The object did not appear to have made any turns or abrupt movement, it simply followed a straight course for about a mile or two.  Then almost like a dream, the object faded into the blackness of the night sky just parallel to our position.  A second object of the same description, just a little bigger and closer to shore, followed about 5 minutes after the first had disappeared.  The second object also vanished at the same point the first one did.  The strangeness of the object was unmistakable due to the presence of other normal aircraft in the night sky such as planes and satellites.  We were able to get most of the second object on HD digital video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers consisted of four college students, a mother, and one high school student who were all outside enjoying the cool late summer evening by the sea.<n>

At around 5 pm I happened to look up at the sky when I noticed two lights flying horizontal from one another.  They were very bright and obviously not helicopters as they were flying at too high an altitude and not planes as it was still daylight and I could not see the normal outline of a plane.  Behind the first set of lights I observed an identical set of lights flying the same pattern.  The objects also appeared to have a slight wobble to their flight path which was unlike anything I have ever seen in the sky.  Also my co-worker standing next to me he noticed it appeared the lights had sort of a energy field surrounding them.  When the lights reached the middle of the sky at least 6-8 new lights began to appear and the lights began to form different formations in the sky.  The changing of formations lasted between 10-15 min and then the lights vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was around 1:30 pm on Sunday, September 5, 2010.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had noticed shadows of several gulls on the sand,. Each time when I saw a shadow I would look up and a gull would be flying overhead.  The sun was shining, the sky was bright blue and there were no clouds near me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then an enormous shadow loomed above us on the sand - it seemed to swoop with purpose like a machine of some sort.  The shadow appeared to be rectangular and in shape like a huge construction beam or a reaper blade- it appeared 10’ wide and at least 30’ long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It startled me and I looked up but saw nothing.  There was no noise but I felt it was extremely powerful and contained great force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire incident lasted two to three seconds.  The shadow passed over me and continued down toward the water.<n>

I leaned out my front window and smoked a cigarette and noticed a bright object hovering over the Woodlawn area of Dartmouth.  I was amazed and a little scared to be honest. I observed laser like beams leaving the (craft) or object… towards the ground every 20 minutes or so. I then woke my mother who also observed the object that I can only describe as an intelligently controlled craft.  There was no sound complete silence.  The object darted back and forth at a high rate of speed.  But stayed in one general area of the city.  It remained for over an hour. Periodically emitting beams towards the ground.  Then moved off at a high rate of speed towards the sky and disappeared.  The object seems to shift from one color to another and appeared to be saucer shape or oval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Smaller craft was briefly seen come from the ground and merge with larger craft  500 Lights On Object0: Yes<n>

I saw a bright white light at approximate 15,000 ft agl about 5 miles to the north moving to the east.  No sound accompanied the light.  I watched it for about 10 seconds and then it just disappeared.  I went over to the east side of the house and could not find it. Again no sound.  This appreared strange to me as I sit outdside almost every night and watch the sky when it is clear and look for shooting stars.  This was not a shooting star and it was not an aircraft because it did not possess the green and red lights that usually accompany an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another evening about 2 weeks prior at about 4am, I noticed a fast moving object moving about three times the speed of a commercial aircraft moving from south to north at about 39,000 ft.  Twice it emitted a white blast of smoke or exhaust from the rear. I am an uneployed Meteorlogist/Flight Operations Specialist is is well versed with all types of commerical and corporate aircraft having flight planned them and built their routes both in the United States and abroad.  This aircraft emitted no sound either and did not possess the green and red lights that accompany a commerial or private aircraft.<n>

I c ant sleep at night now I&#39;m very afraid. god is our witness to what we saw I have no reason to tell you something that wasn&#39;t true at all and there is no exaggeration in any of what was told. what do we do if we see anything like this again? please help us understand this. in March of 2007 me and a friend were outside talking in ny one night and all the street light and house lights and even his car shut off then turned back on in 1 minute...why?... we still talk about that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was about 11:30 at night and the sky was clear.  This was a white light that would do a quick flash, or blink every 4 seconds.  I timed it and it would flash right on 4 seconds.  It was the same color and about the same brightness as the rest of the stars in the sky. With some binoculars I was able to see it slightly better.  It was moving SSE really slowly and was in the same area of sky for at least 20 minutes. I&#39;ve seen aircraft and satellites move across the sky and this was going way too slow for any I had ever seen.  There was no sound from this.  I&#39;m not too familiar with constellation names, but after looking it up, I think this light was in the same area of the sky as the constellation Aquila, if that helps.  It was hard to tell it was moving at all and until I got my binoculars out, I wasn&#39;t 100% sure it was.  I&#39;m thinking it might be a weather bal! loon, maybe with some kind of strobe light on it, but I wanted to be sure.  When it did light up, it seemed to be lighting something from bellow, kind of the way lighting lights up a cloud.  I could be wrong about that since it would blink so quickly, it was hard to tell for sure.  It also seemed to change brightness.  Sometimes it would seem very bright and other times you could barely notice it flashing.  The brightness seemed to come and go.  I followed this flashing light with my binoculars for about 20 minutes until it went out of sight behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object never seemed to move closer nor further away, staying in a seemingly small flight area. It would be stationary for a few seconds or less and then move in short, quick bursts; up and down, left and right, even diagonally.

I discovered I had the direction of travel of the craft incorrectly stated in the original report.  (It was going EAST, not West.)  I&#39;m also adding the final paragraph which describes an corroboration from another location on the same night, only minutes after my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday nights, I sing onboard the historic Dixie, Indiana’s, oldest paddle-wheel tour boat on Webster Lake in North Webster, Indiana.  Weather permitting, I perform on the top deck of the boat which is uncovered. We have a clear, unobstructed view up there of the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 09-14-10  ((sic.  09-04-10)), the sky was mostly clear with a few light clouds here and there.  The sky was a sea of stars and there was no moon.  The day had been windy, but by our 9PM departure time, it was very calm on the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10 PM, we were emerging from a bay in the southeast corner of the 600-acre lake and were traveling west at about 5 miles per hour on the last leg of our tour.  I was just finishing a song when the captain of the boat tapped me on the shoulder and pointed into the night sky directly above the boat, calling my attention to a very strange spectacle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An object was flying very slowly in a due east direction above and to the port (left) side of our paddleboat. It was so strange, I called the attention of the passengers to this object.  There were about 15 people on the upper deck, all of whom had a perfectly clear view of the object simply by looking up, and approximately 30 more on the lower, covered deck.  Most of those on the lower deck went to the port-side windows to stare up at the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not very good at estimating heights, but this object flew above the spotty clouds at what I thought was no more than a few thousand feet.  The entire object appeared about the size of a dime held at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The leading edge of the object was a large, very bright red, glowing circular spot.  Immediately behind that was a rectangular light (about 3 times as long as the spot) which was an even brighter, orange glow which scintillated and looked very much like an open flame.  All I could see were the lights, neither of which pulsated or flickered other than the flame-like action of the orange &#34;body.&#34;   We could see no wings or visible superstructure.  The craft was shaped like a fat, red-and-orange exclamation point travelling point-first. It left no smoke or vapor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of the passengers said they thought it was a helicopter, a hang-glider, or an ultralight, so the captain stopped the boat and turned off the paddlewheel completely.  We could hear no sound of any kind from the object even though it was almost directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had the object in sight for at least a minute, but no longer than 2 minutes.  It continued due east, never changing its direction or rate of speed until it was out of sight of us (a mile or so east of the lake.)   I finished my show, and had a talk with the captain.  He said when he first saw it from the wheelhouse, he thought it was a missile, though he could not explain the large red, leading-edge light. Neither the captain nor I reported the incident.  I don’t know if any of the passengers did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four days later, I started to tell this story to some people at a retirement home where I was performing and immediately one of the employees came out of her office and told me that her son saw the same object fly over the airport (and air force training base) in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, about 40 miles due east.  I asked her to describe what he saw and his description was identical to mine.<n>

I saw a very large bright &#34;something&#34; moving fast in the sky going East. I thought it was a Satelite but have never seen one that bright. I kept my eye on it but then a flash of lighting was seen in the distance, however I never took my eyes off it then it suddenly vanished. The sky was clear.... It was no where in the sky to be seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Even though it was dark at this point, it did not appear to be very high in the sky so at first we assumed it must be a large piece of flaming debris from one of the fireworks; however, the debris did not lose altitude and float to the ground.  It appeared to be on fire and it also traveled on a straight, unwaivering path, which continued to fly at the same altitude until we could no longer see the object.  While the object could have possibly be triangular in shape it was hard to see because it was so illuminated although it did appear to have flames coming from the back of the object.  It did not appear to be traveling at a great rate of speed.  There was only one object and the color was kind of a bright yellow orange like fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It never moved, however, I decided to get back in the car and drive due southwest to see if I could get a closer look.  As I drove west, I kept an eye on it (as best as I could while driving)---followed west approximately 3 miles, but couldn&#39;t see it anymore (not sure if it was actually still there because of the clouds.

After approximately 45 seconds to a minute of this tracking it made a sudden 90 degree turn due south, and became gradually dimmer. It tracked south for approximately 5 to 10 seconds and made another 90 degree turn due east and proceeded on this course for another 5 to 10 seconds. It made another 90 degree turn south and then another east, traveling in each direction for 5 to 10 seconds. It then disappeared spontaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object left no contrail or smoke trail and made no noise. The object was not any perfect shape, but more resembled a radiating ball of fire.

Ahead up in the night sky to our right we saw three round glowing lights. They were moving in a southerly direction. We decided to turn right into a parking lot and get out of the vehicle and look up at them. When we pulled in we were directly under them. They were in a vertical triangle position. Not horizontal. My son kept thinking they were balloons because the glowing lights looked like burning flames that you would see from a hot air baloon. They were low and making no sounds. Rockford does have an airport and we have seen planes often. Planes have red flashing and white lights and make noise. Not these orange passing what ever they were lights passing in the night sky just above our heads! They faded into some clouds and then disappeared. I doubt anyone would be flying in a hot air balloon in the dark.  And three of them at that. And then to be perfectly traveling together in the shape of a perfect triangle.  Too weird. Also, I did witness an air plane near the object.<n>
9/4/10 19:00|Huntington|WV|Circle|1 minute|Circular black object with single bright white light, hovering, turning, then moving at incredible speed.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77695.html|390|ndxe201009| Circular black object with single bright white light, hovering, turning, then moving at incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home in my vehicle at approximately 7 pm on Sept 4, 2010 and noticed a bright white light in the sky ahead of me.  The light was steady, not blinking or twinkling, and there were no other lights around it.  I was driving East.  I have a Windstar minivan that has a long, slopping windshield and provides a big view of the sky above.  I didn’t pay attention to the light at first, it was sitting nearly stationary and there is an airport close by so there are helicopters in the air all the time.  But, this light was so bright I couldn’t ignore it.  Note, it was not dark yet, I did not have my headlights on yet. The size was approximately the same diameter as holding the round end of a pencil eraser at arms-length. But, immediately I noticed the object the light was attached to. It was round (well, circular looking at to directly) and very dark, almost black.  So it seemed to create a black halo (though obviously solid) around the light (keep in mind the sk! y was still bright and light blue at the time).  Since I was driving east, the sun was behind me at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could only estimate, based on what I know of small aircraft (I’ve lived near an airport my entire life, and I am now 50 years old… I’ve seen thousands of aircraft in the sky), I can say it was flying lower than most Cessnas, but higher than the medivac helicopters I’ve seen. My mind, for what it’s worth, latches on to the idea that it must have been 16-20 feet in diameter, black body included. As I continued driving (35 mph on a dead-straight road, in the middle of town which is completely flat) the object picked up a little speed and started moving away from me in a curved path (if you drive toward a stationary object or star, it would &#39;seem&#39; to be coming closer, not moving away from you). I would estimate this movement to be about the speed of a medivac helicopter (at this distance, a helicopter can be heard, and it was warm and I had my windows down. There was no noise coming from this craft).  It continued to move, I would estimate about 10-15% across the sky, curving ! east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, here’s where it gets interesting… everything before I just consider curious, but not not-worthy. But, as I stopped at the stop light (so my car’s movement has no bearing now), this craft literally took off! Heading in the direct opposite direction it was heading. It was heading directly West and directly toward me. All this time I had been looking at it at approximately a 45% angle from the ground… this thing went from moving East to moving West immediately, and went from 45% to directly overhead in no more than 2 seconds, and it disappeared from my view out the windshield. I can’t say where it went from there, but directly West (as it was traveling) from where I was, and only about 2 miles away, is one of the largest oil refineries in the East (the Marathon Petroleum Refinery). So, if it kept it’s course, it would have passed directly over the refinery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then turned &#39;right on red&#39; at the light, and looked out the passenger-side door window, but the object was already gone from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to repeat, it was broad daylight, no cars had their lights on, there were no interior lights in my van to cause reflections. This object, whatever it is, was in the sky, and maneuvered in a way that no known aircraft can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, me, I’m 50 years old, college educated, a professional artist. This is the first report I’ve ever made, this is the first thing in the sky I’ve ever seen that I can’t explain using logic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked on the site earlier and saw a few other reports this month from my area regarding a bright white light, so decided I should report what I saw as well.<n>

Very very bright white light.  Appeared to be about five miles out over Atlantic and appeared while it was still daylight.  At first it didn&#39;t move at all, as a planet or star or satellite moves.  Remained stationary for a half an hour, then headed due south, slowly, away from my vantage point.  As it moved away it remained just as bright as when it first appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time I saw commercial aircraft with navigation lights over the ocean in the same general area but their lights were faint and difficult to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By comparison to the navigation lights, the white light was extremely bright and very large.

The light was a yellow, white pin point of light. It was unmoving, I called my son who joined me in the street and helped him locate the object. He has had astronomy classes in college, but could not think of anything we would be able to see in that location at that time of day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was an estimated 50 -60 degrees from the horizon and roughly 105 degrees from north.

I then continued on to cut the grass, and approximatley 2 minutes later I saw the thing again, this time time it was now really high in the air, and flying just as slow, directly over my house, going west this time. I immediatley shut off the tractor and ran to get my camera as fast as I humanly could, and when I returned outside, I successfully captured the object on video for 1 minute before I could no longer see it on my viewfinder, and now im submitting the video to you.<n>

It appered to be a triangle. The object was hovering in one place for a minute or so, then shot across the sky.

I was driving and I looked into the distance and saw two flashing lights, I thought both of them were just cell phone/radio towers. One was much more bright than the other. As I approached the lights, I noticed that there was only one tower and the other light, which was the much brighter one, was moving south (I was headed west). I figured it was an airplane. The light was flashing about every second. When it flashed again, I saw that it wasn&#39;t very high in the sky. The next time it flashed, I realized that there were several lights and they were in the form of a triangle. I knew this couldn&#39;t be an airplane. The aircraft changed direction and started heading east parallel to my friend and I. I stopped my vehicle and my friend and I looked at the aircraft. I had the window down and I attempted to get a picture with my cell phone. The aircraft stopped and hovered in one spot about the same time we stopped. I got a very close look at it, It was very dark, so all I could see was the bottom of it when it lit up. It was only about 100 feet in the air and only about 250 feet from my vehicle. When it lit up, the light was white, like LED lights. I could also see a triangular metal frame around the outside of the aircraft. I was so frightened that I decided to put my phone down and floor the gas pedal. I drove as fast as I could to the highway. My friend said that it looked as though the craft was following us. I came to a stop sign and turned left, which immediately we had to drive underneath a bridge. After coming out from under the bridge, I remember seeing the ground, and reflection of the signs, light up with the same color of the aircraft, as if it were directly above us. After that, we approached the highway and I drove the rest of the way to Glasgow. I haven&#39;t seen it again.<n>

One in particular was twinkling and when I took a closer look it was actually blinking an array of colors. I thought it was a plane or helicopter at first, but it was pretty stationary and very high up. There also appeared to be beams pointing upward and downward, 3 up and 2 down. I woke up my wife to witness it and she took a little interest and went back to bed. I recorded it on a digital video camera for about 40mins. It&#39;s 6am, now,  and it&#39;s still there. No sudden movements, just slight moves to the south and higher up from my point of view. Now most of the stars aren&#39;t visible, but this is along with the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I crossed druden and R126 and observed this object come to a complete stop, hover and than go straight up into the cloud cover.  From what I was able to observe it seem to be no larger than a school bus except that it was circular and made no discernible sound,if there was a sound I was not able to hear it over the noise of my truck.  This entire episode last no more than 2 minutes and occurred at 3:55 this morning. And as luck would have it I was the only person on the road at that time.<n>

We where sitting looking at a star that caught our interest and were looking up at the sky at approximently a 45 degree angle.  Then we began to see what seemed to be head lights from a car come through the trees.  They did not shine beams of light like an average headlight though.  It seemed to just be a light like a lantern almost.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object came into view.  It was a diamond shaped object that was more so pointed at what seemed to be the front of the object.  It had around five rockets, with low white fire, going from the corners of the wings from port to starboard. It also had a small red light coming from the nose of the aircraft. Its altitude was rather low considering the fact that I could see some of the panels, which were only lit up in the front and not to the rear of the aircraft.  Another noticeable feature was the fact that it was silent.  There was absolutely no noise from it.  It continued toward the South-West at a slightly slower rate than a commercial airliner.  It past in about 20-30 seconds.  I had tried to take a picture with my phone but the craft was in the trees when I tried to take a picture so none of the photos came out.  Afterwards, me and my friend stood there a minute, and then hurried towards my house.<n>

It wasn&#39;t a helicoptor either, because of the sound and somewhat shape. Also very loud. it was about 400ft from the ground. when it got faster and closer it looked like a flying v shaped guitar. then it just zoomed out if sight the the south. My cellphone since then hasn&#39;t been working right. it was acting weird right after the incident.

As I kept driving intially I discounted it as maybe stray car light behind us from a distance.  I checked the mirror to look for a car behind me and saw nothing.  I looked over again and I saw something with three bright lights follwing my car and I got scared because what ever it was followed us up to the subdivision I live.  What ever it was kept up its speed with my car and seemed to float with no sound coming from it.  I was getting really worried because we thought it was coming after us.  As soon as it approached where all the house are it took off out of sight. This is the second time I have seen weird activity in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I didnt think anything of it and continued to puff my cigarette and converse with my coworkers, but after about 30 seconds i noticed how fast this object traveled from the horizon to almost overhead. I told the others &#34; Do you see That!&#34; We all looked in amazement as it silently flew over our heads. There were planes in the area, and this one was so eeirily different. It did not strobe or flash. It was orangeish from  afar, but overhead it was a soft amber followed by a number of red lights, i would like to say 3, but too hard to tell. It came from the eastern horizon to completely across the sky to the western horizon in less then the time it takes to smoke a cigarette. i would say less then 4 mins. I had an uneasy feeling in my stomach as i watched it go by..<n>

I was panning from north to south and back again, when when the sighting began. Looking almost directly east, I saw four objects in formation. Two were parallel to each other in the center of the formation. Two more were to ether side of the central objects; they were slightly behind the two in the center.  As the objects proceeded to the south, the positions of the objects shifted relative to each other, but the formation maintained itself in pretty much the same small area of sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the formation reached the farthest point south that I could follow them , the lowest or eastern most object drifted east, or below , the other three objects a very noticeable distance, but then soon after returned to the formation. Soon after this, the sighting ended due to sky conditions making it nearly impossible to follow them further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way to describe their appearance is that they looked like very dim &#34; light sabers &#34; as seen in the StarWars films !  They were thin and much longer than they were thick ,and they glowed dimly. Through binoculars, they all were the same size and appearance; the length of each was perhaps one - fifth the diameter of a full moon. The edges of the objects were indistinct, due to the glow the objects apparently emitted, yet they seemed to be solid and rigid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had I not been using binoculars, I doubt that this sighting would have been possible. I believe the objects would have been too small and dim to be seen naked-eye from my light-polluted location.  I am an amateur astronomer and have taken a course in extreme weather watching, provided by the National Weather Service. For me , this sighting falls into the &#34; Five-Percent  Category &#34; for being an unexplainable sighting.  These objects travelled as fast or faster than fighter planes and displayed no other lights than the dim, orange glow they exhibited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the author of the report implies an evening sighting.

On our drive home at about 8:55 p.m, we passed a cleared lookout spot on top of one of the park’s hills and saw several very bright, yellow-orange lights, stationary in the sky, northeast of our location.  We parked and got out of the car immediately, and then stood in the dark watching these lights for the next four minutes approximately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The park has many of these scenic overlooks where trees have been removed and people can pull their cars off the roads and view forested hills, perhaps as far away as 15-25 miles.  Brown County is very rural and covered with forested hills.  There is no town, or towers, or any high structures in the direction of these lights.  However, Camp Atterbury, a military camp, is about 10 miles east of this location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next four minutes or so, we watched these lights come on, stay lit about 30 seconds or so, and then go off, fading quickly. We noticed as one light would go out, another would often come on in another location. Often, the lights seemed to be grouped in a diamond-shape pattern, but this shape changed as a light would go off. We saw as many as 5 lights at one time, and as few as one, before all of them went completely out. They appeared, at first, to be stationary, but through careful observation we noticed that lights would go slightly out of alignment with each other, suggesting very slow movement. We wondered if these lights were attached to a larger shape or form that we could not make it out. They were bright and it was getting dark. It is also hard to say how far away they were from us with any accuracy. They may have been a mile or so away. Even if they were as close as a mile away, the lights themselves would be rather large and exceedingly bright. If they were! attached to a form, it would be gigantic. They may have been have been several hundred feet in the air and were above tree line. Becasue we do not know how far away they were, it is also hard to determine how high they may have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife had her iPhone and located the direction of the lights (northeast from where we stood) and zoomed in to take a picture at a time when three lights were present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son (age 24) and I watched similar very bright, yellow-orange lights one night, in the same direction, about 2 ½ months ago. They also went off and on as well; there were about 10 lights or so. At that time, we heard what sounded like thunder rumbling coming from these lights. When I asked him what they looked like to him, he replied, &#34;They look like the lights on the front of a stereo equilizer, moving slightly in relationship to each other.&#34;<n>

I have photos to email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a three day report  1 Sep - 3 Sep  Maricopa, Az.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Day 1   1 Sep  Skies clear, no moon  Time 10:00-10:30PM  Being that I was sitting around the house doing nothing and due to my first ever UFO sighting back in May, I decided to go out and try my luck at spotting the UFO again. So I got my camera and went for a drive on route 347 which was around 9:30 PM.  I first went south for a 4 or 5 mile, saw nothing. So I made a u-turn and headed towards Phoenix for about 5 mile outside of Maricopa, saw nothing. Made a u-turn and headed back to Maricopa. When I was about a mile outside of Maricopa city limits and looking up as I was driving, just off to the left of 347 one of the orange orbs slowly appeared, then went out and came back on again. A split second later a second orb appeared some distance to the left of the first and when back out. Then the first orb went out and a third orb appeared just to the right of the first and when back out. Not know their actual position, I drove through town on 347 and turn left on N. Bowlin Rd. (due to the large open area) and parked hoping to get a ph! oto of them if they should reappear. At this location I had a good overall field of view plus I could see the Harrah&#39;s Phoenix Ak-Chin casino were I first saw the orbs and I hoped they would reappear near the casino. I stayed there for about an hour but I never saw them reappear so I went home for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Day 2   2 Sep  Skies clear,  no moon  Time 9:45-10:00PM  Around 9:00 PM headed out of the house with camera hoping to see and maybe get a picture of the orbs. Drove back to the Bowlin Rd. location and waited. About 45 min. goes by, lots of air traffic out of Phoenix and over Maricopa, but no orbs. So I’m looking toward Phoenix and turn around to look towards the casino to see an orb that looked to be hovering less than a 1000 ft. just over the Harrah&#39;s Phoenix Ak-Chin casino and then when out. So I’m happy that I saw the orb but not enough time to get a picture. I waited hoping it would em to reappear. About 15 min. later an orb slowly appeared and then went back out to the left of 347 across from the casino but a little farther out. Then a second orb appeared a little to the right of the first and went out. Then the third appeared a little right of the second and went out. I had gotten sidetrack trying to light a cigar it and couldn’t get my camera turn on in time to take a photo. So I waited hoping for one more chance to take a ! picture. About 15 min later the first orb slowly reappears to the right of the casino and goes out. The second orb appears (photo 2 ND) and went out. The third orb appears (photo 3 RD) and goes out. So now I’m real happy, I’ve got photos of a UFO to backup my 24 May MUFON report. Being that the UFOs were near the casino I drove down 347 and turned left on N. Farrell Rd. and parked, hoping to get better pictures. I waited about 20 min but no sightings. As I was standing there I happen to look down the road and into the fields on the Ak-Chin reservation and off to the left of Farrell Rd. I could see two white shimmering lights that slowly faded out and slowly came back on a few second later. Now I’m thinking the UFO is on the ground, so I drive onto the reservation for a better look and pictures. I found a spot where I could see about five or six of the lights on the ground in the field just behind the house were Farrell and Thomas St/Rd intersect. They were all shimmering, f! our or five of them would slowly fade in and out of view but n! ever cha nge their location. I also saw a couple of really small light that were moving in the location of the larger lights.  I took a few pictures but most were bad. So I’m posting the two best that show two light (first picture), then you can see a third starting to come on again. You can also make out some of the other lights. The green blue lights are not part of the craft. After about 15 or 20 min. of looking at the UFO I started out for home. I drove pass a really good spot to get better pictures so I made a u-turn to go back that’s when I spot the Ak-Chin police (someone had called me in) coming from all points. So I pull over and told them what was doing, told them about the UFO sighting, showed they one of the photo and I even pointed out one of the lights of the UFO that faded out and in while we were talking. I was told that either side of the main road was Indian property and that I would be trespassing if I left the main road. Then I was told to have a nice day they got! back into their cars and drove way. I went home to start typing this. It was about 10:50 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Day 3   3 Sep  Skies clear,  no moon  Time 5:45-6:00 AM  4:30AM wake up for a nap sitting in front of the computer. Decide to go to Wal-Mart to pickup a few things. Departed the house 5:05AM thought I drive over to the reservation to if the lights were still there from the UFO or maybe it could have been a construction site or something. Get to the location no lights, no construction equipment, no construction, no nothing, just green farm land. Head out to Wal-Mart. Driving on route 238 towards Casa Grande coming up on traffic light of intersection 238 and Shea Way about to make left turn in to Wal-Mart. Light is green.  All of a sudden, out of nowhere, in a knife edge position, in maybe a 30 degree angle traveling at an extreme high rate of speed, in a northeast direction, is a large dark gray or black V shape craft with five white lights, one in the middle and two lights on each wing. It appear too me that it had just taken off from one of the fields to the right of 238. As the craft rolled over to a horizontal position I saw th! e lights flash then the craft made a hard right turn and disappeared over the horizon. I was in a low part of the road so disappearing over the horizon was an easy task. So I sat through a cycle or two of the traffic light, spellbound. I sapped out of it due to a truck leaving Wal-Mart and went right pass the WTF moment to the Nobody is going to believe this. I wouldn’t believe this myself, that all of this could happen to one guy in less the 8 hours. So I drove down 238 a little farther just incase there was more to see. Now I’m on the high side of the road, I can see all over the area. Again out of nowhere, in a knife edge position, in maybe a 30 degree angle traveling at an extreme high rate of speed, in a northeast direction, is the craft, which appears to have just taken off. The lights flash again as it rolls horizontal. It makes a hard right turn and heads out to the mountains to the south. It makes a hard left turn (flyby photo) and now heading north back in my dire! ction. Once it’s over or just pass the Ak-Chin Farm complex ar! ea, it m akes a hard right turn and heads south back to the mountains. It then makes a hard right turn and heads north in my direction and lands (landing photo) in the fields off to the left of the farm complex. It’s getting pretty light out so I’m thinking it may clear the area soon. I wait at my location between N. White and Parker Rd and N. Porter Rd. for about an hour waiting for it to take off again but it never did or maybe I missed the take off during the passing of one of three frigate trains. I ended the wait and made a right on White and Parker and another right on W. Peters and Nall Rd. just to see if I could spot the craft which I didn’t. Made the loop back Wal-Mart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the craft I saw. It was dark gray or black non reflective, taper wing design much like the B-2 bomber. Five white lights evenly spaced, one in the middle and two on each wing which looked to flash when it made its first maneuver. Extremely fast with no sound and highly maneuverable. Other than the possible knife edge take offs it flew pretty much like any other pitch/roll aircraft just tighter. Steep banks with almost wingtip type turns. If you’ve ever seen a glider do a tight wingtip turn that’s what this craft can do only at very high speeds. As for landing I can only assume that it went from fast to dead stop hover and land. It didn’t look to really slow down to land. It just made the fast descent and land. I couldn’t make out a cockpit or cabin area because it was moving to fast. Also I can’t remember if I saw the five lights on the underside of the wing because it was moving to fast. I did notice it had what could be blinking nav. lights on the wing tips. It was ! large but not really overly large but it did have the longest wing span of any aircraft I’ve even seen. When you look at it head on it pretty thin and almost disappears with the mountain backdrop. I would have to give it a 9 for being a good looking craft as compared to our normal military aircraft that are flying today. Sure was something to see. May buy me a camcorder tonight and get back out there by 5AM just incase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s it, you guys can stop reading now. Sorry for being so long, for any mistakes you may find and for not getting better pictures. Something is better than nothing. I did make a report to include photos to the Pinal/Maricopa police.<n>

It was moving too slowly to be a plane. It was also way too low to the ground.  As I drove closer to it, I got a perfect view of the bottom of it.  It was a huge triangle shaped craft. It had multiple patterns of lights underneath.  It was very extraordinary.  This is not the first time I have seen a ufo in Tracy, ca.  As a prospective scientist, I can not make any assumptions on what it can be, just mere observations.  One thing that I know, It is not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

It was 3 red lights all spaced out in the shape of a perfect triangle, the objects moved slowly foward but then stopped and en t backwards and just stayed there untill exactly 5:30am.  The second time 09/03/2010 wich is what i am reporting now the same objects were spotted in the same area as the first time. I sat and watched them change shape and color from red to green.  i watched them untill the sun began to rise and as I was watching an airplane came by and it looked as though it scared the objects because 2 of them disapeared and the 3rd looked as though it was lost because it began to move back and forth and all around as though it was on a winding road and finally disappeared completely. It was to say the least..amazing.<n>

This time they were closer when first noticed and were diving and turning before continuing on approximately the same track as before.

The light moved a bit faster than a standard airplane.  It could not have been mistaken for an airplane as there were no flashing lights typically seen on the wing of an airplane.  It’s possible that it could have been a fireball/comet/meteor although there was no “tail” typically seen on such an occurrence.  There were minimal clouds and no stars were present.  The event lasted about a minute until it was lost behind dense tree coverage.  The object flew in a more-or-less straight path with a bearing directly north east.  It was also continuous and did not fade, nor get brighter during the sighting.<n>

We were talking and joking around when suddenly my friend sitting next to me yells, &#34;U.F.O!!!&#34; and points northeast.  Instinctively, we all looked in that direction.  And there, against a clear, pitch-black sky, one gray, saucer-shaped object was moving right to left at a relatively fair speed.  It was obviously too fast to be a cloud and it was almost a complete impossiblity as there were no other clouds in the sky.  We shouted and yelled &#34;oh my god!&#34; in disbelief as it got smaller and smaller.  The object was only visible for about ten seconds until it disappeared.<n>

The light then flew at high speed to about 35° high off the southern horizon then abruptly stopped for about 5 seconds or so. After stopping the light then changed directions to head west at a much faster speed then disappeared behind the mountains. The whole encounter lasted about 25 or so second and the light didn’t seem blink or change colors in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

If due north on a level plane is 9 o&#39;clock and due south on a plane is 3 o&#39;clock and Hades is at 6, then the airplane was flying at about 11.  While observing the airplane,  I noticed what seemed to be an extra part hanging off of one of the wings and wondered if the plane was coming apart. Then the piece, which was not much larger than a dot, moved so that it appeared as if it were flying between the airplane&#39;s south (near) wing and its tail. That&#39;s when I realized it was a separate, flying object. As I watched the dot seemed to vanish for a moment and then I noticed it now flying just in front of the aircraft. They both then passed over the Cleveland Avenue hill extremely close together. I checked my watch, which read 7:56 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed way to small to be a regular aircraft. The airplane&#39;s apparent length was slightly less than the diameter of a dime held at arm&#39;s length. The object flying around it  appeared smaller than any of the engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If any reports of a jet being buzzed come in for tonight, you&#39;ve got ground corroboration.<n>

As I turned my head to look,  I saw a Triangle Object with numerous lights around it hovering in the same spot for about 2 minutes.  This triangle object was almost black and had 2 rows of almost “spot light” looking lights that did not blink on  2 of its sides.  On the other Side there was a row of lights that flashed one at a time going in order.  It then moved fast sideways were it disappeared for about 30 seconds and reappeared shooting the completely opposite way, where it then hovered again for about 2 more minutes and disappeared.   I have never seen anything like this in my entire life. It scared me because I knew there was no way that it could be a helicopter or airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it disappeared My boyfriend and I carried on our way home when stopped at a stop sign near the outskirts of Cornwall, We saw this triangle thing again just fly at an incredible speed and just disappear completely.  We have not seen it since.  But I am truly scared knowing that this very well may be a U.F.O.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I kept observing it because i had never seen a bird so high until it went below an even higher object and the bird flew away and i was fixated on this other object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other object looked like no bird, but my first thought was it had to be one or a balloon.  I could see the sun reflecting off of it and the color was silver, the object was cigar saucer shaped.  The object appeared to be very small only about quarter inch so i knew it was very high up and was not a blimp or anything.  it was very shiny silver because the sun was reflecting off of it.  i have planes that go in the same direction where i was observing the object and i can tell you.  this was flying higher than any plane that passes by.  i saw no planes pass till after the sighting and they were 3 times lower than what this object appeared to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it was very hard to see and i was shocked to see it so i looked away then tried to see if i could find the object and if it was still in the same place. it was.  I stared at the object for about 30 second before it started to move really really really fast, up down, left to right. like nothing i had ever seen before. faster than a plane, bird or anything. it was then i looked away again thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me.  so i looked away and tried to see if it was in the same vicinity.  it was. so i kept my eyes on it while it moved crazy fast.  I observed this for about 1 and a half to 2 minutes before i was in so much shock i couldn&#39;t believe it i had to look away again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After i did that i tried to find it again but it was gone, it disappeared like it was never there but it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

He had just seen the first of three of what I am about to describe.  As I gazed at the sky, I almost immediately noticed something strange moving quickly across the sky. I am not sure what shape the object was, for it was too far away, however it was moving at an unbelievably fast speed.  The craft whizzed by Saturn in the blink of an eye.)   This was no airplane.  It had very bright blue and red blinking lights   and was flying through the air faster than anything I have ever seen before. The space between the lights made the craft look like it is probably of massive size, it did not seem as if the lights were say, ‘red on one side and blue on the other’, and the lights were not blinking with a certain rhythm or order at all. The craft was silent - moving rapidly West/Northwest for about 15 or 20 seconds, approximately. Then, without slowing down at all, it stopped for a fraction of a second, dipped a huge dip downward, and started moving in a Northerly direction.  After the craft flew by a few more stars in our Earth sky, (5 seconds) it was gone. It was very far away but seemed to be in our solar system, for it flew in front of Saturn and then almost halfway across the sky in just 20 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend had seen a craft very similar to the one previously described, just a few minutes) before we saw the second craft. It was moving in a North.  Within 10-15 minutes after the second sighting, (the one of which I had observed), my boyfriend reported to me that he saw another craft.  He still could not make out the shape of the craft, but it was very similar to the previously described. This craft was MUCH  closer to Earth than the first two crafts, massive in size, and was absolutely in our solar system. (Again, we were using Saturn as a relative coordinate). It  also had many blinking blue and red lights, AND  had white blinking lights,– all of which were flashing sporadically - , was visible for 35-45 seconds, approximately, and was moving South/Southwest and then West, silently. (Note, it is very quiet here in this part of the country. No major airports for hours in all directions.)<n>

It had very bright blue and red blinking lights. The space between the lights made the craft look like it is probably gigantic up close. It did not seem as if the lights were red on one side and blue on the other, and the lights were not blinking with a certain rhythm at all.  The craft was silent and was moving West / Northwest for about 15 or 20 seconds...zooming!!  Then it stopped for a fraction of a second, dipped a massive dip downward, and started moving North.  After zooming by a few more stars in my sky, it was gone. It was very far away but seemed almost definitely to be in our solar system, ! for it moved past Saturn and then almost halfway across the sky in just 20 seconds or so.  That is what I saw tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend had seem one very similar to that just a few minutes before this described sighting going in a different direction, North I think. Within 10-15 minutes after the second sighting, (the one of which I had observed) maybe less, my boyfriend reported to me that he saw another craft (I don&#39;t know the shape) very similar to the previously described. However, he described this third craft to be much closer to Earth than the other two but it was still in space. This one, like the other two, not only had blinking blue and red lights all over the craft, it also had white blinking light(blinking without order or rhythm) all over it as well. I am not sure how long it was visible - maybe a minute at most... He noted that it was moving South/Southwest and then West, also without sound.

It swerved slightly twice while moving in the sky which both my wife and I observed.  Once it reached the point where it was right above us in the centre of the sky it faded, turned red, then disappeared within a two second period.  There were no blinking lights as you would see with a plane.  My wife and I live under the Calgary airport flight path and see planes in the sky multiple time within an hour and know what plane lights look like, and this was no plane.  We also see plenty of sateliites and this seemed too low and was moving way to fast across the sky to be one.<n>

I pointed this out to my wife and she saw it immediately.  The object came closer and closer and it appeared to be an irregular shape, the shape of a police badge.  No lights were on this object and it did not make any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it went overhead we could see that it was a subdued color illuminated by the reflection of the city lights. It looked to be a muddy, brown color.  From our point of view, it seemed to be very large, moving in the horizon. It quickly left our view, moving a west-to-east direction.  We saw the bottom of the object as it went over us.  It looked eerie; it was a muddy brown color with a little pink reflected from the city lights.  It went directly overhead and it was definitely an irregular shape, the shape of a police badge.  The whole spotting time was approximately 1½ to 2 minutes in duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was going horizon to horizon and looked like the size of a full moon. The trajectory was close to perfect, going west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I spent my time on the phone trying to see if anyone else had reported anything, so far I haven’t heard anything.<n>

My wife was holding our 19 month old daughter looking at the stars and yelled, &#34;LOOK!.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was looking directly up and we saw 3 lights flying perfectly in line across the sky.  They were traveling 10X faster than any aircraft in the sky.  Shortly after we saw them, they formed a triangle for about 10 seconds, then bunched together at the end and disappeared into the sky after a plane appeared to be close to them.  These objects were very faint (high altitude) and were heading southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We’ve never seen or reported anything like this and it was amazing<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Knowing the sky after living out here for a few years, I quickly made the mental note that it wasn’t a star. As I looked at the light it increased in luminosity rapidly. This increase took place very quickly- I would say within 5 seconds and made the light/object appear to increase in size dramatically. Additional lights then blinked on in quick succession- first one to the east, then one to the west, and another even further west. The additional lights came on at a luminosity that matched the first light. They were evenly spaced, making me wonder if they were separate or part of one large object. All the lights rose simultaneously- moving upward and southward at great speed, disappearing from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen numerous things in the night sky out here- this is the first that I cannot come up with an explanation for. I am used to seeing flares over the hills to the west of my home, and I am familiar with both military and commercial air traffic that frequents our skies. The size and brightness of the light I saw was well in excess of the luminosity of the stars and planets in the sky. The increase in brightness is highly irregular in the sky. The additional lights and the first all rose in unison against gravity and did not streak across the sky in the same way as satellites or meteors I have seen.<n>

I am quite familiar with the aircraft that fly overhead and have watched the military do their manuveurs quite often.  I find it enjoyable.  I have never seen anything like what I saw and quite frankly, have never believed in aliens or UFO&#39;s.  Now I&#39;m not so sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way home from a class I attended in Salt Lake City. It was around 9:20 in the evening. (Approx.) I turned off 6200 S. and onto 4800 W going south and as I passed the gas station I noticed a reddish-orange light hovering above our park. (This park is a &#34;depressed&#34; park. That&#39;s where all the water goes after it rains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time there was a little bit of water, but not much.) I thought it was a helicopter as we do have a small airport by our nieghborhood, but I thought it was strange for it to be just hovering there. I drove a little further towards it and decided to stop and see what it really was. I pulled over, turned off my music, and rolled down my window. There was no noise coming from it and I could see that it was only maybe 20 yards above the park. A VW beetle with two teenage girls pulled into the center lane and watched the light for a few seconds, then they drove off. I was about to drive off when it started to move upwards, going east/slightly north. I was intending to watch it go back towards the airport, but then it picked up speed and a reddish/orange light (like the one I originally saw) illuminated the object and I could see it was round, not a helicopter or any planes they fly at the airport. It lit up for maybe a second or two, then took off towards the stars. I watc! hed it till it disappeared, which only took a matter of seconds. I sat in my car for a couple more minutes, trying to figure out what I just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove home and I was very scared afterwards. I was very intrigued when I was watching it because at that point (before it was lit up) I thought for sure it was a helicopter. After it lit up and took off, I knew it wasn&#39;t a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I finally got the courage to get out of my car and carry my stuff in the house, I walked in, locked the doors and windows, then proceeded to tell my parents what happened. They were interested and told me it sounded like a UFO. I didn&#39;t want to believe that what it was, but the more I think about it, the more I want to know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t sleep well that night at all.  If anyone can tell me what it could have been, please let me know. Before this I refused to believe in UFO&#39;s, but now I&#39;m not so sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for letting me tell you my story.<n>

The one on the right was speeding towards it incredibly fast.  There was an explosion and then nothing could be seen.  When I got to work I checked online, checked the news radio programs but nothing was reported.  There were lots of people on the road and I know I couldn&#39;t have been the only one to see this.
