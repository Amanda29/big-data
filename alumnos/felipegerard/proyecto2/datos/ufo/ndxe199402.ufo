We both worked at the local VA Hospital, he was an LPN and I was a CNA.  As we headed east we noticed a rectangular object flying very slowly toward us about 75 yards above the road.  As we approached the craft, my friend rolled back the sunroof on his car and slowed down to about 10 mph. We went right under the belly of this craft.  It was rectangular in shape and the nose of the craft was only half as wide as the tail end.  It had 6 red lights on each of the 2 long sides of the craft and it had a very bright white light on the underside of the nose of the craft. My friend asked me what it was.  I told him that no aircraft can fly so slowly and not leave a trail or make no noise and that it must be a UFO.  It was the size of 2 football fields.  And both sides extended well beyond the sides of the road in width.  It was huge!!  The craft was a shiny, black, metallic color.  There were no identifying numbers on the underside as there would normally be on most aircraft.  After we got out from under it, we sped off for home in record time. He still remembers the incident as do I.  No missing time with this sighting as there was with my first report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from same source.  PD))<n>

It was travelling from west to east and it was going very very slowly.  It just took forever to move across the sky.  I observed it for about 15 minutes, I estimate.  It seemed to be bigger than a plane, circular, and either it was rotating or the lights were rotating around it, it was hard to tell.  It changed colour.  It was a blinding white solid, a steady globe.  Then it began to spin, and became brilliantly coloured, red, green, and back to white.  Sometimes a ring of smaller lights flickered and danced all around it but in a type of orbit pattern, not erratic.  When it stopped spinning it went back to a brilliant white colour.  It was very cold that night at least -30 degrees celcius, so it was too risky to set up my telescope, and I was worried that if I went back into the house, I would lose sight of it.  So I just stood there on my front porch watching it.  I know it was not a plane.  I know the way lights behave on a plane and the noise planes make.  It was a quiet night, and this object emitted no noise.  I called my local airport, but no answer.  I called my local police the next day and they said no one had reported anything, and to which I answered, &#34;Well I am&#34;.  I talked with a local woman who published my sighting in her book, &#34;UFO Experiences in Canada.&#34;  I wanted to see however if there was a way to get my sighting more international exposure, so this is the path I&#39;m following.<n>

The lighted object appeared to travel in a square and a triangular and a figure eight type pattern appearing to maintain its general position.  After several nights of watching this object appear I retrieved a Bushnell 20 power spotting scope that I used during my years of marksmanship competition in NRA sponsored .22 caliber shoots, i.e. the scope would allow a shooter to see at 100 yards with incredible detail the &#39;hits&#39; of a .22 bullet on a target.  I figured the spotting scope would allow me to &#39;check out a satellite&#39;; however, to my amazement and my then wife&#39;s amazement what I saw through the spotting scope did not appear to be a satellite.  I used a telephone pole to &#39;brace&#39; or steady the spotting scope.  The &#39;illuminated object&#39; indeed did move in a figure eight pattern; a triangular pattern and a square/circular pattern AND under magnification of the spotting scope red lights flew into the illuminated object and green lights flew away from the object...it was like watching a bee&#39;s nest with incoming and outgoing activity.  My then wife and I watched this light&#39;s appearance for approximately 12 days.  I knew of several people who had seen the object in the night sky but my former wife and I couldn&#39;t believe what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

2/20/94 09:00|Toronto (Canada)|ON|Disk|Less than 10 seconds|Saw a metallic, daylight disk that left a wake in the clouds.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42502.html|5|ndxe199402| Saw a metallic, daylight disk that left a wake in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My UFO Sighting  On a Sunday morning in February of 1994, I saw an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) from the window of my twenty-first floor apartment in Toronto, Ontario, where I was living at the time. I had just gotten home from working the night shift as a security alarm monitoring station shift supervisor and was preparing to go to bed to rest up for my next shift when I heard the sound of a helicopter flying by at some distance from my building. As a lifelong aviation enthusiast who takes notice when any aircraft flies close by, I got out of my bed and went to the window to see if I could see the helicopter, which I did. It was a Bell Huey, flying from east to west along the north shore of Lake Ontario – which was approximately 2 kilometers from my location – at an altitude of roughly 800 to 1,000 meters at a speed I estimate to have been 80 to 100 knots. From what I could see, the helicopter was predominantly light, possibly white in colour, but I could not tell what subtype of Huey it was from my distance (eg., a UH-1D, UH-1H, UH-1N or Twin Huey). The weather conditions at the time were overcast (approximately 9-10ths to 10-10ths cloud cover) but reasonably bright, with the cloud ceiling at roughly 2,000 to 3,000 meters, and there was a brisk wind at ground level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the Huey fly along the lake, I caught some motion out of the corner of my left eye and looked up. There, just below the cloud deck, was a small, round, metallic-looking, “discoid” shape that very much resembled the head, or nub, straight pin, moving in a stable, straight line course almost directly south towards the lake. It was moving a good deal faster (speed roughly 200 - 300 knots) than the helicopter and looked to be about the size of a head of a pin when held ten or twelve centimeters in front of your face, so I’d estimate it’s size to have been eight to ten meters in diameter at the altitude it was flying at. It showed no irregular motion or changes in altitude or direction. But what was remarkable was the fact that the brisk wind – which I think was from the northwest – didn’t seem to affect it’s flightpath at all; it maintained a straight and steady bearing south to the lake without exhibiting any drift. At one point, it passed through a slightly lower bank of clouds and produced a straight line wake in the clouds that lasted no more than two seconds. When I looked away to the Huey for a second, which was continuing on it&#39;s own course, then looked back to the object, it was gone. The sighting lasted less than 10 seconds and it was absolutely astonishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I mentioned before, I have a lifelong interest in aviation and flying, and am fairly expert at identifying a wide variety of aircraft of all types from military to civilian, antique to modern. I am also an amateur astronomer and also have an interest in meteorology, so I am very familiar with what’s in the sky on a daily basis. I cannot speculate on what it was because I could not identify it, but I can say that it was no conventional aircraft, helicopter, or balloon in any way, shape, or form, nor was it any celestial object such as a meteor or a weather-induced optical effect such as a “sundog” simply because the conditions did not exist to observe sundogs or anything similar. I don’t know what it was, but I’ve never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((initials deleted))  Whitby, Ontario<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

2/15/94 21:00|Vancouver (Canada)|BC|Triangle|2 minutes|1994 Sighting in Vancouver, B.C.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29475.html|6|ndxe199402| 1994 Sighting in Vancouver, B.C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening, I was letting our puppy out ((deleted)) before going to bed.  I was outside monitoring him ((deleted)) and I happen to glance up in the sky to check out the weather.  It was a clear night and going over the house, at a moderate speed was a HUGE triangular shaped object.  It was going in a North Westerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew it was a triangle as it had three white lights on each of the three points.  At the base of triangle (in the middle) there were two red lights.  The lights did not flash nor blink and were on constantly.  No other features could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was interesting about this vehicle, along with the massive size, was the fact that as it flew over the house, it did not make any kind of noise at all.  As I observed the craft going overhead, I looked around the sky and noticed off to the South West a small plane flying in a North Easterly direction.  I am not sure how far the plane was away but I could hear its engine running.  I could also make out the flashing strobe on the small plane as well as the red and green port and starboard lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, I told my wife (she was working nights on the night in question and wasnt home and I also told our neighbors who lived in the upper part of the house...they too were not home at the time otherwise I would have called them out to witness themselves).<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of years later, I was watching the television show &#34;Unsolved Mysteries&#34; on NBC and they ran a segment on some sightings in Vancouver...a local radio talk show host had seen some strange flying objects in the sky and had mentioned it the next day on his show - he received quite a few calls into his show from other witnesses. I remember commenting with a great deal of excitement to my wife that I was certain that that was the same sighting I had seen though I couldnt remember the specific dates.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have told numerous people over the years and most are interested in the sighting. No one has ever been critical or made fun of my story...I think that bodes positively for my reputation. I have thought often about filing an official report but didnt know where and eventually, I considered the time lag too much to report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While still living at the address where the sighting was, I used to watch large airliners go overhead...they could clearly be heard and were substantially smaller then what I saw flying overhead.  To this day, if I hear an airliner flying overhead (if the weather is clear) I will have a look; I always think back to the sighting and marvel at the difference in sizes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont want my personal information to be released - thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At first only could see 2 colored lights, and a spotlight beam that did not reach the ground, noticed colored lights slowly turning (first appeared as helicopter losing control). As I slowed down, the object also slowed down and began to wobble, and then suddenly flew sideways across the Freeway approx. 50ft in front of my truck, I slammed on the brakes to a stop. What me and my wife, and another vehicle behind me are now watching, was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen, wobbling up+down (like a fresbe does at the end of a throw), now on the East side, within 100-300ft from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DESCRIPTION; approx 30ft diameter disc, rotating approx. 1 revolution-8sec, with a Triangle attached on the bottom (corners touching discs peremeter), but the triangle rotated twice as fast, approx 1 rev-4sec. Both disc and triangle rotated counter clockwise,then suddingly clockwise, and was dull grayish white in color, and no seams or bolts were evident. 4? colored lights were on the objects perimeter, the lights pulsed (no flash) red to yellow orange, and blue to green. There still was the bottom light beam (white), but saw no evidence of it when it flew in front of us.  The object made no sound, and its thickness was unclear, almost like it was 2 dimensional. The object appeared completely out of control, going up and down (sometimes extreamly fast), and still maintained its wobble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30-45 seconds of this, Fear overrode Couriousity, as the object, several times, got too close, and I rapidly drove off. The other car that stopped, remained parked. We watched the object continue its dance as I drove off, my wife keep telling me to pullover to watch this object, but I didn&#39;t trust it. I admit I was scared, only because of its odd flight pattern, and also because it was flying object that was too close and erratic in flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However I do regret not staying there to watch it, and hope too someday meet the occupants of the other car that did remain. We never reported the incident, mainly because of the reaction from those we did tell, and the fear of losing my job for accused mental unstability. Only recently we got a computer, and thats why I report it now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ANOTHER UNKNOWN: Within days of the incident, for some unknown reason, I began writting down a series of numbers. This is what I wrote- 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9          I&#39;ve found alot of sequence and patterns within 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 9          this, including geometric shapes, mathmatical 9 7 5 3 1 8 6 4 2 9          equations, ect; but not sure what it really means? 9 6 3 9 6 3 9 6 3 9 9 5 1 6 2 7 3 8 4 9 9 4 8 3 7 2 6 1 5 9 9 3 6 9 3 6 9 3 6 9 9 2 4 6 8 1 3 5 7 9 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as having considerable technical background.

2/10/94 23:55|Lewiston (Near)|ID|Triangle|5 minutes|Triangular craft hovering over bridge then moving downriver.|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05920.html|9|ndxe199402| Triangular craft hovering over bridge then moving downriver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1994 I was coming home from my job as a registered nurse.  I was driving on Idaho highway #3/12 near what is known as the Arrow Junction. I noticed lights about 1/2 mile ahead of me that appeared to be stationary and located on the side of the river valley.  The night was very overcast with no stars or moonlight visible.  I thought for a moment that someone must have installed new lighting on the outside of their house because there are many new homes in that area.  As I approached the bridge, however, I saw that the lights were moving down the river towards me.  The lights turned into a triangular shaped aircraft that was probably about 150-200 feet above the river&#39;s surface.  It was moving very slowly downriver, over the center of the water.  I assume that the craft was triangular because the lights that were shining down were in a triangular pattern like this: 0 &lt;--&#34;front&#34; of craft Lights---&gt;   0 0 0 0 0  &lt;--rotating beacons between these lights I think that there were only 5 lights on the craft, but I don&#39;t remember for sure.  There were two rotating beacons in between the last three lights.  This struck me as odd because most aircraft marker lights that I&#39;m aware of nowdays are strobe-type lights.  Another odd thing was that this really large aircraft seemed to be proceeding at a terribly slow rate of speed.  It seems to me that it must have had to have been a helicopter because the forward speed was so slow.  The lights were all white, even the rotating lights.  Since the sky was overcast and totally dark, I couldn&#39;t make out the actual form of the craft.  I always said that if I ever saw a &#34;UFO&#34; I would stop, get out, and watch it.  But this was so different than anything I&#39;ve ever seen before that I could not bring myself to stop and get out of my rig.  I do not have an estimate of the physical size of the craft although it was very big.  I used to be a paratrooper and was in Viet Nam so I am familiar with a lot of the military&#39;s aircraft and I can say that I haven&#39;t a clue as to what this thing was, other than it was big and slow.  The second witness referred to above was another nurse who was driving her car ahead of mine.  The Arrow Bridge is at the intersection that we both took to get home and when I talked to her the next evening at work she said she saw the aircraft and that it appeared to be hovering directly over the bridge when she turned to get on the highway that would take her home.  This correlates with what I saw because I could see her car ahead of mine, turning on the bridge about 1/2-3/4 mile ahead of me and the lights at that time were directly over the bridge and appeared to be stationary.  She had no other information to add about what the thing looked like.  The aircraft passed by me and I continued to the bridge, then made the same turn that the other nurse made and continued home. Additional: The lights had the same brilliance and color of airplane landing lights.  I don&#39;t remember any other unusual factors about the lights other than that they were very white and very bright.<n>

It stayed in one spot in the air without moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the house in the coldest winter months doing some skin sewing.  A friend walked in and told me what he saw. I told him I wasn&#39;t going to go see it because I didn&#39;t believe him.  He finally convinced me so I went to go look.  He pointed at the lights. I told him, &#34;It can&#39;t be an airplane because its very still in one spot and it can&#39;t be a helicopter because there was absolutely no sound.&#34; I couldn&#39;t think of an object that was like what I saw.  There were three different colors on the object.  They were red, white and green.  There were 6 lights on the left and 6 on the right. We stood there and watched in amazement.  It started going slowly then it finally disappeared. It traveled so fast that I couldn&#39;t keep up with it.  I couldn&#39;t believe what I just saw!  We were afraid to tell anyone because we thought they might say we made the story up or that we were crazy.<n>

The light was blinking very strangly, not like a airplane, tower beaken, siren light or anything else I have ever seen.  The strangest thing was that it was on the side of a hill in a fog bank (only fog for miles)and the strange blinking light.  It might have been nothing but to this day I still think it was some type of UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
