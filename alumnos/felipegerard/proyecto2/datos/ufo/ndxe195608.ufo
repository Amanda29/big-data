8/1/56 23:30|Bradford|AL|Sphere|20 seconds|moving sparkling white/ yellowish/orange/flat black sphere paused 20 feet over my head|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83450.html|1|ndxe195608| moving sparkling white/ yellowish/orange/flat black sphere paused 20 feet over my head<n> <n><n> <n><n> I alone with two of my friends were walking home from our local burger hangout restaurant called Wills and Dovey that was located on the outskirts of a coal mining camp that I was born and lived in until moving from there at the begining of the summer of 1958.  The restaurant was located approximately two miles from my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of 1955, we, me and my two friends, were half way home at approximately 11:30 pm on a Saturday night walking and discussing which girls in my town were pretty and their physical attributes and the ones we would like to makeout with.  I mentioned this about the girls just to let you know that UFOS were no where near my thoughts at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was thirteen and half, my first friend was fourteen and my second friend was fifteen.  That night the sky was chrystal clear for my town had no street lights that could have distorted my view of what I was about to witness.  As I stated, we were half way to my house when a sparkling object 90 degree angle to my left caught the corner of my left eye.  The sparkling white object was about fifty feet off the ground and about a quarter mile away and the size of Venus from my perspective located over or beginning of the negro quarters as we called it at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I turned my head to look at what had gotten my attention, the sparkling white object begain to move rapidly toward me, but not in a straight line instead it corrected its course to the right and swoopped around the backside of the rock dump then corrected its course to come to hover about twenty feet above my head the object size had grown from the size of Venus to the size of a beach ball and and the color changed from white to translucent yellow to translucent orange then there was a slight pause in the color change maybe one to two seconds then a stark color change going from traslucent orange to a cloudy smokey flat black to black the pause of flight was over it went up veritical at a rapid rate out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me point out that once the object began to move, the sparkle stopped, but the object was white until it paused above my head.  When the size and color trasformation occured.  The object never emitted a sound at any time from movement to pause.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object disappeared, I turned to my friends and ask,&#34;What was that&#34;, and their response was ,&#34;What was what&#34;. Apparently I was the only one to witness this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/1/56 20:00|Harvard|MA|Unknown|2-3 seconds|Lost time.|9/9/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101852.html|2|ndxe195608| Lost time<n> <n><n> <n><n> By way of a brief background, I am a 69 year old retired CPA.  My experience happened many years ago.  It was either 1956 or 1957.  I’ve never shared this with anyone except my parents who were tangentially involved and a couple people over the years that were very close to me.  I heard of you on the Coast to Coast radio program.  I don’t know if my experience parallels any others that may have been reported to you or not.  Hopefully my experience may be a small piece of relative useful information to you and your work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was a young lad my parents and I spent our summer vacations with close friends.  They had a daughter, who I’ll call Linda, who was about two years older than me.  They had a cottage on a small lake in Massachusetts.  We lived in Connecticut.  The experience occurred in August of 1956 or 1957.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening our parents decided they needed a couple things at the grocery store and beer.  The liquor store closed at 8:00 PM which was about a 20 minute drive from the cottage.  Linda and I accompanied her father.  We arrived at the liquor store just before it closed.  Linda’s father went in to buy the beer and came right out, within three or four minutes.  From there we went to the store which was only about ½ mile away.  The three of us went into the store and then started back to the cottage.  It was probably about 8:20 when we left the store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The road into the cottage was one lane and gravel and wound through thick woods.  To the best of my memory, it was probably about 5 miles from the main road into the cottage.  When we entered the gravel road, it was quite dark.  About 2 miles into the woodsy we were suddenly surrounded by a blinding, extremely bright metallic light. Back in those days almost everyone had a chemistry set.  My cousin and I used to ignite magnesium which burned with an intense silvery glow.  That’s the closest I can describe the light that surrounded us.  Anyhow, Linda’s father slammed on the brakes and Linda and I were propelled into the dash board (there were no seat belts then).  I remember Linda’s father uttering an expletive.  Then, as fast as the light appeared….. it disappeared…… no more than a couple seconds.  We did not see anything other than the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there for a few seconds blinking our eyes and then continued on our way.  When we pulled into the cottage, my parents, Linda’s mother and several neighbors were outside.  When the car stopped someone in a very distressed tone exclaimed, “Where the Hell were you?”  Linda’s father said, what do you mean where were we”?  We went to the store.  As I stated, we left the store around 8:20.  It would take about 20 to 25 minutes to return.  It was nearly 10:00 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That year was my last at the lake and I didn’t see Linda again until about ten years later.  I had graduated from college, and my mother had passed away.  Linda and her husband were having an outdoor barbecue at her house to celebrate her parents’ anniversary and my father asked me if I would like to attend with him.  I said I would.  I was looking forward to seeing Linda again.  When we arrived at her home I immediately looked for her.  When we saw each other, the first words out of both our mouths were, “Do you remember the night……?”  My father passed the following year and I never saw Linda again.  I’ll never forget that night and I’ve never had any kind of a similar encounter or experience since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
