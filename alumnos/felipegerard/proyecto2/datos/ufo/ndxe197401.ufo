This occurred on a partially sunny afternoon in Ponce, Puerto Rico, at approximately 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon in what could have been January or February 1974.  The spaceship was shaped like two spheres attached by a cylinder curiously resembling dumbbells. The spaceship was not shinny nor did it have any blinking lights or humming noises, it was opaque white in a color resembling the color of white clouds.  The spaceship moved silently, and very slow, almost hovering in what appeared to be almost a reconnaissance flight. It moved from a southerly position to the north.  I observed the spaceship until it camouflaged itself behind some clouds and I never saw it or have seen it again.<n>

I did not see a craft, but certainly heard something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was attending school at the Naval Training Center (NTC) in San Diego.  I had seen a movie (The Neptune Factor) and was walking back to the barracks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Passing through a parking lot, I heard a tremendous sound - imagine something the size of a 747 passing 100 feet overhead with its engines shut down.  It was not the wind...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have spent quite a bit of time outdoors and know it was not something like that.  Being a glider pilot, I know the sound that aircraft make when they fly without power - and it was almost like that, but 100x louder than any sailplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When this happened, I stopped and looked up.  Unfortunately, there were bright lights in the parking lot and I could not see if the stars were obscured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NTC is directly in the flight path of Lindberg Field.  But if this was an airliner gliding to a landing at the airport, it never would&#39;ve made it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought perhaps I was hearing things, until I looked across the parking lot and saw another sailor, standing still and looking straight up.  I walked over to him, and he asked me, &#34;What the hell was THAT?&#34;  I asked him what happened, and he described back to me exactly what I experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the source of this report for his having submitted such a excellent rendition of what he experienced aurally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We wonder whether he might have been aural witness to the vortices, which are generated in the atmosphere at the wing tips of aircraft.  They descend to the surface, seconds or minutes after an airliner has passed, and they are very audible, as they twist at high speed.  Given that the witness was close to Lindberg Field makesus wonder about this this possibility.  The phenomenon is very common, close to airports where heavy aircraft are landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

My mother realized that my brother and I had not put out the garbage yet and it was getting late.  It was about 10 or 10:30 at night.  so we put on our winter coats and headed out.  My younger sister wanted to join us she was 9 years old I was 10 and my older brother was 14years old at that time. As we walked in the snow covered ground and slippery ice the night sky was beaming with stars. We had too walk down the long driveway to place the garbage cans out for tomorrows pick up by the garbage trucks. enroute we ran into a friend of my brother who lived two houses behind ours.  He would take the short cut home often cutting threw our backyard.  He helped us finish throwing out the trash, but there was one can stuck in the deep ice. My brother kept chipping away at the ice with his boots to free up the garbage can as we three were talking about school.  my sister than tried to get our attention.  She said there was something over head flying towards us, but we payed no attention to her. Again she said I think you three should look up to the sky theres something flying towards us.  But we were so focused in trying to free the garbage can that we payed her no mind and said it&#39;s probably a plane.  Her voice then became alarmed and she screamed! Look straight up above us.  We looked up to see a craft hovering above us it was maybe 100 yards over us 16 ft. in diameter with a reddish pink like lights that flashed around it with a blinding white light at the center of it that would flash on and off as it hovered above us it seemed to get closer too us and it would pan up and down slightly causing the perfect circular lights to appear as a semi circle.  Now from that time on we don&#39;t remember what happened.  All I know is we found ourselves looking around for the craft.  It somehow disappeared on us.  Until our friend said there it is, it&#39;s right over your garage roof.  The craft hovered over away from the garage roof took a slight altitude flight. made like a letter z ! formatio n and shot out of sight into the night sky with a woosh sound with such velocity that no jet plane till today could achive leaving behind a trail of two flourescent green laser like lights with a red and white light ray within the two laser green lights that slowly dissolved in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Interesting report; date is approximate.  We have requested that the witness attempt to have his brother and sister submit independent reports of their recollections of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The case is very similar to a report we received in December 1994 from a mother in Traverse City, MI, in which she described how her children, who had been out sledding, came rushing in the house in their underwear, babbling about the disc they had seen hovering over them.  The next thing they knew, the disc was in another part of the sky, and they found that their outer clothing was neatly folded and stacked on their sleds.  The mother was alarmed by the situation, and reported that she knew something peculiar had taken place, because it was unthinkable that her children would fold and stack their clothing in neat piles.

1/24/74|Pawtucket|RI|Disk|1 hour|I reported the UFO sighting in Pawtucket R.I.of 1974 that you have on your website.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72835.html|4|ndxe197401| ((NUFORC Note:  We have no way to certify that this report is either sincere, or accurate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported the UFO sighting in Pawtucket R.I.of 1974 that you have on your website.  My sister and my brother would like to get a interview to talk about the craft in secret to protect our identity.  There is more to that experience that I felt I should share the rest of it now to your organization.  I left out the part to my abduction into the craft  My father still owns that house property with the 3 door flat top garage.  I was hoping if some how a team of your investigatrs can go and do a radio active reading on the roof.  The orginal beams our still in place supported by beams of wood my father had anchored to the damaged ones from the ufo landing.  Now here comes the shocking abduction story.  I was brought into the craft by two small aliens that stood at my eye level but with such strong strenght they shoved me into a room with a metalic table off to the side of the small room.  The lights in the room had a blue silvery incandescent glow.  A Female alien try to set me at ease by communicating to me not by speech.  I know this sounds off the wall but by telecommunication that we&#39;ve seen in science fiction movies.  She said that they came from another world unknown to us and they plan on not hurting me but would like to perform some quick test&#39;s on me, I was frighented and tryed not to look at her large grey piercing eye&#39;s.  She said please disrobe from your clothing and I shook my head in fright.  It was icy cold in the craft it felt as if I was in the cold outside in the snow.  Then from behind her another alien came walking in and he seemed to be a little angry in the fact that I was still in my winter coat and clothing and was not yet even placed on the metal table for what ever they had in mind.  The female alien then said. look what you have done BoBo is now angry at me allowing you to waste precious time.  BoBo the alien who seems to be in charge looked at her angerly and said why did you reveal my name to this human ! boy.  She quickly than appologized and said look what you&#39;ve d! one he i s now angry again at me.  He walked over to me and she said he is only a small boy he will not remember your name.  Getting away from this ufo encounter from that day on anytime I heard the name bozo or hobo I would feel a chill go up my spine until later on in life I remembered his name and realized why.  I noticed in the craft a engraved picture of a whale on it and it seemed to relaxed my mind a little because everything else in the craft looked alien to me and not reconizable. Bobo noticing I was transfixed on the whale asked me telepathically do you know what that is a picture of I nodded no in fright looking at his taller slender body with a large bulbus head because I was to scared to make conversation with any of them.  He laughed and said when I was your age I had already the intelliegence of five of your highly respected scientists.  The female alien then interrupted him and said that&#39;s not true.  You had the intellegence of 2 of their respected scientists.  That i! s true, maybe I am not giving your kind to much credit because I find you humans to be so ignorant and primitive you have so much to learn about your planet and about yourselves.  All this what you call war towards others.  He noticed that I started to look puzzled and stopped talking about what he thought of humans.  He than pointed to the picture and said that is a blue whale.  That is the symbol we use to identify your planet here in the milky way galaxie.  These whales when they communicate to one another in your blue ocean can be heard millions of light years away to our planet.  Their sound waves travel up onto iceburgs working like a radio wave and reached us millions of years ago and we followed the sounds here to your planet.  I am getting tiered typing this e-mail now and will wait to see if you would like a interview where I can share a whole lot more.  I must say I am glad the goverment keeps all ufo information hidden because what I saw can be mind bottling and! scary for most humans that our weak minded citizens could cau! se great stress in how humans think and excell in life knowing that their our intelligent beings way more advanced then us but the good thing is we have God and that is another subject I will talk about.  One quick data I did some reasurch and believe the craft I was abducted in was the ufo that crashed in Chihuahua, Mexico on 8/25/1974. It has the same discription that I reported and learned of this craft this year watching the new tv show on the History channel UFO Encounters.<n>

It was on a sunday evrly morning. I had gotten up to see if the newspapers had arived (so that I could start on doing the inserts and folding them for delivery). I looked out the front door wich faced west and could see a number of comunications towers (WTHI tv and radio, what was then WIIL tv,as well as three other radio antena,s).There was a craft hovering next to the top of boath the tv towers. As I watched them the one farthest away (at the WIIL tower) moved (didnt realy see it move but it did) to the next tower in the line-up I think it was thr WPFR tower. where it hovered. a moment later the one that was closest to me(at the WTHI tower) moved to the tower that the other object had just left. They proceded in this fassion untill they had paused at eash tower in my view and i would guess went to other towers in their path. I reported this to my parents who said that they had been listening to the local,sheriff,and state police depts. talking about them on the &#34;scanner&#34;.Even tho Hulman Field did not send any responding aircraft. Wile this was giong on I was unable to move (i wanted to get the camera but couldn&#39;t).The event is still etched in my mind as if it just happened.I know others have seen the same thing yet have not been able to find any other reports. Hopefully this will bring them out. I Have also witnessed another where a small red ball was next to a direct tv antenna that was just installed.there was a friend with me at the time who saw this instance  as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was off to my right above the terraced houses of an inner city area of Cambridge, England.  On a still windless night with low cloud and drizzle there was no noise. The movement was sometimes quite quick and at other times it remained still for minutes. At the time I was arriving home at ((address deleted)) Road in the east of the city and was looking upwards over roof tops in the direction of the suburb of Cherry Hinton.  I could not take my eyes off the object for fascination until it moved out of sight becoming too low over the houses to the south for me to continue watching it. I had been drinking alcohol during the evening but have no doubt that my senses were not being deceived.  It was a very sobering experience.  I have told very few people about the incident in the intervening years for the reason that I do not wish to seem like I am making up a fanciful story. I record in your form above the date of 11/11/1974.  In fact I cannot recall the exact date but it was in the early hours of a Thursday morning between November, 1974 and February 1975.  Maybe this will be of interest to somebody.<n>

Official report said it was a &#34;miner&#39;s latern&#34;.  Paul Bunyon must have thrown it from Phila.  My father and I watched the whole thing.  Dad died in 1976 and I have never told anyone that we watched everything that was done from a nearby hill.  Neither the police or the military knew we were watching.  They had cordened off the area so sight seers could not get near their operations.  We had a birds-eye view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Case passed to Stan Gordon, PA UFO investigator, for corroboration.))<n>
1/7/74 19:45|Melbourne (100 mi. south of) (VIC, Australia)||Disk|unknown|'Fflying saucer' shaped craft sighted over farm, with occupant emerging, flying to ground and 'freezing' witness|3/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35210.html|10|ndxe197401| &#39;Fflying saucer&#39; shaped craft sighted over farm, with occupant emerging, flying to ground and &#39;freezing&#39; witness<n> <n><n> <n><n> My older brother believes he was about 5 at the time of this occupant sighting, so I have chosen the date of his fifth birthday as the event date. What has always fascinated me about his story is that he made my parents and grandparents aware of the sighting at the time, and it has been mentioned intermittently (albeit with embarassment/disbelief by the adults) ever since. In other words, he reported what he saw to them AT THE TIME, and in detail, so this is not some false memory of childhood recalled/invented many years later. Recently I broached the subject with him to get a definitive account of what I believe is a genuine ufo occupant encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the age of 5, my brother was playing near the gate of our dairy farm, which is located approximately 100km south east of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. He remembers my father and grandfather were still milking the cows, and it was approaching dusk. Suddenly to the west he saw what he described as a &#39;big bright star&#39; in the sky between our property and a particular neighbour&#39;s property (knowing the distance across the paddocks between our farmhouse and theirs, a midway point would be approximately 200 metres away. He watched the &#39;star&#39; abruptly shoot to various positions in the western sky several times and become stationary again. After a while it began to &#39;fly closer&#39; towards and to the north west and he could see that it wasn&#39;t a star but a &#39;spaceship&#39;. Its interesting that the words he gave me to describe it recently, at the age of 34, were childhood words, which re-inforced my impression that he was definitely recollecting something he saw at that age. Descriptive words for the craft he gave me were &#39;metal machine&#39;, &#39;shiny&#39;, and &#39;spaceship&#39;. When I asked the shape, he said &#39;a flying saucer. Like the flying saucers you see.&#39; He vividly recalls that the &#39;spaceship&#39; hovered at what we now estimate to be about 50 metres away (based on his recollection of its position in relation to landmarks below) and a &#39;hatch, like a gangplank&#39; opened up and a man in a silver suit with a jetpack flew out. He variously this figure as a &#39;man with a  jetpack&#39;, and a &#39;spaceman&#39;. The &#39;spaceman&#39; performed a number of manouevers in the sky, occassionally coming very close and then flying off at a distance, before approaching and landing on the dirt road near our gate, approximately 10 metres from my brother. He told me he became terrified at this point and tried to turn and run, but was frozen to the spot. &#34;You can&#39;t run, even if you want to, you can&#39;t run&#34; was all he would tell me about the incident from that point on, apart from being adamant that our grandmother, standing at the door to her farmhouse, about 10 metres beh! ind him &#39;saw it too. She saw it. She just wouldn&#39;t talk about it.&#34; What intrigues me to this day is that as long as I can remember the story has remained consistent amongst our family, including this detail about my grandmother, who according to my father may have originally confirmed my brothers story but subsequently dismissed it from her mind and denied it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The UFO appeared from over the horizon and flew up, performed a loop and plunged into the sea, or vanished back over the horizon, possibly. As it dropped it seemed to shrink, the light grew smaller and brighter, but there was no sound. At first we all thought that it was a flare or firework, but it moved too fast and went much too far. It also left a glowing trail which lit up the clouds for three hours, until well after dark. Everyone who saw it agreed that it was not a firework or a flare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened at 5 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, and at first we all thought that it was a fireball. Someone even said &#34;Look! A fireball.&#34; We watched it arc up from behind the blocks of flats and hotels on the skyline. It was a fiercely intense point of light, like a distress flare, except it was white. It moved very fast from right to left in front of us, rising, then performing a loop and almost immediately shooting down towards the sea. There was no sign of impact, no sound, no flare of light indicating an explosion. It might have vanished over the horizon, or it might have entered the sea, there was no way to tell. The trail it left in the sky, which resembled glowing smoke, we continued to watch, since it showed no sign of dimming, and it fascinated us. It even seemed to get brighter as the daylight waned. We waited until well after sunset, when the sky was pitch dark and full of stars, but the trail remainded, hardly dimmer than when it was made. In fact, when we eventually left, it was still there, so I don&#39;t know how long it took to fade. It was the glowing trail that convinced us that this was no fireball or flare.<n>

Then, maybe 100 feet above the 7 story building, a large (maybe 100 ft in diameter and about 30 ft high)) came straight down and hovered over the building.  It had light panels going all the way around that were about 20 ft wide.  Everyone looked up and we were all amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving home, we listened to the radio reports of others sighting the same object.  The next day there were reports that the government response to the sightings was the Air Force was testing a new plane from a local base.  This was no plane!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15 minutes, the ship went straight up about 1000 ft and then shot off to the north at tremendous speed.

I saw no lights at first.  It was behind a stand of trees that had been planted for wind block.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left our friends house off 188th/116th in Renton at 1:00 Am.  I Checked the time before we left.  As we were traveling along 148th (Lake Youngs Road) southwards  we had just gone past 224th,   It was a cold clear night, moonless, I was leaning my head against the door glass watching the stars when I saw the object.  At first I thought it was a reflection on the glass because the image was faint.  I had my husband turn off the interrior lights and it was still there.  I couldn&#39;t hear anything so I had him turn off the radio. I rolled down the window.   It wasn&#39;t making any sound at all.  It was staying with us as we drove along.  My husband never saw it because of it&#39;s angle to the roof of the car.  I wouldn&#39;t have seen it myself if I hadn&#39;t been leaning against the window looking straight up.  When we came the stop sign where 148th crosses 240th street I watched the object go on over the hill.  In 1974 there were no houses up there.  I heaved a sigh of reliefe because this really spooked me.  Then as we were coming up on the stop sign at 256th a light caught my attention.  It was the object again.  This time coming at us head on about 30 feef off the ground.  We were stopped at the stop sign at this point and I paniced because at the nose of the object was what appeared a wide wind screen, with phosphorus green light emitting with the shape of a  humanoid in the middle.  I screamed at my husband to get us out of there.  He took off with tires screaming,  I lost my memory of the trip home from this point.  The next thing I remember is coming up on the stop sign at highway 18 on Wax Road.  I am completely calm, not worried or anxious.  We arrived home about 5 minutes later.  I took our baby son into his room and put him to bed and then took myself to our room.  The clock on the side of the bed said 3:18 A.M.  This trip we took from our friends home would take 20 minutes any day of the week, day or night.  We had lost 2 hours.  But I managed to convince myself that I must have read the clock wrong before! we left Renton.  I didn&#39;t know anything about UFO&#39;s or their characteristics at the time and it was easy to write off as just a strange incident in our lives.  After I filed my previous report (9/6/97 incident) I was just browsing your sight.  I read the report of the UFO Flap of 73, the Coyne Hellicopter Incident on 10/18 73 and  just freaked when I read the discription of the object.  It sounds so much like the object I saw on that cold January night.  I asked in my last report for someone to call me.  Now I really need to talk to someone.<n>
