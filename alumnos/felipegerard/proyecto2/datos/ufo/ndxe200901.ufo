My windows were open, but I heard no sound. I know the woman in the car next to me saw it too, but we did not communicate with each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was clearly capsule-shaped, (or rectangular with rounded edges) never blurred or faded, but seemed to be glowing from above. It was light bluish-green (more on the green side) and seemed like it was not too far up. It did not seem like it was in space. It looked clear or crisp like it was just over the valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was much faster than a plane, but not as fast as a shooting star or meteor, at least none that I have seen before. I was so sure that it was a close object that I was expecting a big crash or explosion or something after I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been looking on the news and online, but nobody has said anything.<n>

One of our friend starts talking something about Orion&#39;s belt and we were looking up. All of a sudden DIRECTLY above us we see these halo-like really dim white lights, it was three of them and they formed the shape of a triangle. It was about the height of helicopters flying around when there&#39;s news and chases and things of that nature. It made a weird &#34;hoovering?&#34; sound, its hard to explain really. We were all really surprised as it was flying relatively low. The skies were really clear and we only saw it for about 10 seconds just to where we were able to see it as the light were really dim and could not see it that far after it passed. This has been my very first sighting and I am very intrigued by what it could be. I did not manage to get any pictures of it as I did not have my cell on me and was very short in length, but there was 8 witnesses to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/31/09 21:00|Downey|CA|Sphere|10 minutes|3 separate pairs and one single object, separate but similar movements and trajectories.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68375.html|4|ndxe200901| 3 separate pairs and one single object, separate but similar movements and trajectories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1/31/2009.  Approx. 9:00 PM, Downey, CA.   I went out to my car to go to the market.  I always look up and watch the moon and Venus (earlier this month or late last month you could see Venus, Mercury and Jupiter up there).  Anyway I was looking toward the southwestern sky, then instead of getting into my car I started looking up at the dipper in the southeastern sky and wondering which stars made up the handle.  A few seconds into this I notice 2 white objects, round but not sure if spheric, way up high in the sky, almost blending with the stars, but la bit larger and not as bright.  As I looked up the two objects seemed to be about the width of 2 fingers apart and moving west at an angle of maybe 25 degrees.  No blinking lights, no sounds.  As they passed what would be an imaginary line dividing the S/E and S/W sky, one seemd to move either upward or south and I lost sight of it, while at the same time watching the second one, which seemed to linger in a slow change of direction and began moving in a pretty much straight line toward the northeastern sky.  I followed its trajectory until somewhere high in the N/E I lost it.  As I turned to look back south, I saw 2 more, similar objects, same direction of travel initially as the first pair.  This time, the lower object continued toward the west, I believe I saw it looking sort of reddish, I kept looking back and forth between the two, then lost sight of the one headed west.  .  I looked back and saw the top one now turn also toward the N/E direction and followed the same trajectory as the one other one from the firts pair.  I thought that was strange movement for what I thought at first might be helium balloons from a party maybe.  But the night was still, the leaves on the trees around me were not really moving, unless there might have been some high winds way up in the sky.  But it they were balloons and there was wind that blew them from the S/W to the N/E, why didn&#39;t BOTH objects get blown N/E?   How could one go west and another sout! h up jus t upward?  So I don&#39;t think they were balloons, and they didn&#39;t look like nor behave like airplanes that I know.  Anyway, I saw a THIRD pair coming from the same S/E area, same trajectory as the other two pairs, but this pair did not go as far west as the first two pairs.  This third pair seemed to separate almost due south from my vantage point, not disappeared form sight maybe going further south or just &#34;up&#34; and the other took the SAME trajectory as the other 2 going N/E.  Finally I saw ONE SINGLE object coming again from the same S/E location, went twestward o about due south from me, turned and travelled toward the same N/E direction as the other three.  That made FOUIR going N/E, ONE went west and TWO went either south of me or just &#34;up.&#34;   I think I can rule out party balloons and I think I can rule out airplanes because airplanes would need a wider area to change directions like these did.  What else they could have been I don&#39;t know.  I just did not see any details on the objects, such as lights, lines, windows, etc. - just a roundis;h-looking object.  By the way, these were not moving slowly like a balloon might be, and as they travelled N/E they seemed propelled and not just blowing in the wind!  If this is what an UFO does then I saw 7 of them.  If not, who knows what they were!   But they WERE!<n>

Seen several nights for over an hour each time|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68370.html|5|ndxe200901| Very Bright White light w/several smaller red, blue lights. Seen several nights for over an hour each time<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked outside and saw a very bright light in the western sky about 9pm.  At first I thought it was an airplane.  The light appeared to be moving slowly, like an airplane.  I stopped to watch it.  Then I noticed the light was stationary.  We live on a large 2,000+ acre Lake.  The light was across the lake from us and over land.  I am guessing it was  10 miles from me.   The light appeared stationary.  At first, I thought it was moving, I stopped to watch it.  The light was about the height a low flying  airplane would be flying at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it, it appeared to be getting larger and brighter.  I then thought it must be an airplane heading  straight toward me.  However, as I watched it, it seemed to be hovering and moving very little.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it 15 minutes.  It was a very bright white light.  There seemed to be smaller red and blue lights near the bright white light.   The lights seemed to be sort of &#34;twinkling&#34;.  There was some kind of &#34;form&#34; of a shadow structure where the lights were, but I could not determine any shape.  It was too far away from me.  It was not directly overhead, it was in the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was cold outside, so I did not want to stay outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked back inside and told my husband &#34;there is an UFO outside&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He replied &#34;You mean that bright white light?  It has been out there for several nights this week&#34;.  I could not believe he did not mention it to me before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband went outside and said &#34;that is the same light that I have been seeing all week.&#34;  He goes outside at night more than I do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was busy cooking at the time.  I went back outside an hour later, and the light was still there.  The light seemed to have dropped a little lower to the horizen, and it was not as bright as it had been.  I did not stay outside because it was cold.  I did go back outside a couple of hours later, and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not sure how to photograph it in the dark when it was so far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a feeling the light may be back out there tomorrow night.  I will look for it and try to watch what it does.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/31/09 21:00|Hackberry|LA|Other|3 to 4 mins|Observatory in the Sky|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70945.html|6|ndxe200901| Observatory in the Sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my boyriend was heading to store before it closed approximately at 9pm. When we reached to stop sign at hwy 27 there was a strange blue ball type light coming from the west (where we have a goverment oil reserve) heading straight to us.  I kept asking my boyfriend, &#34;what is that, what is that?&#34;  I got my phone and reached out the window and started snapping pictures.  It appeared to reach the Hwy an seemed like it stalled a moment as if it were watching us and turn right running along side of the road heading south to the gulf of mexico, at this point it seemed to have a dark formation triangle like with a circle of lights that were vertical in shape, there was no noise, it was pretty low but not low enough to get a positive look.  It was not going that fast but was steady pulling away from us as we reached the store it crossed over the Hwy still heading south but had left the curvy roadway and was flying (floating like) over pasture and marsh area&#39;s.  I called my girlfriend  who lived in the area it appeared to be passing but she did not see anything.  It disappeared into the night.  The pictures are crazy.<n>

It got very bright and then disappeared, which it did a few times until it stayed bright.  (My radar detector went off saying K band like crazy each time that the light appeared and then would stop after it disappeared.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have grown up in this area and my radar does not usually go off in that area and it didnt go off the next day when I went back to the same spot so it must&#39;ve been picking up something that was emitted from the light.  It would also be worthy to note that this light was very close to the ground, and from my perspective I would say it was no higher than a three story building.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, from the original light, came three others that branched out into a diagonal line formation, the lowest light being at the right and the highest at the left...somewhat like this -&gt; \  (we had no idea that there was other lights behind the first until they appeared; it was as if they were &#34;turned off&#34; until they came into action).<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were redish orange and hovered in place.  When they moved into the diagonal formation it was precise and quick.  The entire sighting happened over a ten minute period or so, and then the lights just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After waiting around for about an hour for the lights to reappear we gave up looking and went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all got a very good look at these lights and there is no way that they could have been any sort of aircraft.  Also, I would like to state that my friends and I had/have been noticing very similar lights in the sky that would become very bright and then disappear but this sighting is the only one in which the lights moved about into a formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. The reason that I havent put this on here until now is because i had no idea that this website existed!!!  We were all very freaked out and the whole radar detector thing made it even more eerie!<n>

We thought it might be a helicopter or tower of some sort, but as we got closer the bright light became 3 lights, then one blinking light.  As we drove past, there were no lights on the back side of whatever it was.  Then the light was back, then gone again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later the passenger of the car saw what appeared to be a bright meteor streak across the sky, but then as the glow “burned out” the object moved 90 degrees from its previous path and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When we looked at what she was talking about at first we thought it was an airplane and then realized it wasn’t so we pull over into a parking lot.  When we were watching this craft is was circular and had different lights flashing from it.  The colors were red, blue, green and white.  It also had an aura around it.  We watch it for about an hour.  It just kept on floating from left to right and up and down.  Also coming closer to us then fading back away.  Then all of a sudden my husband decided to look directly up to see if there was anything else in the sky.  We saw these small circular objects moving so fast through the sky, moving left to right and diagonally.  One of the objects went directly towards an airplane it looked like it was going to hit it.  We think the first craft we saw might have been commutating with the little crafts.  During this sighting my husband had called his mother and his brother to tell them to look in the sky toward the east to see if they can see what we were seeing.   After a few minutes his brother saw it and then so did his mother.  His brother also saw the little crafts going toward the airplane and zipping back and forth in the sky.  We were all amazed at what we were seeing, it was very weird.  This was my first sighting of a UFO, this was my husband’s second sighting.  It all seem too weird to be true but it was since his family seen it too and they were on the other side of the town.  Well needless to say that it was our daughters’ first UFO sighting, she was really scared and kept her eyes closed and said can we just get to the store already.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Object may have been Sirius.

The white/silver thing had vanished so I put away my video camera and went back to my yard work. Then I saw the blue/green translucent worm. It was morphing and moving, these colors were like nothing I’ve ever seen. I went back inside and grabbed the video camera again. I managed to get some of this one on DV tape, but the colors are not as intense as watching it live. Again the wind was out of the west, and this object is moving against the wind to the west. I called my wife out so she could see it too. It would stay stationary for a while then it would go up or down in my sky and go east sometimes then west. This was a perfectly clear day, and after this one vanished after 20 minutes, I saw a strange black, two engine jet fly over where the two objects had both been.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was removing a wasp nest from the eve of my house with a stream of water from a garden hose.  After I knocked it down and was spraying the wasps I looked up at the eve and saw this white/silver shimmering object staying stationary in the sky.  As I watched it, I saw it moving slowly left and right.  It did not seem to be affected by the wind.  The wind was out of the west maybe 5 mph. at ground level.  I went inside and grabbed my video camera.  It is really hard to film these things.  I got some of it on tape but I’m disappointed at my video.  At least I managed to capture something.  The white/silver thing moved back to the west, against the wind, hovering then moving again.  I called my wife out to look at it and my kids saw it too.  Unimpressed they went back into the house.  I watched and tried to get it on film for over 15 minutes, and then it just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Three photos forwarded by witness.

I noticed an object in the sky to the west of me hovering for a few minutes .I could not tell if it was an airplane or a helicoptor it was just too far away. About another mile up the road at a redlight I noticed it was still in the same position.I pointed it out jokingly to my daughter &#34;theres a ufo!&#34;,figuring it was just a plane or helicoptor. I watched it out of my window on and off for about another mile or two  This is where it gets interesting, After passing the Red Roof Inn on Thomas Road I looked again and it was still there. I looked at traffic, proceded through the red light on the south side of the Thomas Road I-20 overpass, (distance of about 300 yards to the top of the overpass) and thought I was going to get a good look at the object but it was totally gone!!  I pointed this out to my daughter and she was shocked that it was gone to!  I have no idea what the object was, it was not flashing lights of any kind it did not leave an exhaust trail and it did not seem to move and was only visible to me for a maximum of 2 to 3 minutes .There is absolutly no way an airplane could have moved from the last position, to not being able to be seen ,a distance of 300 yards drivin from a stop light!!  I hope my daughter and I are not the only ones to report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

All the planes up there criss crossing then I see this thing just bolting in a unimanagable rate of speed and going in a straight line.  This could have been reflection of high noon sun on a passing satelite.  Either way it had no wings and was way above the highest of planes in the blue sky.  No trail what so ever. All silver perfect circle.<n>

For some odd reason, there was not one car in sight.  My husband casually said, &#34;Well, would you look at that, an unidentified flying object&#34;.  I looked up to the northeast, and what we saw appeared to be about 2 miles away, black, and cigar shaped.  I said to him that I thought it was an airplane.  He asked me just what kind of plane did I know that looked like that.  Just as soon as he said that, the object flew instantly towards us and now was not even a quarter mile away in the sky.  It changed shape, still black, but looked like liquid metal.  It became egg-shaped and was very shiny, however, the sun was blocked by solid cloud cover, so I didn&#39;t make sense that the object was reflecting light.  It hovered in the same spot for about 15 seconds, then, with amazing speed, shot straight to the east and stopped instantly, hovering over the middle school.  I was now heading east in my car to get closer to it.  I traveled two city blocks, looking straight at the object.  When I became close, approximately 1/2 city block, it again shot off straight east and disappeared from sight.  My husband and I racked out brains trying to figure out what it could have been.  We have never seen anything move that fast, stop to hover just as fast, change shape, you name it.  It had no windows, no landing gear, nothing.  It just looked like a black and metallic, with a liquid mercury appearance.  I wish I knew who to contact that would have access to radar in the panhandle of Nebraska area (close to Wyoming border) to see if anything was spotted on the morning of 1/31/9 in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were well elevated and appeared stationary. I tried to take a picture but all I had was my cell phone camera and the light did not pick up on the camera. I drove back to work—about 3 miles away. The lights remained. I had a coworker shut down the parking lot lights and he visually confirmed by him. I called home, which is about 10-15 mile away and my 17 year old son and my wife could see them also. They may have drifted eastwards. They seemed to flash. One disappeared and the other remained for several minutes. It then flashed and disappeared. There elevation was hard to determine, but were not low as they were visible over terrain that rises bout 1000 ft over the valley floor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the observers, we are both US Govt employees.

It is a dark, dead, straight stretch of road. More than fifty miles ahead, we could see an active city of flashing white glow.  As we neared the city of lights hovering over the left side, my wife pulled off the road and she said,  “Look at this!” I saw a spectacle of the brightest white flashing light ever experienced.  The object was hovering approximately 40 yards away and 50 feet above the ground.  It was so bright in the night sky that I could not make out the shape of the object, or objects.  It was hovering, but not completely stationary, as it slowly wavered 10 degrees down it’s path.  There was no sound.  I peered into the luminescence as I looked up to this swiveling white light at the top sending beams high into the dark sky.  Below, there was a row of blue lights possibly stretching 30 yards across.   I franticly repeated, “What is this?” My wife, my eighteen-year-old daughter and ten-year-old grandson were speechless as we, all, looked on in awe.  This experience lasted a mere minute before I resolved quickly, “I’m gonna grab my camera”, reaching in the back window for my camcorder.  Suddenly, as I said this, the lights/object strobe-shifted miles down the road.  The movement was unworldly as there was no humanly audible sound nor any notice of motion to reach it’s distance.  I, still, thought to capture the distant lights to record ‘something‘ of the phenomena.  Again, suddenly, as if there was connection of my intentions, the object shifted considerable distance down the road to be a mere glow.  Within two seconds, the object was here and then had nearly disappeared.  I felt cheated.  My wife began turning the car around until our daughter cried out with all her fear and common sense, “No, don’t turn around!  Do not turn around!  Do not go after that thing!”  I had never seen my daughter so scared<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking through the rear window of the car, perplexed with the sudden distant remaining glow, I considered our fortune to live through this experience.  I was, almost hypnotically, mesmerized sensing a lapse of known reality by the object’s peculiar rapid movement.  Now, I question previous understanding.<n>

If I could estimate the length of the object(s) I would say about a half of a mile long. At first, there were about 30 red lights equally spaced, and then the lights would disappear, meeting at the center with only about 4 red lights remaining. This occurred about 3 times pretty fast. My friend got his phone out to take a picture, but by then, the lights went down to four, one more time, and then disappeared to the southeast. The direction we were facing was east. Reminder: this was spotted in Maryland but the location of the object could have easily been in West Virginia. This was very large and unexplainable. I explained it the best I can, but I just wanted to let everyone know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a very bright Crescent shape light about 1/2 mile into the woods just under the tree line and as wide as a house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live just north of the Baton Rouge metro airport and thought it was a plane. I walked outside to get a better perspective. I realized there was no sound. If this was a plane it would have been rattling my house. Not to mention, it would have been moving. It was completely stationary. It just hovered there in the woods and began to change the color of a harvest moon (orange). The brightness of the light was not as intense as this time passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I decided to get my video camera to show my husband what I saw. While I was scrambling to find it, the light was fading. The camera disc was full. So, I just stood and watched it shrink smaller and fade into a red/orange light the size of my hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was strange how it shrunk and faded. It just faded down to the center of the original light source. no sounds, just complete silence. The whole thing lasted about 10-15 min. Then the light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are in the winter season here and the trees are bare from hurricane Gustav and the cold. So the visiblity through the woods was pretty clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father is retired Chief of police for the Baton Rouge airport. I called he to see if this could have been some sort of exercise, runway lights, something. He said I lived too far north of the airport to experience any of these things. So that&#39;s why I am reporting this Unidentified hovering light experience. I even checked to see if there was a lunar eclipse that night, Since what I witnessed was in the west.<n>

On the way back, we were driving down our road when my mom saw something.  She pointed out a strange light near this red blinking airplane light thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, the light color was a goldish yellow I guess.  Perhaps the color of a star or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it might be another light like the airplane one then remembered, they didn&#39;t put up any new lights!  So we watched this light in the sky as we were driving and it didn&#39;t move.  Didn&#39;t do anything!  But it was weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size was to large to be a star or planet, and it was to close to the ground. It was just a strange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every night since then I look out my windows at the red light to see if the other light is there.  Hasn&#39;t been since.<n>

They moved off and into the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran out from under the carport to see if there was some sort of object projecting the bars.  I did not see anything in the sky.

The sky was bright due to the parking lot and didn&#39;t have many stars. All you could see was the crescent moon to my right and a bright star below it. I looked up momentarily and something caught my attention. It was a unique red star, it didn&#39;t look like the red of a plane. It looked more like mars but even brighter. It went right under the moon and moved towards the north. I thought it&#39;s gotta be a plane at first but as I kept watching it, I saw no flashing lights. Planes always fly over from the north and so as I was watching it a plane flew by and the object started following it. It was moving very slowly and would move subtly up and down as it went in a northern direction. Then it went more towards the west, and sort of stopped in one spot (turning into odd shapes of lights) and started coming back towards me. This is when it got weird, Instead of being one bright red light I saw 2. Then it was coming even closer, and I saw 2 red lights and an almost orange light. It was not flashing. It then turned it&#39;s shape or did something and had 3 red lights (sort of orange hue) in the shape of a triangle. It then flew slowly right over my head. I could actually see the outline of the object. It appeared to almost change shape before my eyes, but I made out a triangle. It flew over me and then went back towards the east, almost did an oval shape. At this point I was convinced this was not a plane or a helicopter. It started moving back towards the north. I was standing outside of my car with my lights on so I flashed my lights at it. It then actually came back towards me after doing this. I yelled at a co-worker to come look at it. It was changing from white to red erratically. Not flashing, just changing. Like possibly rotating or changing its shape. When I flashed my lights at it, it was pretty far away and once I yelled at the co-worker to come look it started coming back towards me, this time lower and even more over my head. After it went over our heads, it had 2 bright light wh! ites on the back. We could see the shape of it. It was triangle but had other things on it. He thought it looked like a satellite but agreed it was way too low. It then went back towards the north and I stopped watching it. We see planes fly over everyday since there is an airport close by, but this was beyond bizarre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD))<n>

So i got my tripod out and filmed it for 20 min. During that 20 min duration, it changed color from blue, to a neon green, then to a deep purple. When it became purple, the size of the object got smaller and then after some adjusting of the camera it then got big and had a shape of a ship. The ship was like a saucer but had a orangish/brown plasma below it and with my camera holding still, it moved across the screen at 70x zoom. As time went by, the object started to condense down to a smaller object and became a bright neon green again and was switching colors repeatedly. The object pulsated as it was condensing down to its smaller form as seen on my video. The object then got so small that i lost it over the mountains west of my house. I have great footage of it and no one seems to know what it is. I took it to a meteorologist and he didn&#39;t know what to make of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Altitude was unknown, as no relative size of the two points of light could be discerned. Objects hovered for about 10 seconds before slowly fading away. As they lights faded, they appeared to have a light &#34;halo&#34; surrounding them. No navigation and/or anti-collision lights were seen at any time. Time was about 1:15 before sunrise, so reflected pre-dawn sun was probably not the cause, nor Iridium &#34;flash&#34; due to lights being two distinct objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Objects appeared to be about the size of Venus, only side-by-side. Neither Venus nor Mercury nor any other bright celestial body was out at that time of the morning. Further, Venus was, at the time of the sighting, in the evening sky and does not appear as two bodies. Finally Venus or Mercury would have been in the wrong part of the sky (the western part of the sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Area of sighting is in a very-highly traveled approach flight path to Van Nuys, Burbank and LAX airports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness is a former Air Force test pilot (now civilian commercial pilot) with over 8000 hours of flight time as well as an amateur astronomer with 35 years experience in astronomical observation.<n>

I look up the stars in the sky when i smoke quite often.  I noticed an extremely large triangular shaped craft pass over us and eventually disapper over over and behind the treeline.  Because it was so large it appeared to be moving slower than it was.  It had white lights at each corner, and one inbetween each corner light.  They were dimmed out.  It appeared that the craft was in blackout mode. It made no noise whatsoever. There is no way possible it was a conventional or military aircraft.  Earlier in the day I noticed A-10 warthog jets flying around.  A few minutes after my sighting i saw them again.  I served in the military and know their sounds and characteristics like the back of my hand.  I also believe these are the aircraft that the person saw from the other sighting from North Coventry on this site.  I believe it was from december.  The tailfin description matches an A-10 perfectly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was as bright as the evening star. We were walking near the corner of Citrustree and Santa Gertrudes in East Whittier. It then disappeared, but then reappeared very faint. It continued to travel at a high rate of speed getting larger as it came closer to us. The light traveled in a Southeast direction, but change color from white to orange to red then back to white. Each color lasting for for a few seconds. There were no trademark flashing lights like aircraft, and it was not in the typical flight pattern of this area. We have lived here in Whittier, CA our whole life right under the LAX final approach pattern and it looked nothing like an aircraft. It was traveling much too fast to be an airplane or helicopter. There was no sound. After watching this for about 3 to 4 minutes the the Fireball vanished into thin air. We continued to watch the area for another few minutes and nothing could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They exhibited behavior not typical of airplanes or aircraft of any kind. They also did not exhibit behavior of falling debris such as a meteor or other object entering our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m hoping the video i did capture will be of some use, but i will admit it&#39;s not very good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it was taken with my Canon Powershot digital camera while in video mode. At times i tried to zoom in and the picture would get blurry so i would have to zoom out and recenter on the lights  A light would appear..and something would seem to &#34;shoot off&#34; from it and then another  would appear next to it...in almost a perfectly straight line. At first this was slow, then at the end the lights would appear more rapidly and closer together. And then it stopped.I did not count how many appeared altogether as i was in awe. I have never witnessed thes lights in this type of formation, appearing one after another next to the other in a line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and my father have seen these lights, or something similar in the same area of the sky at different times for the past 15 years or more.They do not appear often at all or for very long. Sometimes they just appear in different places and blink off and on, and sometimes they move. Thats the best explanation i have for the events that i witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also would like to apologize for the end of the video because i did not capture all of the event. It started a few minutes before, and as i was attempting to capture, my memory card became full and i had to stop to get another. When i did, thats when they started appearing in rapid succession and closer together and then suddenly they stopped. At all times and during every occurence there has been no sound coming from the direction in which the lights appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you are interested in this video i could send you a copy on cd-rom or dvd format by mail, however the file itself is much too large to email.it is approximately 102 megabytes in size as i have my camera set to maximum video resolution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I eagerly await your response.<n>

I was heading north north east, so I was looking in the direction of Rhodes Island. As I looked into the sky I saw a rather large light and tried to make some sense of this and then it just took off north towards Massachusetts. I thought it was stationary at first. Nothing can move as fast as this except a fireball! I didn’t expect it to move and then it was gone. It was not way out in space, it’s very hard to say how far it was but 2-10 miles maybe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was round and the size of a light bulb. Nothing like the size of a star or planet or anything like that. This was close and it did not have any like light rays glistening from it like must light objects do. The speed when it took off was what made me realize this was something unusual. I know how fast a fireball travels because I saw one last year. It streaked across the sky coming Massachusetts and exploded in a bright flash over Rhode Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My husband, I and two boys had to run to Brownwood last night from Bangs to get something to eat at a local fast food chain. My husband waited in the car while the boys and I ran inside to place a order. When we came out to the car, my husband said look there are lights in the sky, it looks like a UFO. I said yea right..He said no really, look over there. I looked up and noticed the most amazing thing. The lights appeared and vanished. Then further away, they appeared and vanished again. I was totally shocked. My boys noticed the lights as well. My husband said that while we were inside the fast food chain, he had saw the lights first appear over Walmart, and it did the same pattern 3 times while we were inside. The appearing and then vanishing on 3 different occasions. I could not believe what I was seeing, because I am normally a very skeptical person, and I saw it with my own eyes. The first time I noticed the lights they were between Home Depot and Walmart, and the second time I saw them they were over the Home Depot store. We tried to drive back behind the store in the direction that the lights were headed, but did not see them again...My son tried to record the lights on his cell phone, but the guard lights around Home Depot was putting a glare on his phone. I just wanted to respond to this, because I know that I saw them, and I am so glad someone came forward to talk about this. I had told my husband last night, to contact someone, but he said no one would believe the story without pictures. I am convinced there was something going on last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very foggy day but not so bad on HWY 121.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading south toward Southlake and as I got to Spring Creek Pkwy, I notice a circle shaped object with lots of lights on top of HWY 121. (about 6:30 am )  I thought that I was seeing things but right after that another one following each other was traveling very slowly like they were observing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not too many cars on the road but very few cars that were traveling in my direction were braking to watch.  It was impossible to stop so I then stopped in the nearest station and called the non-emergency police 972 941-2142.  They advised me to call FAA ( 206 722-3000 ), which I did and got a voice mail of Mr. Davenport is full.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the police back and they told me that was the only number they had and for me to report and also fill out form on line at www.ufocenter.com  I saw total of 4 circle shape objects traveling slowly above HWY 121 with very bright lights perhaps 14-16 big round lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks much.<n>

I first thought nothing of it and presumed it must have been light from a car headlight. Then it happened again, but this time the light moved very quickly and zigzagged through the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking that some kids were playing with a torch, I looked out of the window so see the source of the light. I waited there for roughly 40 seconds before I noticed a light 0.5 miles away on the other side of the lake, behind a small wooded area opposite the harbour. It appeared to be a ball of light, perfectly spherical with what I would estimate to have a diameter of 15-20 feet and pulsed slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere moved at a jogging pace and weaved aimlessly through the trees. It would appear to slowly move down to the lakeside and stop there after completing a circuit of the wooded area. The sphere appeared to rotate as it would beam light every 1 minute, which I believe I first saw beaming through my bedroom window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke my wife and she was curious to what it could be, so she went to look in my son’s room for binoculars. By the time she returned to the bedroom the light had stopped, but then over the lake, probable 0.8 miles from the wooded area where we had seen the light, a strobe light flickered and then disappeared over the banks of the lake at 25 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They would shot to the left or right and come back to about the same spot.  I couldn’t make out shapes because they looked exactly as stars but you could tell it wasn’t because of the movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This continued for a while and after about 5 minutes I told my girl friend to make sure I wasn’t going crazy and she seen the same thing.

I walked inside to retrive my cell phone as to take a picture in which I did but they look like faint white lights at best.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my daughter whom was upstairs yet before she could make it out side we watched these objects rise about a 1/2 mile straight up &amp; then shoot of to the right at a speed that I can only explain as immpossible.

We were walking back to my house and we are looking at the clear sky and discussing about stars.  We saw a slow moving black object appeared on top of us moving in North-East direction.  For a second we were shocked we ran to my house  which was about 20 feet away and I called my wife out, three of us went to terrace and saw triangle move away slowly, after about a minute and half it disappeared from our view.  Since the triangle passed right above us were able to make out that it was a triangle, it was completely noiseless, moving as if its cruising.  It was moving at very low altitude i would guess not more than 70-80 meters from the ground. It had one red light in the centre of the triangle.  It was huge prob! ably size of a football stadium.  I am a guy who follow aircraft and aviation industry very closely and none of the know aircrafts come any where close to the triangle in terms of shape, size or cruising.

I was alone in the car going for a joyride.  I remember thinking to myself, &#34;I know I am going to see something extraordinary tonight.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where I was driving, there is a lot of air traffic.  I&#39;m very familiar with a lot of the aircrafts, frankly because I see them every night.  I remember looking toward the north sky, and seeing about 3 airplanes.  I looked back to the road, and noticed I was the only car driving Northbound (for at least a couple of miles). I looked back to where the planes were, and saw a huge white light in the middle of the sky. It looked unfamiliar to me. There were no flashing lights, or anything else that may have caused it to be recognized as an airplane. It was moving very slow. I was going about 40 mph (because I was the only one on the parkway). It slowly glided down the sky, and ended up on my left side, over the water. It stayed in that position, seeming to be following me, for about 7 minutes. Then it looked as if it was getting farther away... I drover under the overpass. Coming out the other side, I looked back to the sky, and the light was brighter than ever. It was if it had gotten closer in those few seconds. I was in total disbelief. I became scared because in my heart I knew something was watching me. I began to move slower. I took my eyes off of it for the last time. I looked back and it was gone.<n>
1/28/09 18:00|Nampa|ID|Light|Approx. 100 seconds|Interesting light in sky, definitely space-object, behaved like satellite, but was momentarily very, very bright|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68310.html|50|ndxe200901| Interesting light in sky, definitely space-object, behaved like satellite, but was momentarily very, very bright<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was right around 6PM local time, Sun had barely set, and I was standing in my backyard enjoying a cigarette. Was not looking at sky but eyes drawn to sky by radiant light suddenly appearing in the sky. It was as bright as an airliner&#39;s landing lights, when viewed about ~2000 feet above and ~2000 feet away from you, aimed in your direction. The light suddenly and rapidly dimmed into the very low apparent brightness of a satellite, and it cruised at satellite speeds directly overhead towards the southeast. I&#39;d say when I initially saw it - when it was really bright - it was about fifty degrees of arc above the eastern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d normally think it was a satellite. Speed was right, direction was right, and it crossed in my vision with the Sun below the horizon, and could have hit the satellite at just the right angle to make it very bright. But this thing was BRIGHT. It would have been a massive satellite to glare like that from so far away. I watch the ISS sometimes - actually look where it is on the internet and plan for it to fly over me in that very type of lighting situation - and it wasn&#39;t the ISS. In that lighting situation ISS does not get as bright, and then does not get so dim, as this thing did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other odd aspect of this thing&#39;s illumination was it did not ever get totally dark when it crossed the terminator heading to the southeastern horizon. When I&#39;ve observed the ISS in the same situation, it rapidly turns a gorgeous red and then fades into black at some point before crossing the other horizon. The ISS is spectacular when it does that. This thing did not disappear when it crossed the terminator. It was a very interesting phenomena.<n>

I watched it as I drove and then pulled off the road to get a better view and determine its speed, size, etc.  It was cone-shaped, with the open part up, but very nearly an isosceles triangle from my vantage point. It had what appeared to be a thin rod projecting from the bottom point of the cone.  At the end of the rod there appeared to be a shiny sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it as it floated in a stationary position.  After about 3 minutes, a C130 took off from SDF, flew by the UFO, and then headed west.  The UFO then almost immediatly headed east and increased its altitude.  The craft appeared to move at about the speed of a helicopter, but remained perfectly vertical from what I could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft was completely black except for the shiny sphere at the end of the rod.  My theory is that its visual stealthing wasn&#39;t working properly.  I did not take a photo because I was concerned about getting in trouble.  My assumption at that point was that it was a US military stealth drone of some sort.  Now I&#39;m not so sure and wish I had a picture so that I would know that I didn&#39;t halucinate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was black and very thin, moving around sort of crazy.  My friend saw it, but did not believe in UFO&#39;s.  So, I stood there watching it fly, spinning, the turning into a sphere, then disappearing and coming back.  It repeated that for about one minute, and then it was gone.  I stood there for another minute, but it did not come back.  There was no lights, or any other thing besides the flat circle.  I was going to take a picture with my cell phone, but it would not turn on.  So I thought the craft in the air was intercepting with my phone somehow.  Once it was gone, my phone turned on.  I was not scared, but very excited I actually saw a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Eli In Albuquerque<n>

I live on the 17th floor of an apartment building.  My bedroom window faces east.  There are a series of condomiums at 30-35 floors each, approximately 10 km away in the east.  The light I saw was above the set of condominiums, although I believe the light was much further away and only appeared to be above the condos.  I first thought the light was an airplane, but understood that planes do not take-off or land at Pearson International Airport between early morning hours.  The light first moved to the south at a slow pace, then disappeared.  A second later, it would light up again, only it would appear further north.  My guess is it moved approximately 1 km north from the spot when the light went off a second earlier.  The light moved again in a slow speed to the north this time, turn off, and re-appear further to the south approximately a km away again.  The distance it moved is just my estimate.  This movement would randomly continue for 15 minutes.  Because I was in awe, and aware it was not anything familiar, I watched the entire event which lasted approximately 15 minutes.  The light finally dissipated for the last time and never re-appeared.  I google searched the event several days later, and found that a report was filed on a UFO website which described a sighting in the very same area and approximate time,  although the sighting was reported earlier in the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be hovering above somewhere over the town of Hermon Maine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was initially slowly making it&#39;s way left towards Bangor then it stopped in mid air and hovered for about 30 seconds, it then moved back towards the right and stopped and hovered again, it hovered for about 2 minutes and then slowly started hovering straight down until it dissapeared out of sight due to the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had distinct white and red flashing lights that didn&#39;t match up to any plane or helicopter that I&#39;ve seen at night before. It also didn&#39;t have any audible sound in the sky like a plane would. It also seemed quite low in the sky as well as moved any direction it pleased.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandfather also witnessed it right along side of me. A gentlemen who works with my grandfather said his wife (and her female passenger in her car) saw the same U.F.O. earlier that night at around 9:30 pm on her way home from the bangor/hermon area. She said that she stopped on a hill heading home to watch the U.F.O. and she said that it looked pretty nearby to her. She said it just hovered for a while and then dissapeared out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could clearly tell from my observations that night, that this was some type of unexplainable U.F.O. space craft.<n>

It was close to 10 pm in the north area of Laredo, TX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we turn south in one of the streets, we immediately noticed a very bright large stream of light ahead of us in the sky.  The stream of light was running horizontally illuminating the darkness east side of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both looked trying to figure out what it was or where the light was coming from.  We realized that it was from a large object with dimmer light and haze floating in the sky.  The stream of light was like two huge lamps pointing east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We can not precisely tell the form of the object producing the stream of light, but can definitely say it was moving and shortening the stream of light until both, object &amp; light totally disappear instantly in front of our eyes like a flash!!!<n>

From what I could see of the front of the craft at that moment, it was equal in width to a large 747 jet, and had two large solid white lights on each end, and a small blinking redish light somwehere else on the object. It was fairly low to the ground, and I watched through my passenger windows as it flew over my car and temporarily out of my sight, so I turned out my driver&#39;s window, looking back and forth to the road, to wait for the object to re-appear, but not seeing it for approximately 20 seconds. I looked forward and saw the object was now in clear view, but substantially ahead of me on the highway still traveling south. At this point I could see that the object was a solid black triangle against the dark bluish night sky, all sides the same length. The rear was a point, and the front was a flat side. The small blinking redish/pink light was on the tail and the large white lights were on the face of the two front tips of the triangle. It continued moving south away from the highway until out of sight. There was another large white light far away in that southern direction as well, though I saw no detail of it. If it was an airplane though it certainly saw this object as it was moving in it&#39;s general direction. I could clearly see though with no doubt in my mind that this was indeed a solid &#34;backwards&#34; flying equilateral triangle with no wings, engines or windows. I feel that some form of authorities in the areas that this object passed over should be contacted to see if others saw it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live in Christiansburg, Va. It was 6 am and fairly clear.  Sunrise wouldn’t be for almost an hour. I heard a funny noise above me, like a low rushing sound, and looked up and saw 3 steady white lights forming a perfect triangle. In the center was a flashing reddish light. It was very large and very low.  It moved slow, to slow for a jet. I’d say it was at about 500 ft. It was pitch black against the sky.  It was around 100ft between lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m a airplane buff and my first thought was, it must be a B-2 on a training mission, But the more I thought about it, I knew it that couldn’t be as the triangle of lights was to large and perfect. Running lights on a B-2 wouldn’t form a perfect triangle. I did some research on navigation lights and haven’t found anything that would match up too what I saw. A jet would have been louder. I could barely hear it when it went almost right over my head moving off to the southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’d like to know what I saw.<n>

She suddenly told me to look up in the sky.  I saw an odd orange-ish light coming almost overhead from the north, but didn’t have my glasses on so I couldn’t really make it out.  I ran in to get my glasses.  It was still overhead when I got back and we could both make out that there was a sort of cone-shape on top of the bright light.  There were no flashing lights and the light was not the normal color of a plane.  We are very near an airport and see jet lights constantly.  This craft was not going towards the airport.  It moved very slowly and with NO SOUND at all!  We watched it for at least 10 minutes.  As it moved south, it seemed to stop and hover over the city (Los Angeles) for a minute or two before it continued south.  We only stopped watching when it was out of sight.  This happened only 20 minutes ago!  It was not a helicopter.  We have those overhead constantly too – police and news copters every day.  The light was bright orange enough for my staffer to comment that it looked like a flaming piece of paper floating through the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a small business owner and my staffer is a professional who has worked for me for over 2 years.

I looked at the brightest spot in the sky i have ever seen. I showed my wife and asked her if it was a star. Just then the light went dim and the light went from round in shape to oblong. It then got really bright and moved about two finger widths to the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in the house to get the binoculars and it was in a different place. My wife said it moved fast.

Around 8:30 pm I looked up to the sky from the center of the lake, over the area of Mt. Arlington, and saw 3 red blinking lights in the sky.  It was in the eastern direction.   The 3 red lights were in the shape of a triangle, blinking, and stationary.  The blinked for about 10-15 minutes then disappeared.  At first I thought it was a light tower, but it was much to high, especially compared to the tower we could see in the same area.  Not planes either, as the airport has a holding pattern over the lake and we could see several airplanes flying in the same direction, in comparison just didn&#39;t look like an airplane.  We tried to take pictures with our camera phones, but the cameras were not good enough to capture what we saw<n>

By now my night vision was fairly good. I caught movement out of the left corner of my eye, and startled, I instinctively ducked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it was a hang-glider, basing this initial impression on the shape alone.  I was startled, as this had &#34;sneaked&#34; up on me without any noise, no cutting of the wind, nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming from due east headed due west, this triangle was of a conflicting description.  It was darker than the night sky, no lights, but also seemed somewhat transparent in that the outside/frame/shape was more clearly defined than the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Black but with the appearance of &#34;transparency&#34; toward the center mass.  Contradicting terms, but that&#39;s the best words I can use accurately.  It was so quiet and stealthy, had I not been looking south at that part of the sky at that moment, I would have never detected it.  That part startled me the most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It glided overhead, less than 400&#39; AGL, and remained in my vision for seven to nine seconds until it dropped behind the trees.  In other words, moving steadily, but not very fast.  I would estimate the width greater than 25 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hurlburt Field is due West of here.  If it maintained it&#39;s heading for a few more miles, it had to cross it the base and certainly the runway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my observation, there was no change in altitude or direction, nor change in velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We did not hear any noises such as engines, etc.  I watched whatever it was move slowly across the sky to the left and I walked to the street to see where it was going because the trees began to obstruct my view and I brought it to the attention of a neighbor, who was walking his dog, and he said the same thing &#34;that it had 3 bright orange lights, in a triangular formation, and was moving slowly and in perfect formation.  I decided to come online to see if anyone else had seen it and came across this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I happen to look to my left because something that wasn&#39;t there a second before now was. At first I thought the moon appeared, that it might have been blocked by a tree or something. That &#34;moon&#34; was far but close at the same time, too close to be the moon but it was completly full, and white. But it was a bit small for a full moon.. There seem to have been a bit of haze it front but it was really clear. And all of the sudden it dropped. Perfectly dropped down, my first thought was something crashed or the moon dropped but that was silly, I wanted to go around the bend to see a clearer view of the moon, that maybe it would have been obstructed but I knew it was not the moon, and I knew whatever was crashed. And  for sure, when I went arond the bend, there was nothing there, nothing in the sky...No reports of anything crashing, I called the West Paterson Police department, they probably thought i was crazy.<n>

I could not find my car keys, so I was using the spare keys to open the car. I was unable to open my car and after trying several times, one of my friends in the other car came out to help me. She was immediately able to open the car door and I got the hat from the car and gave it to her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was walking from my car to my friend’s car to say goodbye, I noticed a unusual object in the sky. I pointed it out to my friend, who was standing a few feet away from me at the time, and asked her what she thought it was. She said she did not know, but that it was flying very low. The object we saw shaped like a saucer, and it was flying at around a 30° angle to the ground. We could see there were lights at the bottom of it, arranged in a pattern I have never seen on an airplane or helicopter – there were three bright lights (one was orange/red, the other blue, and the third white/yellow) that were very large placed around the circumference of the aircraft. The lights were not beams; they did not illuminate the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some other characteristics of the aircraft that made us sure it was nothing we were familiar with was the speed and agility with which it moved, the UFO seemed to glide through the air at a very high speed without making a sound. It also looked much larger than any plane or helicopter flying at that distance. But the most unusual part of this sighting came when, more or less 45 seconds after first noticing it, the object passed behind a house. We waited around five seconds for it to come out from the other side of the house, but the object didn’t appear. I then started to run down the street to see if I could see it at a different angle, but it was clear the aircraft was no longer there. It was then that we were clear on the fact we had just witnessed a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a white ball of light about the size of a Baseball.  The only thing I can compare it to is a large smokeless roman candle projection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 12 feet away from me and 6 feet off the ground.  I got up and looked outside and saw nothing.  As the ground is covered in snow (at least six inches) I expected to see a smoking visible hole as the trajectory would have had it slam into the side of a foothill behind my house.  I found and saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I considered it might be ball lightning but it was clear and about 30 degrees outside.  It also made no sound I could hear.<n>

This afternoon I was at lunch and about 12:15 I happened to look up and saw it again, at very high altitude this bright white object hovering for several minutes right at the top of the sky (90 degrees)  it hovered in place for about 15 minutes then suddenly it released some smaller objects, (about fifteen in total) and as they started to drop, they formed a  V formation and began to move at high speed towards northern orange county.  The original object started to move in a north-east direction.  It took fifteen to 20 minutes to slowly move about 2-3 miles in that northeasterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time at a much higher altitude there was another object that had a very reflective surface as it would shimmer with the sunlight (it was not white like the first one, but actually reflected the sunlight).  This object was way much higher than the first one ( it was barely visible to the naked eye), and it stayed in place throughout all the time that the other object did its maneuvers. eventually after 20 minutes or so, I lost track of those two bright objects.  I am going to take my digital camera tomorrow to see if I can catch them again and see If I can take some pictures of them.  I am a county employee and I am college educated. I have studied astronomy and I can tell a star from a planet from an airplane at high altitude.  these were not planes or a mickey mouse balloon, and not seagulls either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

The couch and chair that we were on faces the kitchen.  In which I was baking cookies and would check periodically.  As i was sitting on the chair i noticed in the kitchen window a giant yellow/white light.  I could tell it wasnt a star it was shinning to much and it wasnt a plane cause it kept in one place for more then 20 mins.  So i went to go check out what exactly it was through the window.  As i looked at it. In the corner of my eye in the sky, to the right of this light about 100ft away was another object that caught my eye.  This object was much bigger in size like 3 times bigger.  Only this object was from what i saw for a split second kinda round a flash of lights around the side flashed in a row, then when i turned my eyes to look at it. The object was gone. I knew I saw something so i looked harder and when i looked the object infact had not dissapeared at all. it was still there just very well hidden. I cant really discribe it. It was as if the object had and was trying to blend in with the sky. It did really wel too.( at this point I called my mom to come and look at it incase my eyes were playing jokes on me or if i was krazie) After i pointed out where the hidden object was and then she too saw it. and was lost of words.) I only noticed it cause there was those flashes of quick light and there was a tiny outline of light and an object that was pretty big in size. The object stayed there for almost an hour then slowly started to completly dissapear. I tried to take a picture of the object but when I did the object was to well hidden to show up and the window gave a flash reflection when I tried.)  As for the other light that was there. that too had dissapeared about 2 mins after i started staring at the other object. the bright light literally just dissapeared in the blink of an eye. It was seriously something that was not normal. Ill never forget this night!!!<n>

I continued to watch the object while I said, &#34;Oh my god!&#34; to my mother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both stared at the. object while it flew and approx. 2000 feet in the air above the road and continued onward to it’s destination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I both agree on the fact that the most bizarre thing about the object was the color of its lights.  The lights were Red, Blue, and Green and were placed in a triangle like formation on the bottom of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object passed over, I thought I could clearly make the out a half-moon shaped object flying over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom thought it could have been an airplane but I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hopefully someone else will report a sighting like this and I know that it was one of the strangest things I have ever seen.<n>

It would only take a matter of 5 seconds or less to fade or to reappear in those intervals, and when it faded it would quickly fade to a faint dot before disappearing, rather like those old TV sets when they were switched off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not that it was going behind cloud for this would happen in clear sky, and when it was at it&#39;s brightest and cloud was obscuring it, it illuminated the cloud somewhat. It was as bright as aircraft landing lights, but obviously it&#39;s behavior and position seems to rule that out. While I was in Devon, my friend could still see it some 60 miles away in Bristol, when I called her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (She, and my mother-in-law, have apparently been observing this strange light for up to a week, usually in the same sector of the sky). I observed this phenomena for about an hour as I drove south, seeing it up to my right in a roughly SW direction at about 50° above the horizontal plane. My latitude was about 51°N.(2°W).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was an aircraft, but it was too high to have its landing lights on, and after a short amount of observation realized it was not behaving like an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It maintained what appeared to be a stationary position from my perspective for the hour I observed it, while I drove south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It certainly was not Venus, this I know for certain, I recognize that particular celestial body. Could it be some kind of supernovae? Or perhaps a very high and bright military craft, more likely in orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))<n>

Most times there would be a second &#34;star&#34; a little over dancing with the other.  When a plane would go by, the object would stop moving almost like it was just pretending to be a star.  After we noticed a couple, we started to look around for more, and indeed did realize not all the stars in the sky were infact stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went inside after about 40 minutes and after seeing about 5 objects circling and hoovering about the night sky.<n>

Then in THAT moment I  thought, &#34;Who&#39;s firing an illegal-grade bottle rocket&#34;. Upon hearing  a second LOUD boom that shook the ground enough to notice, not violently,  I thought, &#34;Oh My God, has a house blown up?&#34;. I turned to look out  the window to my west because the motion lights came on outside  due to the movment of the taller shubbery in a stiff sudden breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was aleast a 20-25 mph gust from the north. The sonic incident  lasted a total of about 7 to 9 seconds, and there was no light of any  that I noticed. The gust of wind was short-lived. I was headed for  the telephone, so I did not time it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fearing a gas leak/explosion, I called 911. This was at approximately  3:20 AM. The operator did not even ask details of my home address,  however, she did ask if I was near certain streets in my neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 30 seconds numerous police and fire vehicles were headed into  my neighborhood, and I went out to see and speak to an officer, telling  exactly what I experienced. My husband was asleep, but was awake when I  called for him, he says something woke him, but he did not know what it  was. He did mention feeling a tremble or shaking. He was upstairs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 3:30 AM my neighbor was walking from the north end of Woodlawn Avenue,  to his house at the next block south. He does not wish to be identified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He is a retired, very well educated professional in educational and  technical fields. He was awakened by the second loud boom, percieved that  it was at ground level, and had headed down the street because he was  sure someone&#39;s house had blown up. We dicussed, I told of the preceding  boom and whoosh-hishh, and that strange wind gust. It was very cold, and  I went inside, and called your hot-line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Police and fire sirens were continually heard from 3:20 AM to at least 4:45 AM by me, going all around the surrounding area from downtown to  northern Greensboro.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the weather conditions, because I wondered that this could have  somehow been a meteor event that was somehow without visible light. The  ceiling was 3500 feet and below, winds were 5 mph, the clouds were thick,  the humidity only 44%, temperature was 29 degrees F.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 50 years old, well-educated I suppose, and a professional musician.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I often work at night in my home. Unless someone tells me otherwise, I  know that first BOOm was above ground, sonic in nature, and am doubtful  that it was produced by military aircraft. My father was a pilot, and  in the 1960s we grew up under a sky where the military practiced sound  barrier breaking. That whhosh-hisshh was a descending sound. The second  BOOM was near or on ground level, the floor did shake. The wind, possibly,  associated with the event, I can&#39;t be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is an expansive park in the area where, from my perspective, this  event concluded, and the fast wind came from that area. As of now, no news  of damage, explosions, mischief, or anything else are known to me. If you  have more info or need more, please feel free to contact me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((names deleted))<n>

It was about 10:30 pm, and my mom was driving the car, my sister was in the back asleep. We were on the highway, and there were plenty of airplanes flying around. The sky was cloudy so instead of it being a dark blue/black color, it was sort of light purple and I could easily see the shapes of all of the airplanes against the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> hen I saw something flying that didn’t look like an airplane at all. It was triangular shaped and had an off-white light on each corner. It was flying very close to the ground and didn’t produce any noise. We drove almost directly under it. What struck me as most interesting was that it was flying in a straight line, at a constant medium speed, but was spinning around at the same time. At first all I saw were three lights spinning around, but as it got closer I saw that it was a triangle. It wasn’t large at all, and it looked to be about the size of a small commercial airplane, or even a jet. One of the lights on it was blinking as well. It was flying across the highway when I saw it, and I stared at it until it disappeared behind the trees on the sides of the highway. However, it didn’t look like it landed. I only saw one. I saw many other airplanes after that, including commercial airplanes, jets, and small individually owned ones, but none of them had the same shape, light color, or light blinking pattern as the triangular flying object did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been interested in UFO&#39;s and have believed in aliens for quite a while, and this definitely looked like something that I&#39;ve seen on UFO shows. In the past I thought that I&#39;d seen UFO&#39;s before, but it took me only a few seconds to realize that it was an airplane. This aircraft however showed no signs of being one.<n>

It is cold out so I only planned on having a quick cigarette. I saw this huge bight light. It looked like it was maybe hovering above Lake Ontario/ St-Lawrence river. I thought it might be a helicopter since I live close to the Kingston Airport, but the light did not move or have any other flashing lights just a blue haze around it. I called my mom out to the step and ask her if there were any planets that would be that huge and bright and close this time of year. She informed me that she did not hear of any on the news. Sometimes they let us know if you can see them without a telescope. I came back inside and googled planets to see if there was one this big and close. There were no head lines. The closest and brightest one for this time of year was Sirius and it was so far and small and distant compared to what I saw. I thought this bizzare and went outside to look again. The light was still there. It was. same spot, not moving, no sounds of engines. Just sat there motionless. I was just turing around to go back inside because it was so cold and I took one last look. I am not shitting you when I say this light took off almost faster than my eyes could see!! I didn&#39;t know what to do, and had to sit and think about what i just saw. Unless the news says otherwise I saw a UFO. I know I did. I cannot think of any other explanation. Weather balloons don&#39;t move that fast. Nor do helicopters or any airplane I have seen or know about! Looking from where I saw on my step this thing had to have been huge! I am terrible at guessing but the light was like 3 of the lights that the jail I work in. All put together.  I don&#39;t drink or do drugs and my mom saw it too!<n>

When he came home my daughter and I joined him outside to witness this object.  I noticed what looked to be reddish lights off to the far left and right of the object at times.

After explaining to my wife what happend i continued walking to my car and got in and drove down the road. As i got to the traffic lights at the bottom of the road i saw two more appear in the sky then the lights turned to green i raced up the road three hundred yards and pulled over and watched the other two fly away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We didn&#39;t know what it was. We called some friends in our same town, but not by our house. They saw it as well. I called my son (60 miles away) and he saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not move from 7:15 until 8:30. The shape looked round - like a bright round ball in the sky. I called a local weather man. He said it was Venus. It was emiting blue and red colors on the sides. Also a tail would come out sometimes on the top, sometimes on the bottom and sometimes on the sides. It never moved in those 75 minutes. It also looked like it had a huge search light beam that would occasionally point down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got some great photos of it. The photos showed the blue and red lights. It also showed 2 triangles. One triangle was on the left. It was an upside down triangle. On the right there was another triangle that was right side up. They appeared to be connected. One of the photos show 3 dots in the center of it. Some photos were just totally bizarre. It was like hyroglifics. We took photos of the orange ball, and they came back as designs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 8:30 p.m. I was assuming it was Venus, as it had not moved. I also assumed that the colors and tails we saw were just gas in the sky. However at 8:30, it moved quickly; first down towards the earth - lower in the sky. Then it quickly moved to our right. It moved so quickly that we had to change windows to see it. Then finally, it took a hard left turn and gradually vanished from site in the distance. That made me a believer. I doubt a planet like Venus would do that. There were 2 people in our house and we both saw everything. Our two friends in a different part of town saw exactly the same thing. We made them describe it on the phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what it was; but it certainly was some kind of unidentified object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD))<n>

We dug out an old telescope and sighted in - the results were a little more than startling - great black bands across the silvery surface look like an aerial view of a highway system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is one great black circle, with two small black circles forming a &#34;connect the dots&#34; triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object itself tends to stay in one spot, and moves very quickly for a short distance, and stops again. It tends to dim for a short time, and then become very bright.

A little before mid-day I was standing at the marked place (on wikimapia.org) waiting for my friend who was in a meeting. I was looking at the clear blue sky with very faint clouds and I saw this extremely shiny object in the sky. It seemed stationary and was very bright. I was amazed at the brightness and concentrated on it trying to identify what it could be and then I realized that it was moving very slowly, as if it was drifting. I thought maybe it could be a weather balloon (It probably could be, I am not sure. It was just a few hours that I was in Yavatmal and I have absolutely no Idea if weather baloons are released there. I believe weather baloons are white in colour but this thing seemed to reflect like it would be a foil. This thing looked like a perfect shiny sphere although in the  photograph it shows a different shape. I believe it could be because of &#39;camera shake&#39;. The picture is taken from a Cannon PowerShot A560 zoomed to the maximum digital 16x. It does make it shaky and difficult to catch a object so far away on the LCD screen and click it with a steady hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds later it seemed to slightly pick up speed. I am sure the wind on the ground was in the opposite direction this thing was going westward. It kept on accelerating gradually and then it stopped, looking brighter than before (or maybe I imagined that it looked brighter). It was hard trying to focus the eyes on it. Two of the workers there too asked me what it could be. I said it could be a weather balloon but I wonder if they knew what a weather balloon is. I wished I was carrying my binoculars that time. At that time I took a break by looking down cause my neck was feeling the strain looking straight up. When I looked up again I could not see it. It could not be, cause it was only a couple of seconds . . . It just could not disappear. It had not disappeared but it was way away westward and was moving really fast almost at the speed of a plane flying high. And then at one point it stopped and it started shrinking in size rapidly and then it was gone. I would attribute to the shrinking in size to it going higher and away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The accompanying photo was taken when it seemed to be steady. I could not bring it in frame (on the LCD) when it was moving faster. I realize now that I could have used the viewfinder instead of the LCD.  This is the only shot that I ve taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh one more thing I would like to mention that earlier I had seen two vapour clouds (one stretching east-west and the other north south) that a fighter jet leaves. I did ask my friend that time whether there is a air base nearby. I do believe that 2 to 4 vapour trails are left by jets over Yavatmal skies each day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I forgot to mention the above incident to my friend but at least two of his workers have seen this with me. Could be even more cause I was staring at the sky like crazy and I am sure many must have seen me staring and they too would have looked in the same direction.<n>

While watching it started showing light colors of red,blue,and white.  While I watched, it turned so that a circle of white lights could be seen.  Just as quick it turned again showing a triangle shape on the other side, which was dotted with white lights.  This object jumped up and down, left and right but never left the same location.  At 0345 went from this space to a location north of itself, without a trail and within a blink of the eye.  I kept watch until about 0430 at this time it began to fade in what appeared to be nothwest.  When I saw this object I got 2 coworkers to come see this strange object.

It appeared that all the lights though holding a steady pattern were travelling at different speeds since one seemed to be overtaking the others. Occasionally one light would come slightly into the forefront before disappearing behind clouds towards what would be the west from my vantage point. One light appeared to almost change shapes as it travelled at times looking almost like a bird and at others looking only like a round or oval piece of light. I do not know what it was; however, as a 5-year veteran of law enforcement in this area I know I have never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/23/09 22:45|Havana (Cuba)||Unknown|2 minutes  (approx.)|01/23/2009 22:45 Havana, Cuba (the country) Light only (yellow-orange) About 2 minutes It flew along the Beach Street of the City|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68233.html|113|ndxe200901| 01/23/2009 22:45 Havana, Cuba (the country) Light only (yellow-orange) About 2 minutes It flew along the Beach Street of the City<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10:45 PM Friday night a huge light of color between yellow and orange appeared flying over Malecón (Beach Street) of Havana. It followed a straight-line trajectory at a fixed altitude which did not seem very high at a comparatively high speed. It was clearly breaking the usual observation pattern for a plane: if you´re not close to an airport, a plane looks small and if it´s night time, then you see one light fixed and a couple of another ones blinking, all flying slow. In this case it was only one light much bigger than one of a plane flying at a considerable distance away and even bigger than lights of the sea ships sailing along the Malecón at a prudent distance for a while before entering Havana Bay. At the same time the speed of the movement of the light was much higher than the speed usually observable for a plane, although it did not cross the sky in a single moment. Given that it was night time, it was impossible to see the shape of the carrier of the light, but given all the described above it was leaving the impression of being something small flying at an altitude, let´s say, below heaviest rain clouds. Given straight-line trajectory and fixed altitude it was DEFINITEVELY not a meteorite, but something piloted or directed (although who knows, not necesserily extra-terrestrial). I saw it when it was already flying along the Malecón from the Bay to the West of the City, then it disappeared behind the roof of my building and I ran to the hall trying to see it from the other side. And I did. Around U.S. Interest Section the Malecon makes a slight turn, but the light kept flying straight becoming each smaller and weaker until disappearing. I did not hear any sound at any moment, although it did not give me time to open the windows, and the whole thing lasted for about a couple of minutes tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My partner called me, he is about a mile away locking up a pool and dock area, he tells me to look up in the sky, I  do, and there is a big triangle,( the point is at the rear, ) with red glowing lights at each point. Now when I say lights, I don&#39;t mean like car or plane or copter lights. They looked like a glow from a fire or if a trash can was turned upside down and a huge road flare was put inside of it. I didn&#39;t see anything else to describe, no hull, nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very cloudy that night due to an earlier rain, the clouds were low, and it moved right in them. It also moved very slow.  As it moved further away from me, the back      light trailed back and the front left light trailed to the left. And that is the last I seen of it. It was also big, hard to tell exactly, best guess, about 60 to 75 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was some what close, about 100 to 150 yards in front of me, and about 3 light poles up, I am not great at guessing feet when it comes to altitude. There was no sound that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Juan, my partner said he seen some of the hull, and saw the lights crossing. I will try to get him to fill a report out.<n>

Then all of the sudden, I heard an eerie droning sound. Scared, I got up to look out the window. There were 2 craft that seemed to be lowering a kind of large tray in to the river. This lasted for 30 minutes, and then the craft silently sped off to the west. After that period of 30 minutes, I started to feel nauseous and had a headache. I threw up and then went to bed.<n>

It appeared to be somewhat triangular with a tail, then there were like yellowish orange light that blinked, in between the red lights, however It was something that  I never seen before in my life, I dont know what it was I just know that its was not a helicopter or an airplane, there were no sound at all.

It was a little brighter than a star, but not much larger.  From my location it was about a 40 degree angle from the horizon in the SW sky, more southerly than westerly.  In relation to the nearby trees, I watched this light move in a straight line SW of its southerly/westerly location, and then abruptly veer upwards for about 5 minutes, then move in a straight line in an easterly direction, again for about 5 minutes.  It hung stationary for a few minutes, and then moved downwoards to approximately its original location, and began the same manouver again.  I also watched it do the same thing from a vantage point on a road nearby, with a tree branch as a reference to its movement.  There were airplanes in the sky, passing by, as well as a helicopter, and the light did not look like either of those possibilities. I reported this the the Surrey RCMP, who made out a report.  I also saw this similar light tonight, but could not watch for long, since I was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))<n>

The light was very low compared to the height of most air craft in the area.  We continued to watch the light as we drove home and the light continued to remain in the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we arrived home, I walked to the pasture, with my wife and continued to watch the light for several more minutes.   My wife grew bored and went into the house.  I continued to watch the light for about 15 to 20 more minutes until clouds moved in around the light and the light grew dimmer, due to the clouds.  I continued to watch the light until it faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light did bob in the air and I guess it to have been ten to fifteen miles away.  While watching the light, I saw two air craft fly past the light, although the air craft appeared to be further away from me.  The size of the light was difficult to determine given the distance although it did appear to be as large as a normal commercial plane, although the light was very bright, brighter than what I would expect to see and have seen in the past on commercial planes.  I did not see any wings, flashing lights or any other indicator that would have made me think it was a plane, besides the fact it remained in the same place for about 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing at 32degrees 39’07.61”N and 96degrees 17’27.92”W, looking almost due west.  The light was visible just over the trees and as stated previously, much lower than any aircraft I have seen in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to contact the Naval Air Station and the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, both to no avail.  I am not a UFO buff, not even sure that I buy into the whole UFO thing, although I know that what I saw and watched for quite some time, was not normal and did not act like any aircraft I have ever seen in this area or any other area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.

While out, I was looking around the sky because there seemed to be very few stars out.  When I looked West, I saw a lone bright object which appeared to be about the height of a high flying plane.  Although I expected it to move across the sky until it was out of sight, it didn&#39;t move.  Then as I was watching, it turned from a white light to a red light, then back to white.  It wasn&#39;t really blinking as it stayed approximately one color for a minute or two before changing to the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and got my binoculars and came back out.  Looking through the lens, it appeared to go from round to long and back to round.  That was coordinated with the light changes.

About 10 minutes later, I went back out with her but the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD))<n>

I am on the  north shore of Orcas island  in Washington state and there is very little light pollution here, and the light is to the west/southwest. I, We thought it was a planet at first because we can see planets quite clearly from here at different times of the year. But as far as we know there is no planet suppose to be in that location now.  The light also seemed to travel to the north and up from the horizon line, then slowly within the 2 hour time frame it moved back south and down tward the horizon line.  I called my daughter who lives in Bremerton WA, and asked her if she could see it and she said “yes” and we watched it together while talking on the phone for about 15 minutes. During that time it got brighter and dimmer over and over again. It seemed to be generating it’s own light not reflecting light from somewhere else.  There was no real significant flight path, it didn’t travel anywhere, just moved in the same general area for the whole time it was visible. At about 20:30 it dimmed out completely and we thought it was gone, but shortly there after it was back again, it continued to dim out and come back over and over , I took some video, but it is very poor quality and just shows light dimming and brightening, in the distance. It is approx 21:00 hrs now and it is really low on the western horizon and a bit more orange, still is fading and reappearing, but seems to be about to go below the horizon line now and out of my line of site.

((sic.  January 23))  We were coming back down Kellers Church Road which is the road that runs directly behind my house.  Before making a left into my development, we noticed two distinct lights in the distance.  It was 5:59 PM because my brother had called his friend Matt right when we noticed it.  We initially thought it was a plane that was making an emergency landing or crashing because it was so low to the ground.  From where we were, I would say we were only a mile or two away from this object.  So, before we turned into my neighborhood we decided to continue down Kellers Church to figure out what this object was.  We went over a small bridge, went around a bend on the left and then another on the right where Scott Road and Kellers Church Road meets.  We went through a set of woods, and in the middle of it was a clearing.  In that clearing we saw an unidentifiable object which all of us had never seen anything like it before. We were SW of the object, and it was directly above the tree line, just sitting there hovering.  It could have not have been anymore than 150 ft. above the tree line, which is incredibly low.  We decided to come to a stop to try to figure out what this object was.  It appeared to have a diamond shape, with four lights on each angle.  There was an obvious dominant light on the front of the craft.  My brother tried to make out a video of the object using my camera phone for about 30 seconds, but nothing appeared on the screen.  My brother and his girlfriend’s sister both felt the object had recognized that we were in its presence. The front light then appeared to be shifting towards us.  My brother immediately told his girlfriend to please go, because none of us knew what this object was capable of.  She hit the gas and we proceeded through the rest of the wooded area.  We kept an eye on the bright light as we traveled in a circle so we could return.  As we were driving I turned arou! nd and c learly saw a spherical dome shape structure on top of the diamond that stood still, while the body was still shifting.  We went up the hill which led to a connecting road.  We made a right and continued to try and follow the object, but by the time we were back to our original location, which could have only been 5 minutes max, the object was out of sight.  We couldn’t find it anywhere.  The only thing we could see above were normal blinking, red tinted planes.  It was nothing we couldn’t identify normally.  This was something that none of us in the car had ever seen in our entire lives.  The engine also did not have any sound.  My brothers girlfriends’ sister described the only noise coming from the hovering object was a humming sound.<n>

One blinked out before I got to the neighbors,leaving seven bright red lights in a triangle formation. Then suddenly five disappeared,two bright red lights.

I was outside on my sidewalk having a cigarette, when I happened to notice a very bright light flying to the east. I assumed this was just a plane landing at Harrisburg International Airport (KMDT), as my house is more or less on the approach to runway 13 there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I paid little attention to it until it drew a little closer, when I realized that it was not one landing light, but about nine of them arranged in a huge triad formation. Above these lights were a pair of ICAO standard recognition/nav lights, moving with the landing lights. Actual assessment of the size of this object was difficult, as it was dark, and the low amount of noise it made would indicate it was quite high. The faint and indistinct noise signature makes it seem all the bigger, as visually it seemed gigantic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued flying an easterly course a ways south of my house, until it disappeared from view. It did not seem to be moving particularly fast, certainately no faster than a commercial airliner. It made no sudden or erratic movements, and it&#39;s behavior seemed consistent with known laws of aerodynamics. This, combined with the fact that it had operating recognition lights, makes me certain it was terrestrial in origin, yet the sheer size of it makes it hard for me to explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also have some background information about me that is relevant. I am a rather large aviation buff, and I am taking flight lessons at the Lancaster, PA airport (KLNS). I have a total of sixteen hours logged, all in an Evektor Sportstar light-sport aircraft. I have a fairly good knowledge of Aviation-related subjects, and can recognize nearly any western commercial or military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/23/09 01:30|Sterling Heights|MI|Light|35 seconds|Home and Yard Lit up By Solid White Light, Surrounded By Colored Lights  500 Lights On Object0: Yes|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68200.html|133|ndxe200901| Home and Yard Lit up By Solid White Light, Surrounded By Colored Lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m visiting my parents in Michigan, and at 1:30 AM my dog wanted to go outside very badly.  She started barking incessantly after a few minutes.  When I went to let her back in I saw that the home behind (and 4 doors down from) my parents home was encased in a bright white light.  The light was very strange in that I could not identify the source.  However, it reminded me of looking at a football field lit up for a night game -- the light is directed squarely on the field but darkness surrounds the field.  This is how the light behaved that shined on the house (and only that house and it&#39;s yard).  The light was much whiter and much brighter than what would be achieved by floodlights.  Furthermore, a band of relatively large colored balls of light surrounded the home itself.  To borrow from another analogy, it looked like a band of Christmas lights surrounding the home.  However, these lights were much, much larger than Christmas lights (about the size of a fist at arms distance).  The colored lights were bobbing up and down slightly.  I remember seeing red, blue, and possibly green lights.  No yellow color.  There was no sound other than my dog incessantly barking directly at this home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting lasted about 35 seconds (from the time I saw the white light), and suddenly the white light &#39;turned off&#39;.  The colored lights remained around the home.  Therefore, the white light was 35 seconds in duration (but I caught it after it was first present), and the colored lights lasted much longer.  It was very late, and very cold in Michigan, and I therefore did not go outside to investigate further after the white light &#39;turned off&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am making this report because the light, in my opinion, were absolutely not floodlights or &#39;party&#39; lights, and the source of the white light was far above the house &amp; yard (but I did not see a &#39;craft&#39;).<n>

I viewed the object while driving about 40 mph and viewed it for  about 10 seconds from first sighting it, to passing under it. The object had no lights and was the size of a basketball. Curiously the street lights had been out. The object was not difficult to see since my headlights illuminated the area. The object (metallic) had a raised band around the middle and 3/4 of the way up it had what appeared to be a round port or eye. The object was positioned right near a power line that stretched  perpendicular to the road which was two lanes. This object seemed like some type of probe. This was kind of bone chilling when you see something that close! It is my opinion that an invasion is taking place. I have seen too many this past year, and continue to hear and read of many reports around the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coincidently, Florida, or at least my area, experiences a high number of power outages.

1/22/09 19:20|Flowery Branch|GA|Unknown|10 minutes|Three lights moving quickly over north Georgia|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68188.html|141|ndxe200901| Three lights moving quickly over north Georgia<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are two witnesses, identified as witness 1 and witness 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness 1: Driving home from work around 7:20 PM, I saw what I thought was a large airplane, however the lights were different from normal. I do not know how far above my car the object was. I would estimate about the normal height of airplanes, going a bit faster than normal airplanes. The object appeared to have a large rectangular wing unit with lights (blue and white) that flashed from the inside to the outside of the wings in a parallel pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking at that object as much as I could (I was driving), and then I saw another set of lights, much smaller. These were flashing red and white and moving extremely quickly at what appeared to be a very high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used my cellular phone to call witness 2 at my house to tell him to go outside quickly and see the lights. Our house is in a valley, and by the time I got home and he got outside, the bigger object (with the white and blue lights) had gotten over our house and beyond the tree line. However, we could still see the smaller ones. They moved very quickly over our roofline and out of sight. I did not see anything more that was unusual after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time span was about 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness 2: When I took the call I was upstairs in our home.  I headed downstairs and out the front door to see her driving down the driveway.  I could tell she had seen something unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She pointed out the first object though it was just entering the tree line to the rear of our home and that of next door.  Nothing unusual to me as this can be a corridor for landing patterns at ATL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the smaller object she then pointed out was moving rapidly, with a flashing I had not seen in commercial craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About the time (and this will sound corny) it traveled under the constellation Orion, another smaller light appeared right behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It, too, began traveling at a speed I have not seen the commercial craft do.  I also could not hear any echo of jet or other propulsion noise from aircraft.  Normally, we would hear a faint engine sound.  It should be noted I did not hear this as the larger craft went by, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two smaller lights were out of sight in less than 90 seconds. The one in the rear that had ‘appeared’ was traveling, using line of sight and my hand for scale, approximately three inches behind the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I t seemed as though these were extremely high in altitude, higher than commercial craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/22/09 19:10|Ocean Springs|MS|Light|3 minutes|Strange lights - NO Way a man-made craft|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68190.html|142|ndxe200901| Strange lights - NO Way a man-made craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a light in the sky that wasnt very far away and it was an orange-ish color and it was small at first and then it got really big.  I said &#34;WOW, what was that?&#34;.  My Mother was driving and asked &#34;what&#34; and I said &#34;a weird light&#34;.  It went out of sight for about 30 seconds.   We turned the corner and went toward the beach when we both saw four lights in a row, the same orange-ish color(the color of a street lamp) and they slowly faded one by one like it was rotating. At first my Mom thought it was a plane but the lights completely disappeard and then reappeared instantaneously a very good distance away.  Too fast to be a man-made craft.  Then I didnt see it for a minute or so.  We drove down to the beach and I looked up and saw a small, very distant light (it was the size of the stars) in the sky which abrubtly turned around and did like a bell-shaped turn in the other direction, changed to a red color and then disappeared quickly.  It was a clear night with no clouds.  The starts were very vivid in the sky.  We&#39;ve never seen anything like this and it was too coincidental to see two strange things in the sky within minutes that seemed to be relatively thousands of miles apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife and I live together with my step daughter.  I am 46 years of age and was at my house alone.  I do not drink or smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While talking on the phone on my front porch, I noticed a bright orange light in the sky.  I turned and saw what appeared to be a ball of fire in the sky right above the trees.  It was huge.  I told the person that I was talking to that I was watching a UFO.  He said, “take a picture with your phone.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being the extremely technologically ignorant person that I am, I couldn’t figure out how to take a picture and continue to talk to my friend.  He said hang up and take the picture, but by that time it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told him that I missed it and that no one would believe me.  After a bit more conversing, another object appeared.  This time, off to the right of the first object.  (It may have been the same object, but this time it was oblong with four rotating orange lights.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my friend that it was back. He said, “Well, hang up and take a picture!” I ran down the steps; but as soon as I hung up, it was gone!   As fast as the other 2 disappeared, another oblong shaped object appeared with four rotating orange lights this time to the left of the other two.  Before I could get my phone to the picture mode, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t expect anyone to believe me, but it was a truly amazing site.<n>
1/22/09 13:15|Tampa|FL|Oval|1 minute|metallic silver object clearly seen hovering in the afternoon over tampa and after a minute of observing vanished without a trace.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68217.html|144|ndxe200901| metallic silver object clearly seen hovering in the afternoon over tampa and after a minute of observing vanished without a trace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: January 22, 2009, 1:15pm Conditions: clear skies,  sunshine,  and clouds far into the distance Location: New Tampa east of Bruce B downs several lights north of the I75 overpass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 22nd,  me and my boyfriend were heading to USF for my class that afternoon.  We were heading from our home down Cross Creek and traveling due south on Bruce B Downs blvd at about 45MPH.  It was a clear Florida afternoon with clouds only in the distant horizon.  Upon crossing the Tampa Palms region my boyfriend had spotted something in the sky and was laughing about how normally people who see UFO’s depict an object which seems very unlikely to be a UFO at all making the whole possibility even more far fetched.  I looked up and saw an object in the sky just beyond the power/telephone lines crossing the road, and once we had passed under these I could clearly see the object without interference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the passengers seat of his SUV,  the object appeared to be close to a 45 degree angle from the horizon, and about 5 degrees to the left of our car’s heading which looked to be just to the left of the center of the windshield from what I could tell.  The shape was horizontally ovular with more of acute sides on the left and right forming near points.  The texture seemed to be quote slick as the light  reflection from the sun and shadow underneath were relatively free of distortion.  The color of the object to the naked eye seemed to be silver hues or possibly a very metallic white,  but either way the surface had very reflective properties.  The top was very bright white with sunlight,  but the bottom were tones of silver and grey with shadows that looked like slight reflections of the tree line below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being an aspiring scientist I immediately thought about all the possibilities and scenarios in my head and concluded it must have been a weird shaped blimp for an advertisement at one of the local stores near Amberly dr.  I ruled out a plane instantly because it did not change size to indicate a northern or southern trajectory, and it did not waiver side to side in our view either.  For the clarity of the sky and close proximity to us,  I was able to rule out a helicopter instantly also.  The object made no sound,  had no impact on the tree line below, and no propellers or engines of any sort were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my boyfriend stared at the object while slowing down in our drive and I made the comment,  “You know if this is what people seen when they reported UFO’s I can see how they make that assumption,   after seeing this blimp,  I would nearly claim it were a UFO if I had been startled or had bad eyesight myself.”   As we got a little closer I started thinking how weird it was that the blimp/balloon had no advertisements on it,  no personnel carriage underneath,  or no tie down to a building below.  We kept staring at the object as a full minute had passed with it in our sights and we still had no reasonable theories as to what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend laughed and stated that it must be a UFO then,  and I agreed since it would be the simplest solution to the situation,  and right when I had said jokingly ,“Yay aliens,  how neat!”  the object vanished right before our eyes.  As bizarre as that sounds,  I know.  It reminded me of those home movies where a kid holds up a ball and says, “now it’s here………..now it’s not (and the camera recording breaks for a moment)”  then the ball is suddenly not in the kid’s hand due to 2 separate recordings being edited together.  It was a quick and abrupt vanishing act for this object.  Now neither of us were laughing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued watching, scanning, and searching the sky as we drove all the way to campus.  There were still no clouds around,  no chemical trails from an aircraft,  no noise of an engine accelerating rapidly enough to be gone that quickly.  Yet the object was nowhere to be found with no trace of where it went.  It was gone before I could blink right before my very eyes and for the first time in my life I had no clues to lead me to any sort of conclusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited the last few days to see if any other reports surfaced in the news explaining what we saw,  but to no avail.  While I would love to have an alien encounter,  I’m not sure what it was we saw and am not entirely convinced It was a UFO,  I would like to put it out there for anyone who would like to find answers and put all these puzzle pieces together for us and the rest of the confused world.  Thank you<n>

It was in the western sky,up above the tree line.When I downloaded them to my computer,I was surprised at what is in the pictures.<n>

I noticed it one night while smoking a cigarette at about 1am, I came back at 3am and it was gone, it has been in different spots, but same direction in the sky, nearly every night that the sky has been clear.  The thing that caught my eye was it appeared to be strobing different colors.  I looked at it with my binoculars and it was strobing green, blue, red and purple.  I have never believed in UFOS, but, I just cant explain what this is.  It doesn&#39;t move, so its not aircraft or satellite, it is to high to be a new radio tower.  My background includes 5 years as a Bexar County Sheriffs Deputy, 2 years as a private investigator.  I have an Associates Degree in Criminal Justice and I am currently a student at the University of Texas.  If you were to look at Seguin on the Texas map, the thing I am seeing is in! the direction of La Vernia, TX, which is in Wilson County.<n>
1/21/09 23:00|Nashville|TN|Triangle|30 minutes|Large silent object that landed and seemed to hover and make fast turns!!|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68177.html|147|ndxe200901| Large silent object that landed and seemed to hover and make fast turns!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiancé was driving me home after she had gotten off work when I noticed a large bright object in the sky.  We had just passed smith springs road were it intersects with murfresboro road driving away from downtown Nashville.  I was in the passenger seat and saw it to the left and in front of the car. At first I thought I was looking at a helicopter as the object seemed to hover.  But, as we drove closer I could see that the object was long and flat on the bottom and far to large to be a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we made it to our turn at nashboro blv, we could see the object quite clearly and noticed that it had begun to move slowly.  Once we turned from murfresboro on to nashboro blv., the object passed over our car slowly and making no noise at all.  The object was low enough that if I had been on the roof of a nearby house I could almost have touched it.  After it passed over our car we watched it descend into a near by field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove around trying to get a better view of where it had landed but were unable to see more then a bright glow from the road.  Neither of us were willing to get out of the car and trek through unknown fields to find it so we drove around hoping we could get a better view.  After about 10 minutes of driving up both smith springs and nashboro blv we saw the craft shoot back into the sky at a steep angle.  After it took off we followed it until the object turned around and a plane passed over us a few seconds later. We made a u-turn at bell road back onto smith springs to follow both the plane and the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lost sight of the plane and never saw it again but we did find the object again flying low and parallel to murfresboro road.  We followed it down murfresboro till it came to a halt in the air and then a few moments later it turned and headed back the other way towards nashboro blv again.  Making another u-turn we followed the object turning off murfresboro and back onto nashboro blv. There it traveled straight down nashboro blv and I snapped a few pictures while driving after it. After about 3 minutes the object turned sharply around an came over our car once again.  It was silent and fast and quickly was out of sight seeming to descend again. After this we lost sight of the object and were unable to find it again.<n>

As I looked out the window, I saw three (3) objects in the night sky.  I watched them for five (5) minutes moving from South to North (I was looking towards the southeast) and the objects traveled not like a plane, rather they traveled almost with no effort, very calm, smooth, very slow and no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three (3) objects had a circular shape with three (3) lights on each one (the lights on each object were positioned like that of the holes of a bowling ball).  Two (2) of the lights were a very bright white color and the other was a pinkish/red color. The objects had an Amber Glow/Tint around them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you held your hand, arms length away, the space between each object was from my thumb to my pinky.  As I was holding out my hand, if I brought it over the object to try to block it out, I could still see the Amberish glow residing around the objects.<n>

Very quickly, we noticed that it appeared to be unusually illuminated as though there was a very powerful red light (like firework)on the top of the aircraft enabling us to only see the silhouette of the Hercules.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft continued to fly in a straight line, yet the light moved from being on top of the aircraft to following it from a close distance. It did this for a short space of time and then suddenly burst infront of the aircraft almost half a mile in less than a second. The acceleration was unbelievable. The light maintained this distance for a few seconds and then once again burst backwards at very high speed and continued to follow the aircraft. The light then stopped in mid air, and then shot up into the sky at an immense speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light appeared to have a very intense, almost white, oval shaped centre which was possibly a 1/4 of the Hercules&#39;s lenght. When combined with the &#39;fuzzy&#39; light which surrounded this bright centre the light was possibly half the lenght of the Hercules.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record I am 17 and my brother is 14.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am unable to say whether the object made a noise as the aircraft made too loud a noise to notice any other sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

While on the phone with my mother, I noticed several strange objects in the sky.  I counted as many as six in all.  The objects appeared to be of several different shapes, however I could only clearly see 1 craft in particular, and i will attempt to describe the others by their light patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most visable object was one in which the shape and light patterns appeared to morph. It started off as a round object with a single light, then went to an triangular shape with three different lights. It then morphed again into an oval possessing 6 lights, and finally a cross shaped object of eight lights. It moved at a constant, slow speed across the sky and traveled directly above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second most visable object was a very bright object which seemed to hover, and would during the duration of the sighting appear either farther away of closer and at varying points across the sky. However, this object did remain within a small patch of sky and did not deviate from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other objects I will divide into two catagories. The first catagory is what would best be described as &#34;Firecracker&#34; like objects. These objects would appear to &#34;blink&#34; and would then reappear at a different point in the sky. these objects traveled in a very erratic pattern and at very fast speeds. They apeared to possess one light each, and the light would change colors from yellow, white, and red at random. Approximately 3 were seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second group can best be described as &#34;slow and steady&#34;. These objects moved slowely across the sky, but with an erraticness that could not be explained. Their light was constant, appearing white or red in the sky. Approximately 2 were seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It sould be noted that I live on a waterway which emptes into the Atlantic Ocean and that there is a Powerplant on the body of water. There were also a good amount of aircraft that appeared after the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date indicated is flawed, so we have assigned a date above, which we assume is the correct one.

1/21/09 20:00|Pueblo|CO|Sphere|1min 45secs|3 orange lights seen west of pueblo blvd and arkansas river|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68178.html|154|ndxe200901| 3 orange lights seen west of pueblo blvd and arkansas river<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 8:27pm tonight, 1/21/09, me and my friend were at the Pueblo City Park behind the baseball field and skate park, parked in a car overlooking the river as it goes under Pueblo Blvd. On Google Maps, we were parked at coordinates 38.266590, -104.657360. It was somewhat windy, clear skies and able to see the stars. Looking in the direction of Google Map coordinates 38.273312, -104.667145, on the other side of Pueblo Blvd and on the other side of the river from where we were, we saw an orange light maybe 6-7 stories high. It was an orange sperical light that flashed on and off once. Then a few seconds later it turned on again, then seperated into three seperate orange spheres, extending away from us and to our left looking out toward PMI. The lights then stayed on for about 1 second, fully extended and remaining absolutely still and perfectly aligned to each other despite the wind. Then about 45 seconds later the three seperate orange sphere lights turned on, in the same direction and area as before, but one was closer to the ground and the other two were splayed out away from the other about 8 stories high, but each flashed on simultaneously and off simultaneously, all in a duration of 1 second. Then a few minutes later regular aircraft with required FAA lights flew over and kept flying over. The UFOs were not seen again afterward, and we only saw them at a time when it seemed no air traffic was in the immediate area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had parked there because we had seen UFOs there before and figured we might see on tonight. We noticed what seemed to be a bright, large planet out to the west. That planet had been in the exact same spot the night before, but tonight it began to slightly move around in every different direction, not staying stationary, and then it moved farther and faster from where it should have been in the sky. That&#39;s what got us to look in that general direction, and then we saw the first flash of the single orange sphere way to the right and close to the ground on the other side of the river. After the orange speheres, we looked back at what should have been a planet and it remained stationary and eventually sat below the horizon with the rest of the stars about 15 minutes after the orange spheres had stopped activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend who was driving and wants to remain anonymous called his friend who was in pueblo west on his cell phone after the second appearance of the lights and during the third appearance said that his cell phone recepetion cut out slightly during the call, especially during the third appearance of the lights, and after the lights stopped appearing the reception was back to normal. He said the person in pueblo west he was talking to also saw the lights simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The last sighting was last night around 6:45 pm. We were driving west on McKinley ave in Fresno CA on our way to a meeting. We noticed 4 hovering objects at a stand still on each side of our car about 3 miles up in the sky when we were at a red light. Once our car started moving they moved along side us, every time we stopped they stopped. They all looked alike and did not look like helicopters and not planes. Later on in the evening on the way back home we spotted another craft similar to the ones earlier just hovering at a stand still above the houses in our neighborhood. the object even brightened its lights from red to super bright white. it was still for about 3 minutes then slowly started to move to the right, then left then it either vanished or we just did not catch it take off. This is not the first time we have seen these objects in the sky. we seen larger ones the size of two commercial planes before. We just find it strange that the sightings have not stopped. Our children, my parents friends and my mother in law have all witnessed them. For some strange reason these objects have not gone away and seem to be growing by the numbers each day and showing themselves pretty boldly. If anyone has seen them also please post a report, we hope we are not just going crazy over here by ourselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At around 6:45 pm, we decided we had enough and began to clean up our tip-ups. As we left the shanty, I noticed a light out to the west that was brighter than any other star in the sky, and it was a little more orange than the stars. I got my friends attention and he saw it too. It was not moving at all. It stayed in the same place for roughly 20-30 seconds, and then it was gone. I can’t explain what it is, but I know it was not a plane because it was not moving, and there were no flashing lights. I don’t know what else it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/21/09 18:45|Pensacola|FL|Circle|1 hour|saw large bright light in wsw sky as well as 3 reddish orange pulsating orbs in southern sky|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68187.html|159|ndxe200901| saw large bright light in wsw sky as well as 3 reddish orange pulsating orbs in southern sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned home from shopping and let our three dogs outside at approximately 645pm. I brought them back inside and realized that I had left some items in the car. I went back outside and noticed a very bright light in the WSW above a nearby treeline. I kept looking at it trying to figure out what it might be. I live across the street from a Navy helicopter training field, so I am very familiar with their sights and sounds, but it would have been too late for them to be flying anyway. It wasn&#39;t a plane- it had no blinking lights and did not move like one. It had fringes of red on the left and right sides and what appeared to be &#34;moonbeams&#34; eminating from it. It moved very slowly towards the south. I called my neighbors (to my west) on the phone and asked them to step outside and see if they witness what I was seeing. We stood in their front yard and watched it move away to the south. We watched it for approximately 10 minutes and they went back inside (since the temperature was around 30 degrees). I came back inside my home and thought about what I was seeing. I went back outside and it was still there, but lower in the sky. I went over to my neighbors (to my east), and they stepped outside into the street and also saw it. We watched it for a few minutes, and they went back inside their home. My neighbor (to the east) went online to see if there were any stars that were supposed to be visible, and I told them I would talk to them later to find out. I went back home at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 730pm, I went back outside to see if the light was still in the sky, but it had disappeared. I walked back over to my neighbors (to the east) to see if she had found out anything on the internet, and as I knocked on their door, I turned towards the SWS, looking over the helicopter training field towards Perdido Bay. I saw three orangish-red pulsating orbs. Two of them were close together, and the third was further to the west. At this point, I noticed that the orbs were fading out slowly, then would reappear in a different spot. They did this independently of each other. My neighbors came to their door and as we stood in their driveway, we all witnessed the orbs fading out then reappearing, moving westerly. They started appearing closer together. One would fade out, and then the other two would fade out. The whole episode lasted approximately two minutes before the orbs disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed that air traffic in the area picked up considerably during both episodes- more than usual. There was a distinct difference between the bright light and orbs versus the planes and helicpters that started appearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor did say that Scorpius would have been the brightest star in the western sky, but when we came out to look for it, it was no longer there- with no explanation where it disappeared. The bright white light was no star. The three pulsating orbs were not stars. I&#39;m not sure what we all saw last night.<n>

It must have been pretty low. As I watched the helicopter pass by, I caught a glimpse of what I thought was a plane headed toward me from the opposite location. It was was brighter than the other stars in the sky, but it looked just like a star. I questioned myself about the speed of the object. I was giong really fast for a plane. Easy to follow with eye, but faster than a plane. Also, the flight path was unique as it changed direction from southbound to northbound. This only lasted maybe 30 seconds then the object stopped. It just sat stationary like a star. It also looked just like one, but brighter. I sat there and stared at it for twenty minutes or so. No more movement. I went inside and have been checking on it. Still there. It has been over an hour since I saw it moving. I am blown away. I have found many other accounts like mine on the net. Skeptics explanations do not account for what I have just wittnessed. I hear unexplained frequencies and metallic noises during odd hours (1-5 AM)and I have experianced purple ball lightning near where I live several years back (i can elaborate upon request, it was amazing, there was witnesses), perhaps there is something of cosmic interest in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light streaked across the sky at a speed 5-10x that of a plane, and looped around several times, ruling out any possibility of a commercial plane. The lights continued to flash across the sky, and were visible from around a 10 mile radius. The instances were frequent but short lived, the streaks would last for one or two seconds at most. I saw the streaks without any doubt in my mind at least 15 counted times. My friend was with me and corroborates the whole thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/20/09 23:23|Okeechobee|FL||2 minutes|Huge-bright light in sky, subdues in a ball-like object hovering 1000 feet above my neighbors rooftop...|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68993.html|164|ndxe200901| Huge-bright light in sky, subdues in a ball-like object hovering 1000 feet above my neighbors rooftop...<n> <n><n> <n><n> On January 20th 2009, two other friends and I witnessed a UFO. My friends and I were sitting in my car in the parking area in front of my apartment. My car was parked so that I was facing the road and the whole entire sky above it. It was a remarkably dark night, as we had just made a joke about it because we could barely see each other and we were sitting so close to one another. Then , out of nowhere, it seems like the entire sky lights up. This massive bright light is all you can see. I had no problem at this point looking around the car and being able to see all the rather shocked faces. And then the light subdues but into this ball-like object that seems to be hovering about 1000 feet from my neighbors rooftop, never losing that intense light. It stays there just about long enough for you to say “What in the world?.. and then it just shoots of into the sky. I looked at the clock right after and it was 11:11pm. I didn’t call the police, thinking they would most likely just think we were all crazy. I did happen to be watching a program on t.v. and heard about this reporting center. This is my honest report.<n>

I had just finished watching a PBS documentary.  We stepped outside at 9:56 p.m.  I put a white bandanna on my dog to see him in the dark.  The dog going out was a nightly ritual.  It was cold out and I was fully awake.  I waited for him to make his rounds and return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the South I witnessed a reddish-orange light low in the sky.  I assumed it was a helicopter.  It dropped something and sparks of red made their way from the light to the ground.  I thought, &#34;I hope whatever that is doesn&#39;t hit someone&#39;s house.&#34;  I then watched it move from south to north towards me.  I was waiting to hear the blades and engine of the helicopter.  I heard nothing.  The red light then proceeded to drop another sparkling type of light down toward the ground.  I was relieved to see it do this again as I was not sure if I could believe my eyes the first time I saw it do this.  The night was cold and there were ice crystals in the air; but this did not look like lighted crystals, it was different.  It looked more like what a meteorite looks like as it falls to earth with a tail coming down.  It did not make sense but I was just observing this taking place so I was not trying to make sense of it all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached me it seemed to be higher in the night sky.  I thought I heard an engine which relieved me as I then thought it had to be a helicopter.  But, this noise was from a train in the area moving south to north.  This light object did not make any observable sound.  My dog was standing at my feet by the patio.  I was worried that whatever was dropping might hit him or me so I stayed by the back door.  I proceeded to put him inside. I then looked up and it started to drop another sparkly charge but this time I did not see the material come all the way down, it stopped almost upon starting to drop down.  Maybe the position above me was wrong for viewing it to the ground?  It then kept moving toward the northeast across the top of my apartment complex and I followed it as it moved.  I rushed inside to get a binocular so that I could see what it actually was.  This took fifteen seconds.  As I came back out I did not see the light anymore in the sky.  I walked north behind the apartment complex with the binoculars but could not relocate it in the sky.  I then went inside.  I watched television for another hour, as I always do until 11:00 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I thought about this it made no sense.  The light, the sparkly discharge to the ground, the movement from south to northeast.  It was all very nonsensical and hard to understand.  I do not know what I witnessed? It is the first and hopefully last time I will witness something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We pull over to the side of the highway, which was interstate 64. We looked out the windows and watched it hover.  Then we were in a rush so we had to get back on the highway. We watched it for about 10 minutes then started on the road. As I watched behind me it was slowly moving in the opposite direction that we were going.<n>

Then, in very fast procession starting at the top row end light until they were all off.

First thought was it was possibly the north star, but I realized it wasn&#39;t in the north, it was actually west of Hwy. 120, seeing it through the passenger window. It appeared to not be moving like a plane would. It was just sitting in midair, bright white light. I kept watching it until I got near Lake Geneva and parked up on the hill before the golf course. Watched it outside my window, heard no noise from it. I then proceeded home, as I was close to Hwy. 12 I saw it again on the right side as if it moved quickly to stay with me. I followed it in the sky all the way to my home, where it sat as I called my wife and daughter to come out and look at it. It lasted for another 10 min. From my vantage point, I seemed to have a greenish tint with a reddish tint bottom. I watched the light shrink to a speck of light, disappeared and came back, almost immediately, but not as bright as earlier. Then the light shrank again until it slowly flickered out. Noticed quick like shaky circular movement at times, but it did not seem to move much. I have seen this same light before in New Berlin, maybe 20 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first I thought it was a tower, but then I realized it was slowly moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other lights on the object other than the pulsing red. It seemed to be moving further south. I continued to watch it for about 2 minutes, then it was gone.

He stated, in a very excited voice that it was &#34;buzzing around&#34;. I, however, did not witness this. After a few minutes, he lost sight of it as well.<n>

I frequently go outside at night to watch the stars and I noticed this set of lights, which weren&#39;t supposed to be there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights changed in intensity and changed position as if they were attached to something.  When I first saw them, they were a perfect triangle.  They moved to form an elongated triangle pointing east, then reoriented again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t hear any noises.  What seemed to be the &#34;center&#34; light was brighter than the other two.  The center light was brightest when oriented head on, forming almost a straight line, then turned again, becoming a smaller looking triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t move quickly enough to be distinct, if that makes any sense.  But they definitely moved quickly enough as to change the arrangement of the lights within 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my girlfriend out to see them, but all we could see was the center light.  Then, they began to move again and the triangle was visible.  I called her back out and she saw it, too.  She said it was creepy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought they might be helicopters flying in formation.  There were no other blinking lights, but they did &#34;twinkle&#34; like stars, which is what made it seem so strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not an avid ufo enthusiast, but I do like to watch the stars.  This is the first time I have seen anything like this.  I do remember watching something on the Science channel about triangular lights which behaved exactly like these did about a month prior to this event.  I don&#39;t think that influenced what I saw, but it definitely made me watch them closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15 minutes of watching (it was fairly chilly), I came inside to check if there had been any reports.  I didn&#39;t really know where to look, though, and I found this site through a google search on how to report sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went back outside to continue watching, the lights were gone, as far as I could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The one on the west from my vantage point was slightly higher than the one toward the east.  They were about 10 degrees apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The right hand cluster blinked very slowly approximately every two to three seconds it would disappear for two to three seconds.

The object was oval with white lights all over it.  I also blinked a red light about every 2 minutes.  The object was slowly moving away from us.  I drove towards the object, to see if we could identify it.  However, we were never able to identify the object.  The object disappeared after about 15 - 20 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was a star, then it started to bounce/hover closer to the coast.  My next guess was that it was some sort of satellite?  But what type of large, bright, satellite would be that close to LAX?  It would be a danger to the planes coming and going.  I am not sure what it was, all I know is what I saw.  What I saw was not a star, not a plane/chopper, not a satellite, nor was it a flare, as I have seen flares in the past. After about ten minutes of observation, and the orb backtracking away from the coast, it disappeared.  I remain confused and astounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a cloudless night here in Eastern Oahu, Hawaii. I had been looking at Venus, then looking for the Milky Way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up at Orion, I saw a flash of light. I waited, and soon it flashed again. It was positioned &#34;above&#34; Orion&#39;s Left &#34;shoulder&#34; (West-North-West+-) or the right side of Orion as you look at it (Orion was lying on his right side).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it blinked again I began to count. I counted to seven between blinks, some were dimmer, some brighter. I went inside to try to find a place to report it or look it up if it was a satellite, to no avail, for half an hour. When I went back outside it was no longer visible (8:15). It did NOT appear to be moving, or, it may have been moving VERY slowly. I&#39;ve watched satellites before, seen them traveling West to East and North to South. I know there are geostationary satellites, but I&#39;ve never seen a blinking one before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best guess is a rocket booster that became geostationary (since others have seen it in the same position) and as it turns end-over-end it also spins and some sides may reflect better. Then perhaps it &#39;disappeared&#34; as it entered Earth&#39;s Shadow?  I did explore other websites, and on ATS (Above Top Secret) people in Africa, Texas and Finland described EXACTLY what I saw.<n>

During previous shots I noticed a few satellite/airplane type points of light moving across the sky. After taking the photo, it was during review on the computer I noticed the strange object that appeared and the end of the light trail. I am by no means a photo analyzer, I would think that the object at the end of the light trail should appeared &#34;streaked&#34; similar to the trail. Look at the end of the &#34;trail&#34; just above and to the left of the window. The object is moving south. If you zoom in on the object it is a strange shape.

Changing direction from left to right at 45 degree angles. Quite stunning to watch<n> <n><n> <n><n> On saturday evening I went outside onto the deck and was observing the clear sky over Auckland as I do from time to time, after 5 minutes or so of looking I saw what I thought was a shooting star going across but then to my amazement it changed direction suddenly on about a 45 degree angle to the left for approx two seconds then went straight for another two seconds then it changed direction on a 45 degree angle to the right and continued this staggered movement until it went out of sight. I can only drscribe it as being a light and unable to distinguish any shape being it was so far away which is why I first thought it was a shooting star. I was totally flabbergasted seeing something in the sky changing direction suddenly to the left straitening up and then altering it&#39;s path to the right and doing it at random again and again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had decided to go out for a quick stroll on the beach since it was a relatively clear night out compared to the previous week. After a short walk south my friend suddenly stopped and was peering south south-east slightly out towards the ocean before I could ask him why he stopped  a bright orange glow took hold of my attention in the direction he was staring. Both of our eyes were affixed to this point where this glow took up a good chunk of the sky it looked as if a bomb had gone off. At this point we both realized this was right around the same place in the sky that shuttle launches could be seen from the Kennedy space center which we had witnessed many times before. As we discussed this a bright almost glowing light orange or dark yellow cigar shaped object appeared in the orangery haze. The object slowly started moving vertically about the same speed as the shuttle. Me and my friend assumed we were watching a shuttle launch and were both pretty surprised that neither of us had heard anything about it and that the beach was vacant except for us. With a shuttle launch it seemed almost impossible that we would be the only ones out to watch . Although surprised we continued to watch the object astounded that we were the only two watching this great event. About 2 minutes in to the object rising vertically it seemed to be slowly moving  north towards us no longer gaining altitude. The bright glow kept growing more intense as it moved towards us. Suddenly we realized this object was leaving no trail of smoke so the idea came to me that maybe this was a helicopter but there were no blinking lights just a steady light orange  glow. I attempted to take a picture on my phone but it was so dark that nothing came out. The craft now around 45 degrees from its first appearance then appeared to move west out towards the ocean and over the ! period o f around 2 minutes the once intensely bright light slowly dimmed. Then the craft about the intensity of a star slowly moved south and over the period of a second faded away as fast as it appeared. I have never seen any object emit no trail, have no blinking lights, and be absolutely silent. Throughout my entire life I&#39;ve never witnessed Helicopters, planes, balloons, shuttles, or any other type  of aircraft behave the way this object did. Me and my friend have an open mind regarding UFO sightings but were pretty skeptical of what we were witnessing and were wondering if anyone else may have witnessed this event  being easily in the view of the entire coastline. Any information could be helpful to aid us in figuring out what we saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have lived in this house for 13 years, and I know what the night sky looks like, looking west.  This was like nothing I’ve seen before.  Three other people in my house joined me in looking at this object.  It was pulsing and changed colors, which was visible with the naked eye.  We started looking at it with binoculars, and could see more details. It was rotating and appeared to have four smaller lights inside. There were a couple of airplanes that passed by in the time that we were looking at it, and it appeared to be about 20 times bigger than the planes.  A point of reference that we had was a tower on Camano Island that has a red flashing light, and is about 120 ft. tall.  The disk shaped object was to the south of this tower, and was a little higher in the sky.  The colors that we saw were white, red, blue, purple, orange, and yellow.  It was visible to us for about 20 minutes, and then it just disappeared.<n>

Ontario Airport was to the far east but this object appear not to be moving toward it or away from it. We stopped on the side of the rode near the 60 E exit. The object did not appear to be moving in any direction just stationary. My wife and I both concluded that it was not a plane or helicopter because it did not have a blinking red light or have alot of white light around it. In addition if it were a police helicopter, you would see a spot light if it was trying to search for something, not in this case.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed them because the clouds in the sky were very unusual, they were low and wispy. As I was looking at the lights they began to rotate in a clockwise direction. It was at this time I realized that the three lights were connected to one large object. This object was triangle in shape and seemed to be black in color. The white lights were fixed on each corner of the object. The object was very low, slightly higher than the tree tops. It was hovering in the same spot as it rotated. As it hovered I noticed a very faint hum. Other than this slight hum it was silent. After the object rotated one time it slowly began to move South/Southwest. As it began to move is when I yelled for my partner who was still in the house. He came out in time to see the lights pass over our house. The three lights did not blink and seemed to be on the bottom of the object. As the object flew away it began to gain speed and altitude. The object turned and banked several times.  It seemed to move effortlessly almost like it was in water. We live right next to the Burbank Airport so we are used to seeing airplanes and helicopters. This object was like nothing I have ever seen. It was larger than my house just hovering with virtually no sound and no wind. I have been searching for more reports on that night but have had no luck. I have always been a skeptic but I know what I saw and this event has changed my perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They asked me to go outside to see. I looked out my second story bedroom window looking out north east.  I saw what looked like a blimp,  I ran out to see it closer.  My immediate thought was it was the moon peaking through clouds. There were no clouds.  It was not the moon and it was moving. It was not a plane or helicopter.  It was a large bright light.  I ran into my garage and got my telescope without a base. By now my family had come home and we were all looking at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a bit I caught the object in my telescope and what I saw I can not believe. It was an eye shaped orb that seems to not be solid an orb of light with a red light bouncing inside. Not a craft or man made. On the outside left of the orb was a bright light looked similar to a star in a telescope. My family described this object to be hovering and stopped abruptly &#34;on a dime&#34; and moved fast. They thought it was a blimp at first but after stopping and getting out of the car they could not explain what it was. The color of the orb was the color of a harvest moon. The orb was low in the sky not up high and proceeded east. I am a changed person and can not sleep.<n>

I looked south down my street and saw to the left of me the brightest largest moon I have ever seen- it was  so big it lookedlike it was just miles away- then I thought what the hell...the moon is 1/4  maybe right now..I looked again and it looked like there was explosions of some sort on the face of the moon planet thing..I saw other planes ( obvious) fly right up next to it and hover..3 on each side..in formation- this moon light thing hovering was changing colors and had shadows of some sort over it- resembling an easter egg my brother threw in the purple..made a weird color. the thing hovered - always being followed by the 6  by standing planes..I live in the run way to LAX..and I see planes all the time..this wasnt a plane..as a matter of fact there were no planes I could see directed into LAX - the sky was blank- except this light moon thing..I turned around and saw my shadow thatis how bright it was..I called my daughter- to come see- she ignored me at first then I guess my tone- to come here now- she got up and her first questions is...whatis that? is that the moon being attacked? We saw it go out of sight..honestly it was very very very very unsettling. What is going on? How can a guy in Belarus- see the very same object 8 days ago?<n>

1/18/09 18:50|San Dimas|CA|Oval|10 min|Oval object, stationary at first, moved north to west at rapid speed after visual sighting. Craft not recognizable.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69014.html|208|ndxe200901| Oval object, stationary at first, moved north to west at rapid speed after visual sighting. Craft not recognizable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx. 18:45 hours (1.5 hours after sunset) on January 18, 2009, I observed a &#34;fuzzy, bright&#34; object in the northwestern evening sky. It caught my attention because it was stationary, but wasn&#39;t of a shape I recognized. It was not a helicopter or other familiar aircraft. The object was fixed in the west-northwest sky, at approx. 60-65 degrees above the horizon. The weather was clear, warm, and no other flying objects, aircraft, or stellar phenomena were visible in that part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used binoculars (10x50) to get a closer look, and was startled to see a grayish-gold oval with small red &amp; green lights, one on each side of the object, plus a white &#34;headlight&#34; - small relative to the object&#39;s size. It seemed to be oval, but it also had an oval &#34;ring&#34; or projection at the bottom. The &#34;skin&#34; seemed to have large (relative to the overall size) markings or texture. I figured the sunlight from over the horizon must be reflecting off this thing, so its elevation above ground must have been quite high to catch sunlight this late. I could not venture a guess as to the object&#39;s actual dimensions, due to the lack of background reference points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was an aircraft - this due to the fact that aircraft typically display a red light on the left wing, and a green one on the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I retrieved my digital camera, zoomed into the area where the object was located, and took three photos in succession. I had to guess at the location, because the object was too small to be seen in the viewfinder. When I tried looking at the display, I thought I had taken photos of black sky, as I could not make out anything. It wasn&#39;t until I downloaded some other photos from the camera this weekend that I saw the two good images from that evening on my computer screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I checked the pictures I had taken in the camera&#39;s viewfinder, I noticed the object start to move. It moved from its initial location to out of sight (into the western horizon) in less than five seconds. It flew roughly parallel to the San Gabriel Mountains, visible to me as the northwestern horizon from my back yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire viewing and photocapture, plus the object&#39;s disappearance, spanned less than 10 minutes.<n>

There are 4-5 disc-shaped objects flying in a length ballistic pattern perhaps mid-way between the hills and Marin County, over the bay.  Close inspection of the objects seems to reveal different angles of flight by the objects, and some reflectivity consistent with the position of the sun is present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The image is one in a series of four taken within seconds of each other, and the objects do not appear in the other three images, which presents fairly strong evidence that the objects are not the result of dust on the lens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is not out of the question that the objects are a product of the camera pointing at the sun, which can create some strange effects, but this seems like a somewhat far-fetched explanation.<n>

I am sure lots of people on the freeway saw it but I can&#39;t find anything about it online. It appeared for only a couple of seconds before disappearing in a north east direction. Here is a google maps link of where I was and the direction I was facing when it happened:  http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=irvine+transportation+center&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=38.638819,78.837891&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=33.670443,-117.754984&amp;spn=0,359.972599&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=33.670634,-117.755051&amp;panoid=W8YhBR5WwkXRCOxFgaPvhw&amp;cbp=12,346.4568740764644,,0,-10.251370399373544<n>

Unfortunately, my little brother, his friend, and my step-dad had just went inside. In any case, the object looked like a plane at first, but without wings, and it was traveling way to fast, stopping, and going again. It looked like the path of lightning, but the object did not have a tail. It was headed NE about 5 miles East of me when it passed by. It disappeared just above the tree line and was gone. After  I thought it was a plane, I thought it may have been a dandelion petal, because we have dandelions in our yard, and some of them are in bloom. However, it was traveling too fast, and there was not a strong enough wind to carry it. Also, after seeing a commercial plane fly by headed north, I could estimate the crafts speed at anywhere between 2,000-2,500mph. It went roughly 4.5 times the speed of the jet. I haven’t told my family. This is the first time I have seen a ufo, but my dad did once over the water in Tampa Bay. He was with someone who also saw the bright object hover over and lift of the water that night. By the way, the ufo appeared white to me, as it has in many videos I&#39;ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was not a solid triangle, there was nothing in the middle. Just the shape of a triangle, and each corner has a piece that stuck straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was silent, small planes frequently fly over my house sometimes lower than this and you can hear them so well they shake the windows of my house. This craft produced no sound and just &#34;glided&#34; smoothly across the sky heading north. It had a gray color, and shined a tiny bit when the sun hit it right, but not like a normal, it just looked different the way the light reflected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going to run for the camera but it was heading towards two small hills that would obscure it from view in a matter of seconds so we just watched it cruise on by and dissapear behind the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on, about 20 minutes later a third friend arrived and we told him what happened, so we went out back again to look for my bird a little more. We ended up going onto my roof with a pair of binoculars and scanning the sky for my bird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and saw a small white dot, not moving, just sitting there, directly above the area we had seen the triangle craft earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When focused on in the binocluars it looked like a silver metal orb, but it was so high in the sky that no detail could be made out. All three of us saw this second object, and it remained there for 15 minutes or more until it finally moved away in the same direction that the triangle craft had went earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The color was opaque. It was very well camouflaged against the night sky and I had to concentrate first to make sure what I was seeing was what I was seeing and second not to lose site of it.

The whole event lasted about a min. and a half and it just appeared to fade into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a pilot or expert in such matters. I am a computer repair technician. In fact I am somewhat of a skeptic but I did find my experience interesting enough that I thought I should share it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After 5-10 seconds I realized that it was not lightning because 1.  it did not appear to be a rain cloud, 2.  there was no arcing, 3.  the light reverberated, unlike lightning which flashes intermittently, and 4.  the sky around the cloud and adjacent clouds were not lit or affected in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the reverberating light in the cloud began to fade, a brightly lit craft emerged out of the eastern side of the cloud, accelerating slowly. The craft was undoubtedly the source of the light in the cloud, although now the craft emitted a constant, very bright, slightly bluish light. The craft was cigar shape from my perspective, therefore possibly circular. It was estimated to be 2-3 times longer than a 747 but, due to the distance and intensity of the light, I could see no markings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 5-10 seconds I saw a 2nd, identical craft approximately half a nautical mile to the east of the 1st craft. The 2nd craft was traveling slowly westward, i.e. towards the 1st craft. The 2nd craft seemed to appear suddenly, as if it had “switched on”, or it is possible that the 2nd craft had emerged from an adjacent cumulus cloud, but no light was seen within the cloud beforehand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about the same time, or a few seconds later, I saw a 3rd similar craft slightly further north than the 1st and 2nd. This craft was much dimmer than the 2 others. It was not a reflection on a cloud, as it was in open night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three craft accelerated together towards the northeast, slightly gaining altitude before disappearing behind a large bank of cloud. After several minutes observation they did not reappear from behind the bank of cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These craft were definitely not aircraft, balloons or ordnance. At one stage it was thought possible that the 1st craft may have been a rocket from Cape Canaveral on a low trajectory from earth. But the appearance of a 2nd and 3rd craft, and the direction and distance of Florida, discount this suggestion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The person relieving me from watch admitted to seeing the reverberating light in the cloud, but not the craft (he was not wearing his spectacles).<n>

Outer border was bright with a bright dot at it&#39;s centre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I had arrived in Mayrhofen, Austria for our skiing holiday.  Our sighting happened on our first evening whilst stepping outside to the balcony to smoke a cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red circle as it appeared to us in the sky appeared over the mountain horizon and continued upwards, sometimes moving very slightly to the left or right.  It continued to move slowly and then gained speed and moved still upwards.  As it gained speed it grew fainter until the light had disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took a video although this was low quality.  However upon examining the photograph taken, the red circle was brightest at it&#39;s centre with a bright outer border.  There were no visible trails of exhaust from any propulsion.  The light remained constant for the entire sighting and there were no additional lights or flashes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve searched the internet and found nothing similar...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will forward the photograph to this website as evidence of the sighting.<n>

The night was perfectly clear with not a cloud in sight. Two other family members walked outside and saw the light. I personally stood there for five minutes to gaze at it. At first I thought it was a planet I never recognized before, but I knew that to be false after about fifteen minutes.  At first it was just a bright light, but after staring at the center it looked almost like a cross or even a human shape.  Four spokes (for lack of a better word) sticking out from a main frame.  There were rays of light coming from all sides.  These rays seemed to be rainbow colored and white at different times. It was hard to tell if it was moving or if it was just my eyes, but it seemed like it was moving slightly.  Like I said, about fifteen minutes later the light disappeared and that was the last I saw of it.<n>

I noticed that your website has other reports that you are tentatively classifing as Venus &amp; Sirius, but they are not.  They are both UFO&#39;s, or UFO docking stations of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One is the bright starlike object in front of our view of Venus. The other is the bright starlike object in front of our view of Sirius.    As one who has always been a sky watcher, and who takes photos daily &amp; nightly, I know what I am seeing.    These objects are at lower altitude than a planet, or star, and block our view of these natural objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been watching &amp; photographing them for months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description:   The SW object changes shapes which can be seen visually, and the lights appear to change colors.  It also seems to react to being photographed with more light pulses, brightening.  The object in front of Sirius shows the same characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both followed the natural path of Venus and Sirius across the night time sky.  If you get a camera on them, they are no further up than the usual low altitude UFO&#39;s that glide above many of our neighborhoods at night.   I would estimate the faux Venus object to be about 1 mile up, at most.  The faux Sirius object is probably 1 1/2 to 2 miles up, judging by it&#39;s size when video&#39;d.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This west side of Houston is a little known hot spot, with activity most days &amp; nights when the weather is good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will include video links at the email address you have provided that include photos, both original and enhanced to bring out the detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We live in the South part of Killeen, Texas and we usually see military and civilian aircraft fly over our house all the time, but this thing that flew over our house was a size of a 747 at is was about 750 feet to 800 feet in the air, their was no noise and no navigational lights.  Then when it started to get over a populated area, the light just blinked out, you could still see the shape of the object, but it was very vague.  It looked like a tear shape object with not red or green navigational lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be traveling in a southeasterly direction and disappeared behind South Mountain.  It was very similar to seeing a meteor on a dark night, but occurred in midafternoon on a clear sunny day.  Space debris?  And no, I had not been drinking or engaging in other mind altering activities.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/17/09 06:25|Loveland|OH|Triangle|5 minutes|Triangular object flew overhead at about 20 to 30 mph just above the trees!|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68398.html|234|ndxe200901| Triangular object flew overhead at about 20 to 30 mph just above the trees!<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday morning, January 17, 2009 I was leaving my house to go to work at 6:25 am.  I backed the SUV out of the garage and once I was in the street, facing Northwest, I immediately noticed a large bright yellowish white ball of light in the sky low on the horizon.  I had absolutely no clue what it could have been, but I wondered if it was a plane on fire or maybe a large plane with its headlights pointed toward me since my subdivision is on a flight path to and from Cincinnati Northern Kentucky airport.  I pulled up to the stop sign at the end of my street watching it and soon realized it was getting closer and flying toward the southeast at the back of my subdivision.  I turned left and stopped at the next stop sign and looked to my right and realized it was still flying low and moving very slowly.  I turned left and headed to the end of the street to exit my subdivision so I was driving Southeast too and could still see the light out my driver side window.  It was now to my left.  I hurried up and turned left onto State Route 48 to see if I could intercept it, and now I could see that the object was no longer a single large bright light but actually a solid object with multiple lights on it, and that it was flying very slowly, maybe only about 20 or 30 mph!  It was coming toward me now so I stopped the truck and put my window down to get a better view of it.  I couldn’t believe how close it was to the trees that are about 30 feet tall.  It was probably only 25 or 50 feet above the trees.  I watched as it approached me and it had several bright white lights across the front of it.  I opened the door and stepped out of my vehicle but stood right there, and I could hear this sound coming from it that I’m finding hard to describe.  Sort of like the sound of a jet engine with the volume turned way down, and this thing flew over me so slowly that I could now see that it was shaped like a triangle but with rounded edges, and was about the twice the size of my SUV.  There were no wings and! it had several white lights on the bottom and on the corners of it.  I saw a car coming up the street behind me so I hopped back in and put it in drive and tried to keep it in my view but was unable to.  I didn’t think to use my cell phone to take pictures of it!  I searched the Internet hoping to find something similar and I am uploading the two photos I found that are VERY similar to what I saw.  The first picture is the bright light off in the distance, and the second picture is one of a triangle but the one I saw had more lights under it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/17/09 04:30|Moraga|CA|Light|1 minute|Bright red light seen only 100 yards at 0 angle  eye level from my house  500 Lights On Object0: Yes|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68091.html|235|ndxe200901| Bright red light seen only 100 yards at 0 angle  eye level from my house  500 Lights On Object0: Yes<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have recently seen over the past week two (1) Bright red light twice on different dates 1st sighting (01/09-13/09) and second sighting (01/17/09) both times in the exact same spot no more than 100 yards from my house, right before a curve in the road at 0 degree level of angle, eye level.  It is a very bright, deep red light that does not strobe or blink in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently at 4:30 AM 01/17/09 I noticed my wireless internet abruptly cut out, and I went to the window to see if it was there, and sure enough it was.  This frightened me somewhat, being as that it keeps coming back, and this time it seemed to directly contact me in getting my attention by knocking out my wireless internet so that I would come to the window.  It was less than 100 yards from my house, and I know this because my road curves at around 100 yards, and it was clearly In front of a driveway no more than 100 yards away because the road curves there.  Clearly it was at eye level also because it was clearly a driveway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The past two times I have seen this bright red light it has stayed completely stationary.  The first time (around 01/09-13/09) it disappeared when a car was starting to come around the bend 100 yards down the street where it curves.  It simply just vanished instantly, like at the speed of light.  Absolutely NO FADE OUT.  The second time, it was like it directly contacted me and got my attention, knocking out my wireless internet!  I feel like I somehow knew it was there so I went to my window and sure enough, there it was, in the EXACT SAME SPOT as a few days ago.  It started to make me somewhat scared so as I was looking at the bright red object I simply told it  “You are kind of scaring me a bit, you know...”  So after observing it for about 30 seconds, Within 2 or 3 seconds of saying what I said looking directly at it, it disappeared!  It’s as if it was being considerate, and obviously showing signs of intelligence???  I live on a very suburban dark street with minimal street lighting and lots of retired folk, and almost everyone is in bed on my street at 4:30 AM I would assume except me because I am a college student still living with parents.  From now on I am going to keep my powerful Panasonic 10mp camera with me at all times if I am up early in the morning so hopefully I can get pictures of whatever this is… I have a feeling many others have seen what I am seeing, especially the Puget sound case in 2007, but not nearly this close… It is as if it is trying to make contact with me.  Hopefully from now on If it comes back I will be able to take high quality pictures and re post with an update.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Important note:  This has only started happening to me after I had seen the blinking red black triangles over the freeway in concord (HW 24) over the past month…<n>

We were laying on the grass at a school near my house, about a few minutes later- we saw something coming at us in the sky, it was oval shaped, and looked like a disk or saucer.  It  had yellowish windows that seemed to change  color to an orange-red.   It had tons of little windows the whole thing looked like a cartoon.  It came right at us and became 20 feet away.   We were so scared and ran off- we started to scream and cry.  We had left our phone so we went back for it, but we found it in our pocket.  By that time it had left, but we ran home.  When we got home we told my sister and my other cousins.  They didn’t believe us at first, but we looked so scared that they did.  It seemed like we were almost abducted.  We have seen many of these crafts before in the sky in a great distance, but this time it was coming towards us.  We have probably seen about 20 UFO&#39;s i! n the years 2008 and 2009 all together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

No object seen-just lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> Heading west bound on Hwy 52 towards home-looked up in the sky as I always do, as it is a beautiful clear San Diego evening with lots of stars, then to the south I saw a bunch of lights-dark orange-Not blinking, very odd color. Some were bigger and brighter than others. I put my hazards on and slowed to about 25 mph completely blown away by what I was seeing and trying to come up with a logical explanation. I thought for a minute maybe something had exploded in the sky and i was seeing the embers, then  (There was an airplane heading south that was much lower but had to have seen the same thing I was seeing-probably either just departed or preparing to land at Montgomery Field.)  I pulled off Regents Rd and stopped the car-almost shaking as I watched each light slowly fade away.  I am a native San Diegan and have seen a few odd things in the sky but this is by absolute far the craziest thing I have ever seen in my entire life.  I called Highway Patrol about ten mins after the sighting to see if anyone had reported seeing anything crazy in the sky tonight and they had not received any other calls yet.  I am usually skeptical as most things can easily be explained but tonight I am still really freaked out and I cannot possibly be the only person that saw this tonight.  It was too many lights and encompassed too big of an area............?????<n>

It wasn’t a plane because  one came past at the same time.  The lights looked to be in a similar distance perspective.  Cars were stopped in the street looking at it<n>

I dismissed it as nothing out of the ordinary, figuring it was possibly the planet Venus. I returned to my activities on the computer but I started thinking about the light and realized that I had never observed Venus in that position in the sky nor had I ever seen a star or planet either as bright or as big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After having pointed out the object to my brother I returned to my room, turned off the light, noted the time (20:46) and started watching the ball of light. It seemed to remain stationary but after a little while I thought I saw it move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To confirm that it was indeed moving I rested my chin on the window sill, braced my head with my hands and kept one edge of the window in my peripheral sight to provide a reference point. This is what I observed: 1: The intensity of the light changed, it would go from rather bright to fairly dim. The duration and brightness seemed quite random.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2: There appeared to be a background shape but I could not distinguish an exact form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3: The light pulsed or throbbed red. The duration and brightness of the pulse was somewhat variable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a rise, peak and fall unlike an airplane strobe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4: The light moved. It was moving westward (away from me) very slowly the whole time I watched, at times it would stop and stay in position and then in a very fluid but quick motion go either south or north a little ways and then either remain motionless in its new position or resume movement west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5: I saw three airplanes at different times coming from different directions and altitudes but they all were heading in general direction of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6: Toward the end of the time of my observation the light was pretty far away but it seemed to separate into three different points of light and then join back up into one several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time I spent intently watching this was just over 45 minutes, but starting from when I first spotted the light it was in the sky for over an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two side notes, the first one, This isn&#39;t the first time my brother and I have observed strange lights in the skies over Gladwin, if anyone in the central Michigan area has seen any UAP or UAVs please report it here. Second, If you watch the skies remember to keep camera batteries charged or fresh ones handy. My camera was on the same window sill that I was watching from but the battery was dead and I didn&#39;t want to break away to get the charger, if I had my camera I could have got some good shots with its 10x zoom and probally some good video due to how long the light was in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/16/09 20:00|brunswick|GA|Triangle|drive-by|huge triangular object with red pulsating lights|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68139.html|243|ndxe200901| huge triangular object with red pulsating lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday Jan. 16th 2009 I was driving on I-95 north heading to Savannah GA coming from Florida. I&#39;m not positive on what town I was in but I was not in GA for too long before the encounter. It was close to 8 o&#39;clock pm maybe a few minutes past. There was a pack of 18 wheelers 1/4 mile in front of me and a group of about 15 cars 1/2 mile behind me. I looked up and saw something out of the ordinary. On I-95 there are towers with red flashing lights and are triangular in shape. The object I saw was very similar but had to have been at least 300 yards long. The object was about 50 feet high give or take. The whole object was straight and flat, there were no curves of any sort. It was shaped like a wedge with 4 lights on each side and 3 in the back all evenly spaced and rectangular in shape. Also there were lights in the top but they were only turning on and off. The lights on the corners wrapped around both sides. All the lights were red. The lights on the bottom were pulsating from dim to bright and the lights on the top were turning on and off all at the same time. The side walls of this object seemed to be metal. The only thing I can relate the look to is the movie &#34;Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy&#34;. I am 100% positive that I saw what I saw, first of all I drove under it on the highway and second the group of cars that were behind me had slowed down considerably when they had gotten in view of it. I hope that another witness finds this website to validate my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved slightly over the 20 minutes observed but not fast enough to be an aircarft.  The object was also far too high in elevation to be a helicopter.  It would be considered by anyone to obviously be brighter than any star or planet in the sky on even a clear night, but the clouds behind it tonight(and sometimes briefly masked by) proved it to be closer in.  The brightness and then dimming was also not the result of the clouds becasue it did this even when clear. We also caught several minutes of the light on video that reflected the pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I continued staring at it for another thirty minutes and it didn’t move at all except for the amazingly bright light it was giving off. I called my brother outside and he originally said “that big star” then realized it utterly dwarfed any other visible star in the sky I went inside about 7:00 pm or a few minutes after and when I looked out the window at 8:10 it was no where in the sky. Upon mentening  my sighting the following day  ( 1-16-09 ) I’ve talked to three other people who saw the same strange big bright light in the sky.  I work as a night front desk person at a motel and am always looking at the stars, yet I have never seen something like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/16/09 18:30|Buffalo|MN|Light|at least 2 hours|Bright, white object with flashing red, yellow, green, and blue lights hovering in the night sky seen from Buffalo, Minnesota|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68069.html|248|ndxe200901| Bright, white object with flashing red, yellow, green, and blue lights hovering in the night sky seen from Buffalo, Minnesota<n> <n><n> <n><n> On January 15, 2009, I witnessed an Unidentified Flying Object from my home in Buffalo, Minnesota.  Here are the event details:  my husband and teenage daughter went out to run some errands.  I’m not exactly sure what time it was when he called me to see if I could see it from our house.  Indeed I could.  I studied it for a moment and concluded that it was not an airplane; I am familiar with the light patterns of airplanes, and this craft was flashing red, yellow, green and blue and seemed to be hovering in the night sky.  I grabbed my digital camera and took some pictures.  Looking at the craft with the naked eye, there were no “tails”, however, the “tails” were captured using the camera.  I then proceeded to use my digital camera to record a video of the craft.  In the video, we could see the movement: back and forth, up and down, and side to side, with no regular pattern.  My husband proceeded to tell me on the phone that he and our daughter were trying to drive to the craft’s location, but every time they got close, the craft would shoot to another location within view.  Duration of sighting was at least two hours.  Only one craft was sighted, its shape was hard to determine due to the distance, but seemed to be a bright light (extremely bright) with flashing red, yellow, green, and blue colors.  Its motion was sporadic at times, but seemed to hover in the same general area in the sky.  The weather conditions were as follows: very cold (approximately -20o) with clear skies.  It was evening (after 6 pm Central time).  The next day, January 16, 2009, a relative from Mason City, Iowa called to say that their family of three also saw the object in the sky (I posted the video on the internet and sent them pictures as well).  Our teenage daughter also captured some pictures with her digital camera, showing more erratic movement and green “tails”.  Distance was very hard to determine since the movement was not visible with the naked eye.  I was standing at my patio doors, filming above my h! ead slig htly.  From where I was standing, in order to cover it in the sky, I would have to have held up a dime.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was outside around 6:30-7:00pm on Friday after work playing with my dog, and b/c I live 5 minutes from the airport I happened to be looking up at all the airplanes in the sky. I noted just before the incident about what a clear night it was and how you could see almost all the stars. As I watched one plane that happened to be pretty low probably having just taken off and banking in a southern direction; going just under my clear view of a very bright Venus; I looked down at my dog. When I looked back up to find the plane to see which direction it was heading in, I noticed a single white light moving from the south to the north. It struck me as odd b/c I could see about 7 planes in the sky at one time from my vantage point and I noticed that all the planes in the sky had at a minimum of 2-4 lights on, and at least 1-2 flashing lights. I watched the single white light move north at a somewhat medium pace, wasn&#39;t fast, wasn&#39;t slow. As it got closer the single light started to turn pink, then changed to red then completely faded out. After I saw that I assumed that the object, presumably a plane, probably banked to the side and the light was hidden by a wing. So I sat outside for 10 minutes and watched the sky in the general area where the object was heading. I never saw a light appear in the area. I still saw several planes in the area, all with multiple light, and flashing lights. I also remembered to recheck the sky conditions for possible clouds... not a single cloud in the sky. I&#39;m a natural born skeptic, so this is strange for me. I was so baffled by this, that I told my wife and of course she laughed and told me I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/16/09 18:30|Albuquerque|NM|Other|30 seconds|Three spheres of light connected in a club like shape, lower lights soft whitish, upper light yellowish orangish traveling silently.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68080.html|250|ndxe200901| Three spheres of light connected in a club like shape, lower lights soft whitish, upper light yellowish orangish traveling silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 1/16/09 @ approximately 6:30 pm I was taking some trash outside and putting into the trash container. I then sensed movement. Looked directly up and saw three spheres of light sort of clustered together. The bottom two spheres were soft whitish in color. Not really a glowing. Different from any other aircraft that I have seen in the night. The third light/sphere was situated above the other two spheres sort of in a &#34;club&#34; like formation. The sphere was approximatly 1/3rd smaller than the other two directly below it. The light color was a faint yellowish maybe kind of orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Movement was silent and moderate, but detectible by my senses. The altitude I estimated at approximately 200 to 250 ft. With my past military experience I would say this craft traveling at this low altitude is undetectible by radar. this instantly raced through my mind. I dont know why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total approximate view time was approximately 10 to 12 seconds. It seemed much longer. I did a post mock-up this morning. Positioning myself and timing approximate viewing time. Not more than twelve seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was moving in a northeasterly direction. Speed was approximately 300 ft per second. While viewing. At approximatly the 7th second. [Estimated on my post mock-up also]. The two lower light spheres suddenly turned off. Leaving the third smaller faintish yellowish light sphere. Still travelling at the same rate but, getting fainter losing light and shape, then totaly vanishing. I was&#39;nt scared or startled. Just marveled,concerned, and sort of disturbed. As I feel presently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally. I have experienced seeing moving lights on different occasions. I always figured they have to do with the nearby airport and airbase. My experience last night was real and vivad. Recordable. Thank you.<n>
1/16/09 18:25|Yuma|AZ|Light|3-5|This sighting was EXTREMELY similar to "Endeavor" space shuttle night time fly-by's.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68070.html|251|ndxe200901| This sighting was EXTREMELY similar to &#34;Endeavor&#34; space shuttle night time fly-by&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen many UFO’S in Yuma for quite sometime, and have been always disappointed because I never had a camera at hand until today during this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to instantly recognize that this was very similar if not exactly what I have seen in previous times in Yuma.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They are major military bases in Yuma, and I truly believe that these bases DO withhold technology from which you will see in my video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen events of the space shuttles zooming across the sky’s at night, if you have seen that happen then you can DEFINITELY compare how this event looked extremely similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright white light that floated across the sky, catching my intention, enough to run inside and yell at my parents at the top of my lungs to come outside and witness this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so sure that this is what I have seen in the past multiple times, I even told them that this light would zoom away at thousands of miles an hour once it reaches the outside skirts of Yuma. This light did just that. My father said that that was the most significant part of this sighting, because I predicted or just pretty much knew it was going zoom out of sight at supersonic speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier this year I sighted what had been supposedly the space shuttle “Discovery” or “Endeavor”. Our local Yuma Daily Sun news report gave approximate times for the sighting of the space station flying past, and me being a constant observer of our skies I had seen this space station one night thinking it was a UFO later to find out it was “Discovery” or “Endeavor” that was flying by. I saw this light two nights in a row. Both nights sighting were extremely similar to what you seen is this video I took that I am now reporting to you guys. The only difference being between this sighting and the “Discovery” or “Endeavor” sighting is this video is shot while the sky is lightly lit. The sun was up enough to see the sunset on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This UFO was bee-lining across the sky at a steady, slow , floating pace. It was about 30 seconds later after this video ended, due to lack of memory on the camera, that the light zoom off at supersonic speeds right as it reached the outskirts of Yuma County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was shooting the video I was stating that the flashing red light was “BELOW”  white light. It “WAS” below the white light just before I shot the video. I did not realize the flashing red light from the plane had been coming toward us almost directly and had risen above the white light which you see in the video. The only conclusion I can get out of that is either this white light was below this plane and the plane gained altitude, or this white light is just outside the atmosphere and created an optical illusion even to myself. So the white light can appear to an observer to either be below the atmosphere in the skies of Yuma County or it was moving at incredible rates outside the atmosphere and floated across the sky very similar to that of the satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So let’s say if this object was in space then it being its size and the brightness of it, this object must be gigantic enough to reflect the sun’s light off it to appear so large. So one way or another the size of this thing is massive , and you can compare it to the plane flying past. Because the plane was flying by is going to make it much easier for you guys to study the size of this object and the direction its going. And myself living in Yuma since day one, and can bet my bottom dollar that the flashing red light was from a Jumbo Commercial Airliner, no doubt in my mind, that plane is heading right for California. The fence you see in my back yard it going parallel with North and South. The airliner is heading west. The light is Heading NW from what I observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me make this very Clear. This Object did not have supersonic speed until it reached the outskirts of Yuma. AS SOON AS IT DID it zoomed up to supersonic speeds and the lightly gradually at a somewhat fast pace got smaller and kind of dimmed smaller and smaller. A satellites light doesn’t even dim out like that. Satelites that I have seen in our skies did not move at same high speeds as this. Had the white light actually be in space. If it were then this white light would beat any satellite up there in a race hands down. And that was when the white light was just floating across the Yuma sky, so theres no telling just how fast this white light took off at the end of its descent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this white light come across the sky from the deep south of Yuma, and I could bet my bottom dollar it was in Mexico’s air space before it reached Yuma. Do our space shuttles travel from South to North? From what I understand they do not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love it if you guys could get back to me and let me know what you guys think of this and if this helps you with your research. Thank for taking the time to read this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks a billion!<n>

I was in the front passenger seat. The area is rural farming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We headed East on Chillburg Rd. then turned South, South East onto Best Road. As we cleared some trees I saw to the right of us (west) a bright pulsating white light. We were just coming into Rexville when I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We crossed the North fork of the Skagit river and turned South on Fir Island Rd. As soon as we turned, we saw it again to our right (west). It looked bigger this time and my friend suggested that it was Venus or Jupiter. Then we realized that the object was stationary and below the cloud cover. A light fog was rising but the object shone very bright like a mercury vapor light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We found a place to pull over and watched the object through binoculars for about ten minutes. It remained stationary about 35 degrees above the horizon. I used an old navy trick to judge degrees by extending my arm, fingers closed and parallel to the horizon. It measured 3 and 1/2 hands above the horizon which is about 35 degrees. I could not judge the distance but its altitude was under 3,000 ft. because that was the ceiling and it was below the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object, as seen through the binoculars, was extremely bright with a soft blue light that seemed to cover the top; a pale red glow showed amidships and the bottom and sides were bright white. It was silent and stationary. It&#39;s shape could not be determined because the pulsating light was too bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few other cars pulled over because they too saw it. Unfortunately, none of us had a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got back in our car and watched it as we continued south on Fir Island Rd. Just before the road comes to a tee and Fir Island turns sharply to the East, it disappeared. I started writing down everything I could remember and decided to submit this sighting.<n>

At first I thought it was a star, but then I noticed a red dot next to it. There were no clouds in the sky. It was floating next to a group of small mountains. Both dots were about the size of pinheads. The red dot was “orbiting” the white dot, moving from its left to right side, around it. The white dot moved slowly down and towards the mountains (my left), then up and continuing left. It appeared to be moving farther away, since the red dot was beginning to be harder to see, but I could still make out when it crossed in front of the white dot. This was about 15 minutes in. The white dot then started to make small counter-clockwise circles, stop, then make small clockwise circles. It repeated this about 3 or 4 times. It was very tiny at this point. Every time I looked away to try and make a phone call, it was hard to locate again. The white dot started to move towards the mountains again (my right), so I ran into the house to look for a better camera than the one on my phone, because it was too small to make out. I was in there for about 5 minutes, and when I came back outside it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I just started looking up at the clear blue sky because of the conversation these 2 guys standing near me. They were reminiscing about the US Airways plane crash on the 15th of January 2009. I saw an object in the shape of a diamond moving slowly from east to south west at about the speed of a floats in a parade. I believe it was metallic because it reflecting from the sun. It had no wings, no stabilizer and no propellers, just a diamond like shaped object. I viewed it for about 25 seconds. If I stick my finger out at it, it would be the size of a writing pen tip. The time was about 9:00am. I didn’t have my video camera with me. It was in my other car. I normally carry a mini DV cam in my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It still seemed to just be an airplane but I continued to follow it for about a mile.  When I finally got close it didn’t seem to be moving.  It was cigar shaped somewhat but was indented slightly in the middle (almost lip shaped).  By this time it was at 9 o’clock and I went to grab my phone to take a picture.

I don&#39;t recall the exact date, but I have seen a couple of reports on your website of similar sightings, so I thought I would report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, my daughter and I were travelling home at approximately 9:00 pm.  We were heading east on Jericho Turnpike, in the eastern portion of Commack, approaching Smithtown.  My wife was driving, I was in the front passenger seat and my daughter (17) was in the back seat.  Traffic was light, as it was a cold winter evening.  We were stopped at a red light when suddenly I saw, above and ahead of us, what looked like a shooting star....except it was very large, and bright green!   The first thought that entered my head was a meteor.  It was heading in a northerly and downward direction, so it passed in front of us from right to left.  It was only visible for a couple of seconds, as it was moving very fast, but as it flashed by, it momentarily lit up the sky around it in a bright green color.  As I stated , it was moving in a downward trajectory, so much so that it looked like it might crash in the neighborhood to our north, and I silently braced myself to hear some sort of explosion.  But nothing more happened.  After the object had passed, I waited a few seconds and then asked (trying not to sound too excited) &#34;did anyone just see that?&#34;  To my relief (that I wasn&#39;t having hallucinations), both my wife and daughter replied, tentatively, &#34;ummm...yeah&#34;.  I then asked whether either of them had any idea what we might have just seen.  My wife, almost too quickly, blurted out &#34;oh, it must have just been a shooting star&#34;.  I could tell by her voice that she really didn&#39;t believe this, but my wife is someone who does not like to engage in any discussions about anything paranormal, etc.  So, I just let this go, and didn&#39;t bother to comment that I&#39;ve seen many shooting stars in my lifetime; that they are not this BIG; and that they aren&#39;t BRIGHT GREEN!  I tried to make more light conversation about what we&#39;d just seen, but I ! got the distinct impression that both wife and daughter were a bit creeped out by it, and didn&#39;t want to talk about it, so I dropped the subject.  However, one last postscript to this....about a mile east of our sighting, we encountered a County police car coming in the opposite direction toward us.  The officer was not using his siren, but had all of his emergency flashers on, and was driving at a high rate of speed.   He was obviously making a silent response to something urgent, and as he approached us, he made a screeching right turn onto a side street and headed north into the neighborhood where I thought our &#34;shooting star&#34; might crash.  (He made the turn almost on two wheels, and was drivng so fast that my wife commented, &#34;Whoa....where&#39;s HE going?&#34;)   I don&#39;t know if the two events were just coincidence....or if the officer saw the same thing that we did!  I have no idea what it was that we saw...I am not saying it was a &#34;flying saucer&#34;....just that it was NOT an ordinary shooting star.  I won&#39;t say it was unlike anything else I&#39;ve ever seen, because I did have a similar sighting several years ago, late at night, while sitting on my deck.  In that instance, however, the same type of green &#34;shooting star&#34; went directly overhead, travelling west to east, and did not appear to be travelling downward.   I don&#39;t wish to identify myself, just to say that I consider myself a qualified observer, as I am a 24-year-veteran law enforcement officer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It resembled a comet or flare, but it was green. The object had the intensity of a welding torch, but did not burn my eyes; the tail behind was, as I stated earlier, a bright turquoise-green. I saw it out of the corner of my eye and watched it go over the tree tops. There was no boom, there was no whistle or pop, these led me to believe it was not a firework or bottle rocket.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a possible unrelated event, a few minutes later, a plane came flying over from the horizon. All that were visible were the lights on it, but rather than flashing like a normal military or commercial plane, it flashed similarly to that of a police car. I didn&#39;t stick around to see where it was headed, as it was cold, so I went into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My house is about 25 to 30 miles away from an air force base, but in the 10 years we&#39;ve lived here, I&#39;ve never seen anything like the green light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Object then began chasing the car back to Olathe / Lenexa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 1-7-2009 at approximately 21:00, an unknown bright object was spotted in the sky over Olathe, Kansas in the South / Southwest area.  The object was seen shining lights out the sides and changing colors from bright white to a dim soft blue, back to bright white and to a dim soft green and back.  Finally, at 21:30 the light dimmed to red and disappeared low in the sky to the West.  (2) individuals witnessed this event while talking to each other on cell phones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The same light was seen again on 1-15-2009 at 20:00 in the same area.  The same (2) individuals while talking on cell phones in (2) different cars viewed the object in the same vicinity directly over Pflumm Road in Olathe, Kansas.  This time, the object was chased by car (1) in an attempt at a closer look to identify the object.  The light was again seen shining rays out the sides and changing colors in the same pattern as before.  The chase car turned West from Pflumm Road onto College Boulevard and several times stopped to look at the object through a pair of binoculars, however, the object was too bright to make out any shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several times it seemed that the car was getting closer to the object.  When College Boulevard came to an end near the Douglas County Line, the chase car changed to K-10 Highway and proceeded to follow the light West towards Lawrence, Kansas.  No longer would the light allow the chase car to get closer, several times it appeared that planes flew near the object, but it was followed only by car (1) through Lawrence until K-10 ended at Clinton Lake.  The light then stayed in the same location for 30-minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now it gets really interesting.  With the light still in the same location, the chase car began heading East, back to Olathe / Lenexa at approximately 21:00.  While car (1) proceeded back, the person in car (2) reported the light FOLLOWING the original chase car (Car [1]), changing directions and altitudes!  Car (1) stopped several times to confirm this!  This new chaser-being-chased event continued for 30-minutes!  Both cars proceeded to a parking lot at Shawnee Mission Parkway and I-435 where the object began a slow decent while still changing colors, now also changing to orange and red.  At no time did the color change flash (as landing or marking lights would), the color would just change from one to another in a random way.  The object now began moving back toward the west, away from the cars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 21:30, both car (1) and now car (2) proceeded South on I-435 and the object began moving West/ South West again.  Car (1) exited on 87th street while car (2) continued South.  Car (1) came to a stop on a hill just West of a Kansas National Guard Armory.  The object was still in the distance and at the same low altitude, but becoming less bright.  Suddenly, the object turned a faint red and disappeared at approximately 21:45.<n>

I have never seen anything so bizarre.  I though perhaps it was this a hovering plane of some sort, however, I witnessed a plane flying under it and it was moving at a normal pace whereas this large light of sorts moved slowly and at times appeard to just hover.  When I stared at it, I though I saw flikering lights within the light.  I though my eyes were playing tricks on me.  Can anyone help me confirm this siting?<n>

The object also seemed to have an illuminating red ball that lit up every five minutes or so lasting for a few seconds.  The event was witnessed first by one member, than another and finally one more who took a more closer look at the object through a telescope. His findings were that the object had to be a star that was close?  Upon trying to find the object minutes later in a sky that had too much clearance for anything to have had disappeared that quick, and knowing it could not have been a satellite, or airplane, the only conclusion is that it was something flying that was unidentified... UFO?<n>

He lives in the northeast US.  He claimed to have seen a UFO on two occasions near his home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incident #1 Date:  Actual date isn’t exact though he remembers somewhere in mid January 2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time of day: approximately 7PM Location: My cousin was out in the yard playing with his 2 dogs, a golden retriever and a chocolate lab.  He claims that the dogs actually spotted (or heard? or sensed?) the UFO before he did which drew his attention to it.   He spotted a UFO hovering just below the tree line that was shaped like a “stretched cube” (rectangular block shaped) – the trees were approx 80-90 ft tall (estimated).  My cousin estimated that the UFO was about 1000 ft away from himself.   The grayish-black (charcoal) colored UFO looked like a “square house with rounded corners with lighted square windows all around it on every side except for the top and bottom which had smaller round white lights”.  The UFO then came above the tree line and started doing different flipping and turning movements.  He said it didn’t look like or act like a plane or a helicopter or anything that we know of or make in the US.  He described the pattern of bright white lights along the windows as going all solid and then flashing very quickly in an ordered sequence one after the other and then back to solid.  The lights on the top also flashed in the same pattern.  He claimed that after the craft went above the tree line that it was “watching him” and sort of “showing off” as it did its maneuvers.   He estimated the size of the craft as approximately 30-40 feet long and about 10 ft high.  He mentioned that it spun slowly 3 to 4 times on different axes (Y then X and then like a 45 (or 135) degree angled axis).  He noted that after spinning on one axis that it would very quickly move linearly to another position and then spin slowly on a different axis.  Both dogs were trying to get inside the house when the craft appeared.  They were barking and yipping to get inside the house and didn’t appear comfortable around the UFO.  This whole event lasted for about 3-4 minutes.  He didn’t hear any sound at all though because his dogs were barking loudly so that pretty much dominated any audio.  However he noted that he didn’t hear any loud jet-lane type noises.! He men tioned that while the UFO was in the tree line of pine trees that the branches were shaking and shuttering.  He only watched for 4 minutes and then went inside because it was unnerving.  And after inside the house he looked again quickly and it was gone.  He told his parents who didn’t believe him which is why I am penning this for him (Uncle Age 43) Incident #2 Then about 1.5 months later he claimed to have seen it again in the same spot though only for about 30 seconds this time.  The UFO appeared to execute the same maneuvers as described above in the first incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He drew some pictures that depict the UFO and how it turned axially and also the lights on the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin gets good grades in school and isn’t lying about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

1/15/09 18:15|Birmingham|AL|Light|40 minutes|Strange light(s) in the sky over Birmingham, Alabama for  2 consecutive days|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68052.html|269|ndxe200901| Strange light(s) in the sky over Birmingham, Alabama for  2 consecutive days<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the Western sky around 6:15-7:00pm central time in Birmingham,AL I was outside on my back porch when I looked up (as I always do to look at the stars), and I observed a light in the sky that at first I thought was a star. The thing that caught my eye was the fact that it was a bit larger than a star and a lot brighter. I&#39;ve seen this in the sky for the last few weeks, and I simply thought it was Jupiter or Venus or some other planet that I thought I had heard someone on TV talking about being in the night sky at this time in the year. Well, on this night and on the next, the &#34;star&#34; moved. I don&#39;t mean it moved a tiny bit, it really moved! If you hold your hand out at arm&#39;s length to measure the distance that it moved, it moved about 3-4 inches in any given direction. Sometimes it would perform a circle type movement, but most of the time it would just kind of &#34;float&#34; around, going from one side to the other, back and forth. I observed this for 40 minutes or so, until I could no longer see it (it seemed to sink in the sky as time went on). It would seem to be moving in a straight line at times, almost like it was deciding on a direction to take, and would travel in this straight line for a couple of inches (at arm&#39;s length) and then it would stop, only to move around aimlessly, without purpose again for a while. I&#39;m not sure how many points of light there were coming from the object, but at times it seemed to have more than one, maybe three or more. Maybe it was disk shaped, because at times it would dim as though the lights were turning away from my direction. There were no flashing lights of any color, only whitish light. I hope to see it again the next few nights to take a picture or video of it.(I have no camera, but my girlfriend does)<n>
1/15/09 18:10|Houston|TX|Other|about an hour.|Multiple UFO Sightings Houston, Texas|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68049.html|270|ndxe200901| Multiple UFO Sightings Houston, Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting outside with a friend when we notice a police helicopter circling around us (it continued to do so for about 10min.) Then we saw a triangular craft with a bright white light in the middle with smaller lights throughout the craft. I could pefectly see the shape of it. It was moving slowly and ackwardly and moved out of sight. Then we saw what was the shape of a twin rotor army helicopter, but it was making a low drone noise and had two very bright red lights. When one light blinked the other would go out and visa versa. On this one, it could just have been an army helicopter. But, the lights were really strong...not the normal airplane/helicopter light. Either way, why would there just be one flying relatively low to the ground? Then 10-20min. later we saw another triangular craft like the one before, but it soon disappeared. And about 5min. after that we saw the strangest thing yet. A group of blinking lights that were blinking really excitedly. Going from dim to dark as they blinked. And it would jump from one place to another and make really weird flight patterns. Sometimes it would go dim and then go really bright and go up and down really fast and then appear somewhere else. (I have a short video of it where you can see it jump, but at this point the ship had stopped blinking. Where do I send the video?) Then it started turning left then right in a smooth zig zag type of pattern. It seemed to have a shape while it was turning, but it&#39;s hard to explain the shape. I&#39;d say it&#39;s closest to the &#34;chevron&#34;sign. We also saw a bright white orbish object flying around it for a little bit. Then it started moving back and forth, then disappeared. It&#39;s been a crazy night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no noise coming from the ball (object) and never changed altitude the entire time it was in sight. If I had to estimate the size of the object I would say it was as big as a king sized bed.

At the back of the field there are woods to the left that go behind apartments but also go down a steep hill that connects to someone’s field for their horses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were walking closer and closer to the woods I suddenly saw the entire woods light up as if there was a giant flashlight beam over everything.  I stopped walking and asked my boyfriend, who is that?  I thought it had to be a person and when he looked at the woods he saw the light right before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were frozen to the spot, it was the scariest thing id ever seen and then my boyfriend noticed a light on our feet, it looked like a bluish light from one of those high powered flashlights and we thought it was the cops, we were in the park after hours, but when I looked all around me and no one was there, no cop was shouting at us and the light was a perfect circle around us like someone was above us so we looked up and of course saw nothing but that was even worse than seeing something so we ran full speed down the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn’t stop till we were all the way at the other end but my boyfriend looked back while we were running and he said he saw an orb of orange light gliding down the field, when I looked it was gone but we started running again anyways because we were afraid of being chased.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn’t go back to the park for awhile but a couple weeks later when I wasn’t afraid anymore we went back.  That night my boyfriend and I had an argument so we sat under the pavilion to talk about it.   I had my back to the field but he was facing it and he pointed towards the woods and told me to look because he saw a bright orange light in the sky.  I looked but the light was gone.  I stared at the spot for a minute and then looked away when he said it came back and this time it was there.  The light was small,  from our view point it looked like the size of a beach ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about fifteen or twenty seconds the light started to expand.  It just got bigger and brighter, and then the most amazing unexplainable thing happened.  It seemed to unfold and it went from a big ball of light into exactly what you would picture a UFO to look like, a saucer shaped hover craft, except the light was so bright that it didn’t have a defined shape.  It was like the sun on earth, it blurred the vision around the UFO and after five or ten seconds it started to descend behind the woods and I assume it landed in the field behind it.  My boyfriend and I wanted to get closer, to go find it but I refused to go in the woods at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then I haven’t ever seen anything like that but I honestly now believe aliens or someone not like us is out there, watching, or maybe waiting for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw has inspired me to look up a lot of information on aliens and I think when these UFO’s are seen it is by choice to determine when or if ever it will be acceptable for aliens to walk among us.<n>
1/15/09 00:05|Rockville|MD|Sphere|2 minutes|Large, floating metallic sphere with a single 'headlight' and atleast 3 red lights on its bottom-side|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68037.html|278|ndxe200901| Large, floating metallic sphere with a single &#39;headlight&#39; and atleast 3 red lights on its bottom-side<n> <n><n> <n><n> On January 15, 2009 at approximately 12:05 AM in Rockville, MD 20850, I witnessed a UFO silently moving across the sky not too far away from me.  I am a college security officer and was out patrolling the campus when I observed a bright light West of me.  At first I assumed it was an airplane with an extremely bright light and I thought to myself ‘that is a really bright light’.  The sky was somewhat cloudy at times but it was clear enough that stars were visible still – more like a hazy/cloudy sky at the time of the sighting.  If one has seen an airplane traveling through clouds before, one would have observed that the headlight is distinct and the light forms a triangular shape; this object I was watching was doing the same thing only it was at least twice as big as a light from an airplane.  Throughout the approximate 2 minutes I watched this light, it began to move South and I thought to myself ‘either that plane is about to crash into me or it is flying dangerously low’.  My assumptions that it was an airplane were backed by 3 flashing red lights beneath it (resembling a planes wingspan).  As it began to turn South from its seemingly stationary position, I thought that it could not be an airplane and that it must be a helicopter.  The only problem is that this made no noise that I could hear what-so-ever (when police helicopters fly anywhere near the campus, they are extremely loud and obvious, unlike what I saw).  As it turned I caught a very clear sight of the actual object on its side in the bright moonlight and at that point I ruled out the possibility of it being a helicopter.   The object most simply described was a large, dark, metallic sphere floating slowly in the air, possibly a few hundred feet above the treetops.  I was unable to assess how large this object was, but from my view, its size was about the same as the moon’s size from my view.  I even considered the possibility that it was some sort of remote controlled toy but it was too big and I thought that it would be ! silly fo r anyone to be playing with something like this at midnight.  It was heading out of my sight and about to be hidden behind a building and large bare trees so I ran to get to the other side of the building to get a better look but I could not find a trace of it anywhere.  I did see what seemed like an airplane traveling very far away in the distance but could not understand how it could have gone that far in a matter of 15 seconds or so.  But I am 100% sure of what I saw; a large sphere-like object with a single intensely bright ‘headlight’ on its side facing a downward angle and at the least 3 red flashing lights on its bottom side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One housekeeping staff working through the night noticed a bright light in the sky not moving but did not think enough of it to watch it because it was too cold outside.  He went to throw out garbage but on his way back he noticed that it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other security officer claims he saw red lights in the clouds above him not moving but did not see the actual object as I did as he drove around in the security truck but did not pay much attention to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The duration of time of what I saw was about a total of 2 minutes but I only saw the actual objects body for approximately 10 seconds.  Never in my life have I seen anything that could have been a UFO before today.  It clearly was what I said it was.  While speaking with the housekeeping staff witness inside of a building, we both heard what sounded like a rocket being fired.  An example of this sound is what the fireworks sound like during 4th of July celebrations as they are fired into the air.  But there was no sound following this whistle.  This is possibly unrelated but in my 2 years of working this shift at this job I have never heard anything like this.  After hearing it I ran outside to see if there was something to see but the sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was out on the porch watching all the trees fall down because of the ice.  I had just finished my cig and was waiting for the tree across the street to fall and noticed this object floating across the sky.  It was in between some trees, but I watched it for about 30 seconds before it went behind the trees.  I ran in to get my boyfriend to come see it but it never came back into view.  It was silver and disked shaped.  When it was moving it kind of wobbled back and forth and you could only tell it was a saucer when it wobbled.  It wasn&#39;t moving very fast but it was nothing I have ever seen before.  I really think it had something to do with the ice storm as it was a state of emergency.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have responded to the witness, requesting a date for the sighting.

It looked like one flashing beacon light on a tower at first but it then it tracked across the sky like there was five of the same flashing light in a row. Then in an instant it was one again just pulsating in the same spot. Then in a quick instant it was on the other side of the highway far from where it was the first time in a stationary position not moving. It was so fast I didn&#39;t even see it move to its new location. It was just there. It was to fast to be any type of aircraft. Very strange and not sure what It was. I got off the ramp and looked back and it was still there in its new spot just flashing away. It was around 11 PM. I might add that it was on a night where the temps were below 10 degrees and we were getting a light snow so the sky was cloud covered. The object was very bright and constantly pulsating. When I first saw it I thought it was a beacon light on a cell tower but I drive this way every day and there is no towers where I saw the light which is why I watched it so close. It was so bright it stood out on a snowy night. This all happened over Moraine State park. It was so odd to see I was asking myself did it really just do what I thought it did?<n>

The sky was perfectly clear with no clouds. At first, I thought maybe it was a planet or something until it started moving. It seemed to rise slowly while zigzagging back and forth. After watching it for a little over a minute it completely disappeared. The object looked to be a mile or two away west-southwest toward Dawson. I live out in the country surrounded by farmland so I have a pretty good view all around me. This is probably the 3rd time in the last two months I&#39;ve seen this same light around my house. Also, I saw several planes out and about but as far as I know it didn&#39;t make any sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no sound.  The object moved smoothly, quickly and silently across the sky.  It moved in a S.W. direction from highway 19 S.,it appeared to be about 300 feet away and it appeared to be bigger than---I don&#39;t know--bigger than a helicopter--it disappeared behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was easily the brightest object in the sky and the sky was very clear and I could see many stars and even the faint milky way, since there isn&#39;t much city light to diminish the view of the stars where I live.  I was not aware of any planetary sightings during this period, and was most certain that what I had spotted was not a plane or satellite, I watched closely and made a call to my ex-wife who lived on the other side of town.  She went outside and spotted the object as well, noting as I did that it moved in an ever so slight wobble.  Being that it was around 29 degrees outside, she went back in to her home.  I stayed out side and watched this object float around the general area that I had initially spotted it in for 75 minutes.  It&#39;s movement varied from random wobbles to slow vertical movement.  There were approx. 18 aircraft that traveled in the visual area of this object and as these aircraft flew through my view ( I kept constant watch of the object.) the object would move in a seemingly defensive direction, but not drastic in relative distance.  At 20:15 the light very slowly began to fade until I was able to discern a somewhat shape of a disc and from where the light appeared to emit, the color turned from yellow to red then the object completely disappeared.  I did shoot 35 seconds of cell phone quality video.  You can not see the stars or planes that were flying by, but clearly see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Lights did not resemble an airplane in fact an airplane was noticed at the same time at lower altitude with its blinking light to the north west of my house heading east towards the philadelphia airport. These 3 lights hung just south east of our home in west chester and moved slowly up and down and sideways in a quick manner. Slowly it disappeared in the sky moving upward.

I continued driving down the highway, at 1:11 A.M. i got a closer look. I could not make out a shape at all there seemed to be a flashing red light, on my left side of the object, white in the middle, and blue on right. I heard no noise coming from the object. It seemed to hover very slowly adjacent to me on my right, almost staying with my speed, then take an immediate turn over me and across the highway. On what i can assume would be the backside of the object, i saw a fast set of flashing lights from right to left, there seemed to be about four to five flashing lights. It had a slight angle from top left to bottom right, while floating straight ahead over a tall hill out of sight. After continuing my drive, i stuck my head out the window, and saw the object just floating passed the hill very slowly, until it was once again out of sight at about 1:14 A.M. It was a cloudless night, in an area where there is no light pollution from surroundings<n>

We saw 8 lights (very bright) in the sky. I asked him what that was, he didn’t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we drove down a back road toward the lights. As we approached there were no sounds like a regular aircraft. We got directly underneath of them, we could tell they were both triangular in shape, had 4 very bright white lights across the front. When I backed into a driveway to turn around, I heard a whooshing sound &amp; they both took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took me all of about 10 seconds to turn around &amp; they were gone. I would approximate that the crafts were about 100 feet off of the ground &amp; hovering until we approached<n>

We stopped for a light, and I asked my husband, did he see it. It was so large, that he had missed the lights that showed it&#39;s shape. A very large triangle. Two white lights blinking on top, two white lights blinking on the bottom, and to the midpoint on our left - a flashing red light. I exclamed it was as large as a football field, my husband believed it was larger than that. It wasn&#39;t tower lights, it was low to the Earth, and hovering, like on a side - not flat across. When the light changed we continued on our way, wondering what we had just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At the tail end of the object the yellow tail broke and there were three distinct flowing yellow lights coming out of the back end of the object, like engines.  No noise.  When it appeared it tilted slightly to the left then disappeared again.  While watching this flying object it appeared very small and there was a very bright white led like light in the center of the object.  It is almost like when the object put on the brakes so to speak it appeared and then when it released the brakes it disappeared again.  There were no blinking lights on this object and it was moving very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sun had set and the sky was almost dark but still had a slight glow to the sky. The balloon object; no lights,  was flying away from my position like a knuckle ball at about the 2:00 o&#39;clock position, but the wind was blowing into my face from the north. Than without a noise, the balloon object went straight up about 12:00 o&#39;clock position, dove straight down to the left, came right at us over another fast food place and grew to about 10&#39;-14&#39; in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my daughter to look at the object when i pointed over the buildings horizon. She saw the tear dropped balloon looking object and within a second it darted up and out to the left and was gone in 1 sec. It shrank in size as if traveling at a very very high rate of speed. Again no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it were a balloon, how could the balloon travel seem to go against the wind about 1/4 mile and hover perfectly still, move again very quickly, hover, and take off like it was shot out of cannon?  I am not a true beliver in UFO&#39;s but this was a very curious encounter, and after watching your show for the first time this past Saturday, I thought I would pass this info to you. All the best.

F Time: 4:28 pm Location: Wilbarger Co., Texas  I was driving home from work SE bound on US HWY 287 about 3 miles NW of Electra, Texas, when I saw a very bright shiny ovoid shape back to the south (right side of HWY). I&#39;d guess it to be about 0.5 miles away and maybe 2-3 thousand ft. high. The craft was hovering in place but as soon as I locked my gaze on it, it fell with dazzling speed towards the ground at about a 45 degree angle. Then it completely disappeared. I don&#39;t mean moved out of sight, I mean it was like someone switched off a light bulb! It flat out disappeared!  As I was watching, it suddenly reappeared est. 1/4 mile north from where it disappeared, now flying slowly at about 1000 ft. off the ground back across the left side of the highway heading due north, it then fizzled and sparked (electrical short?) and completely disappeared again. I&#39;d say the first sighting lasted about 4 seconds and the last maybe 2 seconds. I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was very, very strange! I know it was no airplane, weather balloon, or space debris because of the controlled movements and the disappearance/reappearance. Other planes were flying, leaving plain vapor trails, this left no vapor trail at all.<n>

Out of the top, right corner of my windshield, I noticed a very large, very shiny, silver object in the sky, absolutely frozen in place. Compared to how the sun appears in the sky, the object was maybe one-and-a-half times as wide and one-fourth to one-third as high. I watched it for as long as I could, which was maybe four to five seconds. I had to take my eyes off it to negotiate the curve. When I came out of the turn a few seconds later, the object should have been directly in front of me, but it was gone. The object appeared to have been a little way out over Lake Pontchartrain, near the Causeway, just outside of New Orleans. This would put it a few miles from the airport, but there’s no way it was a jet or plane. It was much too big, much too shiny, and it never moved during the time I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed one bright light at first sitting stationary over the Atlantic ocean at first glance I thought it was a plane but realized that it was just sitting there then I noticed a second light of to the right side and down from the other light I watched these lights for about ten minutes just sitting there not moving I’ve lived near airports and usually they will come in back to back so I’m used to that and it wasn’t anything like this. I would also like to point out I served six Years in the military and I know what flares are and how they move so this wasn’t any flares. Well thanks for your time I wanted to share this information with you I goggled to see if there were other reports and found that this wasn’t the first time someone has seen lights on the Atlantic Ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best Regards,   ((name deleted))<n>

I was watching a movie, when a strong noise, like that of a helicopter, appeared all of a sudden over my building (very close to Washington Square)  I went out to the balcony and saw a big object standing still, flying very close to the last floor (the 17th, I live in the 3rd)  Actualy I would have said it was a helicopter, but my mind was saying to me &#34;no, it isn&#39;t&#34;, as there was a wierd light belt surrounding the structure from the bottom to the top, with white, blue and red colors.  I went downstairs to follow the object, as it was disappearing to my eyes whenever it crossed to the other side of the building or was geting closer to the roof.  As you can imagine, I wouldn&#39;t have gone downstairs a regular monday at 4AM for something that wasn&#39;t wierd enough.  I have to add also that, as a sciencetist I use to be kind of objective and sceptic.  I took my camera (regular old digital camera) with me, but the only one picture I could make was a very vague light in a dark sky, which equals nothing.  The object finally slowly flew towards the west side, I tried to follow it, but disapeared between the buildings. I went from 3rd street/Laguardia Place  all the way to the 7th avenue, and from there I could just slightly hear the &#34;helicopter&#34; noise, but couldn&#39;t see anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to imagine that it was a helicopter that, because was dark and the long shaped structure, I was confusing with something else, and that&#39;s all. But could you please let me know if you have been reported from anyone else or you can find anything like this today?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My boyfriend thought it was a plane or jet fighter since it was so loud but I said the sound was too loud.  So we looked out the balcony and into the sky and saw a flash of light beam fast across.  We then went to the front of the apt to follow the light.  When we looked to the sky we saw about  10 flashing, sparkling lights in a row and above about 3 more but a good distance from each other.  That lasted about 30 seconds or so and then it hid behind the clouds and we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This craft was also almost silent and did not make the usual jet or airline sounds I normally hear. This craft was probably about 10 to 15 thousand feet up and flew about two to three times the velocity of a normal airline jet.  I have never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was HUGE and for a moment I thought that it could have been Venus, although, I&#39;ve never seen Venus so enormous.  Upon starring at it for a few minutes it appeared to have a red center.  The Asheville Airport is near here so we are familiar with aircraft travel and appearances.  The aircraft from the airport that we did see during this event would pass behind or to the side of this bright object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my Mother who lives in Etowah (about 20mins west of my location)  and she said that she also saw the bright light.  We don&#39;t have a telescope so we used binoculars to look closer.  Looking through the binoculars  also appeared to have a red center and trails of yellow which turned blue at the top coming off of it, almost like a meteor or satellite coming into the atmosphere.  However, this changed.  It then began  to appear that what I thought had been trails were surrounding it.  I checked to see how it looked at that point by the naked eye and it appeared to be as I had originally seen it;  just a huge star with a red center.  After being unable to determine what it was I went inside the house and checked back 30 minutes later where it had appeared to have moved latterly across the horizon toward west.  I know that it moved because on first seeing it the object had been right between two trees and on my seconding outing I saw it behind a tree more to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen this same light on other occasions but assumed that it was Venus or some gigantic star. If I see it again, I will definitely post again.   Could this be Venus?  Or a satellite falling?<n>

I was going next door to give my girl friend the phone. A helicopter seemed to be flying out of the area when I looked east over the hill and I saw what looked like three bright lights forming a triangle directly above the hill. The lights were bright and they seemed to be rising in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called people from inside my house and next door to come look, that is when one after another the lights began to break off and fly west towards the coast. Once they fly over the population it seemed the lights went out and red and blue lights replaced them with white flashing ones. They were able to stop on a dime and change direction and made no noise and we hear helicopters and planes just fine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After three of the lights did this then hovered lingered and crossed over and under one another out at the coast, three more came over the hill. This continued for almost an hour. I have no idea what I saw, I know that where I live does not have nearly as much air traffic as was going on that night. We got some video but it was taken with a shaken hand. After all the lights flew out to the coast that was the end of the night’s excitement. I did not have any binoculars only a Sony cybershot camera.<n>

As we sat and waited for my car to get warm, I noticed a peculiarly bright light in the Western sky. The light caught my attention initially because it was the brightest light in the sky, much brighter than any of the stars. But then as I sat and watched it, I noticed it was traveling incredibly akward to be a plane. First off, it was traveling left to right, then remaining stationary (hovering like a helicopter), then continuing to take off again, sort of zig-zagging. As it proceeded this routine, I ran back inside and grabbed my digital camera and batteries (nothing substantial seemed to come out, but they&#39;re open for review). I did notice, however, as i tried to focus on the object with the camera, i could clearly see a purple, cyan, blue alternating color pattern (this could just be coincidental, but even with the naked eye an alternating strobe could be seen).<n> <n><n> <n><n> All in all, I&#39;m not saying it was ever close enough for me to say it was an alien craft or UFO. I am, however, asking for an explination for the object I most certainly witnessed in the sky. Take into concideration that my father has worked with airplanes his entire life and being that we live less than a mile from the city airport (that has no military connection), I&#39;m familiar with the common planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time<n>

It appeared to be a planet like Venus. I looked in the westbound direction, probably heading 270 from my vantage point from the east looking directly west. It was above the West Maui Mountains. It was clear night. The star or light, was very bright and getting brighter in intensity. It was then moving slowly, from left to right. and then it would stop. and then it would move again, right to left. And then, it would dim, until it was completely out of sight. It was at least at a 60 degree angle slant range from my point of view. It was very high above the mountains, not near any horizon or clouds or sea level horizon. It was at a 60 degree angle. and then it would reappear, and it would become a bright light again. This pattern would continue for about 10-15 minutes. I don&#39;t think it was any clouds or atmosphere, because I the visibility was clear, light winds, no clouds, and clear night skies. You could see other stars blinking continuously, and you could see the Hawaii night sky. I cannot say that it was in fact an flying saucer, or UFO, but I do not believe it was a planet nor a star. A planet does not move, from side to side, a star blinks, it does not dim for 1 minute and then turn bright for the next minute. and then after this pattern repeatedly, it completely disappeared, and the light never reappeared. If it was Venus, it would have come back into view, I continued to watch the night sky for another whole hour. Same direction, same area, and the light never reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light balls were to the left of the highway about five miles away and a mile up in the sky.  They were lighting up and burning out, one after the other.  As soon as the last one lit up, the first one burned out, followed by the second and so on.  There were four in a row that did this.  I arrived home and continued watching them.  The lights sporadically burned out and lit up again, not always in single file this time.  Some would not quite burn out, to where my fiancé and I could see them dart back and forth, then light up again.  While doing this, the lights would leave tracers.  The lights seemed to be alive while darting around then stopping in place, slowing down, and then speeding up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The full moon was just rising and illuminating the sky. It was a beautiful night and warm for winter here in East Naples, FL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would gaze at the moon, marveling at how beautiful it was as it was rising into the night sky and then pay attention to my dog. My dog is an elder fellow and is blind so I need to be careful to keep an eye on him and give the correct ‘signals’ to help him navigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed groupings of several people, some were talking around a golf cart and some were partying, or at least that is how it sounded. Both groups were far enough away from me that I could not converse with them nor did I know who they were so therefore I was unable to ask them if they had seen what I just saw in the full moon night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I gazed up and saw two pulsing red/white orbs circling each other to the right side of the moon. They were pulsing light objects with red in the center with bright white around the perimeter of each one. They moved in unison and always parallel to one another. They seemed to be equidistant from each other. If one moved up, the other kept the same distance or so it seemed to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took me a few seconds to realize what my eyes were seeing. These pulsing orbs of light were playing with each other and then suddenly the pulses started to dim and they were gone. I kept looking up to see if they showed up at any other place in the night sky, but they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would guess that they were not visible by me for more than 2 minutes tops. Or at least once I noticed them in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately walked my dog and I back home as fast as I could and let my husband know exactly what I had seen. He could tell I was excited about this episode!! I have searched the Internet this morning to see if I could find anything about this episode and that is how I came upon your site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what I saw, other than it was an unusual sight. One I have never seen before nor will I forget. It stayed with me long after I saw them last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And I turned to my boyfriend and pointed it out to him.  Him being so skeptical, I thought he was going to dismiss what I was seeing, but he looked up and said, &#34;what is that?&#34;.  We both agreed it was not a plane or like anything we have ever seen before.   I am pretty positive it wasnt a plane because planes have red or white lights flashing and are always flying over head as we live near 2 major aiports; and seeing so many, this was in no way a plane.  The light was very bright, large and orange in color, wierd in shape (fireball-ish?), like nothing I&#39;ve seen before. As we stared we noticed that the orange light was very bright and large for being a distance away. It was heading Northwest to Southeast, towards us. The first one stopped, stood still or hovered for more than a few seconds and then headed west. There was a second one behind it, just as bright orange as the first. It was coming from the same direction. It stopped and was hovering. It pulsed as did the first one when it was hovering, almost to the point of dissapperance. It did a small square flight pattern(looked very unatural), and headed west(was out of site pretty quickly once heading west-within 3-4 seconds). The duration was about 2 min and there was absolutely no sound whatsoever associated w/ the objects. My boyfriend is very skeptical, but he said it was like nothing he has ever seen before. The color was just such a bright rich orange color and the flight pattern was very akward. I have no idea what it was, I just know it was a first that I have seen something like this.<n>

At this time I started yelling to my wife to come outside and then my folks woke up thinking something had happened ,when they came outside my reaction and there reaction was shock. It looked like one of the brightest star in the sky moving vary odd and very fast from one angle to another. When I called my older brother and told him I am seeing a UFO he told me I was on drugs but I just had to convince him to come see it for them self, meanwhile my folks were very nervous and exited at what they were witnessing.The object looked oval and very bright but when my brother arrived he was wordless he then immediately took his camera and we stared filming the objects they were moving so fast that it was hard for us to zoom in so we had to go on ! top of the roof were we can get a better view,we filmed it about 35min but whats weired was that when we filmed it there was two oval objects that you can clearly see in the video and they seemed to be following each other, after some attempts to call local news we saw and heard helicopters and or local helicopters. When the helicopters got close to the objects they seem to dive down and never came up again.But they showed up almost at the end of the video witch we later posted a 3min video of the UFO objects .To this day it was a unfortgatable occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/10/09 21:10|Miami|FL|Formation|2 minutes|These objects were not known man made aircraft.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67959.html|342|ndxe200901| These objects were not known man made aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On January 10 2009, 2110 hrs, I took a break from watching a movie (paused it) and went outside to smoke a cigarette. I enjoy looking up to the night sky especially on clear nights when clouds are at a minimum or none are present (the latter applies to this event) and visibility is excellent. On this night I was smoking my cigarette when I noticed a commercial and most likely civilian aircraft making its aerial maneuvers for approach for a landing at Miami Int’l Airport. This is typical at the area where I live since aircraft traffic is directed through this area for landing approach. I did not think too much of it given the fact that I see aircrafts performing routine maneuvers on a daily basis. On this night, however, I noticed two objects flying through the night sky (no particular shape) in a constant formation on the background (relative to the aircraft making its northward turn) of the commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were being displaced at a relatively high velocity (or speed, since their general direction and displacement seemed constant). At first I thought that I was seeing “things” and removed my eyeglasses and cleared my eyes. I went ahead and put my glasses on and saw the objects again. The commercial aircraft had a northward direction to while the objects had a general northwest heading. Military aircraft came to my mind in trying to identify the objects but no audible noises were emanating form the objects and no beacon/strobe lights were visible. Unless there are stop secret military stealth aircraft out there flying hypersonic with silent engines (especially at the altitudes these objects were flying) that the civilian population does not know about, I think this classifies as a UFO event. Furthermore, as they traveled in their direction (by the way, one object was leading the other by approximately a couple of thousand feet,  at approximately a 30° elevation, measured relative to the trailing object) their emitted visible lighting was fading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very skeptical about UFO sightings and associated reports on the tabloids. The main reason is probably because I am an engineer and to me almost everything in life has an explanation through engineering and science. This is the first time in my life that I have encountered a physical event that I do not know what to make of it. By the way, I am certain that these objects were not satellites. I am becoming more convinced that we (habitants of planet earth) are not alone in the universe.<n>

At first I thought it may have been a plane flying in my direction at an extremely low altitude. Then the object began to descend straight down, a small but noticeable distance, and continue to hover over the residential area of Reseda. I turned to by boyfriend in the passenger seat and told him I knew what I was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time a freeway sound wall blocked our view while I was driving in the inside lane. I quickly shifted to the fast lane and waited for the object to come back into view. The object had to be relatively low in the sky if the sound wall and tree tops could easily block our view. When the object was visible again, all the bright lights had been shut off and now the craft’s anti-collision/beacon lights were blinking, and I could clearly see the outline of the unit under the full moon. Disk shaped, with a protruding top and bottom, with the blinking lights arranged around the widest part of the craft. It looked as though it was made of dark grey metal since it was reflective in the moonlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had driven around the craft, proving that it was stationary, and decided to circle back to get another look. In the 2 minutes that I was able to circle around back to the craft’s original location, it had moved higher up in the sky and less than a half mile west. We followed the craft by street and observed it, now stationary again, for 15 to 20 minutes. Every now and then we would see the lights on the craft dim and brighten, then descend straight down and hover. On the crafts ”low-light” setting; I could see multiple colored lights blinking at different times. When it began to move further west, we followed again until it was just a small speck in the sky. We decided to finish our errand in Reseda and head home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were now driving on the 101 southbound through Studio City, California at about 9pm when I looked up and saw another similar-looking craft with bright lights hovering over the freeway a little higher than the treetops. As soon as I pointed in its direction, the craft took off heading north over my vehicle. Again, we turned around to head north and follow but the craft had traveled a considerable distance and we decided it was too far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe that I may have witnessed two separate spacecrafts. It is also possible that it was the exact same craft that I saw in two different locations when considering its speed capabilities and the time in between spotting the craft(s).<n>

I was showing my wife how to use the zoom controls on her camera and how it will blur and image if there is not enough light. I took a series of three photographs in a row. When we played them back there was an unknown light in the shy in the first photograph and nothing in the other two. When we got them home and looked at them on the computer we could see that their was a tale coming from the light source and it appeared in the photograph to be streaking across the shy. Their was eight other people with us at the time and no one including me saw anything in the shy.  One of the people in my group was a VPD officer and he did not see anything either.

The “star” traveled quickly across the sky then “stopped in mid-air” over what appeared to be the ensign peak area between Bountiful and SLC.  This startled me and I said, “What the heck is that?”. No falling star here as the light then moved back north east over North Salt Lake and made a slow wide circling pattern as if it were going to land. At this point my wife said, “Maybe it’s a helicopter going to land”.  The light then traveled west quickly across the interstate and suddenly maneuvered straight up for about 300-500 feet over I-215 just south of the Legacy interchange. After that it traveled south towards the 7th north exit in west SLC desending at a high rate and disappeared from our site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a private pilot and aware of natural speeds and maneuvers a “normal” plane or helicopter would make, but this to me seemed to fast and erratic in behavior. My wife thought she could see blinking lights around the main light. I could not see position lights only the white/yellow light it emitted from all angles. Besides, this is controlled airspace, would Salt Lake Center allow this kind of evasive maneuvering?  I was curious to hear if anyone else saw what we witnessed so I called an FAA flight briefer and he gave me the number to this reporting site.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Viewed from Cocoa, FL<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working in the yard and looked up and initially saw 4 oval shaped bright objects in a rectangle pattern moving North East toward Kennedy Space Center. Two neighbors walked by and I called their attention to the objects and also my wife.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of the objects appeared to be of bright multiple colors and one was a bright raspberry color. I ran into the house and got my binoculars and then we saw 3 more that appeared to be in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at them through the binoculars some were bright white while others were multicolored and seemed to change colors as they moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last two we observed were bright white and seemed to move more slowly and came very close to each other and stop momentarily as it appeared they touched. At that point one turned the most beautiful blue color and they drifted apart and continued the same route as the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am retired military.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The colors were red,orange,green,raspberry and several shades of blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I handed the binoculars to my neighbors to look and then I noticed 3 more in a line from East to West travelling in the same North East direction. Looking through the binoculars they were also of these same beautiful colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife came out of the house and we handed her the binoculars and she remarked that they appeared to be translucent like a jellyfish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last ones observed were 2, one behind the other travelling in the same North East direction. The lead one seemed to slow and the trailing one seemed to touch or bump into the lead one. The lead one then turned the most beautiful blue that I cannot fully describe, almost like a Carribbean blue but more vibrant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not seem be moving fast or make any turns and appeared to be as high as our commercial aircraft fly, but these objects left no contrails. The sky was clear/blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all very excited seeing thse objects because the beautiful colors gave us an uplifting feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that evening I saw another neighbor in the supermarket and he told me he saw the same objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before this incident I was somewhat doubtful of stories about UFO&#39;s, but this experience has changed my views.<n>

It looks just like a star or small point of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of four sightings submitted recently by same witness.

1/10/09 02:05|Middletown|OH|Triangle|20 Minutes|3-4 triangular "humming" objects at treetop level in Middletown, Ohio|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67955.html|354|ndxe200901| 3-4 triangular &#34;humming&#34; objects at treetop level in Middletown, Ohio<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2am I went to let my dogs out, and saw/heard nothing unusual. I returned to my upstairs bedroom on the front side of our house, and resumed watching television. I had my bedside window opened approximately 6, though my shades covered the gap.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2:05 exactly, my (almost 15 year old) daughter and her friend were in a nearby bedroom talking.  Her bedroom faces the rear of our home.  There are no shades or blinds on her windows.  The girls remarked that there must be a storm coming, as there were flashes visible in the upper edges of the windows, and appeared to emanate from the clouds/fog over the house.  They then realized that the flashes were stationary and occurred in fixed intervals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the girls looked more closely out the window, they were looking upward.  They noticed that a large dark shape was moving over our 2 story home toward our backyard (west to east).  The dark shape then dipped downward as it moved over the crest of our home toward our backyard (eastward), and was visible below the cloud/fog level, approximately 30 feet off the ground.  As it moved slowly away, it became clear that it was triangular in shape, and had 3 lights along the back, flashing blue, red and green in varying patterns.  The object emitted a low, pulsing hum noise that was audible from the girl’s window.  There were no loud or airplane/jet noises, or I would have heard them with my window open. I can only surmise that between my tv and my husband’s snoring, I was unable to hear the very low noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Behind our home is an open field that is used for farming.  It is a large, open area with the nearest houses at least 1/3 a mile away (guessing - not an absolute distance).  There is an old barn within ~200 feet of our home that sits in the southwest corner of the open field.  As the object moved away from our property, it reached the area of the barn and hovered briefly.  It then slowly moved away toward the northeast, and suddenly disappeared.  It appeared to the girls that the object was approximately the width of 2 houses in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2:08am, near the far east edge of the field, 2 similar objects suddenly &#34;winked on&#34; and moved around one another for a brief period.  They appeared to be the same types of objects as the one that moved over our home. Just as suddenly as they appeared, they seemed to &#34;wink off&#34; and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2:10am, a new set of flashes were visible over the house, and they were similar in nature to the first set. As the girls watched, a much larger, and louder (humming) object moved over the crest of our home, following the same path that the first one did.  This one appeared identical in every way, with the exception that it was so large that as it dipped over our home, the edges were not immediately visible.  It had to move beyond the barn for the entire object to be seen. It was easily double or more the size of the first object.  As it moved west to east, it slowed over the field, and then slowly seemed to rotate over a fixed area, and remained there for approximately 3-5 minutes.  It was possible to see strobing lights on all 3 corners of the object, but the 3 lights in color were only visible on the &#34;back&#34; edge of the object. As the object sat in place, the 2 objects that had been sighted at 2:08 suddenly lit back up and began to move around, as if in response to the larger object close to our home.  This continued for the last couple of minutes that the large object hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With no warning, all three objects just disappeared. It looked as though the smaller objects streaked away to the left and right of the large one, and that the large object lifted straight up, out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two girls described their thoughts and feelings as though they were transfixed and unable to really do anything but watch.  They debated whether to wake either myself or my husband, but were concerned that they may not be believed, especially after time had passed and no more objects were visible.  The one thing that they did notice was police sirens in the vicinity (I did hear those), and they wondered if they were in any way responding to the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The open field is sort of unusual in that it is sort of &#34;land-locked.&#34;  It has very busy roads on 2 sides, and has houses and suburbs on all 4 sides.  If you didn’t live next to it, you would not be aware that it is even there.  Considering it’s size, that is really unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very short distance from the field, near the south-eastern corner are at least 3 bar/club businesses and a bowling alley, all of which would have closed at 2am.  If anyone was leaving them (this was a Friday pm/Saturday am time period) they should have been within eyesight of  some or all of the objects.  The only variable that I am uncertain of is the cloud cover/fog placement.  Even when the objects were above the cloud/fog line, the rhythmic strobing was visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have repeatedly asked questions of my daughter in different ways to verify details (and to a lesser extent her friend - she had to leave), and the story has remained consistent.  I believe her - and that was before I had a chance to read/learn about all the other sightings near our area.  We are very interested in verification of the sightings, and if anyone else saw anything similar.  PLEASE get back with us if you learn anything, or we can do more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [Please Note - Though we don’t want it posted publicly, entering our address into Google Maps will show you the field in relation to our home.  In the lower left corner of the field is the barn and a dark, teardrop-shaped pond.]<n>

There is no Airport in the direction in which it was going down, and it went down extremely fast. I thought for sure that I would hear a plane crashing, but there was nothing. It just disappeared. Also, the object made barely any noise, Had it been a plane I am sure it would have made more noise than what I was hearing. Baffling!!!!<n>

My eyes would not otherwise have been distracted to peer skyward had it not been for a &#34;flaring&#34; effect I noticed from this object moving from the south.  I compare this object to a star of magnitude +2 and when it didn&#39;t flare it appeared identical to a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best approximation I can describe this &#34;flaring&#34; is to equate it with the firing of air in a hot air balloon at high altitude.  The flaring had colors of red/orange/white and would last about ten seconds, then cease and the point of light would reappear.  The flaring occurred in intervals of about two to three minutes and I observed about five of these events.  The object continued to move south to north at a steady rate but abruptly began traveling northeast as it passed over the Vancouver, WA area.  I continued observing this object for 20 minutes and the flaring continued to occur at regular intervals throughout the period of my observation.<n>

Then as i watched i noticed that it was changing colour, Blue, Red, Green, White and repeating in a random order. At first i thought thats weird lights for a plane, i noticed that it wasn&#39;t moving it was hovering. I then thought it must be a helicopter, living in Naval town often the Fleet Air Arm or Royal Air Force are doing maneuvers in the Solent or English Channel with the Royal Navy. I watched for several minutes and ran downstairs to when i got back it hadn&#39;t moved at all still flashing away. It was way to high to be a distant helicopter or Coast Guard Copper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then took one photo on my digital camera but in the dark and with 10x zoom plus another 6.9 digital zoom it was out of range but still you can see the weird colours (ish) i then took two film clips of it and although not being able to see the change of colour you can see it changes shades of white. Then the other observer came back from outside, he&#39;d just been driving and hadn&#39;t been drinking all day neither had i. He observed it and commented how strange it was. Skipping forward sometime after 20 minutes i went to have dinner and came back to find that it had moved from right to left and was getting higher then at 20.29 it finally disappeared by the building opposite.<n>

I managed to record about 3-4 seconds of that rapid flying bright object on video and then it just disappeared behind the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 10th Jan 09, I checked on the UFO sighting website, and to my surprise I found that the similar object was caught on video in Scotland too on the very same day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a UFO geek and what I saw was a mystery and I don’t go our looking for flying saucers or aliens, but for now, I will live with it and feel good about something I caught on my camera in my life in Tanzania.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report has sent several still photos, taken from the video.

As I pulled into my subdivision, I noticed three lights moving close to one hundred miles per hour around a thousand feet. The one leading the craft(s) was a bright white, almost like a spotlight, the middle was less bright, and the third was red. That was all I could see. My subdivision cuts between two major roads, and on the other end of the subdivision, about 20 seconds away, there is a huge clearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we got to the clearing, the craft was gone. We drove to a local convenience store where my friend was in there getting something to drink. He told me he was driving from Nelson along Hwy 5 when he saw this flying saucer.

I saw Venus and several stars. Two of the stars I saw were moving together very slowly. The only reason I noticed this was because I saw them through the branches of a tree in my yard and watched them get blocked out by the bare limbs. I brought what I saw to my neighbors attention and he too couldn&#39;t explain it. It looked like one bright star and one dimmer start moving with it. It was the weirdest thing I have ever seen, but I didn&#39;t see any structure at all. It seemed to be higher than the thin clouds that were forming and we were able to watch it for about a full minute before they both vanished. Is there a place I can report this and also check to see if anyone else saw it? By the way, I live near 5th St. and Cheltenham Ave.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then formed into V. We watched this for 20 minutes and tried to call our local news station from cell phones after looking up their numbers. I finally emailed one of the Memphis stations just to see if anyone else saw what we were seeing. I haven&#39;t heard anything back. It was something I&#39;ve never seen.

The sun had not set yet.  While looking at the moon I noticed a sliver of light (reflection from the sun), approximately ½ to ¾ inch long moving toward the moon.  I thought it was unusual because there was no vapor trail (I thought it was a plane).  I kept watching it to see what it would look like in front of the moon.  As it approached the moon and began crossing the moon it grew smaller and smaller, and then I realized it was going behind the moon!  I kept watching to see if it would come out the other side, but it never did.  It simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that I think about it, it could not have been a plane because at that distance you would not have seen it.  The fact that it was the size I mentioned means it must have been a huge aircraft of some type.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/9/09 09:00|Huntsville|AL|Other|4 minutes|A "parked" 737 in the sky accompanied by an orb|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67953.html|369|ndxe200901| A &#34;parked&#34; 737 in the sky accompanied by an orb<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday morning at around 9 am when I was driving to Huntsville, I saw a stationary 747 or 737 passenger plane parked in the sky about 100 feet above a field just to the right side of the road.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me at first because the car was in motion and I was definitely driving towards the nose of the plane, but as I got closer I realized that it was truly just sitting there parked in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To its right (my left) was an orb dancing around in the sky.  It seemed to reflect the sky on all its &#34;sides&#34; and appeared perfectly round and solid.  It was no bigger than a person would be if they were curled up in a ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I realized that it was indeed parked in the sky, I pulled over and snapped a photo with my digital cell phone camera.  It isn’t that great but I have it if anyone wants to see it, and I will try my best to get it to sharpen in photoshop, but the actual raw photo taken at 9 am on 1-9-09 is in an email I just sent to this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The exact location of the craft was approximately ½ mile north of the Toyota plant in Huntsville on Pulaski Pike Rd.  I don’t know why it chose this location because there is only a field full of llamas and alpacas, some donkeys, horses and cows.  There is also a stream near by with fish in it.  Maybe it was surveying the area or something I don’t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But after I took the picture I was beside myself.  Back in 2000 when we lived in Texas, the whole family (kids, me, hubby) saw the exact same thing.  A large passenger plane parked in the sky, about the size of a 737 or 747, and it too was parked so low you could see every detail of its wings, engines, windows, paint job.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This one yesterday was painted with a silver grey bottom and orange on the sides (like a Northwestern Airlines plane).  It had no &#34;underbelly&#34; rocket boosters or anything, there was no way in the physical world it could have been hovering because passenger planes that are made to stay in flight while moving at 600 miles an hour simply drop to the ground if they are! motionl ess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 seconds after I parked the car, it started to go away (I guess the occupants saw me?)  It went slow for about 5 seconds then disappeared going in an upwards north easterly direction very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the sphere that was dancing around everywhere disappeared.  Oh and the weather for the sighting was perfect, 100% clear sky, no clouds anywhere.  9 am, broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she sounded to us to be quite sincere, and quite credible.  We have looked at the photo, taken with a cell telephone, and the objects is reminiscent of a swept-wing airliner.  It is ambiguous, we believe, but the witness has volunteered to send NUFORC the same photo, after it has been &#34;processed&#34; by a photo lab.  PD))<n>

I had been walking my dog about five minutes when I looked up and saw a very bright light in the western sky.  As I continued walking my dog I noticed that the light had gained in altitude but did not seem to be moving forward; it only appeared to be moving vertically.  I continued walking my dog and watching the light.  The area of the light is in the flight path for airplanes entering and exiting Charlotte-Douglas Airport in Charlotte. At first I thought it may be an airplane, but I watch airplanes every night and this light was different.  It was much brighter than any airplane I have ever seen and it remained stationary except for the time that it gained in altitude.  As I started walking back to my home with my dog the light very rapidly lost altitude and began to travel horizontally toward the north until I finally lost sight of it. The entire sighting lasted from 20:10 hours until 20:45 hours.  There were many airplanes in the sky that night and the difference between the two was very obvious.  There were no other lights (red, blue, etc.) visible that I could discern with my eyes, only a very bright white light.  The light did not appear to be pulsating or rotating. That is all that I know about this event.   End of statement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD))<n>

I was in the passanger seat when I noticed to my right above the treeline a good half mile off the road we were on a brightly luminated object that was the color red when I first noticed it and to me it looked like it had risin up out of the wooded area and came to a rest or hover just above treeline and that is when I told my girlfriend to &#34;pull over&#34; and &#34;look at that&#34; at that time the object had started to move vertical very slowly but when it started to move upward the object did something strange it changes size, and color. From a bright red to a green,orange,purple then blue. From where we were the object seemed to be a sphere and kept a spherical shape even as it changed size and color but when I first seen the object as I stated it was a bright red and  I guess then it was about the size of a dime on the horrizon but when changed to green it got smaller to about half the size of a dime then it went to a amber-orange color it expanded to about the size of a half dollar on the horrizon then it turned to a brilliant violet-purple and it went to the smallest size witch was about the size of a BB then the last color was again a very beautiful brilliant blue and then was just a little bigger than the BB sized purple and that was what it looked like as it went up through the clouds the color was so bright that as it went through the clouds it also lit up the surrounding clouds. But as it was moving upward and changing colors and size it made a few really fast zig-zag moves then went straight up through the clouds. All of this sighting happend in a matter of 45 seconds to a minuite after pulling the car of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But what I think is really strange and you will too is that in 1992-93 me my father and my sister whitnessed an object exactly like the one I saw last night. And it was very near the same place just back in 92-93 my family and I saw it from a different location witch was on Fish Hatchery Rd. in Gaston,SC  but a good mile from my then home the object hovered and changed size and color but what is interesting is that then it was over a area that is the Lexington County Lanfill and when we saw the object last night it was over the same landfill my girlfriend and I were just on the hwy 6 side of it but back in 92-93 my family and I were exact oppisite on Fish Hatchery Rd. side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now there have been for years talk in the community that there may be Millitary Weapon Sylos on the Landfill complex witch I guess is about ten miles squared in a heavily wooded area. I really do not know if there may be missiles or nukes or any other thing there that anyone or anything may find interesting on this landfill property but I know what I saw and this is the second time I have saw it above this area and whatever it was it must have been interested in something there. Both times I got this feeling that whatever this thing was intelligance was there. I was 13 at the time of the first sighting with my father and sister and I am 29 now and I just hope I am  lucky enough to whitness something that intelligent and beautifull again before I die. Also I would like to add these two times I whitnessed a UFO were the only time in my life I had ever seen something unexplainable in the skies of SC or anywhere else in the USA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You For Your Time, ((iniatials of witness deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be both serious-minded, and apparently quite sincere.

CST I went out my kitchen door to take the trash out.  The door faces east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon is just about full this evening.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a strange &#34;cloud&#34; to my right. It was strange enough that I turned to look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving from the south to the north very fast.  It was about 70 degrees off the horizon and dark grey.  The shape is what first caught my attention.  Imagine an iPhone lying flat but there was a large &#34;dome shape&#34; under it and in the middle of the rectangle.  The &#34;dome&#34; seemed to have several lobes on it so it was not perfectly smooth.   In fact the whole object was about the size of an iPhone held at arm’s length. There was only one object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not make any sound.  In fact I would say the silence was &#34;deafening&#34; in the same way it is quiet after a large snowfall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon is quite bright tonight and the edges of the object seemed to glow from the moonlight rather than an internal source.  The object obstructed the view of stars as it flew by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked down the side path to the front of my house to keep the object in view.  It continued straight north.  The speed and altitude did not alter. I continued to watch it until it disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky is clear tonight except for a few wispy, white clouds that are shaped more like long pencils.  I watched the object fly under the clouds and noted that the object was not only moving in the opposite direction of the clouds, but it was going much faster than the clouds.  It moved fast enough that I knew I did not have time to get my camera.  Plus the object was dark enough the I was not sure it would photograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog was outside with me and he started barking when the object was in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for approximately one minute before I could no longer see it.  There were no aircraft nearby at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was home alone.  I am a mom and a business owner.  Unfortunately, I did not see any of my neighbors outside who I could ask to witness the object.<n>

There is a logging road that leads down to a large pond.  There are trees on each side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and his best friend went outside to smoke leaving me and my sister-in-law inside with the children.  They were outside for about five minutes when the called us out to come look at a bright star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside and down the logging road I saw what looked like a large star that was very low.  It sat just over the tree line in the horizon.  I remembered thinking that it was tear drop shaped.  Looked like a tear drop diamond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were talking about what it could possibly be.  We had never seen a star so large and one of us said that even the North Star wouldn&#39;t be so low.  Maybe it was a planet?<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are all strong christians and have never believed in any alien myths or stories so we were talking about any logical explanations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After looking at it for a minute i began to notice red streaks coming out of the bottom.  I kept thinking that my eyes were playing tricks on me from focusing too much so I turned away and looked back only to see red and blue colors coming from this bright light.  My brother then asked if it was moving or if his eyes were playing tricks on him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked back at it and the light was moving right to left very quickly.  It never moved far enough to disappear behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we were all a little scared.  This was obviously no star nor planet.  My brother got out his video camera and began filming.  The movements became more noticeable.  Diagnol, side to side and up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and his friend decided to try to get closer.  They began walking down the lane and were not ten feet closer when the light started to BACK AWAY.  The light was moving backwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my sister-in-law were screaming that it was leaving and of course the guys froze in fear and we literally watched this ball of light back away until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a skeptic If we had watched that light for a while and it never left I would have been convinced it was just a planet or something and that our eyes were playing tricks on us with the lights and movements.  But when I saw that thing back away from us I knew that it was nothing of this earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what we saw last night but I do know it was either an angel of god or a being from somewhere else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it left of course we are all looking in the sky in terror and amazement at what we saw and I began to notice planes EVERYWHERE.  It was dark of course and it was a very clear night.  But I counted eight planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I commented on this to everyone else they brushed it off as it being a clear night and there&#39;s always that many planes, I just never noticed it.  But I did count 9 planes and they were headed in the same direction as the light.<n>

( all in the same general area).  they all seemed to disappear at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then it occurred that this object was moving to fast to be a helicopter so I jumped up and opened the window thinking I would hear engine noise. However, to my surprise, the object was not making any sound. The object had one white light, one blue light and two red lights, one of which was flashing. My son got up to view the object, but it was gone by the time he got to the window. I would think that this object was moving approximately 500 to 600 knots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this individual, and we suspect that the report is quite accurate.

My previous sightings are old and my memory not good on them, so I will not get into them, except that we (my wife and I) saw what looked like a UFO Dec 13th around 8pm on the way home from Plano, TX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My story begins with some intrigue, last night our power seemingly went out, my wife and I awoke due to our fan going off, I quickly got up to shutdown my desktop before the APC ran down, but noticed that it was not beeping, then noticed we still had power, thinking it was strange that our bedroom breaker would go out on its own I went back to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It began getting colder in the house so I forced myself to get out of bed to check the breakers, thinking that our central heat possibly caused a breaker to trip.  Before getting outside I noticed that half the house was without power, not just my room and the heater, when I got outside there were NO breakers thrown, baffled, I went back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before getting back inside I looked up at the clear night sky, only to find a flying star, &#34;shooting star,&#34;  I ask myself? Not possible, it moved extremely smooth and consistent, almost unreal, nearly straight above me moving east to west,  solid white light (like a star), it slowly faded so faint I thought it disappeared, but it was still visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued tracking, then it became strong again (about 10 seconds of strong light and 10 seconds of faint light), it shifted direction and disappeared again, but this time I could not see it any longer (it did not go off into the horizon, it simply disappeared), so I turned around looked up to see the rest of the sky, AND LOW AND BEHOLD, ANOTHER!!!   That’s right, almost brighter than the first, now I am watching another one flying north to south.  I couldn’t take it anymore, it was about 5:30am, I quickly went inside and got my wife, it took about ten minutes to get her outside, daylight was approaching, and when we looked up scanning the sky we couldn’t see anything, she looked down on the horizon facing North, and she sees one!!!  I did not get to see it, she said it streaked across the sky shifted direction (up) and disappeared, I was satisfied enough not to be disappointed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little background on my wife and me.  We live in the Texarkana area (outside of the city), I am a highly credentialed systems engineer, serve on a financial board, and often photograph the night sky with my wife’s DSLR (thus I know what the sky is suppose to look like, as well as what airplanes and meteor storms).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife is a home maker, takes care of me and our 4 kids, she is also a photographer of her own business, and she runs a local MOPS group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of us are skeptics and believers, mostly that not all sightings are real, and not all sightings are UFO’s, sometimes just unidentified to us.<n>

(Eastern Standard Time) I was sitting in my bedroom at my computer desk working on a music project.  There is a window about 2 feet to the left side of my desk which I tend to glance out occasionally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked out the window I saw a flash of blue, which I initially thought was lightning.  Then It appeared to be getting closer and closer.  About 3-4 seconds later the light fully consumed my bedroom window and my whole room was lit up by this light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly jumped out of my chair and ran into the hallway, closing my bedroom door behind me.  Even when I closed the door and looked back the light had not subsided.  As far as I know the light was there for about 5-10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen my share of power lines going down and transformers exploding, but they flash and go out.  This was different than anything I have ever seen. After leaving my room, I immediately went to knock on my sisters door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She came out of her room in a panicked state and said, &#34;Did you hear that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both ran downstairs into our moms bedroom and called 911. My sister then explained to me that the sound she heard was like a compressed boom, almost like a shockwave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a side note I would like to add that 2 nights prior to this occurrence I looked out my window up into the sky and saw a bright light which was flashing red, green and blue. At first I thought it was a plane or a helicopter, but then I realized that the object was not moving. It was not a star and there is no way a helicopter could reach those kinds of elevations. I went to grab my camera which was on my desk and not even 5 seconds later the object was gone. From my window I have a really good view of the nights sky and there is no way a helicopter or plane could have disappeared from sight that quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> Philadelphia, PA<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be quite serious-minded and credible.

1/6/09 22:00|Reading (Berkshire) (UK/England)||Oval|25 mins|White bright light seen performing incredible movements over a small village in Reading, Berkshire, UK|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67891.html|397|ndxe200901| White bright light seen performing incredible movements over a small village in Reading, Berkshire, UK<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to report a UFO sighting that took place on the 6th of January 2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 10:00pm UK time in the evening when I went upstairs to my bedroom to look out the window to see what the weather was doing. It was a very clear night, the moon was shining very brightly and so were the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, as I was looking into the sky something caught my attention; my eyes were immediately drawn to a bright object behind the trees. At first, I wasn’t really sure what I was looking at, to me it looked like a bright star, however, it was the brightest object in the sky with the exception of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That theory was quickly ruled out when it began pulling off incredibly fast movements behind the trees. It suddenly started moving from behind the tree in what I could best describe as fast short burst movements. It would suddenly move quickly and then just as suddenly stop dead in the sky. To give you an idea of the location, where I live we have a lot of trees surrounding our house, with two large trees at the front of our driveway. The object moved from behind one of the trees we have and settled in position between the two large trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What amazed me was its variety of movements, it was moving up and down left and right and even diagonally and at times all within one movement and very quickly. The object appeared as a strobing bright whitish light that wasn’t really round, the way the light was in appearance suggested to me it was more of an oval shape object. But it appeared to be strobing very quickly, almost to a flicker kind of rate. I was absolutely mesmerized by this object; it was pretty amazing to observe what it was doing. This object didn’t appear to be very close; to me it was a typical size of a star, but maybe just slightly bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another thing I would like to add to this sighting was the fact that while I was observing this object I was getting a kind of an emotional response to it. Wasn’t sure if this would be of any help or if indeed it has any relevance but I thought I would mention it anyway. It was strange to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The actual sighting lasted for around 25 mins or more, I couldn’t keep myself awake any longer and had to go to bed. I can’t really say how long that object was in the sky, but it seemed to be lingering for quite a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, this morning I had another surprise on my way to dropping my wife off to work. Our local radio station announced a UFO flap that’s been taking place in the Reading area I live in and even stretching as far as Oxford as well. I thought I would mention this, as it might help you verify more on the report I am giving you today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really do not know what is was, but I do know what it wasn’t; you can rule out blimps, flares, aeroplanes, and helicopters etc. What I saw was nothing related to conventional explanations and I am absolutely convinced it was very much out of the ordinary. I wished I had got it on camera, but unfortunately none of my equipment was charged up, so frustratingly I couldn’t use anything to capture the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This isn’t the first time I have witnessed a UFO, I have had previous experiences with them in the past also, but this has been the best one so far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a regular listener of the Jeff Rense radio program here in the UK and always listen to your reports of UFO activity. God bless everything you are doing in getting the truth out about what’s really taking place around the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this report helps you in your investigations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very warm regards.<n>

After observing the light for less than a minute, it began rapidly ascending and descending about a 100 yards up and down.  I ran into the house to grab my friend who saw the same thing.   We both a heard a noise inside the house that sounded just like my dog when it scratches the door.  The dog was outside with us.  When I opened the door to the house the car alarm went off.  I probably set the alarm off with the keys in my pocket.  There was nothing in the house.  I went back outside a few minutes later with my camera.  The object moved slightly but nothing like earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few hours later the object was moving  slowly, like a star to the west and 10 degrees higher in the sky.<n>

The first one I saw was close, triangular in shape, and was moving too slowly to be an airplane. It seemed to have three lights, one on each of the points, and then a couple more in the middle of the front.  I couldn’t get my palmcorder out fast enough to catch it on video and I was driving the opposite way of the direction it was traveling.  It seemed to be traveling in a north and then northwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second possible ufo, I got on video, but it was farther away and it looks like just a light on the recording.  I was traveling south on a straight road and you can tell it is not moving from side to side.  It was not getting fainter or brighter, so it must not have been moving towards me or away from me.  This leads me to believe that it was hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something else I saw that could be &#34;something&#34; is hovering to the southeast of my house.  On the video I got of it, it brightens and darkens itself.  It seems to be stationery.  I must admit, I could just be excited about my previous sightings and it could be a planet or bright star that I have not previously noticed. I will take another video of the same area tomorrow night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving when this all took place, save for the last possible incident, so if the &#34;crafts&#34; made any noise, I couldn&#39;t hear them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot e-mail the videos because I can only e-mail up to 10mb, and both videos exceed that.<n>

Very strange, piqued my curiosity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very bright white light hovered 5 degrees above the western horizon for at least 20 minutes and proceeded in an easterly direction at high velocity. The white light was as intense as the moonlight but much smaller in diameter,very sharp and crisp light, more than a pinpoint of light. Usually there is a lot of military air traffic in the area, and stealth fighters are regularly seen in the area. This light caught my attention immediately when I came outside for a cigarette. It hovered and drifted very slowly too the south for 20 minutes. At first I thought it was a planet but it was much brighter than normal. I noticed the very slow movement of the object and decided it was not stationary. I observed the light for around 10 minutes and decided it was too cold for my comfort. My coworker observed its speedy departure to the east about 10 minutes after I went inside. Way too bright to be an ordinary aircraft and no blinking lights which would be expected on a helocopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))<n>

Then I noticed a very bright light that looked like a star way above the air plan.  As I thought in my head, this cant be a star, it started to move slowly to the east. Then I saw another light or star blink on in the same path as the first one but it was moving towards the west.  I was blown away at what I was witnessing, There were no wings or any airplane or helicopter features and no sound coming from the lights.  The only way I can describe them is they looked like stars or very bright points of light. The one moving to the west suddenly disappeared.  The one moving to the east was still moving slowly and then just stopped.  It stayed still for a few minutes and then started to move to the west.  I kept my eye on it as it kept going to the west until I could no longer see it past the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of four sightings submitted recently by same witness.

I was staring straight into the stars for about 20-30 minutes when I saw the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was laying on the beach with my feet pointed east (towards the water.)  I looked to the left and saw the beginning of a shooting star.  For the first half a second it seemed like an ordinary shooting star. Then a stream of turquiose light surrounded it.  The stream remained in the sky until the object abruptly cut into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The stream of light disappeared quickly after the object was out of sight.<n>

All was very Quiet. I witnessed 3 Objects in the sky Seemed Approximately 3 Miles away or so. They were slightly twinkling in a bright orange/white color and had an ovular shape. They seemed to form a Triangular Formation and then move very slowly Eastwards. They then seemed to stay put in one spot for about 5 seconds. Very quickly (I&#39;m talking a flash of a second)they shot upwards and were gone out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was witnessed overlooking my neighbors field.

It may be intended as disinformation, but we cannot be certain; it is our best guess.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Received call from parents at 8:34pm from parents who live 2.5 miles away.  They were seeing strange lights in the sky.  We looked outside and the lights were also visible from our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My account: Sky was mostly dark.  The sky was overcast.  My guess is that the cloud ceiling was 5000-10000.  I saw 6 red lights moving very slowly across the sky.  They were due west when I first viewed them at about 35 degrees above the horizon.  The lights were in a formation resembling two opposing triangle.  The two triangles were separated by roughly 5 or 6 times the length of the side of one of the triangles.  They were not in a tight formation, but stretched over what appeared to be a large distance.  My feeling was that the six lights were not part of one object, but they were independent of each other.  This seemed to be true based on what was observed later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights had a &#34;blurry&#34; look to my eyes, not crisp.  I do not wear glasses.  There was no unusual noise to be heard.  The lights moved from the western sky to the southern sky slowly.  At a quick glance they might have appeared stationary, but they were indeed moving.  After watching for ~90 seconds, the lights were in the southern sky and the three lights of the triangle to my right independently broke from the formation and seemed to move away from my vantage point.  The lights got smaller and smaller until they were not visible.  It appeared they ascended into the cloud cover and were no longer visible.  Within another 15 seconds or so, the other three lights in sequence did the same thing and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 39 yrs old and have never seen anything like this.  It was completely unlike anything I could imagine.  Honestly, as it was happening, I was convinced I was seeing something from an extra terestrial world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the police about 45 minutes later to report this and they said many other people were calling with the same report.  He went on to say they heard from a neighboring police department that the lights were caused by weather balloons with road flares tied to them.  After hearing this, I doubted my first assessment.  However, the police report was not definitive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The day after this happened, Jan 6, this appeared on our local news station website:  ###### source: http://www.news12.com/NJ/topstories/article?id=223402#  (01/06/09) MORRISTOWN - It was something out of a sci-fi movie Monday night in Morris County when residents spotted mysterious lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Residents in Florham Park, Hanover and Morristown saw the hovering red lights in the sky. Some are even wondering if the lights were a UFO, leaving some to think we’re not alone in the universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some who saw the lights called police. The authorities contacted a local airport to scan the sky with radar, but found nothing. According to police, the lights were possibly helium balloons attached to road hazard flares.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ####  To me, the balloon and flare story is plausible based on what I saw.  When the flares went out, this could have been perceived as the lights moving away from me and then vanishing into the cloud cover.  However, I would like to know who set these balloons afloat and why they had flares tied to them.  Until then, the jury is out for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One last note: from my parents vantage point, they saw 5 lights and not 6 like me.  We both claim the lights were clear as day to see so I can&#39;t explain the discrepancy in our accounts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

I estimated the altitude to be around 50,000ft. or more.  It was about 45 degrees up from the horizon.  It&#39;s brightness was that of an average star just visible to the naked eye.  It was nearly directly East when I saw it.  It traversed N to S only 5 or so degrees in 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I start thinking to myself here is another one!  So,I am thinking, I wonder if they know I see them?  So I say outloud: &#34;Do something, change speed, change direction, do something&#34; and I&#39;ll be danged if it didn&#39;t slow down to a crawl, then makes a perfectly short sharp 90 degree radiused turn to the E at its original speed and I watch it for about 5 seconds more before I can no longer make it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky overhead is overcast, but not in the East at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, 12 minutes later at 7:02pm what sounds like a flight of two to three F-15&#39;s comes flying overhead from the NE to the SW, on what could have been an intersecting path with the &#39;UFO&#39; at some point. The flight sounded like it was approx. 15,000ft or less when it went overhead.  That flight was probably on landing approach to Shaw AFB as it only about 30 miles from where I was.<n>

It also seemed like there were an extra large amount of aircraft in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was very cloudy outside however with a low lying cloud layer and lots of snow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have read about a similar case of this happening in Melbourne, Australia, exact same details, so this most likely is a natural phenomena but I decided since I don’t know what it was I should probably report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This could be fireworks reflecting off the clouds, except no sound of them, could be a low lying airplane with its lights reflecting off the clouds except again no sound of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could also be a meteor.<n>

After quickly going to get my binoculars I realized that the object was moving.  My next thought was this was possibly a comet or possibly a meteor (at this point I believe the object had a faint tail).  I ran inside to call my Father, still not realising what I was seeing.  It was then that I realized the object was changing in color (originally a orange-red) from a blue to a white (white being the smallest the object appeared and orange-red the largest the object appeared).  Almost immediately after I noticed the object changing color it quickly changed direction from an approximately eastern course to an approximately western course.  The object then changed direction and color a few more times before at exctly 12:59am changing direction one final time towards the stars until the object getting smaller and smaller disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were completely stationary.  While Visible for a half minute or so before actually driving underneath them, from a distance they looked more like bright stars, once below them however they were very detailed and were not bright like a star but had blinking red lights and triangle shape.  They did not appear to move one inch the entire 2 minutes I was looking at them from the time I approached, came up upon, and drove below the craft. The one craft was approx 2000 - 3000 Feet in the air, and further removed from being directly over the freeway.  The other one was lower 1000 – 2000 feet in the air, almost directly over the freeway, and the lights were extremely bright and red on the lower one.  They were approx 300-500 yards apart from each other.  There seemed to be three (3) overly bright red lights at one of the points on the triangle, and less bright ones at the other points.  Since I was driving and only could see the bottom of the black triangle I can not describe the top obviously.  I noticed a couple other cars in front of me on the freeway swerve so they must have been looking at this too.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to take a picture while driving since this is too much of a distraction and safety risk behind the wheel; however I am sort of kicking myself for not pulling to the shoulder and taking a hundred pictures with my iphone.  If I see them again I most certainly will.  This is the second time in one month that I have seen these craft in almost the exact same spot.  The previous time there was only one red blinking triangle however and it was above the freeway but on the other side.  What are these??<n>

I had called my roommates who are police officers to step outside to look at this abnormally big bright star,now me and my friend are watching this thing in the sky approximate altitude for this object 10,ooo-20,000 feet and was moving ever so slightly to the north at first and then back towards the south, at the time of our sighting alot of airplanes were in the sky all on the slc approach pattern airplanes coming in from the south end of the salt lake valley and also coming in from the west, this object was above the approaching airplanes and just off to the west enough so as not to bother incoming airplanes,to the casual observer it would look like a star or an airplane turning in from the west to land at slc but when you really looked at it for more than a min you soon begin to realize this aint no airplane or a star,now my two roomates were alot closer to this thing in the sky, they said the object observed to them it looked kinda egg shaped and when it was moving it would do little circles in a short pattern then quit,the color s on the object never changed, stayed constant in intensity and color,now an hour has passed and this thing is still in the sky as me and my friend are leaving his residence and are heading north on I-215 and got off at exit 700 north in north salt lake, the object was directly to our west now the closest we were to this strange star thing was about five miles away,my two r! oommates felt what ever it was very big in size,since this incident has intrigued one of my roomates and so she will be carrying a camera with her from now on,i have reported here before and had worked at the mine for about seven years and in that time i have found quite a few people who have seen strange lights out there in the surrounding hills around kennecott .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I allways look to the sky in the morning to see if theres weather,, and in hopes of catching another glimps of something. On this morning I noticed a bright sphere traveling east very high ( estimate ) upper atmosphere. Looked like a satelite untill it abrubtly stopped,,changed direction and traveled at an un-earthly speed in a northern direction,,stopped again for a few seconds proceeding east again. the speed at which this craft displayed was not of this earth,,nor was the way it manuvered. it continued to travel east for a few minuets,,and displaying that same un-earthly speed shot away from the earth,not straight up but at an angle which allowed me to see it it split second longer before it was gone. Trust me Humanity has nothing that can travel as fast as the craft I wittnessed. The first UFO I wittnessed was in San Diego. Over the Ocean Off of Point Loma about 2 miles away from shore. Clear nite about 9:00 or so,,,wittnessed a Green pulsing orb traveling eraticly north in a kind of floating up and down motion as it traveled north up the coast. It was fairly close, and was not like any conventional craft I have ever seen.

We were going home when a large orange sphere was sighted by both of us.  It looked just as if the moon was impossibly close to the earth.  There was a shadow covering the top half, but you could tell there was another half there.  We got about a 5 second glance at the object when a mountain obstructed our view, we were still moving at this point, we didn&#39;t pull over.  Then, as we were rounding a corner, expecting to see the object, it wasn&#39;t there.  The object was not seen after that point.<n>

Its trajectory seemed to be from west to east and possibly proceeding downward slightly. There was no sound. It was in my vision (through a clear windshield) for probably less than 0.5 sec. The light extinguished suddenly and completely while it was high in the sky. It was a very clear night, very dark, and with a yellow crescent moon practically on the horizon. I was driving on a dark stretch of road with no street lights and no traffic lights. As I continued driving home, I searched for any further signs of activity, but found none. For the record, I do not drink or take drugs. This is my first and only sighting of a UFO<n>

I turned down Appalachian trail and noted that the objects were not still standing but were moving in a South West direction towards Weston, FL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first the objects looked to be a one object with a light in each corner of the triangle, but suddenly they began to move irregularly and one jetted away, this left two. I viewed this event for under a minute and viewed the last two until they were no longer visable over the houses, they were moving at a fast but steady pace due Southwest. These lights were contained they didnt emit any stream or glare but were very deep in color and bright at the same time.<n>

The drape I was closing was to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Off to my left- which is east, I seen a diamond shaped thing going across the sky. It had one very white bright light that stayed on and it blinked very white bright lights. Right close behind it in perfect unison was a red sphere following.  I watched for about 5-10 minutes as it went along the southern sky from east to west, until it disappeared in the distance and through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were also planes flying in the vicinity who just kept righ on flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a plane, for planes do not follow that close together and planes also have blinking lights besides one being stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also submitted a report to MUFON. I do not remember the exact day. Though it has been since the beginning of this year.

1/3/09 20:30|Gosberton (UK/England)||Circle|approx 5 seconds|Bright circular light travelling at high speed in Lincolnshire|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67910.html|429|ndxe200901| Bright circular light travelling at high speed in Lincolnshire<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whilst driving home from work with my two teenage children in the car I was witness to a bright white circular light in the sky travelling at high speed in the Boston direction.  There was quite a lot of cloud cover which ruled out the possibility of a shooting star and this area has a high concentration of military aircraft and I knew that it could not possibly be a plane as there was no noise and at that hight it would have been very loud if it had been an aircraft. The object was travelling at a very high speed and appeared to skim the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/3/09 20:30|Mechanicsburg|PA|Unknown|5 - 10 minutes|Bright flashing object moves silently above Mechanicsburg, PA, with erraitc cursive-like motions.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67842.html|430|ndxe200901| Bright flashing object moves silently above Mechanicsburg, PA, with erraitc cursive-like motions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To whom this may concern: On Saturday, January 3rd, 2009, I believe that perhaps I may have seen an unidentified object moving in the sky last night around 20:30 or 8:30 pm EST in the skies of Mechanicsburg, PA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside in my backyard on my deck for about 10 minutes. During that time I noticed how beautiful the sky looked and began to gaze up at it while I finished my cigarette. I noticed planes in the sky and I am fairly familiar with the different lights used on commercial and private aircraft, and what I saw in the air was strangely disturbing. While star gazing I remember looking away from the stars, and when I looked back the first thing that caught my eye was a fast and bright strobe-like light moving in the general direction towards Carlisle, PA.  Once I saw this strange light I was intrigued and the first thing I thought was that it was just a plane with a spectacular lighting pattern and colors of dark yellow, red, and white – no greens and blues normally associated with standard civilian aircraft. What made me change my mind and become a little nervous was the movement it began to make as it traveled across the sky. At first it seemed to maintain a steady flight pattern, but soon the object (at this point I had a feeling it wasn’t any plane that I was familiar with) began to make a very random, quick yet smooth motions that omitted absolutely no sound. It almost looked as if it were making cursive motions that one could associate with the writing style. However, even with the awkward motions the object continued to move in the general direction of NE-SW, until I looked away again. When I looked back to same area it once was, the object had moved surprisingly to a position higher in sky (not altitude but degree – altitude seemed to be constant) and was now heading more for a NW route. That’s when denial struck, and as I was the only outside (my friend was playing guitar in the basement) I didn’t really want to be out there by myself it was a little eerie, and the object i! n the sk y wasn’t necessarily the  most comfortable thing to floating around above me at the time so I went inside. That was the end of my very first sighting, and hopefully my last.<n>

Although this time I fear it was more of a malicous intent.  I am not going to call these sightings any more.  Somehow, the bruising around my ribs and thighs are telling me this was more of a visit.  I was about ready for bed, letting my dog dudley out for an evening walk.  He began barking and used his tail to cover his genitals in fear as he cowered behind me.  I suddenly felt what I would describe as an extreme static charge in the air that seemed to cause droplets of dew to quickly evaporate.  Even the frost on the ground turned to steam and I could feel intense heat.  This quickly turned my attention towards the treeline in front of me as I heard the same high pitch sound, only this time much more painful.  I dropped to my knees and noticed blood dripping from my nose onto the ground.  This came to a sudden stop as a warm intense blue / gray light surround my body and seemed to have a heavy weight on my back, pushing me to my stomach and making my face lie in the blood from my nose.  I woke up shivering and nude in my bed nearly six hours later.  Dudley seems to be very scared and barking all day.  He wont eat and wont let me touch him.  I feel the same emotions of isolation.  I need to talk about this and I am afraid to tell anyone I know.  My nose has scratches on the inside and is very tender and I have had strong migrains all day.  Last night, I do remember having thoughts almost as is someone was telling me what was happening.  My thoughts were saying...&#34;It&#39;s ok, we are scientists, you will feel pain shortly, think of it as a study.&#34;  500 Lights On Object0: Yes<n>

I am a transportation specialist specializing in the transportation of life sustaining, essential goods. Supplying key cities in the United States. I was returning from the southern portion of Virginia, to my home in New York. I was traveling northbound on interstate 81, through Winchester Va. On the north-side of Winchester, away from the city lights the road gets dark at night. I was listening to the radio when my phone rang, as I picked up the phone I happened to look to the west side of the interstate and when I did I was shocked and awed. There was a formation over the distant mountain. A triangle shaped formation was flying towards me. It immediately caught my attention because of the sensitivity of the cargo that I had on-board. There was a triangle formation with another light perpendicular to the lead light. The size of the formation was enormous. I also noticed before I decided to report this, that others in the area reported the same sighting. The formation then seemed to travel northbound, staying perfectly above the mountain and following the interstate. I first saw the formation in Winchester, Va, and watched it the entire way to north of Carlisle, PA. Between Mechanicsburg, Pa and Harrisburg, Pa is where I lost site of the formation. I saw the exact same formation on U.F.O. hunters on the History channel, a month later. These were clearly not man made craft as the maneuvers they performed were impossible to achieve in modern aircraft. We don&#39;t have anything that can stop in mid - air and make a 90 degree turn. Horizontally or laterally. Thus the question remains. What the heck were these things?<n>

It was a clear night, and unseasonably warm for December.  In the sky north of Benton I saw a orb of light descend quickly towards the ground.  It moved at a speed which is unlike I have ever seen any typical aircraft.  The light was a solid bright yellow, and had to be within a mile from where I was standing.  The craft moved rapidly down, and abruptly stopped still above a tree line.  It wasn&#39;t too far from the ground when it stopped, probabley 50&#39; above the trees.  The aircraft then flashed slightly brighter, and disappeared.  No noise.  No trail.  It vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
1/3/09 19:00|Gainesville|VA|Light|15 minutes|Spectacular Lights seen to separate in Virginia outside Washington DC|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67831.html|435|ndxe200901| Spectacular Lights seen to separate in Virginia outside Washington DC<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 7:00pm on Saturday January 3 2009 my wife and I went into our backyard to walk our dogs.  We were in the backyard for a few minutes when I saw a bright light that seemed stationary in the Northeast sky.  I pointed the light out to my wife and than noticed it was slightly moving from north to south.  We live 40 miles outside Washington DC, near Dulles airport, so we do see a lot of airplane traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to think we must be looking at a slow moving airplane.  As the light got closer I noticed there wasn&#39;t any blinking lights and this light was not acting like a conventional aircraft.  The light would slowly move than stop and stay stationary for several minutes than would start moving again.  While we watched the light I told my wife to stay and watch so I can go inside to grab the camera.  I ran into the house, grabbed the camera and opened the back sliding glass door. Just as I started filming the light was just making it over my house, I told my wife to meet me in the front yard. As I ran to the front yard and met my wife I again started filming the light, at this point it was slowly flying above Orion, which was just rising in the east. This is when the unbelievable happened. Just as the light was above Orions belt my wife said &#34;Look it&#39;s turning around&#34; I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes. The light was making a complete U-Turn. But even more spectacular, as the light made the U-Turn, another light continued moving south and stayed on the original path. What I&#39;m trying to say is-the light we were originally watching turned into two separate lights. One made a complete 180 degree turn headed back north and was blue in color, the other light continued south. It seemed to me that these two lights were somehow together or connected and than separated. The light that U-Turned off the original light soon stopped and remained stationary for approximately five minutes as the other light continued south. Soon after the original light was out of sight the U-Turned light started moving ag! ain towa rds the north until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this sighting my neighbor was also walking his dog, he saw my wife and I and was also able to see the two lights after they separated. This was our sighting. I really hope someone else saw what we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n>

The sun was starting to set and then I noticed a strange looking craft in the sky. It looked to almost blend into the sky but appeared significantly brighter, a cylinder type object.  Hard to describe.  It must have been hundreds of miles away.  I watched it for about 5 minutes then I looked over at my wife and said &#34;Honey... what is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> She looked and said she didn&#39;t know but that there was another one &#34;over there&#34; and pointed about 45 degrees to the right.  After a few more minutes of watching them hover and slowly moving across the sky a third craft appeared.   Approximately 15 minutes had passed when they seemed to vanish into thin air.   I didn&#39;t think much of it until last week when I recalled the occasion to my wife and she blurted out &#34;I&#39;m pretty sure they were UFO&#39;s!&#34;   It had always been in the back of my mind and now I&#39;m positive that they were indeed not man-made.

It didn’t appear to be a plane due to the absence of blinking lights or any lead up to its appearance. It clearly didn’t seem to be a satellite since it was below cloud level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event became more peculiar because then a second bright spot appeared next to it for about a minute and then one of the two disappeared (a hard thing for a satellite or plane to do, if that’s what they were.)  After three minutes, I lost view of any spot in the nearly dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I decided to report this is because I photographed a series of eight very clear images of that three minute span and continue to be baffled by looking at those pinpoints of light below cloud level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If viewing the images is deemed worth your while, I need some guidance as to how to do so.   The fact that there is such precise time related data on the camera further prompted me to write a report<n>

The bright light dimmed and as clear as can be is a shape of a UFO. Not a saucer shape that I have seen on tv, but a shape that I can only describe as an ornate Christmas ornament. On the video you can see the UFO vanish, it doesn&#39;t go behind trees or drops below the mountain top, but vanishes like it takes off straight away. I have showed the video to my wife and friends and they agree its a UFO. When I spotted the bright light I called my friend across the street to look out his window and he watched it too although he did not video it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/3/09 04:00|Lafayette|CO|Triangle|7-10 Seconds|I completed a report on your site over a year ago and it was very brief and not as descriptive as I should have been in my initial repo|7/6/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76034.html|441|ndxe200901| I completed a report on your site over a year ago and it was very brief and not as descriptive as I should have been in my initial report.  But since the time of my sighting, I have left out so many other significant factors to that night/morning that I just felt compelled to write to you again and explain the whole event, as there is so much more to mention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have talked about my experience with several people over the past several months and have been made fun of countless times by friends and co-workers, but I still feel the need to explain the whole story to get it off my chest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 1/2/09, I received a call from a friend’s son, who begged me to come up to Lafayette CO, to watch some meteor showers after I got off of work.  It was on a Friday and I was very tired and did not want to drive up there and hang out that particular night.  But the boy who was 13 or 14 at the time kept insisting that I come up and stay the night.  In fact, her 2 other children got on the phone and begged to see me as well and after I spoke with them, I felt compelled to drive up there.  So I packed a bag and headed north from my house in Denver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived at about 8:00pm-8: 30pm and it was cold and I was dragging butt after a long week.  The kids immediately asked me to run to 7-11 to buy firewood for the outdoor fireplace as it was going to be even colder later that night and into the early morning hours.  So I bought 3 or 4 bundles of wood for our night.  Upon our return from 7-11, we hung out for a while and planned our night and agreed that we (my friend and I) would get up around 3:00am-3: 30am to start making hot cocoa and coffee for the 4:00 am showers.  But at around 11:00pm-11: 30pm, the kids were very hyper and were not ready for bed by any means.  They asked me if we could burn one of the bundles of wood and sky watch for a while before heading to bed.  I hesitantly said yes but knew that I was fading fast and didn’t have much energy from a long week at work.  At any rate, I didn’t want to disappoint them, so we headed outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we got the fire going and brought out blankets and snacks, my friend’s daughter (7 yr. old) climbed on lap to stay warm.  The 2 boys, I believe were 13 and 11 were running around singing loud and throwing things in the yard.  I was getting annoyed because I didn’t have the energy they had and I really wanted to just chill out and relax in quite and peace.  The little girl fell asleep in my lap almost immediately as she was bundled up well and was pretty warm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10-15 minutes after she fell asleep, I saw a gray animal or &#34;something&#34; running in a very weird manner along the side of the fence.  Whatever it was, it used a hand as well as its legs to run and hop at the same time.  At first glance I thought it was a wild animal and as soon as I had that thought, I literally threw the girl off of me and yelled, &#34;What ((deleted)) was that?&#34;   This thing moved very fast along the fence and was gone in no time at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend had her back to the &#34;thing&#34; and the boys were running wild and didn’t see anything.  I was so freaked out; I didn’t want to stay out there anymore.  I told them what I saw and they kept asking questions and so on.  Finally, I said that I was going to go inside and sleep for a while because I was getting up at 3:00am-3: 30am to make the snacks and then to watch the showers.  Plus, we needed to save some of the wood I bought.  So the boys said that they were staying downstairs to watch movies with the intention of staying awake all night.  My friend, her daughter and I went upstairs to her bedroom and we all were going to sleep together in the same bed.  After we jumped into bed, I was on one end, my friend in the middle, and her daughter was at the other end snuggled up with her mom.  I fell asleep immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After sleeping for a while, I woke up freezing like I have never felt before. (I have lived in Colorado my whole life and never wore coats in the winter and would only wear jackets because I am always hot).  So I pulled the blankets up to cover myself up more.  As soon as I did this, I was immediately burning up.  I threw the blankets off of me, and I was freezing again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time, I woke up because my face touched my arm, which was like an ice-cube.  My eyes opened and I rolled over to see a purple light hovering below the ceiling.  I tried to focus my eyes to understand what I was seeing, but I could never really make out what it was.  It just changed shapes and was hovering about 3 or 4 inches from the ceiling, closer to my side of the bed.  I watched the thing for about 10-15 minutes before I decided to get dressed and start making the coffee and snacks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1/3/09  At about 3:40am, I woke up my friend and told her what happened in the bedroom and she decided to get up too.  I also told her that the boys were downstairs sleeping in the livingroom with the TV still on.  I told her to look for her video camera with the infrared feature so that we can have it for the showers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it occurred to me that she may want a smoke before the kids got up (they didn’t know she smoked) so we decided to smoke first before getting any cameras together.  Besides, I’m not good with any kind of camera with the exception of a cell phone camera so this was going to be all on her to set that part up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the part that I originally reported to this site, but I left out some stuff so I need to re-tell the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of minutes before 4:00am, we went outside to smoke.  We were out there for a short while when I saw what looked like a flock of geese flying towards us.  I pointed in the direction of where I was looking and yelled, &#34;Look!&#34;   As soon as I said that, I then realized that this was not a flock of geese at all.  It was a triangular shaped object that was gray on the outside of the perimeter and on the bottom, but shiny black finish on the rest of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I told her to look, the thing changed direction a little and aimed its path towards us.  It was directly over us about 300-500 ft in the air and made no sound and was moving very slow.  I initially said that it was going 30-40mph, but it was going slower than that.  My friend stood there with her mouth open and totally freaked out and I started checking in with her because I thought she was going to start screaming or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time, we could see directly underneath this thing and again, it was gray, with a light at each point of the triangle, with a round &#34;portal&#34; in the center and some weird designs on the bottom.  It didn’t make a sound at all. It started moving in between her house and her neighbor’s house and I started to chase it.  When I started running after it, I knocked over the chairs on the patio and bumped the table really loud, when all of the sudden, it disappeared right in front of us.  The lights weren’t on, but something inside was illuminating the lights from within to let us know they were lights.  And it looked as though it was using our street lamps and porch lights to guide itself.  I know I said that we watched this thing for 7 seconds in the first report, but there was no way it could have been that short because of the detail we were able to extract from it.  That was one of the things that always bothered me about it my first report. It was more like 20-30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it disappeared, we went in and woke up the boys first.  My friend said, &#34;That was the most amazing UFO I have ever seen.&#34;  We started telling the kids to get up in case it came back, and because it was time for the showers.  So after we got settled in our spots, the showers came down immediately.  During the showers, we saw more UFO activity with lights flying low all over the place and doing crazy maneuvers and indescribable movements. We would keep talking about it for the next 2 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So at about 6:00am-6: 30am, the wood was almost gone, the winds were picking up and some light snow started to fall. I told everyone that I was going back to bed because I really didn’t sleep much and I was freezing again.  So I went upstairs to lay down in my friend’s bed again alone.  The purple light was gone this time.  At about 7:00am, my friend came in to crash too for a while.  However, at 8:30am, I got up to go to the bathroom. In the bathroom, there are lots of windows to look at onto the front yard.  When I glanced out of one of the windows, I saw a light layer of snow (about an inch high) covering the ground, with a perfect circle partly on the grass, sidewalk, and street in her front yard.  There were no tire tracks, footprints of any kind or anything else near the circle or any other place out front. It was totally untouched by humans or animals. I woke my friend up again and to show her what was out front.  She looked out the window and asked me, &#34;What the hell happened last night?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this was a long story, but I had to go back and correct some things.  I just couldn’t keep all of this information out of this crazy experience.  I swear that I am not making this up and have witnesses to substantiate this weird night/morning.  My friend has agreed to talk to anyone about her piece of the story too.  However, we do have to keep the kids out of it for obvious reasons.  However, my friend’s children and I have experienced other UFO’s that same year, at that same house.  And there is more to tell, believe me!  But that was the most amazing UFO at that house because it was so huge.  But we do have more stories about some other cool sighting too of a smaller triangle flying 20ft above our heads 3x’s in the same night.  But that’s another story for another time.  Besides, I don’t remember the date of that one.<n>

It looked extrememly large, and I fully expected to hear or see an explosion when it reached the ground.  I didn&#39;t see any such explosion.  I kept looking to the sky as I was driving and when I looked back at the road, I saw I was beginning to swerve out of my lane.  Several other cars ahead of me where also swerving out of their lanes as if they were also watching the sphere.  I heard no sounds during the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/2/09 19:30|St. Paul|MN|Light|3 seconds|Fast shooting light through the clouds over Lake Owasso|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67860.html|450|ndxe200901| Fast shooting light through the clouds over Lake Owasso<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of us were standing around a bonfire on the ice last Friday evening. There were quite a few ice fishermen out on Lake Owasso but most people were in their ice houses. The sky was cloudy as is typical in winter, except that the horizons were clear just a little over the tree tops. I was facing west and my buddy west/northwest. As we stood around talking, something caught my eye just above us and to the south. I looked up expecting to see a shooting star. Instead it was a green-ish/blue-ish egg shaped light streaking through the clouds. It lasted for about three seconds and then vanished. I initially thought that it was a shooting star because of the speed that the light moved across the sky. I immediately concluded that it was not a shooting star because the dense clouds overhead prohibited our view of any stars. Winter clouds in Minnesota are low to the ground and shooting stars occur high in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light appeared to be the size of a large airplane (like a military cargo plane) but it was tough to gauge its size because it was hard to judge distance between the clouds and the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After initially thinking that the light was a shooting star, my next conclusion was that it was a flare. However, the light was much bigger than a flare, and was traveling horizontally at a constant rate and altitude. Flares also don’t travel as fast as a shooting star. The light also did not look like any flare that I’ve ever seen and was not red or white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was moving just inside of the clouds. I could see bits of cloud between myself and the light. This makes me think that it wasn’t a flash light, strobe, or other projection onto the clouds since that type of light would not penetrate the clouds. It would reflect off of the clouds and not appear to be inside of the clouds as this light happened to be. It also did not have any of the normal attributes of northern lights, and appeared in the sky just to the south of our position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise created by the light, no trail of clouds or exhaust, and it disappeared just before reaching a clearing in the clouds. I suppose that it could have been some sort of bright gas ball, but I’ve never seen anything like that before. This light shot through the clouds and seemed to have defined edges (egg-shaped). The light never changed direction, speed, or altitude that I could tell. It just vanished at a certain point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t say that it was a craft of any sort because all that we saw was a fast moving light. Instantly though, we both knew that we had seen something odd. I don’t have an explanation for what we saw but can describe it quite well. My fishing buddy saw it for the last second or so and couldn’t come up with a good explanation for what we saw either.<n>

We documented seeing the same bright light, same location 1 month ago with eyes and binocular&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time, my husband moved our telescope to his room and took 10 minutes or so to focus in on the bright round light.  He compared it to the moon focus which could not totally fit in the scope but when focusing on the bright light it became clearly centered in the middle of the scope and was distinctly a link of round lights making up two seperate rings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the middle of the inner ring, it appears to be straight lights/beams of light toward the center of the circle.  Kinda of like wedges formed in the center of the ring.  At one point, three lights equally became brighter than the rest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all witnessed the sighting through the telescope and at first I would say it was the bottom of a huge space craft but not sure if the beams were lights all towards the center of the ring like a gateway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally, for a breif moment towards the end of the sighting, small white dots appeared to be darting to and from the main object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clouds started to obscure the sighting and I saw a blue flash behind the clouds and when then the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, returning from dinner, the bright light was seen from the front of our home and when we went to use our telescope, the clouds blocked the vision again.

1/2/09 05:30|Ballinger|TX|Other|1.5 + hours|Several UFO's sighted near the big dipper.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67840.html|454|ndxe200901| Several UFO&#39;s sighted near the big dipper<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was deer hunting on the morning of the aforementioned date and it was still completely dark when I got to my deer stand.  The deer stand is a 12’ tripod that has a 360 degree swivel chair and can be covered by a canvas; except the canvas was off and only the metal frame was around me. While sitting, at chest height there is a square bar that goes all around me and is connected to the floor by four vertical bars.  Four metal bars are connected to this chest high bar at each corner and extend up where they are connected at the top by another square bar.  The very top has two bars that form a cross, connected to each other in the middle and topping off the entire frame.  This cross of the bars forms 4 ‘quadrants’ that I separated the sky with as I was looking at stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was facing the northwest looking at the upside down big dipper and a group of stars below it.  The group of stars (I’ll call reference stars) occupied about the same space as the big dipper, but is shaped as such: two stars lined up on a horizontal axis between the ground and the big dipper at about the same distance away from the big dipper as the width of the top of the pot on the big dipper.  Two other stars sit on a vertical axis off to the right of this; the top star is about underneath the second star of the handle of the big dipper at about the same distance as the stars on the handle of the big dipper are from each other.  In between the vertical stars there appeared an object about halfway between them and to the right.  The horizontal stars &#34;pointed&#34; right to this center object. Again, the vertical and horizontal stars were the reference points I used to verify movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking at the big dipper and seeing ‘twinkles’ of stars and some shooting stars all around me, I saw the twinkle of the object that appeared to be a star.  As I stared and focused on this twinkling star I noticed it was slightly moving in random directions, but maintaining its presence within a very small area. If you were to look briefly at the ‘big picture’ it would just appear as a regular star.  As I watched this object to continually verify to myself that this object was indeed moving,  I saw another twinkling of an object just to the left of this one and another tiny &#34;star-like&#34; object appeared.  This object darted to my lower left in a straight line as a shooting star would do and slowed to a near stop next to a couple of very faint stars.  It moved randomly as the first star was doing and then disappeared. I strained for a few minutes to see it, but it was definitely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked back at the first object I identified I noticed that it was still moving ever so slightly in a random fashion, yet maintaining its presence in a very small area, relative to my eyesight.  At that point I saw another twinkle in about the same place as the previous one and yet another star-like object appeared.  This object flashed as a twinkle and its glow went back to the same brightness as an &#34;average&#34; star.  It then traveled in an easterly direction in a not-so-straight line.  As I was looking at this object and looking back and forth at this one and the first one I lost it because it picked up its speed, got very dim and then disappeared.  I lost it when it got about the same distance away as the one that moved in the other direction from the point of origin. Several times I focused in on other stars and verified to myself that they were indeed staying still, and the objects in question were definitely moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I got my binoculars out; Bushnell 16 x 32 (188ft. at 1000 yards).  These are small binoculars so it was difficult to focus and maintain a steady position. At a couple of points I was able to focus in on the object for a couple of seconds to see what I would describe as a spinning ‘ying and yang’ symbol.  It was spinning counter-clockwise. I lost focus on the object and couldn’t regain focus so I leaned my head back and rested it on the corner bar behind me to get steady without the binoculars. I stared at this object for a long time, thought deeply about it and witnessed continual movement in an area tiny enough to conceal its movements; if I stuck my arm out in front of me and made a one inch square it would have stayed within that one inch square.  It almost got out of alignment a couple of times in reference to the other vertical and horizontal stars, but still maintained its presence in a very small area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This activity continued until it started getting daylight and I lost sight of all stars.  I eventually shifted my focus back on hunting and later told my friend in camp about my encounter.  It was as if these objects came in through our atmosphere in a flash all in the same general area, and then moved in their respective directions.  So I just continued to look at the first object.  It not only helped to have the stars as reference points, but the bars that crossed at the top of my deer stand also provided a stationary reference.  The wind was calm, and the morning was absolutely clear.  I had Lasik surgery in my left eye about 7 years ago that vastly improved my vision.  I witnessed several shooting stars that morning, but there is no doubt in my mind that what I witnessed, by definition, was several unidentified flying objects.  It wasn’t a close encounter by any means, but it convinced me that someone or something is among us either as a hidden residence or as a visitor.  I now believe and I will never look to the sky in the same way ever again.<n>

This sighting of the object occurred over about five seconds, and was accompanied by the sound of a passenger airplane or jet aircraft.  Describing the UFO, it was merely a white cigar shape moving about the speed and altitude of a jet.  It had no visible wings or anything of the sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened was that I was sitting in a room, and I looked out my window, which faced north.  I saw this object through the trees of my woods, and it went behind one of the trees.  As I was looking in the area, I did not see the object re-appear on the other side of the tree.  When I saw it, it was going from the North-Northeast to the Northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A similar experience happened about five years ago, but I was on the playground at my school, where I saw about the same thing.  I showed it to some people, and as I was about to show someone else, I could not find the object, although it could not have left the zenith in that amount of time that I turned back around.  It was going in about the same direction as the previous one too.<n>

Object stood sitll in air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> January 1st 2009  I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette before heading to bed. I remember checking my watch because I knew I had to be up early and head out of town the following morning and I recall it was approximately 11:15 p.m. or so. I was standing out on my front porch smoking a cigarette staring at the tree tops which I often do and noticed a light which was yellowish white in color off in the distance. It was behind one of the trees in my neighbor across the streets yard and at first glance I assumed it to be a star. I noticed slight movement which I assumed was from the tree swaying but the light seemed to be getting closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With an airport within 15 minutes away, it was not uncommon to see planes flying over head so I thought nothing of it. As I continue to smoke my cigarette, the light was moving closer and was ascending. As the object got closer, something told me to take a picture. I pulled out my phone and attempted to with the phones camera, but because of the night the only thing that appeared in the picture was the light (I have the picture archived on my phone). By the time the light reached over were the tree was, it maneuvered in what I can best describe as a half circle or moon shaped movement to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still ascending upward, I was able to see the undercarriage or belly of the object. There were lights in the shape of a triangle under the object that were in some sort of series of blinking. The lights were red and a very white crystal light. I am still assuming at this point that the object is a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within what seem to be a minute or so, the object then made another maneuver in the same half round or moon motion coming back around to the right in the direction of the tree I had first initially seen and maneuvered past the tree over to my side of the street a few houses to the right. At this point the object had descended and I was able to see the top of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was round in shape and had a ring of lights on the outer edge. The object sat in the air still almost as if it was starring at me. I opened my front door and yelled to wake my daughter off the couch to get her mother. Not very comprehensive from being awoken, rubbing her eyes, I directed her to get her mother yelling its important hurry. She came back and said mommy was sleeping. I yelled for her to wake mommy up now! The object is still sitting there while this is transpiring. Finally I dart into the house to wake my wife and fly out the back door of our bedroom onto my deck in the hopes for her to come see what I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Standing on my deck, I saw nothing. I then run through the house back out front in hopes it was just out of visibility from the deck, but it was gone. I checked my watch and it was 11:28 p.m. After it was all done I was a little shaken by what I had seen. I was telling my wife of the experience and in telling her about what I had seen, my memory recalled that I did not here any engine noise that you typically would from a plane, and of course it was not a helicopter. I have always been quite the skeptic when it comes to the sightings, but I know I saw something I had never seen before and was unable to identify exactly what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 28 year old male, married with 2 children. I am originally from Long Island, NY and moved to NC in 1999. I am a district manager for a men’s clothier and well respected by friends, family and colleagues. People whom know me would attest to my credibility.<n>

I was just walking for a few minutes and was on the sidewalk of a school, when I saw these flashing lights up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember the green lights were the color of a green LED such as that you would find on a computer monitor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember I saw one BRIGHT light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember a voice calling saying, &#34;Drop the tunug.&#34; It was a robotic voice. I remember calling out, &#34;I do not have anything in my hand.&#34;  The voice said again, &#34;DROP THE TUNUG.&#34;I started running. I remember praying in my head, &#34;LORD, I am not doing ANYTHING wrong.. PLEASE save me. I will always serve you no matter what, so PLEASE help me.&#34;  I remember this horrible pain going through my legs, and I fell to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a clicking noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember someone walking up to me. They put handcuffs on me. I was told to get up, and not to move, or I would be shot with a taser.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know a LOT about tasers. I remember that I was taken to a building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a building, that i had never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got in, I heard the building making a low pitched humming noise, and there were several machines with lines, and other thangs going across their screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was told to sit down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat down in a little chair which had several buttons and cranks on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a red button that said, &#34;For emergencies only.&#34;  I remember I was told to sit and be quiet or I would be tased again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I complied.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was hooked up to a pulse oximeter, which monitored my oxygen levels, and a mask was put on my face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember them saying my oxygen was VERY low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taken to a little room, and was hooked up to an EKG machine which beeped to my heartrate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was then told to put my face up against this machine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember my Mom had told me before NEVER to look into something unless I knew what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I refused to do as I was commanded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They tased me again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told them that I was going to do whatever my Mom said, and that I WOULD NOT do that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was told that if I did not do what they said I would be put in a green light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They said the green light would not just flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would shock me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did NOt put my face up to the machine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You see I am visually impared, and I have to have A LOT of tests, and i am VERY curious when it comes to tests, but I resisted my curiousity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taken into a room, and placed in a little machine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I prayed, and as I was in the machine I sang praises to God who I KNOW would help deliver me from this machine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a green light come on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone outside of the light screamed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember someone grabbing me, and taking me out of the light, and they told me that if I did NOT do what they said, I would be tased.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was then unhooked from the machines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taken outside and told that I was free to go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They put this blue light on me, and everything went black from there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then remember waking up in the craft again, and was told that I was going to have a device called a tunug used on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They hooked something up to the wall, and I heard this LOUD noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It sounded like a machine that is used in the eye Drs. I was then told to look at a red light above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I DID NOT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember having an urge to do something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed something, and pulled it down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started pushing buttons on a lever, and everyone in the room screamed at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember seeing these springs coiled up, and they were green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had a light that was very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was told that I was free to go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was told that I was not going to get the tunug used on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They took me to the back of the house  or craft or whatever its called, and told me to get out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked out and when I continued walking I saw these green lights on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a blinking light that said, &#34;DO NOT Remove any of these green lights.&#34; \ I walked passed them, and continued walking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept walking, until I turned around and went back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I woke up, and went to check on these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were now just bulbs that were NOT on.<n>

It appeared in the one spot, I do not think I just found it as it was moving. It was moving from North to South nearly directly. I would guess it could have been 10 to 20 miles from me. Its speed was like that of a high flying jet. I was not sure but I thought it looked as if it was slowing down! It looked like it may be an airplane very high up, but it quit flashing after about (4)four flashes (dull-bright-dull-dull flashes), and then I could not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3 seconds or so after I could not see it any longer, an object that acted like a meteorite shot to the NE from the same spot the flashes quit. The meteorite object was very brushy in its halo and tail, as if a lot of material was burning up very quickly, but it was not very bright. It had a reddish center with a yellowish corona and was very wide,also the tail was very long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trajectory lasted about 3 seconds and had a pronounced arc as if it was slowing quickly. I estimate it traveled about 30 degrees in arc from the point it appeared before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just by accident, my wife looked up the sky she saw a light, she think at first it is a firecracker since it is still first day of the year, as she called my attention to see it, when I looked up, I said directly &#34;oh my God, UFO!&#34;, my second thought is a crashing plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to my wife, oh my God, a plane!  Burning tail of a plane,  It just passes us until we can&#39;t see it anymore, the trees covering it...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is like a lamp, with shield, the shield is like a gasses sorrounded the inner part of it (the light).<n>

It was moving in a way you can call dancing/hovering it was not flashing the colour remained the same but the intensity varied.  No other strange object sighted other the an airplane left of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my wife to have a look she saw it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked her to get the binoculars, she got them and I had the time to focus on the object It looked like a point , so either a very small object or far away, (the latter being less obvious because of the clouds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object  seemed to move in a circular pattern &#34;out of the tree&#34; to the left moving away from me and dimming out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sounds heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (binoculars type:  bresser 10*50)<n> <n><n> <n><n> My conclusion: no fireworks, no helicopter, no airplane, no mirroring, disco lamps on clouds, no satelite, no star, planet or moon, no falling star, nearest possibility ball-lightning.<n>

I stop the car and look out the window the silver circle shaped thing pulsed three or four times and it was gone. I when through the grave yard to see if anyone or thing was in there no one was.

After turning a corner she got a better view of the object and pointed it out to my brother and I. It was just sitting still hovering over houses. We wanted to get a better look at it so we started towards it. It then began to fly off to the right very fast, so fast that we could not catch up to it. We lost it. It was very large, we could not see the exact shape, but we could see the out line of a large black mass. It had bright red lights lit up in a line curving around the left side. My mom had a better angle than me and she saw white lights lining the lower part of it. We live near both an airport and a very active air force base, but it looked like nothing we had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/1/09 19:00|Concord|CA|Unknown|1-2 hours|Regular, almost nightly sightings of bright star-like objects and one large slow flying object with red light|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68388.html|466|ndxe200901| Regular, almost nightly sightings of bright star-like objects and one large slow flying object with red light<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the past several weeks, I have noticed the following at regular intervals—almost nightly: At least two objects. One is an extremely bright star- looking object that moves slightly  (my perspective). It is not a plane, helicopter or other familiar flying object. Always at the same time another enormous, slow- and low-flying object circles above my house and neighborhood. It is low enough to view pretty well as it has a red light that flashes quickly while it is moving. You can only tell that it is large when the light flashes, but I cannot tell the shape. It is either completely silent or makes an unusual humming noise. My landlord prefers me to smoke cigarettes outside, so I usually am in and out of my house. It is almost always between 7:00 and 8:00 pm in the evening and has gotten so close at times while I am watching it, that it scares me and I run back into my house. Sometimes there are several of the star-like things in the sky, but only one of the large objects, and only one of the star-like objects is closer than all the others. The one that appears the closest is always in the same vicinity. After reading some of these posts, I realized I am not alone in what I see.  I am a little embarrassed to ask any of my co-workers, etc. if they see what I see. I live alone. I took two pictures with my camera phone but they just look like dots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

They clearly were not planes or jets based on the speed which was extremely rapid  and the verticle flight patterns.  They had the ability to start and stop sharply and then reverse flight direction.  Myself  and the other drivers  and looked at each other and back at the lights.  Anytime we were stopped by a red light we got a chance to see if others noticed and tried to get people’s attention by pointing  toward the lights.  I eventually got on I-240 and was able to see these lights for a while until I had to eventually get off at my exit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

When I first saw the object it was directly above me at high altitude moving slowly across the sky to the West.  It was a highly reflective silver color and shaped like a cigar. I&#39;m going to take a guess it was at least 40-50 thousand feet up.  There was no sound or contrail.  I couldn&#39;t see any wings or control surfaces of any kind. jet&#39;s fly over daily at high altitude but I can always make out the wings as well as the body of the jet.  Also, I can always hear the engines on a high altitude jet.  I lost sight of the object because of the trees on my property but it appeared to be  on a steady course due West.<n>

I saw two lights in the sky-very high up and moving along together at the same speed.  They appeared as glowing orbs red/orange and as they moved over the house I saw one shoot up higher followed by the second when it reached the same point then they disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked back to where I had first seen them three more lights were moving across the sky in the same direction.  Again the lights kept the same distance apart moving at the same speed.  They were the same colour and similar size.  When the three lights reached the same point as the two lights they disappeared.  I went to the front of the house to see if they had passed over but they were nowhere to be seen.  It must have taken about 2 minutes plus from the first sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing about the orbs was that they maintained the same size, brightness and distance as they moved across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen this kind of thing before.

It looked like it changed directions and went straight away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time that it looked like it had stoped and changed directions was about 1 to 2 seconds then it was gone.

As we were picking up, we saw a bright orange/red ball that we thought was a New Years firework, but it didn&#39;t die out.  They came in a cluster of 2.  We watched all 4 &#34;balls&#34; go across the sky..still waiting to see them die out, but they disappeared behind the trees.  There was no sound and they went at a steady pace.  The most eerie thing we&#39;ve ever seen.  We all looked at each other and said..&#34;we are all seeing this..right?&#34;  I took pics with my cell phone, but they just looked like stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very strange Huge Orange light flying very slow about 30 km/h and very low, about 50-60 meters in the sky.. It was making NO Noise whatsoever. It was NO some chinese lamp, or some fireworks.. Me and my family of 6 was looking at it. WE NEVER sow something like that.. it was flying over our house in Beaumont, Artane, in Dublin. I hear my neighbours also asking them self what was that...?!...<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is our 1st time to see something like that.. We are 100% sure that this thing was something out of this world!!! It has disapear in mater of second in the sky...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I have search the google to check did somebody else sow it.. and it was there many people who sow the same Orange light. some of them claim to have so 2 orange light. I also find the Report from Australia from 03/01/2009 who sow the same Orange lights and also the Australian Army jets have chasing them..<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Report says:  &#34;MILITARY exercises may explain sightings of a mysterious orange light in Central Australia in recent days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Military exercises spark UFOs  The Northern Territory News understands a group of people who live at Ali Curung, an Aboriginal community not far from well-known UFO haunt Wycliffe Well, had seen the strange phenomenon from their front porch at about 4am on Saturday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several of the group watched as a huge orange ball hovered for an estimated 20 minutes before being chased by what appeared to be four fighter aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wycliffe Well owner Lou Farkas said some mentioned their UFO experience the next day when they came in for coffee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;They had all just come in on a bus from Alice Springs and none of them had been drinking,&#34; he said. &#34;Apparently the light hovered for a while and then three other objects that looked like fighter planes trailed it and were joined by another plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Then the orange light just disappeared into nowhere - they thought it was quite unusual, especially with the other lights that appeared to be aircraft joining in.&#34;  Advertisement: A US military spokeswoman said it was quite possible the stargazers had witnessed a military exercise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Story source www.news.com.au &#34;  The photos on the story was the same light we seen.

1/1/09 00:25|Puerto Escondido (Mexico)||Sphere|30-35 minutes|Multiple Orange & Red Spheres Over Southern Mexico|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69411.html|478|ndxe200901| Multiple Orange &amp; Red Spheres Over Southern Mexico<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was celebrating New Year&#39;s Eve with a number of other people in a restaurant near my home.  We all saw a bright orange light moving roughly from west to east, and we stopped all of our festivities (musicians included) to watch.  The fireworks for the evening had ended several minutes before. The sighting took about 4-5 minutes before the sphere was out of sight.  It flew (floated) directly over the restaurant. I estimate its height to be no more than 4,000 feet above the ground. The object appeared small, maybe a few meters across, and, just like last year&#39;s sighting, emanated a fuzzy orange color that looked a lot like a plasma.  There was no sound, and several other attendees said they had also seen the same kind of event last year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From there, I walked back to my home, and continued to look for more orange lights.  I wasn&#39;t disappointed.  I sat on my rooftop, and after about 5 minutes, another orange sphere came from the north and traveled almost exactly south, until it was out of sight.  It floated quite a distance away over the ocean.  So from where I live, I was looking directly west.  There was no sound. About two minutes later a third orange sphere, this time maybe 300 yards closer to my home, floated by, north to south. Again, no sound.  These orange spheres were then followed by two red spheres, each about two to three minutes apart, and each one slightly closer to my home, by what appeared to be equal distances.  It looked as though they were all following a specific north to south direction in a grid pattern, all of the objects acting together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I take all of the spheres as one complete sighting, then the sighting lasted a total of about 30-35 minutes.<n>

I told my wife after watching the ball drop on t.v., lets see if the ufo is back.  Sure enough, we went out on our deck and as clear as the stars, we saw it again.  It was very high in the sky almost straight up.  It was a bright red cluster/round light.  Near the end of the sighting it flickered, faded out and disappeared.  It simply turns off.  Since it seems to reoccur on New Years, I wonder if it was a satellite.  However, it is so bright, it didn&#39;t move and just disappearing in thin air rules out sat, jet, plane or balloon.  Pretty trippy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

There were about seven of us sitting in the front of my residence.  The group consisted of a brother, children, in-law and relatives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The neighbors started the fireworks about mid-night. The continuous exploding of fireworks last for about 9 to 11 minutes.  At the end of the firecrackers exploding, our attention was drawn to the southeastern sky.  Flying in a westerly direction were several unknown objects.  The first formation consisted of four objects. Three of these appeared to be in some type of symetrical formation and the fourth one of this group was alone.  These four objects were red in color and we could not see any blinking lights nor could we hear any noise coming from this group.  They objects were low enough that we should have been able to hear whether or not they were of a fixed wing aircraft or rotor aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Behind this group of four we noticed two others and either a single or a third group of two objects.  All of the objects were similar in nature in that they all displayed a red light, none displayed any flashing lights. We could not see any color that would be visible on an aircraft; green on one side or a solid white when viewing from the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear as we could see stars and a partial moon.  The wind was blowing from the north.  We had a small fire in an outdoor pit and we were sitting in a semi-circle.  I myself was sitting with my back to the north, viewing the objects coming from the east, heading westward as if to say they were followig directly over I-10.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the objects moved slightly to a point past 180 to 190 degrees, the objects seemed to just disappear.  There were no clouds that would obsecure our view of these objects.   The objects in the second and third group disappeared as did the ones in the first group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Members of the viewing group includes a 63 year old registered pharmacist and his wife who is a college graduate and her daughter; my 25 year old son, a college graduate and his wife who is a registered nurse; my sister-in-law who is a photographer; myself, a 55 year old retired state police polygraph examiner and my wife a Licensed Practical Nurse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no-one in the group who was intoxicated.  I had only had two drinks all night.  The only explanation I can give for not hearing any aircraft noise is that our ears were ringing from the fireworks.  However, no one in the group could hear any aircraft engine noise nor could we see any flashing lights.  As we verbalized our observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also submitted an email to a friend of mine who is a dispatcher with the local sheriff&#39;s office.  The content of that email was to ask him if any other reports concerning these objects were received by sheriff&#39;s office.  At the time of this writng, I have not heard from him.<n>

I estimate the object was a good mile away and made no noise - or if it did it wouldn&#39;t have been heard threw the sound of fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was the only UFO interested person among this group I paid close attention to the time it was first witnessed and the time it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event occurred about 2 miles from the west gate of Ramstein Airbase here in Germany.<n>

It was a brownish color and had a few smaller ones. It made a strange wavy sound, like it was floating. The UFO was not moving to fast but was clearly not of earth origin. It proceeded across the sky until out of sight. Also worth mentioning, there were jets flying around where the object had been scene the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Their altitude was just above the tree tops and they were flying in perfect formation staying the same distance from each other through the whole sighting.  The sky was clear (no clouds) and there was little to no wind blowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought that it could be that they were coming from a Roman candle since there were some fireworks being set off at the time (it being just after midnight at the New Year), but these objects were flying too perfectly and stayed at the same altitude the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light from these objects stayed at the same intensity throughout until they finally faded away at the horizon, and there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as the first two objects disappeared another two appeared from the southeast (the same direction as the first two).  These two orbs were identical in size and shape to the first two.  They were flying a little farther apart from each other than the first two (it seemed about twice as far), and the first one of this second two objects to appear was flying at a little higher altitude than the following object.  Again these two orbs flew at the same speed as the first two and stayed at the same distance from each other and at the same altitude throughout the sighting.  Also the intensity of the light from these objects was the same as the first two and similarly did not vary until they just faded away as they reached the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time of the sighting from the beginning two objects to the time the last two disappeared lasted a little more than five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were so much in awe and did not want to miss anything, so unfortunately we did not get any video of this.  It is only in our memories.  If anyone else witnessed this please report it.  Thank you for having this web site.<n>

Just after the count down to the New Year, my friend and I noticed a bright red sphere moving unusually across the black sky.  The red sphere moved sideways, up and down, and back and forth; unlike a plane or satellite.  When it came to a stop above us in the sky, we thought for sure it was a UFO. My friend took photos of it on my camera, but he didn&#39;t zoom in or take actual moving video, which discouraged me later.  The red sphere made no noise or sound whatsoever.  It looked like it was parked to view the fireworks going off in the West San Fernando Valley.  It looked like it had large round &#34;windows&#34; around the orb itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first photo shows the red sphere moving, and the other photos show it still in the sky.  After a few minutes, it either disappeared or its lights simply went out.  I am not surprised it disappeared, because a bunch of people were standing around with us in the backyard pointing at it yelling, &#34;Look! A UFO!&#34;.<n>

I had not been drinking alcohol to see in the New Year!!!!!  Just pulling the bedroom curtains to go to bed, looked outside (facing towards South) looking and listening for celebration fireworks for the occasion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saw to my left (South by South East) 4 very bright orange glows, in a straight line, not line abreast, moving slowly across the sky, but not very high up, about a few hundred feet up, possibly a few miles from my location, as if from the general direction of Portsmouth or the Isle of Wight travelling towards Southampton and the Docks area. The glows were not travelling at high speed but fairly slowly in a straight line, spaced wide apart, so were not fireworks or flares as far as I was concerned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never ever seen anything like this on this planet. They had no flashing coloured lights like you would see on aircraft / helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes, as I could not work out what this was. I did not understand it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran outside to get a further look, but when I got to the front of the house, they had gone, .BUT then I saw several more spaced apart to the east coming over the trees at the back of my house, again in slow straight lines generally towards Southampton city area and again, a few hundred feet up in the sky. I could not make out any solid shapes, like metalwork, they were just very bright orange glows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in to get my girlfriend outside to look with me, but when I returned outside, again they had disappeared, BUT then I saw a few more much further away over Southampton, again travelling slowly across the sky in straight lines, not in curved arcs, until they too suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear with a few clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glows travelled quite a distance, maybe a couple of miles before disappearing. If they were fireworks / flares then they were of a type I have never seen and how did they travel such distances in straight lines across the sky instead of up and down. The glows were very large, perhaps the size of a craft but very difficult to work out in terms of distance away and true size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got annoyed with my girlfriend as she refused to come and look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That experience stuck with me for weeks, as it was so ,;extra terrestrial&amp;#8217; as far as I am concerned from my experiences on this planet so far. There was no noise with them either like you would hear from aircraft / helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SO THAT WAS THE END OF THAT&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;UNTIL&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230; At about 22.30 hrs on Monday, 15.6.09. I was driving an ambulance from Southampton to Totton area, along the road towards the Rushington roundabout, having just finished my last job.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw ahead of me a few hundred feet up, what I initially thought was an odd looking lamppost light, which didn&#39;t match the others along the road. They were bright white, but this was bright orange. I then realised that this glow was higher up and further away in the background, as if over Cadnam area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I strained to work it out as I continued driving, then realised that it was moving in my general direction across the sky, slowly in a straight line. I quickly wound the window down to see if there was any aircraft noise but it was moving silently AND it was the same type of shape and glow as what I experienced on 1.1.09. as described above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was SO WEIRD that I suddenly pulled up on the side of the road. As I did this it slowly passed directly overhead at a height of about a few hundred feet only!!!!!!! I strained to look out through my windscreen at the top as it passed over, but as it did, I DEFINITELY SAW A VERY BROAD AND FLAT SILVER GREY METAL SHAPE OF SOME SORT OF AIRCRAFT WITHIN THE VERY BRIGHT ORANGE GLOW. THIS WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE OR A HELICOPTER AND IT HAD NO FLASHING LIGHTS AND NO ACCOMPANYING NOISE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped out of the ambulance to see if it was still above me but it had passed by and I saw it continue moving slowly in a straight line away from me towards Southampton. Again, I could not believe my eyes. The colour and shape of the glow was the same as at New Year. I could not work out what I was seeing, but it was MOST MOST MOST DEFINITELY A FLYING CRAFT OF SOME SORT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I jumped back into the ambulance and continued to drive now along the A326 towards Fawley. I looked out and saw the orange glow now a much further distance away and higher up in the sky but it was now moving in a slow straight line as if towards Romsey from Southampton. Then it disappeared. A couple of minutes after this, I saw it again, but this time it was high up again, but moving from the general area of Southampton Docks, south and east as if towards Portsmouth or the Isle of White along the line of Southampton Water. I never saw it again that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot say whether it was the same craft on the three occasions seen this evening, or whether it was three craft in different locations over the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurrence has stuck with me ever since, BUT THE FANTASTIC THING IS&amp;#8230;.on the radio the next day (WAVE 105 F.M.) I heard reports that other people had seen these orange glows in the Solent sky that same night before, SO I WAS NOT GOING MAD as there were other witnesses to it!!!! However, the report stated that this was being written off as a meteor shower!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I thought meteors were small white momentary streaks in the sky, like shooting stars up in space!!?? WHAT I SAW WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT A METEOR SHOWER, BUT A REAL LIFE EVENT INVOLVING A MOVING CRAFT OF SOME SORT!!!!!! DID ANYONE ELSE SEE WHAT I SAW???????????????????????????? I know what I saw and witnessed and I believe in U.F.O.s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The human race in my opinion would be very naïve indeed, if we think that we are the only living life forms in the Milky Way, Galaxy, Solar System, Universe etc etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If such craft as reported as being seen moving at incredible speeds across the sky exist, then that suggests to me that they are also capable of travelling FAR FAR greater distances in speed and space than we have so far achieved from this planet. So I reckon that far superior life forms on other planets we have not yet reached in travel, can reach us already!!!! Reporter is a retired police officer and current ambulance driver.

1/1/09 00:05|Cardiff (UK/Wales)||Light|30-45 seconds|Three unidentified orange objects over Cardiff, New Years Day 2009|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68960.html|492|ndxe200901| Three unidentified orange objects over Cardiff, New Years Day 2009<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were extremely strange lights that were sighted by myself and my wife just after Midnight on New Years Day, 2009. (Yes, there were fireworks going off and no, these were not fireworks!) As a bit of background, I&#39;ve been a Police Officer for 17 years, all of these being on operational duties.  I served in the Royal Air Force for six years and I have a life long interest in aircraft, thanks to my father.  I would say that I am very knowledgeable about aircraft types.  I am always looking up at aircraft so I am used to seeing things in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before Midnight on 31st December 2008, my wife and I went into our loft room in order to watch the fireworks going off over Cardiff.  The velux windows in the loft face north and we had a view of 180 degrees from west to east.  The weather was dry with a slight haze.  Even with the haze, visibility was good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 00.05 hours, I saw an orange coloured ball of light over the west of Cardiff.  I would estimate that it was about 3 miles away from my position and at a height of about 5000ft.  There were no strobe lights on this object and it moved at a steady pace from south to north, in a straight, horizontal line.  It was in sight for about 10 seconds before disappearing, and it did just vanish from sight as there were no objects between it and me to obscure it from view.  When I first saw it, I pointed it out to my wife who watched it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within about 5 seconds of the first object disappearing, I saw another one, this time directly in front of my position so it was over the north of Cardiff, at about the same height but I would estimate at a distance of 2 miles.  It was exactly the same colour as the first and moved from east to west, again in a straight, horizontal line, remaining at the same height.  It remained in view for about 10 seconds and then just disappeared, like the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 10 seconds, I saw yet another object, exactly the same as the first two and exactly the same colour.  This one was above my position and was moving from east to west.  It was bigger than the first two and I believe that it appeared so because it was at a lower height.  Again, it moved in a straight line and was visible for about 5 seconds before vanishing.  Also again, there was nothing that could have obscured my view of it such as a building it could have flown behind etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, my wife decided that she had seen enough and went downstairs and, unfortunately, I had to go with her.  The sight of the lights had spooked her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have mentioned these lights to colleagues and one of them put forward the Chinese lantern theory but the lights just appeared, travelled in a straight, horizontal line and then disappeared.  They were in three completely different places and they did not have the flight characteristics of a floating lantern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These things weren&#39;t travelling at a high speed.  I would say the speed was about that of a helicopter.  In fact, when I saw the first light, I thought that it was the Police helicopter but the colour of the light and the widespread locations as well as the complete lack of any strobe or other flashing lights on the objects soon dispelled that idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no explanation regarding the identity of these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first my husband thought it might be a planet, but I pointed out that this light was tail light red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood and watched the light for between 15 to 20 minutes, the light did not move, the light fluctuated from bright to dim and back to bright at times and then suddenly just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are not aware of any bright and prominent celestial bodies in the northwest sky, at the time the witness indicates in her report.  Object remains unidentified.  PD))<n>
1/1/09 00:00|Lampertheim (Germany)||Fireball|26 Minutes|Several reddish glows in the sky on new years day in Germany|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67759.html|494|ndxe200901| Several reddish glows in the sky on new years day in Germany<n> <n><n> <n><n> On new years day at 0.00am on the 01/01/09 I saw a few orange glows in the sky with odd orange lights or orange balloons floating above them.  Most of them were slowly floating up and then dissappeared.  Some of them stayed but soon they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 26mins there was one more glow but no fireworks in the area of the reddish glow. So I believe I saw an official ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Same thing, i was outside looking &#34;up&#34; like everyone should do often. i saw various different &#34;stars&#34; criss cross across the sky at night. Couldnt have been satellites. well thats all i have for now. keep looking up! your bound to see something.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/1/09 00:00|Bandar Seri Begawan||Unknown|20 min|Obj. captured in camera on new year eve fireworks photo assignment for the press agency.  ((NUFORC Note:  Aircraft, we believe.  PD))|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67841.html|498|ndxe200901| Object captured in camera on new year eve fireworks photography assignment for the press agency<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going for my photo assignment during the new year eve, heading  towards a resort hotel to cover the fireworks display. I position myself at a Tungku Beach facing the hotel from far so that I can frame the fireworks and the hotel all in one frame. When I was there and the fireworks exploded and I started firing shots with my camera using a cable release connected to my Canon EOS 5D digital camera + Canon 70-200MM F2.8 IS (L) lens and a Manfrotto tripod stand. The firework started exactly 12.00AM (+0800GMT) at The Empire Hotel and Country Club and lasted for about 20-30 minutes. Without checking my LCD screen on my camera as most of the shots were burst frames, I left the area. When i was processing the RAW images captured from the camera I realise there was one shot which had something appearing on the left side of the screen so I zoomed in to see what it was. I was shocked! In the image, the object seemed to be hovering above the water and it looks as if it&#39;s not too far away from us. Strangely...the object wasn&#39;t being seen with my naked eye when I was there. Thousands of people gathered around the same area to view the fireworks. If i were to see it , probably the others would have saw it too however it wasn&#39;t visible as it was quite dark from our view. My eye were also drawn towards the fireworks and the hotel so I didn&#39;t notice it as it seems like the object positioned itself at a darker area (can be seen in the photo using long exposure to capture the ambient).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The news had made frontpage in our local news paper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Link:  http://www.brunei-online.com/weekend/news/jan3h4.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Aircraft, we believe.  We have examined the photo, and we are quite certain that the anomalous object was an aircraft with strobe lights.  We have seen MANY such photos.  PD))<n>
