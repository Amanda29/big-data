I began watching the sky overhead at about 10 pm local time. During the next hour and 20 minutes, I saw three meteors streak overhead (two approximately east to west and one south to north) and three satellites cross the sky (two approximately west to east and one south to north). At 11:21 an object in the handle of the Big Dipper (near Alioth) grew in brightness, then winked out. It was not as bright as the object I saw the previous evening, but still brighter than any of the stars around it. It also seemed not to have the bluish colour to it, being more like the meteors I saw earlier. In fact, except that it was stationary in the sky, it mostly resembled a meteor by its colour and in the way it grew in brightness and dimmed suddenly. I continued watching the sky for about another 20 minutes but saw no other activity (not even satellites, meteors or aircraft).<n>

It had smaller white lights on each side, with color<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in the dark looking at the stars out of my bedroom window. The window faces directly West. Suddenly, right above my garage, an extremely bright white light hit me in the eyes, blinding me. At first I thought it was a helicopter looking for undocumented workers in the fields behind our house. I looked closer and realized that although this object was hovering, it was not like any chopper we usually see daily around here. It was about half the altitude of a normal chopper and it made no noise. It has one very large white light and two smaller ones on each side it. I got the impression of something sloping down to the lights, although I couldn&#39;t see any real form. I grabbed for my binoculars, only to remember that they were in the other room. I looked back out the window and noticed smaller lights directly below the large center one, except these were of various colors; red, blue, yellow and green. I then started to slowly move over the top of the house (from WWN to East). I ran to the kitchen window (about 23 seconds) and saw it from the rear about 2 miles past my house. It was a definite triangle of lights. I tried to count and I think it had 6 bright white lights on each side taper in to a series of colored blinking lights.  I watched it go due east for about 6 miles, stop make a hard right turn and take off south towards mexico. It was huge! I, of course, then found my camera a binoculars right there in the kitchen. I watched for at least 2 hrs. hoping it would return, but no luck.<n>

It lit the countryside with a glow that you could read a newspaper by. It looked very similar to an explosion on a massive scale. It appeared in the direction of the Yakima firing range but was to far up in the sky to appear to be from the military. There was no sound and it appeared very far away. Our possible explanation would be a meteror exploded while entering the atmoshphere or possibly a large satelite falling from orbit.<n>
7/31/00 22:00|Hopewell|VA|Fireball|3-5 secs|Large neon-green fireball, travelling parallel to I-295 (south) at 200 mph and parallel to ground, behind treetops, near Hopewell, VA|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16011.html|4|ndxe200007| Large neon-green fireball, travelling parallel to I-295 (south) at 200 mph and parallel to ground, behind treetops, near Hopewell, VA<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am resubmitting a report that I filed several weeks ago, since it is not yet posted on the website, and because I note that you are currently interested in sightings on July 31, 2000.  On the evening of July 31, 2000 I was travelling south on I295 between Richmond, VA and Petersburg, VA, with 1 passenger.  It was very dark and stormy and about 9 p.m..  The two of us observed what appeared to be a very large, neon-green fireball travelling south parallel to I295 at what appeared to be treetop level.  It was travelling faster than the highway traffic, probably at 200 miles per hour or so.  The lower third of it was hidden by the treetops.  It did not have a long tail, but could have had a very short tail.  Its surface appeared to have a lot of clear-colored small bubbles associated with it.  Its size was comparable to a lemon held at arm&#39;s length.  I thought it was a meteor at first.  After thinking about it for several months, I considered the possibility that it might be a UFO.  The reasons for this are as follows: 1) it was travelling parallel to the ground, not arcing down; 2) it did not have a well-defined tail; 3) it appeared very large, and appeared to be at a very low altitude.  I am a geologist (PhD) and I knew that if a bolide of this size and scale hit the earth, it would cause a catastrophic event.  I figured that astronomers would have noticed it and reported on it. I heard nothing reported. The alternative explanation is that we were looking at the base or side of a UFO.  Since I do not know if you received my last report, please notify me when you  receive this.  My passenger was a 10 year old boy.  If the object was a meteor, it was gargantuan in scale, and looked like a planet speeding past.  Near Richmond airport.<n>
7/31/00 21:00|Hopewell|VA|Fireball|3-5 secs|Two witnesses saw a huge neon-green fireball travelling parallel to the ground, behind treetops, near Richmond VA on I-295|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15761.html|5|ndxe200007| Two witnesses saw a huge neon-green fireball travelling parallel to the ground, behind treetops, near Richmond VA on I-295<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two witnesses in a car observed a large neon-green ball or fireball travelling at a high speed through the air.  The car was travelling on I-295 from Richmond, VA towards Petersburg, VA between 8:30 and 9:30 p.m.  It was extremely dark because of a storm.  I noted heat lightning.  The green ball followed a path that was parallel to I-295, parallel to our direction of travel (towards Petersburg), and parallel to the ground surface.  We could see about 2/3rds of the object behind the treetops adjacent to the highway.  I am a 46 year old female with a PhD in geology.  My passenger was a 10 year old Japanese American boy who shouted, &#34;Look, Godzilla&#34;, when we both saw the object.  My first impression was that it was a meteor, and looked like a speeding planet.  But it was travelling parallel to the ground.  Also, if a tail were present it was very small.  There could have been small bubble-like features close to the ball.<n>

Blue color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just past noon on July 31, 00 I saw an object that was shaped like a short torpedo or football shaped object flying South horizontally at a very high rate of speed. I was travelling east on South 260th which connects Highway 99 with Military Road South. I viewed this blue object as I came around the swerve in the road and looking straight at the Interstate 5 overpass. At first I thought this might be a remote airplane or toy of some type but dismissed it immediately due to the surrounding area being hilly. with tree&#39;s and brush. I knew almost immediately that I was witnessing something very special. This object if a toy would have to be self navigatable. It was about 3 1/2 feet long and the width was about 1 1/2 feet. I do not know how high the Interrstate 5 overpass is but I  think about 45-50 feet high. This object  was just below the concrete overpass.<n>

What makes this report-worthy was it&#39;s brightness and clearity ( it looked close) and the fact that it was seen from high in the sky to the horizon without loosing any intensity. A land impact of this object would not suprise me.<n>

The front is windowed with a slider door.  I was sitting in the living room looking toward lake when object appeared to my left (from North) following our shoreline, very slowly, at about eye level if I stood up.  It was totally silent as it went by.  It had red and sort of green lights, the rest was dark, but it appeared to be round, flat bottomed, with a raised center (judging by the light placement).  It seemed to be no more than 75 feet across.  I was mesmerized and didn&#39;t think to wake my husband until after it was gone.<n>

It looked like approx. 7-10 small round &#34;balls&#34;, all green and almost like a green line or &#34;string&#34; connecting them. It was very bright green and was descending rapidly toward the ground vertically w/ a little bit of a curve to the &#34;string&#34; .  It looked like it was &#34;crashing&#34;. It was heading down and a little to the right (south) of me. The sky was very dark &amp; there was some lightening, but this was definitely not lightening in shape or color. It looked like it was maybe 4-6 miles from me.<n>

As I was watching, a little to the left (I was facing south), near the constellation Hercules, it appeared that a star was growing brighter. Within about three seconds, this object became the brightest object in the sky, easily as bright as an aircraft landing light and many times brighter than any stars in view above, but with a bluish quality to it similar to the strobe lights used on communications towers. Then the light simply winked out. I made a note of the time, then watched the sky until about 22:45 before falling asleep. I also watched the sky in the area for satellites and aircraft but saw none. During the short period that the object flashed it appeared to be stationary. I tried to see if it might be a strobe from a passing aircraft, but I saw and heard none. It was also much brighter than any aircraft strobe I had seen previously. The object was astoundingly bright, even as I looked directly at it (I know how objects can appear brighter at night when caught out of the corner of your eye). The following evening, I attempted to see if it would occur again and have submitted a report for what I saw on the evening of July 31.<n>

EST I stepped out onto my balcony to get a last look of my view as I moved out of my apartment this evening. I happened to look up at the partially cloudy sky to get a look at some stars. I noticed that the first &#34;star&#34; that I looked at seemed to be moving from the Western Sky in a South/Southeastern direction at a slow steady pace. I first figured I was seeing a passing satellite. To my amazement this &#34;star&#34; stopped changed direction to direct South then back West before it started to circle, zig-zag then continue in it&#39;s original direction. This &#34;star&#34; did this several times(atleast 5 times) before I lost it in a passing cloud. I can only describe this object as a star as that was its exact appearence. It was as bright as a star in the big dipper(not as bright as Jupiter or the northern stars though). There was some city lights drowning out much of the star field so this object may have appeared brighter a few miles out of town. I would suspect that few people would&#39;ve not reported this unless they happened to be stargazing. Irredgardless, I just thought I would report this &#34;dancing star&#34;. Thanks!<n>

The sun had set and it was dusk. The back of my place looks out across a valley, with hills on the other side about as high as the one my home is on. I saw a small object make a straight line course down the valley, from the NE to the SW. It was below the tops of the hills on the other side of the valley. The object was very small, my initial impression was that it was a seagull, which I see a lot of around here, but this appeared to be traveling in a straight line, the altitude did not vary, it did not change course that I could see and it was much faster than a seagull. My impression was that it was closer to the other side of the valley than the side I was on. I can&#39;t say the object glowed or reflected the last of the daylight, but it appeard to be white. It did not appear to make a sound, but I-5 is nearby, and if the object were quiet, I could see how the noise from I-5 could drownd it out. The whole incident could not have taken 7 - 10 seconds. It was too fast and small to be a propellor driven airplane, obviously it was far too small, and also too quiet to be a jet plane, really too low to be any sort of plane, too quiet to be a helicopter, too fast and flying too straight to be a bird, going horizontal so it couldn&#39;t have been a balloon or meteorite, so, what was it? I&#39;m out of guesses. Professionally, I am a counselor by profession and have held an office manager position for three years as well as pursuing my professional practice.<n>

We had been watching quite a few &#34;shooting stars&#34; when a friend just stopped and said, &#34;Oh, my God&#34;. We all looked up and saw 10 &#34;stars&#34; moving together West-bound coming from the Atlantic Ocean at incredible speed. We all immediately saw them and began tracking them. they followed each other in a very tight group, and then suddenly burst into different directions. Several went below the light horizon for a while, but the others traced circular patterns in the sky. Thinkng they might be birds reflecting light, we broke out the binoculars and the telescope that we had, and through them we saw that they were too high and far to be birds, and that they were emitting their own light, not reflecting other light. They then rejoined and &#34;flew&#34; southward and disappeared. 10 minutes later they reappeared in the same place that they originally entered and broke into three groups-two groups of three and one group of four. They all traveled in a generally northern direction, but not all at the same time. after 15 more minutes of watching, only three were left visible. At 2:12 AM EST we retired for the evening having not seen them for a good 2o mibutes. i am curious as to if any other reports were made.<n>

There were 3 of us standing outside on the deck when my husband pointed to the sky and said, LOOK!  We all looked to the sky and saw a pink/red/white light attached to a very faint boomerang shaped object.  The object was hard to see, but the light was very bight.  The object was traveling at a fair pace, faster than an airplane and way faster than a bird and it seemed very high up in the sky (my thumb could cover the entire object).  It traveled straight west, It was moving quickly so I stepped off the deck and followed the object, then the object took a very pin point turn to the north, travel a few seconds in that direction, then another pin point turn the the east.  I followed the object back the east, the object went behind a tree and we never saw it reappear.  All of the witnesses are very upstanding citizens.  Actually, don&#39;t think I am crazy, but this is probably the 5th or 6th strange siting my husband and I have seen.  We have moved twice in the past 2 years, and they seem to follow us or something.  We live directly accross from an airport, so we all know this was not an airplane.  There was no noise, no flashing landing lights or anything. We ruled out a bird, because we did not see any flapping of wings.<n>

On the last night of the gig, the four other musicians that I lived with and I were on our balcony talking and looking at the stars. After a few minutes, I noticed that a group of the &#34;stars&#34; out over the ocean were moving. I told my friends, and we began to watch them. Suddenly, the entire group came from a very long distance to a position directly over us. They had to have covered 20 miles in a matter of seconds, and then came to a stop. They then split into 3 groups-3,3,1, and began swirling in circles. Then they spread out across our field of vision in the sky, and came back together suddenly. They then went back out over the ocean and came back again, then turning immediately north, and disappeared up the coastline. We were not under the influence of any alcohol or drugs, and the neighbors in the house next door witnessed the exact same event. During their pause over us, we took out a camera with a telescopic lens, and a set of binoculars. The objects were very high up and their exact shape was indistinguishable, but they were definitely illuminated, the light was generated by them and not a reflection of some other light source. I have played this gig once more since that time, but we were housed in a different location, and I did not see them again in the times I went out to watch. This could not have been a plane or any other normal flying machine-the speeds, sudden directional chages and lack of noise would cancel out planes.<n>

It moved from the position named above to overhead then about 45 degrees above wouth-southeast horizon in about 3 to 4 seconds. I was trying to get other family members attention to get additional witness&#39;, but another camper decided to shine a light in my eyes at that moment to see what I was talking about. By the time I could get any degree of night sight back there was nothing to see any longer. If you have any idea what this might have been that I saw please feel free to contact me, my curiousity is peaked. This was no aircraft, I could see aircraft in the area, and there is no comparison, there was no sound, though I feel it was very high I have no way of knowing how high it was.

I am in a rural area that is wooded, but I was standing in less wooded location when a bright light caught my eye.  I turned to see it, and it appeared to pass behind a big pine tree.  I couldn&#39;t tell how far away the object was, but it was traveling horizontal to the horizen and low in the sky.  It looked to be about the size of a pea and was round, glowing white-blue, and had a tail.  It made no noise.  It looked like it could be a  big meteorite, but I&#39;ve never seen a meteorite travel in a straight horizontal line.  After a few seconds, the light disappeared like it had been turned off.<n>

The &#39;object&#39;(for lack of a better word) appeared to be a sort of glowing gradient where the leading edge of the &#39;wing&#39; was a fairly deep orange, and the trailing edge seemed to be glowing orange-yellow, and may have been leaving an orange-yellow trail all along the trainling edge of the &#39;wing&#39; as it moved. The incident was entirely silent. There were planes in the air, but far off in a different quadrant of the sky; they had nothing to do with this object. The object appeared for about a second, long enough for me to alert my wife, but by the time she tried to see it, it was gone.<n>

It was still quite dark and my first glimpse was interrupted by one of the dogs.  I looked back at the object and it had moved.  I knew it wasn&#39;t a star.  I watched it for at least 5 seconds while it moved slowly north.  One second it was there then it was gone. It made no sound and there were no aircraft in the sky.  It was perfectly round.  The edges were very distinct.  It appeared to be a light, but it did not have a beam of light or any rays around it.  The color wasn&#39;t gold like glitter gold, but a muted golden color. This is the third sphere I&#39;ve seen.  The first one was in the fall of 1995.  That happened on a cloudy day and the globe/sphere was below the cloud deck.  It performed the typical slipping through the atmosphere with the zig zag motion of a saucer (if there is anything typical about a saucer).   I was on a hill and was a little above this object when I observed it around 7 pm. The second time I saw a sphere/globe was January 4, 1996.  I was watching for meteors because that is supposed to be a peak day for a meteor shower.  This one was exactly as the first description, except closer.  There was no tail and no flame. It was doing that slipping through the atmosphere, well air.  It wasn&#39;t that far away and again I wasn&#39;t looking up.  I was level with it. It did that zig zag movement,also.  At the time I thought it was just a strange meteor, because I didn&#39;t know better.  Soon afterwards I got online and began my own personal investigation of UFOs.  I soon learned that it wasn&#39;t a meteor. Since the recent sighting, I thought I should report what I&#39;ve seen.  It may coroborate someone else&#39;s sighting.  These separate sightings are not very important by themselves. There were no witnesses to any of these sightings.<n>

The single &#34;egg&#34; shaped light appeared ahead and about a 30 degree angle up. It was a very white light about 3 times as bright as anything else in the sky with a slight haze around it. It sat hanging in the sky for a couple of seconds and then made a rough Z pattern only at amazing speed. It went up and to the right and paused then down and to the left and paused and the up but more to the right this time, the it paused and went straight up and either went behide and clouds (there were a few clouds in the sky) or went dark.<n>

I was laying down on a bench in the backyard with my feet twards the west. I was looking through my binoculars approximately 15 degrees SW from the star Vega (My hobby is star gazing). Suddenly right through the center of my view though the binos, I saw what I thought was a large satellite. I followed the object to examine the details. There were 2 triangular shaped objects in formation one following the other. It crossed the sky in a steady pace. Much faster than a jet, but slower than a meteorite. What shocked me was that when it crossed a patch of clouds, it was on this side of the clouds! I could see its shape much clearer against the cloud. It had a dim orange-yellow glow twards the center and they were not more than 50 feet apart from each other. It countinued in a straight and steady course dead silent from south east twards the north west. It looked like two F-14 with the wings retracted. F-14 are loud. I waited for a sonic boom but heard nothing. After about 5 or 6 seconds I took the binoculars off of them I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. A lot of things crossed my mind as to what it May have been. From birds to fireballs. But birds don&#39;t glow and don&#39;t cruise at that speed. Plus, I know a bird when I see one. These were definite triangular shaped, no wings. Fireball or low flying meteors? But with no flash or tail, in formation, at a satellite&#39;s pace, under the clouds. The clouds were altocumulus. I looked at my watch and noted that it was 10:48pm Anybody else witness this? This was Very strange.<n>

Object was crystaline white and did not streak as much as simply vanish totally.  Far brighter white than any meteors I&#39;ve seen in the past; probably brighter than venus and did not seem to diminish in brightness before disappearing.  There were scattered clouds in that area of the sky.  Later the clouds parted and I estimate the location as just a little south of the tail of the big dipper.  It did not travel more than 5 degrees before vanishing.  Had in been a meteor, given the brillance (like a welders torch).  Had it been a meteor, I would  have expected it to continue on and reappear outside the area of scattered clouds and travelled several tens of degrees.<n>

Although I personally don&#39;t think that they are moving several hundred miles an hour they are going very fast. I have had my friends tell me about the same thing And upon observing these lights We have concluded it is not extraterestrial craft, It is our country&#39;s defenders practicing Arial combat ,Thats all.<n>

Starting in the North (looking towards Prescott area) and travelling NE towards the Harquahelas,  a series of 5 extremely bright amber lights appeared and disappeared, one at a time in a straight line with a very faint object in front of each.  Travelling several hundred miles an hour lasting about 8 seconds total.  A very faint object was seen just after the second light appeared that I followed with my eyes and a light would appear after an intervel. The lights would appear about a second apart and you could just see the object move between the appearances.  The object did not flicker nor blink like an aircraft...more like watching a satellite going over head but this was just above the horizon and faster than the commerical jets you can see.  No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the two observers, husband and wife, who have submitted these two reports from near Bouse, AZ.

I was looking east and it appeared to be about 10 miles away over the Apache Junction area. I had a video camera on a tripod near by so I started taping it again. The object is heading to the south or to the right on video. I lost it when it suddenly did an 80 degree turn downward and increased speed by 3x what it was just traveling. On the video it appears to be 2 objects close together with another object that is not lit up. This object is black and covers some of the Red UFO.

As the object past me and after about 4 minutes from the time I first saw it, an aircraft ( probably commercial ) came relatively close to the object. Soon after ( 15 or 20 seconds), the object seemed to dim, then brighten, speed up and quickly dissappear on the horizon E-NE of me. The characteristics of the object seemed almost identical to the brighter of the two objects observed and reported almost exactly 48 hours earlier.<n>

THE LIGHT MOVED TOWARD THE CARPORT AND THEN WENT OFF.  I HEARD NO NOISE OF ANY KIND TO SUGGEST THAT IT WAS A AIRPLANE OR HELICOPTER.  I LIVE IN THE COUNTRY SO ANY NOISE WOULD HAVE BEE APPARENT.  I THEN WALKED OUT INTO THE DRIVEWAY AND LOOKED AROUND THE SKY ABOUT 3 - 5 MINUTES LATER I HEARD A SONIC BOOM OFF IN THE DISTANCE.  WHETHER THAT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE LIGHT, I DON&#39;T KNOW.<n>

There was a round red light seemingly from just beyond the branches.  It lasted for a couple of seconds and went out.  I looked back down at my daughter and she said what was that?  She said that there was a bright blue light shining on my face,that scanned down me and back up and went out. The time we figured was 11:20. There was no sound, we went into the street to look, we saw two multi-colored lighted objects in the distance across the sky from each other.  My daughter said she could see a red light traveling from one to the other.  I started to tell a friend about this, and before I said when, he asked if it had happened Wednesday night.  He had seen a bright greenish white light streak across the sky and turn down to the ground going in the direction of my house.  He had noted the time to be 11:15, Wednesday, July 26. He lives approximately 3 miles away.<n>

This ball of light was half the size of the moon and located above the Big Dipper.  The object seemed stationary and there was no tail or streaking seen.  It looked to me like a giant explosion way out in space.  I contacted local news agencies with no one else reporting what I had.  I am not sure what it was that I saw, but it sure was excting to experience something so unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The description is somewhat reminiscent of the &#34;flash&#34; of an Iridium satellite, although Iridiums are not stationary.

I was outside my father&#39;s house with my step brother, brother, and grandfather. My step-brother was down by the lake while the rest of us were casually visiting about 50 yards away on the porch.  The silence of the night was broken by my step brother running up the hill from the lake. He told us to all look up in the sky pretty much strait out.  I looked and saw a sphere shaped object with many differntly colored rapidly flashing lights.  There was absolutely no noticable pattern to the flashing lights. The craft zipped back and forth in a zig zagging pattern at an uncomprehendable rate of speed. (it could not possibly have been a plane or a helicopter, it was moving way to fast!!!) After repeating this pattern for about 6 and a half minutes it stopped and hovered in the same spot for about another 3 minutes. A red ball of light was then lowered from the bottom of the craft and the craft repeated the zig zag pattern for another 7 minutes or so. The UFO then slowly made its way over to the rear left corner of the lake and hovered there for a couple of minutes. the craft then proceeded to drop a ball of light and the ball hit the ground and lit up the entire sky with bright flash. (I swear to god on all of this!!!) Throughout the entire account the craft did produce a sound that i or any member of my party could hear it was silent. The craft then proceeded to fly off to left more and I eventually lost sight as it flew by my house. I did not care to follow to the front of the house as I was pretty shaken by the entire expereience. The date my not be exact as this happened a long time ago but every thing I have stated here is absolutely true. The UFO was somewhat distant throughout the entire experience being as it was not a close encounter.<n>

As i spoke to my brother in law on the radio, I noticed a light or lighs rising over the forrrest, Estemated distance less than a mile away..It shot up in a verticle position at a great speed, Then suddenly stopped, Then it moved from side to side then up again and then droped down, Once again coming to a dead stop...It was about 200ft from the ground and there were a series of lights coming from it, yellow,orange,red...It must have been a cylinder type shape because the lights were stacked on top of eachother...i continued to stare at the light, because it felt so strange because where i was,no other lights are around...This location is LLANYBYDDER MOUNTAIN, JUST OUTSIDE THE COUNTY OF CARDIGANSHIRE MID WALES WHERE STRANGE THINGS HAVE HAPPENED LIKE THAT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS...All around the area.... As i continued to watch this, As iff someone closed the curtains in the object, The lights whent out...There was no sign after... There has been sightings around these parts for a while, And it is called the black triangle, And once again there is an airbase in aberporth.... I had again an experience in 1976 when i was young, Where i saw something very close, It was shiny after that i do not remember....but it was on the paper that 3 were sighted over the city of SWANSEA south wales,uk...If anyone has information on the following, I would like to know..<n>

7/25/00 21:57|Klamath Falls|OR|Light|5 minutes +|"Light" flew as wingman to commercial flight.|7/29/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13591.html|49|ndxe200007| &#34;Light&#34; flew as wingman to commercial flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Klamath Falls is a navagation point of a North/South Commercial Air traffic corridor. As such there is a large degree of air traffic regularly seen in this vicinity. There is a wide Military North/South military corridor begining about 45 miles to the east of here. Another N/S commercial flight path traverses Medford, Oregon to the west, approximately 55 air miles. Commercial aircraft was first noted directly over head at approximately 21:57 headed south at 180&#39;, with a bright &#34;light&#34; approximating the appearance of a satellite, with out any navigational lights, directly to the starboard side matching it&#39;s speed. If it is assumed that the commercial traffic was at 30,000 feet, than the object was approximately less than one mile from the aircraft. In lay terms, it was the distance of the width of your thumb held at arms length. It matched the flight path of the commercial until lost in the haze due to a forest fire to the south, at approximately 4 to 5 degrees in elevation, still on a 180&#39; path, at 22:02. Magnitude of the object did not diminish, except once, for less than a second, in which it did dim. It is difficult to imagine that this was a coincidence of a polar orbit satellite appearing to &#34;match&#34; the flight path of a commercial aircraft. The other witness was called out to view the object, but she is not trained in aerial observations.<n>

7/25/00 21:30|Las Vegas|NV|Light|15-20 minutes|Las Vegas Lights|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16196.html|51|ndxe200007| Las Vegas Lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t know of your existence until I just heard you on Art Bell&#39;s show on the night of his return to radio ...in fact, you are still on the air. I had never seen anything interesting in the night sky until the night of July 25, 2000. After this event I immediately typed up what I saw and sent a fax right off to Mike Seigal at Coast to Coast AM. As far as I know he never covered it ...and I don&#39;t know of anyone but the 3 of us who were present who saw this event. However, I thought you might like to add it to your records and perhaps someone else has sent an account of it to you as well. Here is the text that I typed: Attn: Mike It is now 10:25 pm (July 25, 2000) Pacific. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada and just less than an hour ago I was on the very south end of the valley looking north towards the Stratosphere Tower (a distance of 10-15 miles if I had to guess) ...showing a guest of mine from the East Coast a nice view of the Strip from a high elevation. There were three of us present and we noticed extremely bright glowing lights at approximately the level of the Tower, but well beyond it. You could see the lights of aircraft crossing the Las Vegas Valley, but these lights were 20-30 times brighter and stationary with a slight drift to the right (East). One of these lights dropped suddenly to the valley floor and disappeared. After several minutes the others flickered and faded as well. As soon as they were gone another set appeared at a much higher elevation ...in relation to the tower, almost twice as high. These kept fading after about five minutes and reappearing in sets of two and three ...only a single time was there only one light in the sky. I called a local television station, KLAS channel 8 and asked them if anyone else had reported this ...they said no, but said they&#39;d train their stationary cameras on it (in retrospect, I don&#39;t think they took what I was saying seriously). All the while the Vegas.com blimp, a tourist airship here in Las Vegas was in the sky and provided a good point of reference. They took off from the North Las Vegas airport, about 25 miles from where I was in the valley, but they were much smaller (the airship is lit from the interior and the size of the Goodyear Blimp) in relation to the size and brightness of the lights. The best analogy I can draw is to the Phoenix Lights incident of &#39;97 that I&#39;ve seen time and again on TV. Unfortunately I didn&#39;t have a camera, but this incident was far and away more interesting than the Phoenix one. I understand that some explanations there include military flares, and this could have been what I witnessed. However, some of the lights dropped all the way to the! Valley floor and I wouldn&#39;t have expected that to happen if military excercises were being conducted on the Nellis Range over the other side of the mountain range in the north part of the Valley. However, as I mentioned, these lights did not all descend in elevation ...what one would expect if they were flares attached to parachutes. I hope that someone captured this on video ...there must have been many eyewitnesses, including those in the blimp, in the airport tower, and elsewhere. I&#39;m also curious if this will be discussed on the 11 o&#39;clock news, but as I finish typing this it is now only 10:35 and being a listener from time to time of your show I thought that you might enjoy this bit of information. Please feel free to contact me. Best Regards, ((deleted)) XXXXXXX 702-XXX-XXXX<n>

The deck faces north to Polaris exactly.  I had lowered my binoculars to say something to my teenage son and was putting them back up to my eyes looking slightly northeast when a bright, tomato red object caught my eye.  I immediately looked through the binoculars and saw the object.  It was round and was stop sign red.  It looked as though it was &#34;lit&#34; somehow, like neon and divided on the surface (bottom?) into 3 or 4 slightly brighter, whiter (hotter?) areas.  Like a pie graph divided into fourths, with the center of each &#34;slice&#34; being whiter.  It moved fairly quickly to the east/northeast and was then lost to my view behind the 2 1/2 story roof of the house to the rear.  The object looked to be about the size of the ISS through binoculars--I have no way to judge how large or small that actually is or how high it was.<n>

Shortly after noticing the first object, my wife pointed out a second, stationary object at a high altitude.  This object appeared rectangular, and was formed by 2 large white lights with a single red light between the white lights.  This object remained stationary, though would disappear for approximately 20 or 30 seconds, then reappear in the same location.   Though the white wedged object was only seen for a few seconds, the 2nd object was seen for approximately 45 minutes as we continued southbound on state route 77.<n>

They were slow moving.  One light would go in and out and after about 8 minutes the one that was fading in and out dropped very rapidly while blinking on and off and disappeared below the treeline.  The other light stayed in the same area for several more minutes then blinked out.  Approximately 10 minutes later, there appeared to be what we thought were military palnes--4 in a row moving east to west in the area that the lights were.  It also appeared the the air traffic was re-routed as where the lights were observed is in the same area that the airplanes are routed to land at Sky Harbor Airport.<n>

Both settled apart from each other 30 degrees from the east horizon becoming indistingishable from the stars around and remained there for some time until contact ceased.<n>

It covered the whole sky!  Shortly thereafter, I started walking east and noticed 2 bright red lights hovering over the Eastern sky.  I live in the East Valley (Chandler, AZ) and under the flight path to low altitude approaches to Sky Harbor Airport, so I first thought it was a commercial aircraft, but quickly realized these two red lights were something unknown. As I watched the lights one of them blacked out for a couple of seconds, then reappeared.  Both still in the same spot.  From my position, these lights were east, northeast at approximately 50 to 60 degrees from the horizon. It did cross my mind these could be flares, but there is noway. Anyway, suddenly one of the red lights fell to the earth, leaving the other still suppended in its original position. At 2045 hours the remaining red light blacked out for good. We do have a National Guard Unit around the Papago Buttes, but this sighting was way east of there. Anyway, please let me know if you receive any information regarding this! ((name deleted))<n>

One object was slightly below cloud level and one, which appeared smaller, looked to be above the thin clouds. Both objects seemed to grow brighter from time to time and stay in formation as they moved across the sky. The sighting lasted 5-7 minutes with both objects keeping the same speed and distance as if flying in formation. The objects seemed to be going in a straight line until they were almost directly above us when the brighter of the two headed E/NE and increased its speed while the other continued directly east and began to fade. Noticed 5 possible military aircraft in formation at high altitude approx 20 min after the objects dissapeared.<n>

We ended outside with my father in law and my wife.  Hey was watering his lawn and she was out there smoking a Cig.  I walked out and looked up in the sky and off to the horizon I would say North East from the house&#39;s driveway there were to Red Laser looking light just hovering pulsing in the sky.  This was definately not a plane since it didn&#39;t have the tradional 3 light and no blinking.  It was way higher than the aircrafts since they were still passing trying to make there pass back to the airport to land.  It seemed the planes were not flying out as far as usually since the Red Dot  were out to the east and they were flying way lower than usually.  As we watched the Red DOTs they started to move from were they were stationed for about 5 minutes.  Moving slow in a south direction they seemed to keep the same distance and same speed really slow as they went a little further I would say almost directly East from where I was standing they then stopped and sat there and kept the same exact distance and the one on the right side started blinking in and out and a different rate of speed slowly and then fast and then it would be steady, it started again but there was no pattern to the lights and only the red laser color which they had been the entire time.  As we watched the one on the left hand side which had been a steady light the entire time start to move south then droped below  the other all of a sudden the left Red light started moving very fast as if directly below the other light.  All of a sudden as it kept moving south it shoot out to the right side and was gone I would say with in 3 seconds i was like Dam that was fast. All of a sudden the last light which was alway on the left had side started to fade out and up as if moving out toward space with in seconds they wer both gone.  As we looked around we oticed no Planes in the vecinity all of a sudden you see a fast jet going thru the sky as if from williams air force base.  at the rate it was going it wouldn&#39;t have a chance at catching the red light.  Then as if the coast was all clear or trying to cover something up air planes we flown in almost by the dozens.  This was an exciting but scary moment<n>

Objects were saucer shaped, hovering erratically (like an insect or kite) inclined at roughly a 30 degree angle.  The bottom of each u.f.o. was brightly lit with a white light.  The top or back of each object was adorned with different coloured lights: red dominating the center in a line, and blue at the tips accompanied by shades of yellow and green.  The lights would pulse in a seemingly random order, with the red lights flashing in syncronisation, or one at a time.  At times, an object would assume a smooth regular flight path to commence hovering at a new location.  Ascention and descention were rapid, and at equal velocities.  These objects were visible for approx. 2 hours, and made no audible sound.  It is probably worth mentioning that there was an unusually large meteor shower that night (1:30 a.m., July 25, 2000).<n>

It raises the spectre of whether the interesting video footage, taken from a helicopter to the west of Manhattan, might have been hoaxed by people in the television and entertainment industry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are not surprised that this might be the case.  When a dramatic event, the likes of which are shown in the video footage, actually occurs, NUFORC usually receives numerous telephone calls and written reports from other witnesses in the vicinity of the alleged incident.  In this instance, we received none.  Moreover, those in possession of the video tape did not contact us, either, or generate any type of formal, written report, which describes the alleged incident.  From our experience, this absence of information is more consistent with a hoax, than it is with a genuine sighting event.  PD))<n>

I then noticed that it was moving much to slow to be an airplane. I thought maybe a helicopter thats when it flew off. When i say it flew off i don&#39;t just mean that it flew away into the curviture of the night sky ,i mean that it went up and out into space very, very fast,almost instintaniously from its spot low in the sky to the stars. Now i am definately not a expert in aviation but for a plane to pause then almost leap into space and disappear into the darkness of space at that speed is impossible. It went straight up and out. I had never seen any thing like it in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will attempt to have the witness reconstruct the exact date, if possible.  PD))<n>

We were traveling at 0950 PM CST (2150) driving East on Highway 12 just past the junction on hwy 12 and Hwy. H, just after dark. This is 1/4 mile east of LeGrange WI..I noticed what appeared to be a flashing railroad type crossing light ahead about 300 feet...My wife noticed it too. Then we realized it was MUCH larger than a railroad gate, and that the rose/red/magenta lights were alternating position UP and DOWN rapidly.When the light on the right went up, the one on the left went down and alternated ...I then thought maybe this was a farm tractor with a strange light pattern, but we were traveling 50 miles per hour and we could NOT catch up to it...it appeared to be in the center of the road moving away from us.  Two cars were appraching from the opposite direction and they must have seen it too, because they swerved to avoid it and we had to drive onto the shoulder to keep from being hit by one of the cars. Note: The weirdest thing about this whole event was that, when the lights appeared to approach the oncoming cars, they stopped alternating and BECAME AIRBORNE, lifting off over a treeline to the left...they were headed in a northeast direction.My wife and I were stunned and we remain so. I was in the US Air Force for 20 years and I have NEVER seen ANYTHING like this. My wife said: &#34;Did you see THAT?&#34; when the lights became airborne...I continue to shiver and feel weird about this, as does my wife. I am STUNNED! We have NEVER seem anything like this! We are not kooks. We do not want any attention, but we had to report this to someone, because we are at wit&#39;s end trying to explain this. Please feel free to talk to my wife and myself about this, but please dont give out our names, as we dont want our friends and neighbors to think we are crazy. This DID happen, we just are shocked and stunned!<n>

A small twin-engined commuter aircraft passed overhead, on a generally southerly course, and turning east. I looked up to watch him, and at that time obsereved 3 bright lights bearing approximately 110-115 degrees. The angle of elevation to the horizontal was about 40-50 degrees. I called to my wife &amp; had her come outdoors, and had her bring a pair of binoculars with her.The objects were about the apparnt size of Jupiter or Saturn, when seen in the night sky. The were in an irregular formation, and showed no apparent movement. I cvould not see any detail, either naked eye or with the binoculars, nor could I estimate altitude. The number of objects increased to 12, and the slowly diminished , the last one disappeared about 10-12 min after I noticed the first one. I did not hear any sounds associated with the objects, and they did not show any apparent motion.The sky was clear (there were some cumulus clouds on the far eastern horizon)and the visibility unlimited, with little or no haze. I had a glass of wine at the time and did not have anything to drink prior to this event. Question: Is it possible that these were Bolides?<n>

About 60 degrees from plane, a silvery hockey puck shaped object hovering.  I got my son and wife after a few minutes, to also look, and it had become several objects together.  They were grouped in a &#34;geese&#34; formation.  It reminded me of one of the famous Mexico sightings that were caught on video tape.  They moved off rather slowly, to the northeast, then disappeared from sight. A few minutes later, two Air Force jets (DC-10s?)took off.  They &#34;seemed&#34; to be vectored in the direction that the objects were last seen by us.<n>

My family thinks I&#39;m nuts over this.  Well I now have proof thanks to my camcorder.  I&#39;ve seen, with my wife, three round like or football shaped like objects directly above our heads, taking their sweet time heading in formation straight across us ass the sun was going down.  It happened at my roof.  I walk my dogs to my roof and I am addicted to looking up a lot. I&#39;ve also seen silver objects with a little bit of black underneith them with no lights at broad daylight.  My cousin has aslo experienced those with me.  My uncle had wittnessed a brown one with me.  I admit when I see the silver or white ones I feel at peece but the brown ones give off many negative vibes towards me.  I get scared of them.  When they&#39;re directly above me they seem to change their shapes kind of like a blanket or liquid metal then they go back to their original shapes (round).  Finally on the 23rd of July of 2000 at 6pm. I was looking out my window, eight stories high and I spotted a black or brown spot in the sky.  I then knew exactly what it was so I grabbed my camcorder and ran fast to the roof.  The building security guard was up there so he had a chance to wittness it with me.  It seemed like a large ball holding a smaller one in one spot keeping it&#39;s balance as though it was being held by a string.  It was very windy so it couldn&#39;t have been a baloon and it was definitly not a plane.  There were two very close maybe attached to eachother by a long but short object.  It seemed to be observing everything around it, turning all around but still in the same spot.  The security guard ran downstairs but I kept on filming.  After about twenty minutes it started it&#39;s way towards one direction.  The shape then looked round or like a lightbulb.  When it was gone another popped up within a minute at the same spot that I spotted it at first.  I thought maybe it was the same one or another, I was too startled at this point to even think. It ! seemed t o be making it&#39;s way towards me giving off a tapping sound as though someone was tapping on metal as it got closer to me it seemed like a light bulb black or charcoal gray.  I got too scared and started making my way towards the exit.  It then started moving away quickly and left  towards the same direction the last one left.  Then about five minutes later a third one just appeared behind me, going around me heading towards the same direction the others left.  It seemed to have been closer to the buildings behind me than an airplane that had passed right above it.  It&#39;s on the film when I said, &#34;watch it disapear and another will pop up again,&#34; and so I was right the fourth had showed up at the same spot the first two did and left very quickly towards the same direction again.  This is no supprise to me.  They say you only see this stuff at farms but I do spend a lot of times on roofs.  People in the city do not look up at the skies very often. They wouldn&#39;t even think we would get something like these sightings but I do got it on film now with four wittnesses. So, who ever said aliens wouldn&#39;t visit the city &gt;&gt;  huh?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken briefly over the telephone with the individual who submitted the report.

At first I thought they were kites. After realizing how high up in the sky they were, I then thought they might be hot air baloons. One was shaped like a cigar and the other one like a snake. Neither of the objects were moving but were not close together. Stopping to look at the objects we noticed the cigar shaped one started to teeter totter. Both objects then started to travel to the west. I immediately called my brother and had him go outside to see if he could get a better look at them. He definitely could see them so we went to his house. Both objects stopped traveling again. The snake shaped object changed into a ball shape and then disappeared. The cigar shaped object stayed in place then started changing color. It changed from the original brown/black color to silver, blue, red, white, and then back to brown/black. It seemed to get bigger as if coming closer toward us. It then changed shape, zoomed in like it was being squished, and then zoomed out to it&#39;s cigar shape. It then turned and started traveling west a short distance, stopped, turned again and started traveling east a short distance, and stopped again. It then started rising up in to the clouds then came back out of the clouds. The sky was pretty clear except for a few clouds here and there. It then started traveling south for a short distance then went straight up unitl it was a pin dot. Looking through binoculars, we were able to find it for just a moment. The shape and color had changed again. It was now a very long cigar shape and was now red and white alternating stripes. At no time did either object make any sounds. We never saw the snake shaped object again and never saw the cigar shaped one either after that. My brother and I have witnessed UFOs and cattle mutilations before. We have also had huge circular burn marks in our fields at our farm many years ago. So we continue to look up at the skies. We are near an international airport so see planes when they are in their landing pattern. In relation to an airplane in the sky at when it comes in, both objects were at least 3 times the size in length and  probably 2 times the width.<n>

A circle conected by a line that connects on the other end with another circle... appears to be spinning.

It was enormous in size and was below the stars. It had multi-illumanated panels. The panels were giving off shapes and colors unlike anything I have ever scene. We believe it was a satellite though when researching it we turned up nothing. The craft made rotations around the globe. Every 11 1/2 minutes approximatley. I thought it must be some sort of satellite. No way! It was either a dozen satellites or something moving faster around the globe than anything ever recorded.

The length of the fireball was also consistent with the length of the big dipper.  The firebeall moved very slowly compared to a shooting star and had a very long and very bright tail behind it. It is hard to judge the distance it was away from mynlocation, but I heard no sound nor anything that would indicate impact near my location.

I go on Monday to Atlanta and return generally on Friday evening from Atlanta to D.C. On July 21st at or near 18:15PM EST I was riding in first class on Delta flight 1402 (757 service) in seat 3C (window) on the right side of the aircraft.  It was very cloudy most of the way and the aircraft was flying around a large thunderhead. The aircraft was flying at 31,000 feet at around mach .84 (520Mph or so).. the pilot announced this. I was looking out the window watching the massive thunderheads roll by. I noticed a grey metallic triangular shape hovering inside a thunderhead that had a lot of lightening activity.  The pilot was giving this cloud formation a relatively wide birth and the cloud formation was about 500 meters to the right of the aircraft.  It was quite bumpy and the captain issued a seatbelt warning for turbulence in the area. I kept watching the unidentified aircraft .. trying to determine if it was a ballon cage, a weather balloon, or some other known aircraft.  I could not recognize what it was .. nor am I familiar with an aircraft that can hover at 31,000 feet inside a very active thunderhead without grave risk. I stood up to see if anyone else was noticing what I saw and nobody was looking out the window.  Note that there were no blinking lights on the aircraft though it was quite visible if you were looking below the airplane and to the right just inside the thunderhead. I never said anything to anyone .. though I do know the co-pilot quite well.  I fly on her route very often so we always say hello.  I have been thinking about asking her about this event when I next run into her.  Otherwise .. I have kept my mouth shut because most people just think you are wacky when you say you&#39;ve seen something unidentifiable in the sky. As an Engineer I live in the world of the rational.  Technologically we have a long way to go and there is a great deal of innovation and secret activity at both commercial and governmental facilities.  I would never.. ever just assume this was an extra terrestrial space craft (it was too small for one thing) .. my view was that it was about the size of a 737 aircraft or smaller. Anyway .. thats my UFO sighting. Nothing glamerous .. but definately something outside my experience.  I do have a very strong interest in both commercial and military aircraft (historical and in development) and this wasn&#39;t something I was familiar with. Thanks ((name deleted))<n>

At first I thought it was a helicopter, but I did not hear any noise. I continued to watch the object and it appeared to be shaped some what like a three leaf clover, as I was watching it, the object appeared to rotate a quarter of a turn every once in a while it also appeared to have some type of visual disturbance around it, like heat waves or a mirage. I continued to watch it and it started to accend, as it was accending it did not appear like the three leaf clover shape, but rather just a round object. it continued to rise into the sky until I could not percieve it any longer.<n>

There were blue flashing lights all round the car - the lights were in triangular shape when they hit the ground (i think) there was probably 100 individual lights - they were flashing. There was no sound when it arrived so i didnt realise at first what was going on. Then the whole thing moved off making a slight high pitched screach and a big bass rumble - almost like it was a tank moving. The craft was no more than 100 feet above me. It moved relatively slowly - i panicked to get out of the area in the car. It flew right across the valley (flying over the reservoir i was next to). I drove along the road at the side of the reservoir because it was the only way out - hence, i followed the craft until it flew out of sight - the whole sighting may have been 3 minutes - who knows? I was petrified. The craft was disc/saucerr shaped and had lights all round the centre of it - probably 100 lights round the edge of it. I only heard a sound from it as it movwed from my car.

There is a grocery store hooked to a chain of other stores in the shape of an L. In the corner of the plaza is a resturaunt called the Hot Wok Cafe.  I was walking through the parking lot towards the Hot Wok cafe which means that I was walking towards the Northwest, just before I got to the resturaunt I looked just above the roofline of the plaza and saw perhaps a few hundred feet above the ground  maybe two or three hundred feet away what looked like a plastic bag being carried around by the wind. The first thing to come to mind was a scene in a movie called American Beauty that focused on a plastic bag dancing in the wind that seemed to have a life of it&#39;s own.  I thought it was interesting that a plastic bag could be carried so far in the air even though I could not really tell if it was actually a plastic bag or not, ot only behaved like a plastic bag being spun and carried slightly back and forth in the air.  I was about to dismiss the sight alltogether since I was meeting a friend in the resturaunt and did not want to keep them waiting when I realized that this &#34;bag&#34; had pretty much stayed in a very small area.  If it was a bag then the wind that kept the bag in the air also caused it to flutter in float in the same spot for about three minutes.  At this time I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it, I had to see it either fall or flutter away but it stayed in pretty much the exact spot. After a couple of minutes I decided I need to go into the resturaunt and meet my friend, nothing was happening with the &#34;bag&#34; and I only had an hour for lunch.  I went in and looked around and saw that I had been stood up, or my friend had not arrived yet so I ran back into the parking lot and resumed my examination of this object in the sky that was still there in the same spot, fluttering in the exact same manner. Only now there was a small, fuzzy, light colored sspherical object right next to it.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me since I don&#39;t have the best eyesight in the world and I have to stare at a computer screen all day.  I looked away and looked back again and the little dot was still there right next to the &#34;bag&#34;.  I watched for maybe about three or four minutes and noticed that the new object, the &#34;dot&#34; was very slowly moving out of sight.  It took about a minute before I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  The &#34;bag&#34; remained in the same place.  I watched maybe anothe rminute and decided to inquire in the resturaunt if there had been anyone in there within the past 30 minutes meeting the description of my friend.  The attendant at the front said no so I gave up and decided to get some cheaper food across the parking lot and walked back out.  I looked into the sky again and saw that the object was gone.  I scanned the sky and saw nothing else.  This occured on what I remember to be a clear and hot day.  I would be very interested to read reports from any other witnesses that might have seen something similar in the same area that same day and time.<n>
7/20/00 23:30|Ocean Parkway|NY|Chevron|00:01:30|Lighted red Chevron, meneuvering rapidly newar Atlantic Ocean, on Southern side of Ocean Parkway, Long Island.|7/29/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13571.html|92|ndxe200007| Lighted red Chevron, meneuvering rapidly newar Atlantic Ocean, on Southern side of Ocean Parkway, Long Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early in the evening on July 20th, I was traveling with a friend Eastbound on Ocean Parkway, Long Island. Coincidentally, we were on our way to Robert Moses State Park for a sky observation session. The Southern side of Ocean Parkway faces the Atlantic Ocean, consisting of a relatively small amount of undeveloped land. We had just passed a sign stating &#34;Turtle Nesting Area next 6 miles.&#34; The beaches in the area are known for bird and animal nesting. Following, however, were a mass amount of &#34;Do Not Enter&#34; and &#34;No Stopping&#34; signs. Not unusual, but in a mass quantity for such a small area. As we continued, we noticed unmarked, darkly colored helicopters in the area, hovering over the Southern side near the ocean. It was about 20:00, and we assumed the helicopters were watching traffic conditions. Although, it was rather late for rush hour, and they displayed no markings. After leaving the observation session, we traveled Westbound on Ocean Parkway. As we approached the Jones Beach area, we noticed a small red object on the Southern side of the parkway. It appeared as a glowing red Chevron. The ends were a darker red, but the center was lit up as though there were a bright white bulb inside. I had no perspective relating to the height of the object. It appeared as though it could be very small, about 15 feet above the ground. However, it could have been further out, possibly above the ocean, causing it to look small from our standpoint. We pulled the car over to the side of the road. As we watched, the object moved almost like a kite. It moved back and forth rapidly over a small area, with no apparent travel direction. The object then dropped a white glowing bulb-like object, and continued to glow red, but duller. Shortly after, the object decsended, or fell, out of the air. The event lasted for a minute and a half, which is when we continued travel down the road. We decided to turn around and look for any other activity. We took the next U-turn to find a car pulled over on the Southern side of the parkway, facing East. There was a man inside, and he watched us as we passed him by. He didn&#39;t seem to be doing anything that would warrant pulling over. There was no interior light on, no ciggarette, no tire changing, no other passenger. He was gone the next time we drove by. After a couple of times passing the event area, we decided to head home. On our way, we saw many airplanes overhead. We looked carefully to make sure they weren&#39;t anything else. One such craft caught our attention. It had no obvious shape, as it was rather dark. We were travelling west on Ocean Parkway, and it appeared to be hovering, and moving in a general Southern direction. We would have assumed it to be a plane, but it would move, then hover, then change directions in a way that a regular plane would not be able to maneuver. Some information about the observers: I have never seen, or claimed to have seen a &#39;ufo&#39; before this account. That&#39;s not to say that I don&#39;t believe. I do, but if I see something unusual, I tend to force myself to believe something for the sake of being able to say I&#39;ve seen something. When I saw the helicopters, I didn&#39;t think much of it. When I saw the red object, I assumed it to be some kind of toy. Maybe a lit-up toy plane, or some kind of light-up kite. When the object fell out of it, I thought maybe that a light bulb fell out of the toy, so the user brought the toy down to fix it. When I saw the strange man, I figured he was pulled over for a reason. When I finally saw the last strange flying object, I decided there was something wrong. Taken separately, the occurences can be somewhat normal. Howver, when I put them together, the results fit together in a strange way, and suggest some abnormal events.<n>

As I am not familiar with this area, I can&#39;t say which direction I was facing when I spotted a &#39;star&#39; moving at a steady pace in a straight horizontal line.  I watched the light move, thinking it was simply a plane when it disappeared from view, as if it went behind a door.  There were no clouds visable and many &#39;real&#39; stars were shining brightly in the area where this light disappeared.  In order to give the best indication of direction,  the big dipper was slightly behind my left shoulder as I watched the light. I&#39;d be interested in finding out if it was a satellite or plane.<n>

I didn&#39;t quite believe him until a few seconds later he came inside and dragged me out. I couldn&#39;t tell exatly how many lights where on it, but there appeared to be 3 in a triangular shape in the darkest yellow I have ever seen on an aircraft. It didn&#39;t appear to be moving and my other brother (age 18) got our telescope. As he was gone I watched the object move quickly to the left behind some trees. It didn&#39;t dart across very fast but moved a lot faster than any plane I had seen before, and it had done this after not moving for quite a while. When my brother came out we could barely make it out behind the trees. It was then that we noticed another object looking like the other that was not there just a second before. We weren&#39;t looking when it appeared but it must have moved very fast to its position as 3 of us were watching the skies. We ran down our driveway with the telescope so we could see behind the trees and get a good look at the objects, but once we got down, they were no where to be found. We waiting for about 40 minutes but there were no signs of any others. It was then that I came in I searched for a UFO Reporting Center.<n>

The object sat for several minutes, then moved toward the east, where it sat a few more minutes before disappearing. The red light was definitely sitting still in the sky for a time because its later movement was obvious.<n>

7/20/00 21:30|Deming|NM|Unknown|1 minute|Huge beam of light comes from sky, no craft of any kind visible that could produce it.|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90364.html|98|ndxe200007| Huge beam of light comes from sky, no craft of any kind visible that could produce it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is just as important about this encounter is not only what the three winesses saw but what we did not see, please bare with me. I was visiting friends who were staying at Rockhound State park in Deming NM. The night was clear, slightly hazy, and not dark but dusk. The couple I was visiting and I were outside, and I was chatting with one of my friends while her husband stood close by looking out toward the city of Deming as we were talking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly my friend whom I was not conversing with called out &amp;quot;what is that?&amp;quot; at which point the two of turned to look in his direction, at which time we observed a huge beam of light coming down from the sky not up as one would expect. Yes it was coming down! There was an obvious point of origin, but no visible craft of any kind was observed that could produce the light. There was no airplanes, helicopters, hot air ballons ect that could be seen only a very translucent whispy small cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would describe the light as being orangish yellow in color, very intense, and wide. Its hard to estimate the width of the beam but it was easily as wide as any spotlight I&#39;ve ever seen. The light originated from an elevation of approx 1000 to 1500 ft, again hard to determine exactly. What was just as strange is the light just slowly fizzled out, not at all like a light switch that had been turned off but just fadded away until it was no longer visible.   I have had several other experiences in my lifetime but this one is by far the most unusual and I believe unique.<n>

This rock shaped craft moved slowly across the sky.  It had the texture of a rock.  It had three rows of black windows on it.  It was making no sounds or emitting no light.  After about four minutes of watching it, a door like thing on the back of it opened up and a much smaller rock textured craft came out of the big one.  The smaller one had only one large black window on the front of it.  They slowly flew together for about twenty seconds and then zipped off extremely fast.  All four of couldn&#39;t believe what we had just witnessed.  This was the first UFO I have ever witnessed.  Since then I have seen many more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date was approximate.<n>
7/20/00 21:00|South Padre Island|TX|Oval|8 seconds|Bright amber light, very high speed, no sound or trail, east to west over Padre Island, summer 2000.|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81076.html|100|ndxe200007| Bright amber light, very high speed, no sound or trail, east to west over Padre Island, summer 2000.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Summer of 2000, no exact date recalled.  We were a small crew of contract Audio/video design/installers working at the new Brownsville Federal Courthouse.  The crew consisted of Northern Alabama, Southern West Virginia working class, slightly technical males.  I was a degreed, technically savvy programmer in charge of the crew.  I have had a lifelong interest in UFO’s but remain a skeptic of extraterrestrial explanations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were staying at a beachfront hotel on South Padre Island.   While having cocktails on the surf-side deck after sundown I was showing the guys how to spot orbiting satellites.  The night was clear and still.  Satellites were easy to spot as the night was young.  They were surprised it could be done with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly one of the guys asked me if what he had spotted was a satellite.  What he had spotted was an amber light in the shape of an oval (lozenge) flying from the gulf toward land.  We were sitting facing the Gulf almost due east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first saw it about 30° to my left (facing east) and 40° from water horizon.  The light was so clear and present I first thought it may be a streetlight reflecting off of the breast of a seagull.  The direction appeared to be slightly northwest in a straight trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object continued it was temporarily out of sight by other hotels as it crossed over the coastline.  The distance then seemed more apparent.  It was at least many miles away with no trail or sound or sonic boom.  The bright amber color was uniform and constant.  While the altitude seemed no more than 35° from horizon from our standpoint, it could have been at any altitude depending on the distance from us.  What makes this exceptional in my opinion is the fact that it crossed 45° of my visual in about 8 seconds at a minimum of 5 or more miles distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came in and was first spotted out over the Gulf of Mexico, had passed to the left of us and continued on to the back of us in 8 seconds.  Later looking at a national map and just estimating locations and observed directions, it seemed to be on a path that would have passed over Del Rio, TX.  And if continued, on toward Southern California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guestimated the speed to be from 5,000 to 15,000 miles per hour depending on estimated distances and altitudes combined with the 8 second time interval and the 90° beginning and end of the sighting.  I personally think it was a military device.<n>

It was over Charlie Bickford&#39;s field.  She was driving and says she never saw anything like it.  Then suddenly if completely surrounded her car.  She was crying and shaking and thought she was going to die.  When she got home, she couldn&#39;t find her housekey, and rang the bell incessantly for her mom to get up and open the door.  I spoke to her mom, who informed me that her daughter was shaking and crying.  (Her mom has to work at 7 in the morning, and this kid would never wake up her mom for no reason!

7/19/00 19:00|Venice|CA|Cigar|3 minutes|A single, silent, white, cigar-shaped craft was sighted in a clear sky, one hour before sunset.|7/23/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13525.html|108|ndxe200007| A single, silent, white, cigar-shaped craft was sighted in a clear sky, one hour before sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A single, silent, cigar-shaped craft; white in color; was sighted in a clear sky, about an hour before sunset, by myself and 3 additional pedestrians (2 adults and 1 child). We were all walking near my apartment building which is located close to the intersection of Lincoln Boulevard and Venice Boulevard. I had been reaching up at near arm&#39;s length to pet the neighbor&#39;s usually docile cat, which was astride the top of the brick wall surrounding their property; and so, I had been looking up when I first noticed the object in the SW sky. (About a minute into the sighting, the cat &#39;spooked&#34; and abandoned both his bowl of food and his place on top of the wall.) The UFO continued to travel at a steady rate of speed, from the SW to the NE corners of the sky, until it was finally too far away to be visible to the naked eye. The total observation time was approx. 3 &amp; 1/2 minutes. When the object reached what appeared to be the closest point overhead, it looked like it was about two inches in length, as judged by comparing it to my outstretched hand. Clearly, the object was reflecting the sunlight, as if from a white painted surface.  It did not appear to emit any additional light of its own, however; what looked like a very thin, spherically shaped and almost completely transparent cloud, halo or mist, seemed to cling to the object. This &#34;mist&#34; seemed to be fanned by the atmosphere as the object passed overhead. The object was low enough in altitude, (perhaps 3000 to 5000 feet) so that it DEFINITELY was not a likely to have been any type of conventional aircraft.  It looked like a missle, but it&#39;s speed was far too slow for that, and the object made no sound whatsoever.  A missle in flight, or a helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft this low would have made noise! The object was close enough and the sky was clear enough to recognize  it for exactly what it was - unidentified. - I clearly observed the wings of a similar sized fixed-wing aircraft (commercial jet airliner) which flew overhead about two minutes after the sighting of the UFO began. 	It was plainly evident that the UFO, by comparison, HAD NO WINGS, ROTORS, MISSLE EXHAUST, ETC., of any kind. There was no aerodynamic tapering of the front of the object, such as would be expected to be found on a missle. Both the bow and stern of the object were flat, like a cigar that is cut straight on both ends. 	A man and his little boy approached, about a minute into the sighting.  I pointed the object out to them, and the man immediately exclaimed, &#34;Hey, that&#39;s a UFO!&#34;  A man walking across the street overheard our conversation and looked up also, saying, &#34;Wow! - what the hell is THAT thing?&#34; 	The four of us stopped and watched the object for about 2 &amp; 1/2 more minutes, when it seemed to noticeably speed up during the last 30 seconds or so of its remaining, observable flight path, until it had traveled too far into the NE horizon to remain visible to the unaided eye. Up until that point, the object traveled at a slow, steady speed, in a perfectly straight line. 	Afterwards, I called KNXT news radio to inquire if anyone else had reported a sighting of the object. The reporter told me no, but that earlier in the day (at 13:09 HRS, PDT), there had been a missle test launched from Vanderberg AFB. Obviously, this missle test is NOT what WE saw - we observed the UFO around 1900 HRS, PTD; about 6 hours AFTER the Vandenberg launch!<n>

The date of the incident was July 19, 2000 around 1:00 PM. My self and an accompanied employee stopped at our 1 O&#39;clock appointment on Robinson Street in Central El Paso. My employee and I approached the front door of the residence when he noticed up in the sky next to the sun a triangular formation of three spherical dots. We stood there in auh and wondered what they were. The customer of ours answered the door to greet us. She wondered what it was we were looking at so she looked up too. Her gesture was, &#34;maybe they are Harrier Jet planes Hovering&#34;. In response I told her, &#34;Yeah, but where are the wings&#34;. These dots just hovered in that triangular formation without moving for about 10 mins. My employee went inside to see what it was she needed and I stayed there looking at them. After those 10 minutes past, there was a first visible sign of movement. The dot north of the triangular formation moved through the formation in a southeasterly direction and did not stopped until all three dots were in a single line formation. There were two dots close to one another still in their orignal positions and the third dot which had moved southeastern was further in distance from the other two. I could not believe what I was seeing. I then went inside the home to help my employee with the work. I wondered what it was I was seeing and remebered thinking to myself, &#34;is this what I think they are&#34;. I went to the back yard of the house and looked up in the sky. The two dots that were next to each other were gone and the third dot in the south was still there. But the more I looked at it, it seemed to brighten up as the powerful reflection from the sun was bouncing off of it silvery in color. It almost seemed to grow in size because of the expansion of the reflection of light. I know El Paso fairly well. I&#39;ve lived here all my life. The path that the dot had taken southeasterly was in the direction towards lower southeast El Paso. I figured that the dot maybe ! was hovering between 15,000-to 30,000 feet above the ground. Because there patches of clouds in the vicnity of the dot. The direction I was looking in was towards southeast El Paso where Zaragosa Drive is, which is about 20 miles from where I was. That&#39;s about the distance the UFO was from me, I suppose. I stood there for about 15 minutes, after that I went inside through the house to go out the front door to our service vehicle. My employee was in the back of our truck changing the locks. I looked towards the southeastern sky again and notice the dot was gone. The way El Paso is divided is like any other city. We have sections like central, west, east and northeast. The very last tip of the Rocky Mountain chain stops in Central El Paso. The mountain divides the city in two major halves east and west. From there you get the rest of the sections here in El Paso I mentioned. Well, by now I was looking in all directions at the sky and could not see a thing. My employee asked me, &#34;what was that&#34;. I told him joking &#34;maybe they were UFO&#39;s&#34;. He laughed and so did I. We continued to work. The house faced south into Mexico and we had backed the truck in to have better access from the house. My employee was changing the locks and I was standing outside the truck with my back to the north. My employee looked over to me and then he noticed a dot moving from west to east from the north slowly under a cloud that was low in altitude. He screamed to me to look. I saw the dot moving in that direction and as it reached the mountain it just suddenly turned south, traveled a small distance and stopped below another dot we had not noticed was there. I thought, these cannot possibly be balloons because there was stiff breeze west to east that was moving through El Paso. Only something with some type of propoltion can change directions like that. Looking at the two dots they seemed to be getting smaller, both of them at the same time, which meant they were traveling upward towards space. Eventually they faded out into the blue! atmosphere. After that, all of a sudden, in the same path, position and direction, maybe atltitude west to east from the north a dot was traveling again. This time it went straight over the mountain to the east and disappeared. By this time I was feeling previledge at what I was witnessing. Hard to believe, Yes, but not impossible. As we were trying to finish that job I called my uncle and told him what I was seeing. He was shocked. At that same time I looked up in the sky, because a large circular cloud covered the sun. An aurora of light on the egde of cloud emitted. If you ever seen a desert sky during the summer, the sky is very bright and hard to look up without squinting. At the northern edge of the cloud two dots appeared and stayed a certain distance from the cloud. As the cloud moved east, so did the the two dots. They seemed to dance with the cloud, but at the same time the distance between tehmselves and the cloud never changed. If the cloud slowly rotated, so did they. This cloud as it was moving still covered the sun. I was still on the phone with my uncle telling him to look up in the sky towards that cloud where the sun was. I guess where he was he could see the dots. Anyways, when the sun was about to pierce out the egde of the cloud the most northern of the two dots seemed to have changed shape as it moved south above and over the cloud. It looked as if it were tumlbing. I could see this tumbling motion because of the reflection of the sunlight from it. Then, as it reached the south side of cloud still tumbling, it literally vanished from my eyes. I did not see it fly away up, down or sideways. It just vanished. We finally finished the job and traveled to another job site. As we were driving down the road from where we were, I could still see those dots traveling in all directions. I was dismayed and disarrayed but, I felt wonderful and previledged to have witnessed the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life (other than my child being born). Before this incident I always looke! d up in the sky, not because I was trying to find UFO&#39;s, but because I love jets. I never stop looking up, but now I know what to look for and where. The reason I say this, is because I have seen on eight different occasions after that day, the spherical type of UFO phenomenon. How beautiful!!<n>

7/18/00 11:35|Huntsville|AL|Circle|4 minutes|I watched the object from my front yard as it changed size, shape, direction, speed and finally disapeared.|8/5/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13640.html|114|ndxe200007| I watched the object from my front yard as it changed size, shape, direction, speed and finally disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: On Tuesday July 18, 2000 at about 11:35 p.m. I stepped out my front door and onto my front poarch to smoke a ciggarette. It was a clear night and you could see all the stars, so I stepped off my poarch and into my front yard to look at the stars, when I turned and faced the house, (looking East N.E.), I noticed 4 stars together.  As I started to look to my left I noticed that one of the 4 stars appeared to be growing in size and changing color, but it was stationary.  The color was very similar to that of the planet Mars as observed from the ground at night.  I simply thought that what I was seeing was simply a planet or twinkling star, that is when I glanced back at the other 3 stars in the group and noticed that this &#34;object&#34; was now 2-3 times larger than the stars that it was next to and had completely change color from a white &#34;star&#34; color/appearance to an orange/yellow color.  The &#34;object&#34; began to suddenly move to my left in a straight line paralell to the horizon.  It moved at a rate of speed like that of an airplane for about 10 seconds and then stopped in the center of the star group.  It stayed stationary and both its size and color returned to that similar to the stars around it.  It remained stationary in the star group for about 30 seconds and then it changed both size and color again and began to move to my lower left (at a 45 degree angle to the horizon).  At this point it change shape from a circlular appearance to an elongated appearance, but its speed actually slowed until it pasted the star group that I was using as a reference point.  Once past the stars it increased speed and made a sudden change in direction to my upper left, (at a 45 degree angle to the horizon in an upward direction). At this point the suddenly disappeared.  There were no visible clouds in the sky.  I first suspected a planet, as I said, but ruled it out with movement.  I then suspected a satelite until the object stopped moving the first time.  After the shift to the lower left and both color and shape change I suspected a shooting star, but was completely surprised when it changed direction and moved in an uppward direction and disapeared.  I suspected that maybe it might be a test of some type from Redstone Arsenal here in town, but after realizing that it was in the opposite direction, I gave up on ideas. Can you help?  What is this or am I just crazy and seeing things. Contact: ((personal data deleted))<n>

The lights did not blink. No other lights on object. Object moving with one light forward and two corner lights in back. Could not see a fuselage or wings. Sound of some type of propulsion could be heard, but it was very muffled sounding. Did not sound like jets that go over our house often, and was not nearly as loud as the ones that would be 2000-3000 ft altitude.  If it was a regular jet passenger plane, judging by what we saw, it would have been flying at about 1000 feet or lower by the relative distance between the the three points where the white/red lights were. Craft not moving very fast. My wife saw it first. Said &#34;look at that, John&#34;. She noticed it through our trees coming toward us, NW to SE direction. I looked up, and could see it through the trees, coming toward us, and I then moved in the direction where I could get a better view.  The speed of the craft was very slow, that if it was a jet aircraft, it would not be doing any faster than 50 mph, relative to the altitude it appeared to be at. (We also see the police helicopter go over our house often, and I&#39;ve seen it go over or by us much quicker than this total sighting took.) We were just on our way to go for a drive with our two great nieces. They had already gotten into the car in the garage when my wife first noticed this sighting. I called to them to come see it after I first saw it.  They didn&#39;t move fast (the kids), and I wanted them to see it, too.  But, they still climbed out of the back seat of the car, and the car is a two door - that when they got to the driveway at least 30 or more seconds after the craft was first noticed, they could still see it before it went over the trees to our SE. I would not report this, except I can not explain this sighting as a normal aircraft because: (1) the sound was too quiet for most jets that have passed over our house, (2) the wingspan, or distance between the corners of the triangle, would have made the craft size very large even for a 747, (3) the craft took a long time to move across our viewing space, (4) the lights on the corners didn&#39;t blink, (5) I&#39;ve never seen jets going in on a landing pattern for the Eastern Iowa Airport in the direction of NW to SE, though I did see a small jet go over a little N-NE to S-SW just the same day, about 6:30 PM., and (6) I have never seen a passenger jet come in to our airport at that time of night.  Most of the normal traffic seems to die out after 8:00 PM. Because I can give an close time, plus or minus 5 minutes, and because I also believe that local radar would show a blip for what we saw, I think that this sighting would be easily verifiable if was a normal craft or not.<n>

Prior to the time of UFO sighting I had sighted about six satellites and multiple high altitude aircraft. I had been laying on the ground for about one half hour in a way that no ground based lights were visible. My body was positioned in a north to south direction.  (Location Coordinates  41°37&#39;45.18&#34;N  120°12&#39;50.27&#34;W).  Around 2330 I noticed a bright white light traveling west to east from a point starting on a line about one half of the distance between my north horizon and the North Star.  The light felt like it was shining from a beginning distance of 15 to 20 miles to the north of my position which would be in the neighbor hood of Mount Bidwell (Coordinates: 41°57&#39;57&#34;N  120°9&#39;56&#34;W).  The light reminded me of a brightness of an aircraft landing light except that it felt like it was too far away and was traveling at an angle away fr! om my point of view.  No navigation lights were visible at any time around the light.  The light did not appear to be directional like a landing light. The path of the diminishing size indicated possible travel away in an east north easterly direction, with the light fading and extinguishing from view prior to my north east horizon.  Transit time was in the range of one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This path would be consistent with possible travel for a military night training flight from Kingsley field in Klamath Falls, OR (LMT), to the Hart South MOA. However, the transit time across the horizon and perceived distance appeared much too fast for a jet not in afterburner and under the speed of sound. The night was still and no sound was apparent. My position was slightly east of airway V 165 and high altitude aircraft are regularly visible transiting north to south both west and far to the east of my position.  I have never seen a light maneuver like this one, nor have I ever noticed any other flying object that I did not feel could be reasonably explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This location is in a sparsely populated region of California.  Documented cattle mutilations have occurred in the past on local ranches. I am a former Navy and commercial pilot flying such aircraft such the C-130 in the Atlantic and Pacific regions so am familiar with aircraft and landing lights.<n>

There were 4 of them very bright orangish in color. As I continued to watch them I could tell they were moving down very slowly. When the second to last one was gone I saw a bright flash behind the mountain, like an explosion, about 15 minutes after the last light was gone. I saw a bright streaming orange fireball coming from the south to the north, I first saw it around the Mountain called The Brothers. This light had a tail on it, unlike a com trail though, it stayed directly behind the object as it moved and never decreased or increased in size and it was moving to slow ot be a meteor, As it moved to north and its altitude decreased it decsended behind the other mountain that the other lights were behind. At this time I noticed a helicopter in the area. At about 21:30 the helicopter flew away from the area and flew directly over my town at an altitude of about 500 feet. I could clearly see that it was not civilian but a blackhawk. I also took 12 pictures of both sightings and I will send them to the Reporting Center as soon as I get them developed.<n>

Moving from west to east at varied speeds. From complete stops, to short bursts at high speed. Becoming larger and brighter as it moved closer. While watching and trying to determine what it was. A military jet was approaching from the east. The jet then passed at a lower altitude, and moved to the west of the object.The jet then made a left turn and gaining altitude, established a direct course toward the object. The jet was closing in on the object at a high rate of speed. Then the object accelerated away form the jet at about 4 to 5 times the speed of the jet. Then it appeared as though the object stopped. But it actually changed direction and started moving out to space until it was no longer visable. The jet proceeded in an easterly direction. There were no lights whatsoever on the object.<n>

It may have been a star - except that it was moving very slowly to the east. With the binoculars it still could have been a star, but the color change seemed to be a constant pattern - red to flourescent blue to amber - not flickering as the stars seem to. Well, it probably was a star, but it seemed to be going the wrong direction. Will watch again tonight and watch this web site to see if it caught anyone else&#39;s attention.<n>

The plasma-like sphere was orange, translucent, and you could see some ragged dark (black) area towards the middle. The outer edges were orange. The weather was clear with some wind. We did have a full moon, or close to full moon, so the night sky was well lit by moonlight. The moon was to the east of us at the time of the sighting.

These objects were whiteish to yellowish in color, at an obvious very high altitude, (I can recall no aircraft flying that high.) My wife brought out a pair of cheap binoculars and I was able to find two of these objects of the same color and just slightly larger size.At about 18:20 two of the objects that were quite some distance from each other started  on a line toward each other at a much increased speed.(Up to this point the objects seremed to be lazily traversing in random courses.)The two objects seemed to swerve at the last moment to pass by &#34;closely&#34;. At 18:25 the objects dissappeared from my view at which point I went into the house to obtain the UFO reporting telephone number. I returned outside about two minutes later, looked upwards towards a thin whisp of &#34;cloud&#34; and was greeted with three of these similar objects, closely grouped in the shape of a triangle. Putting the binoculars on this grouping it was cleasrly three of the aforementioned items,spaced closely yet with some distance apart to enable viewing clear sky behind them. It appeared that there was &#34;something brown&#34; that they were grouped about. About five minutes later the sky was again &#34;clear&#34; of objects. My wife observed a portion of this but is somewhat lacking in far vision. Do you have any idea what this could have been? We were thinking of a mass release of weather balloons but when the two changed course to close in on each other we began to wonder just what we were looking at ((personal information deleted))<n>

It was bright green, the color of a green light stick,  brightly glowing.  It was maybe one-eighth the size of the moon, too large and falling too slowly to be a shooting star.  My brother was driving, and did see green light out of the corner of his eye, but when I yelled at him to look, he was busy avoiding the driver in the next lane over, who was slowing down and swerving all of a sudden.  I&#39;m sure he was seeing it too.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it, but would like to know what it was.<n>
7/16/00 03:00|Dunville (Canada)|ON|Light|all night|3 unusual lights in sky over music festival|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16149.html|129|ndxe200007| 3 unusual lights in sky over music festival<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the Weekend of july 14,15,16th 2000,I was attending the Sixth Annual World Electronic Music Festival at the Dunville airport just outside of Dunville, Ontario, Canada. Attendance of 9000 people. There are two incidents of interest witnessed by meself and some others. On friday the 14th of July 2000, at aproximately 23:00 I was standing aproximately 500 meters away from the main airplane hangar that contained a major portion of the production. The evening was overcastbut earlier there was some light rain and some summer lightning,but no stars were visible and cloud cover was at 100-150 meters above ground level. At this time I witness a red flash of lightning come out of the clouds and strike the main hanger containing the majority of people but what struck me as odd was there was no sonic resonance to the lightning, for those who don&#39;t know what that is there was no thunder present even though I was standing only 500 meters away. I shook my head not believing what i had seen and went about the evening as if nothing had happened. Later in the morning i was talking with my friend and I happened to remember the flash and I thought I would tell him what I saw. To my astonishment after relaying the story he told me he was relieving himself on the other side of the hanger at aproximatelly 100 meters away at the same time as my observation when he said he saw red lightning hit the main hanger. I did not know what to think at the time. Later that weekend on the early morning of the 16th of july 2000 at aproximately 03:00. The sky was clear and stars were visible. I was standing outside the back of the main hanger in the sound workers camping area talking with the urinator and another friend when all of a sudden another man i had met earlier in the weekend comes running up to us and says &#34;Can you help me with a problem?&#34;. To my observation it looked like he had seen a ghost or something. So I said &#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34;. He replies &#34;Why the F**K are the stars moving?&#34;, at this point he pointed to one of th! e bright est stars direcly over head. I asked him what kind of drugs he was on and he replied in a tone that can only be described as the most truthful in the world that I have ever experienced, that he was totally sober. Then he said look and pointed again at the star. So my friends and I look up. To my complete shock and bewilderment an object which looked like a star at first on closer observation was moving around rapidly within a small vector of space, not alot but enought that you could see tracers where the object was moving from and going to, like a fly around an invisible light. It looked unbeleiveable. I immediatly expressed my disbelief at what I saw. My pale faced friend then pointed out a second bright star not to far from the first light and this light was a bit different than the fist. This one had blue and red lights on the bottom of the bright light and they were pulsing on and off slowly. My friend then pointed out the third and final anomlous light and this one seemed to have a spot light that was scaning the horizontal airspace around it as it was in the air. As well there seemed to be a haze around and behind the lights kind of like a really really faint aroura borealis around each one. I dont know how long they were there for before 03:00 but i observed them for 1 half of an hour, before i went and did something else. Later in the morning just before the sun was coming up I looked for the anomilous stars or lights and they had moved on or i could not see them because it was getting brighter.<n>

It had no tail like a comet and it &#34;fell&#34; rather slowly. I was traveling west on Scholls Ferry rd. which is a very twisty, windy road when in one of the few, short straight lengths of this route I saw a very bright lime/jade green light fall slowly right between the trees infront of me.  It moved rapidedly like a falling star but had no tail what so ever. Just this fast moving falling green ball.<n>

I was driving home on Scholls Ferry Rd. traveling South West (or there abouts as this is a very twisty, winding stretch of road going down the long side of a ridge) wwhen out of no where above and directly in front of me appeared a bright green ball of light desending at a very rapid rate of speed; as if it where falling. It appeared shortly then it disseapered. It did not have a &#34;tail&#34; like most space junk or comets or &#34;falling Stars&#34;.  It was just this very fast, falling ball of green light. All so in March, In Salem,Or. My Wife and I saw an Orange ball of light approach us from the East.  WE watched it for at least two or three minutes before my  wife started to call here sister on our cell phone and as she did so the orange light slowly began to change it&#39;s corse and began moving toward the south and eventually moved into a bank of clouds. I only report this now as I can&#39;t help but notice all of the reports about green, and orange and white lights. This I can not leave out.  When my wife and I where married in 1994 in Los Vegas, Nevada we took a side trip to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.  Unforunatly, because of our time of deparchure and the distance from Utah to the North Rim, It was getting dusk just as we arrived. As we headed back up the long plautue North in the dark pines suddenly a very bright white light pasted us through the trees going in the opposite direction of our travel. There was no sound, and when I looked in the rear veiw mirror I saw nothing but darkness. I looked back; forward just in time to see my wife looking over her left shoulder through the back window of our rental car and then she looked at me breifly. We did not discuss this occurance untill we had returned to Oregon becuase it was so weird but we both remeber it distinctively along with each others unspoken responses.<n>

Cloudless afternoon, north bound on the 55 fwy between the Katella and Lincoln turnoffs. The fwy in front of me is a very shallow bowl so you can see a lot of the fwy coming up. A large shadow passed (moving north) on my left side, I’d say approx. 150 mph. I instinctively looked up to see what it was. I saw nothing. I looked back at the fwy and watched the shadow move from the left side of the fwy to the right (the distance north, covering approx. 1 mile). Alternately watching the shadow and looking up to see what it was, I never saw anything. At one point, the shadow covered the entire fwy, both sides, plus what I’d estimate to be the width of two extra lanes on either side. The fwy, counting the emergency lanes and diamond lanes is 10 lanes. That would put the shadow somewhere between 125 and 140 feet wide. The reason I’m recording this now is I saw something on TV last week about a new camouflage being used with tanks, how they can transmit a picture of something on one side of an object to the other side, rendering it virtually invisible. When I saw the program, it seemed plausible this is what I’d observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

IT LASTED ABOUT 15-20 SEC. I AM NURSE. THE NEXT DAY I WENT TO WORK AND SHARED MY EXPERIENCE WITH MY CO-WORKERS (DR.&#39;S AND OTHER NURSES) THEY KNOW ME, AND I WOULD NOT MAKE THIS UP.

HE DID MAKE IT TO FRESNO FOR HIS SCHLD. EVENT. WE QUESTIONED WHY HE DIDN&#39;T FLY TO FRESNO DIRECTLY, THEY HAVE AN AIRPORT. WE THINK HE WAS TAKEN TO EDWARDS BASE 1RST. WHICH IS NOT FAR FROM HERE.

Very fuzzy at first with a faint red glow and tail similar to what a distant comet looks like. The object moved from East to West towards our position until reaching close to directly overhead. At this point the object seemed to change it&#39;s appearence and stopped it&#39;s Westward course. The object then appeared to change shape from the original &#39;comet&#39; to more of a &#39;crumpled paper&#39; shape. At this point it seemed to start reflecting points of red light with some white. From here the object began to move in a Southerly direction, but only slightly while seemingly gettting farther away with it&#39;s color only being white. It became harder to focus on until it completely dissapeard. The two main reasons we are reporting this would be the objects movement along with it&#39;s shape and color changing. Movement and speed changes did not suggest any type of craft that either of us would know of and the color changes were just strange.<n>

This object moved in the sky east to west at a very high speed very swift in changing direstions.  I do know that the object was flying at about the same height as planes.  The object continued to move in the sky untill we could not see it then it would move back into sight at a very high speed and would come to a complete stop.

It was traveling in a north-northeast direction.  No lights whatsoever on it, which was the odd part.  Sighting was right at dusk, so the object could be seen against a darkening sky.  Low to the ground, maybe 300-500 feet, depending on distance away, which was very hard to judge.  Probably less than a mile away.  No sound. My wife and I tracked the object as it went in a straight line, for about 2 minutes until it went too far away.  Definitely not an airplane.<n>

They have come back to haunt me in dreams and scaring me!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the objects 2 different times.  It was very scary.  One day I was walking down to my house from hanging out w/ my friends...the half a mile walk by my self is pretty fun...i look at the stars and plains that pass by.  but not this day.  i looked up in the sky to see a very bright figure.  there was 4 lights.  3 lights plain white normal BRIGHT BRIGHT lights were making the shape of a triangle.  The other light was in the middle...the light in the middle yet was much different, it was kind of changing colours.  It was pink then red then blue then green then yellow.  i stopped walking and stared at it for over 4 min.  i looked up and it stopped the figure stopped.  then it went diagnal and turned over as if it were going upside down then it turned back up...i think it was showing off its stunts.  the UFO made a humming sound which was pretty loud.  The sight was unforgetable and the UFO was low. I know the UFO was no bigger then the lenghth of a whale-watching boat.  This made me then believe in aliens, but then... There was a second time and this was more unforgetable.  I went outside to my best friends house which is a couple of blocks away...when i came home i saw it again.  it was scary yet unforgetting again the exact same ship as last time exept it was much much lower and much much louder...it wasn&#39;t any hight then the hight of 2 3 floor houses.  It followed me home and thats what scared me.  but the weirdest part was my first sighting i was all alone no one to be near me at all yet i called one of my friends and told him i saw a UFO my best friend which was not w/ me the first time was on the phone w/ her friend and said she saw one too.  we were not w/ eachother yet we both saw it and had witnesses that we said we saw it...the second time she said she heard it and i said i saw it and heard it and thats all that has ever happened but listen...i don&#39;t know if i should be telling you this because i have had several of dreams telling me not to tell anyone what happened!  Please pray for my health and don&#39;t think i am crazy<n>

It was making no sound because we had the windows open and the radio was off. It did not leave a trail, and by the time we got to the lake, the object was no longer seen.<n>

It was around 8 I&#39;m guessing, but either way the sun was setting to our right, and in front of us, above the treeline, it looked like a glowing blue orb thing in the sky about a mile away. I pointed it to my sister and she wondered what it was also. We kept driving and the treeline hid the object, when I came to the top of another small hill and saw it again, very clearly, but then the treeline hid it again and then I didn&#39;t see it again. It looked pretty big, maybe 60-100ft at what looked like a mile away. It was pretty low in the sky, and was a kind of luminous light blue color, and it seemed a little darker around the edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

By the way, I enjoy your segments with Art Bell. Anyway, I saw the report on the red lights over Gilbert over the past year and would like to add some objective observations. I fist saw these lights about 1 1/2 years ago. They were no more than 500 feet above my house. I immediately got out the binoculars and the &#39;lights&#39; proved to be nothing more that road flares suspended under baloons. The flare was too bright to be seen itself but it clearly showed the five or six baloons above it. Both my kids and the wife were able to see the object for what it was. Due to the height of these objects I would guess that they are being launched within 1/4 mile of the house. They generally drift eastward, but I have seen one headed west. We look forward to these launches because for the 20 minutes or so that the flares burn they will travel two to three miles away and up to a height of over 2000 feet. The only issue I have with these pranks is that the winds usually take these object into the northbound landing flight zones of the Phoenix airport. Dull as it sounds, that&#39;s all there is. Only wish I had seen the Phoenix lights a few years ago. Thx for you time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approxiamte.  PD))<n>

The actual size appeared close to that of a private or fighter jet. The objects appeared to be equilateral triangles with less than 100 feet per side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Distance to Object(s) &amp; Altitude :  Directly overhead. My guess would be around 7500 feet in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of Area / Surroundings :  West Los Angeles (urban) just west of the intersection of Pico &amp; Sawtelle Blvds close to Santa Monica airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Full Description &amp; Details :  In the summer of 2000, I was driving with my then girlfriend late one afternoon before sunset westbound on Pico Blvd. just west of Sawtelle Blvd.. While stopped at a traffic light, she pointed to something she saw in the sky which was almost directly over us. I had to lean forward to be able to see up through the windshield to observe 3 identical black triangular objects. I observed them for less than 30 seconds. The objects were motionless and we could not hear any noise from the objects. There were no markings, lights, reflections or familiar aircraft features (stabilizers, etc.), just a solid black object. The objects were in a loose triangle formation separated from each other by a distance of approximately 5 times their individual width. What struck me most was their stillness and almost silhouette-like appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My impression is that the objects were the size of private jets or fighter planes. They were significantly higher in altitude that the normal Santa Monica airport traffic that occurs regularly in that area, enough so that a closed fist at arms length could have covered two of the objects (were they spaced tip to tip).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While observing them, I moved my head to change my viewing angle so as to verify that this was not caused by debris on the windshield or reflections. These were definitely airborne objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the traffic light changed to green, I resumed driving, but was unable to see the objects again since they were nearly directly overhead. Once we had driven a few blocks so that the objects should have been easier to view from a shallower angle, the sky was empty where they had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the shape of the craft, their hovering behavior and sudden apparent disappearance, I assume that these were solid objects under some sort of control, though not any type that I am familiar with nor aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness Background:  At the time, I was working in the entertainment industry as an artist for an internet animation studio. I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Fine Art and am currently self-employed as an illustrator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Views on UFOs, before and after sighting:  I have a strong interest in UFOs, both before and after my sighting. I have read several books on the subject and seen several documentaries, as well as listened to the Coast to Coast, the Paracast and other paranormal-related radio programs. I have found that this interest and the knowledge I have acquired has made me more of a skeptical observer than I was before since I am more aware of the conventional sighting explanations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other Comments :  My sighting is consistent with other &#34;Black Triangle&#34; sightings listed here and on other UFO sites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I woke as usual, went down to the bathroom and I noticed on the outside of my left bicept a circular bruise that looked exactly like a donut with a small red dot in the middle. It was approximatly 1 inch on the outside in diameter and a quarter inch on the inside. It was not at all painful to the touch and for the life of me have no idea where it came from! I do not bruise whatsoever even if I take a good solid punch on the arm lets say so I was to say the least shocked to see this. I went to my Doctor that same morning and showed him and he said the only possible reason he could think of  that I could have bruises appear like that might be if I had a low platelet count so I walked next door and had my blood tested. 2 days later he told me everything was normal. The bruise stayed with me for about 3 days or so. My  question is though have other people ever woke up that you have heard from and seen a bruise or mark like this on thier body. I swear it looked like I had been givin a shot with a needle in the arm because of the small red dot in the center. Very wierd, scared the hell outta me .......... Sorry Peter I did not take a picture of it although it did cross my mind. But like I described it looked like a ringed bruise about 1 inch or so in diameter with a 1/4 inch in the center which looked fine except for a small red dot in the center.<n>

Made my coffee and went out on my porch to drink coffee and smoke a morning cigarette. From my apartment I have a good open view. As I did a pan view I saw a dark grey object just to the right but a good distance in back of the closest tree. When I first saw it, I thought what the hell is that. I sat there and stared at the object seeing if it was moving. It might have been slightly but maybe not at all. I thought maybe I should grab my camera, But like a fool I figured maybe it is just a balloon from a carlot or something like that. So after 4 minutes I turned away and started pacing around (bad habit of mine)and looked again and it was gone!!!!<n>

We were returning from getting some food when we stopped to talk to some people at a house party. As we were talking a light caught my attention. I looked up to the South/South West where I saw what appeared to be a light that grew and was glowing a brilliant white. As I continued to watch the light, it travelled in a North/North East direction and began to fade to a cool star blue colour. I continued to watch for the light but it became so faint that I could no longer see it. The speed of the light was relativly quick, I could judge the speed because I could see it passing in front of the stars. I am an airline maintenance technician at Pearson Airport in Toronto. I am used to seeing a/c in the sky. At first I thought it may have been an a/c on approach to Pearson since I was only 100km from the airport. However as the light dimmed I looked for evidence of strobe lights, position lights or navigation lights and there were none present. Also the altitude of the object was very high, not characteristic of an a/c on approach to Pearson. In fact the size of the light and the colour after the brightness dimmed looked just like a star. I would have easily have mistaken it for a star. And finally as an employee of Pearson Airport in Toronto, ON. I know for a fact that the airport has a curfew on aircraft traffic between the times of 12:30am to 06:30am, therefore it is unlikly than an a/c would be approaching Pearson with a landing light on. A/C do not fly with these bright lights on unless they are landing. I am going to try and get in touch with some friends at Air Traffic Control to see if their was traffic in the area at this time. If I find anything else out I will post the information as soon as I receive it.<n>

As I was just about to enter back into the house I was extremely compelled to stop, turn around, and look upwards into the sky facing East. As I stood there looking into the sky for over a minute this overwhelming feeling was getting stronger so I decided to trust this &#34;gut feeling&#34; and keep looking. I can&#39;t remember exactly how long I was standing there all together, maybe 5 minutes, but I stood there like a rock to satisfy this overwhelming feeling. Eventually something did happen. This large &#34;ball&#34; of neon-green looking object appeared coming from the South traveling in a Northbound direction which also left a flame trail of some sorts behind it. It appeared to travel a few miles from the point in which I first noticed it and may have been coming down at a 5-10 degree angle? At first I was convinced that it was some sort of meteor but then it stopped in mid air for a few seconds. As it stood there in the air it made all sorts of colors and during these color changes I was able to make out some sort of circular shapes. It also had something glowing &#34;around&#34;  and &#34;within&#34; the fluctuating colors. This &#34;something&#34; is best described by looking at a neon-green style Plasma ball. I&#39;m not even sure green Plasma balls even exist but those who know what a Plasma ball is will get the idea. While it was doing this color changing thing it changed direction from going down to the ground traveling Northbound to going up in the air traveling North and then Northeast. It also appeared to be traveling faster when it took off after pausing in the air. It was now obvious that this was no meteor! Unfortunately all I have is a sketching of it that I made within a few minutes after the experience. I still have the sketching and will send it in for better reference. I sure wish I knew what was going to happen instead of just getting a &#34;feeling&#34; of looking up. I probably would have had enough time to get my video camera! The colors from this thi! ng were unlike anything I have ever seen so far in the skies. Regardless of what this object was it has become the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in person. The whole experience now feels like some sort of spiritual experience, strange stuff......<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked for a minute, admiring the myriads of stars from horizon to horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One light, the size of the average star, appeared to be moving fast enough to catch my attention. I starred at it, thinking first that this is some airplane or a comet. But very soon I noticed, not far from it, the light from another object, which was moving with the same constant speed, straight forward to the first object. They both moved toward each other, being on the same parallel line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured out, that very soon they might hit each other! So I prepared to watch what will happen when they meet front to front, certainly understanding, that the distance between them might be thousands of miles at that moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But in two seconds before the possible collapse, or simply crossing each other’s path, the first object, which was moving from East to West, suddenly stopped completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the second object, without making any stops or slowing down, completely changed it course to the South, and made a perfect half circle around the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the second object returned to the same parallel, but now being behind the first object, this first one immediately moved forward as fast, as it was moving before it, and they both continued to move in the same directions, as they have moved in the beginning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a half minute or so, they both moved away from each other and I lost them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After what I have seen, I decided that UFOs are existed. The flying machines made by us, humans, as I know, can not make a sudden stop in the space, or change direction of flying almost at 90 degrees. Those guys were showing us what they can do, so we should believe in their existence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a graphic design of what I have seen, and published it on internet, to show their movements exactly.

7/14/00 23:30|Sikeston|MO|Chevron|15-20 minutes|Chevon Shaped Craft in Southeast Missouri|7/23/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13485.html|164|ndxe200007| Chevon Shaped Craft in Southeast Missouri<n> <n><n> <n><n> AT aprox. 23:30 hours, I was driving down Highway 60 headed west when I noticed a light out my driver side window. I casually categorized it as an airplane until I noticed another one. Then I studied the sky and realized that there were at least 5 &#34;aircraft&#34; in the sky. 4 of them were strobes that either were very small or very high altitude (was hard to determine in a moving vehicle.) The other one was fairly close and moving slowly to the east it seemed. I turned left (south) onto highway 114 and was still watching the objects. The strobes were playing tag with each other, they flittered about the sky in very very fast, short movements. The lower one seemed to turn back to the west some (heading in my general direction.) As I was going to pull over I got a good look at the craft as it rotated (not turned, rotated in place) towards me. It had three white lights , each at a corner of the object. It was chevron shaped and tubular. The best way I can describe it was that it looked like two toilet paper rolls merged together at a 45&#39; angle but the &#34;front&#34; was rounded as well. It appeared to be in the vicinity of 1000&#39; feet off the ground at a maximum. Seeing how low it was due to it&#39;s relationship to trees in my field of view, I suddenly got a vary bad feeling about stopping.I found this odd in retrospect as I have been a long time believer and have had sightings previously. Normally I would think of myself as being the being the first person to jump out and way to it. At this point I sped up and only occasionally looked back at it. When I arrived to my in-laws house in Essex Mo, I immediatley got out and looked up in the sky where the object had been, expecting to not see anything , but the object (or one like it) was slowly gliding to the northeast. I ran inside to get my wife and she returned outside with me to watch the object fly off out of sight. At that point all that could be determined was that it was a slow, rather low flying object that did not make any noise and did not display lighting consistent with FAA regulations (i.e. no red or blue lights, only white.)   My wife and I noticed some more of the &#34;strobes&#34; playing around in the sky very briefly as well. I am not a crakpot and I am not an illiterate &#34;backwoods&#34; person. I spent 7 years in avionics in the USAF and now am a Computer Network Engineer. I do not wish to recieve any press from this, but am willing to cooperate with any researchers that want more info. I will be watching the skies for more, that is for sure.<n>

I was riding with my uncle in his boat.  We were catching lizards and snakes in the swamp, people buy them.  My uncle is 49, he always told me about the lights we saw floating over the water i never believed him ;this is something you would have to see to believe.  i have my eyes in the sky like always, when he grabbed my arm, he had his finger on his lip and pointed into the sky.  there i saw what appeared to be orions belt at the time:it was so far away.  It approached and i was scared, it looked like it was doing about 35mph over the treeline, it stoppedon top the trees about 300 yds away it made no noise.  I take 8 pictures over the whole time.  My uncle shines his light at the orange orb which is about 20ft wide, it flashed and took off at super sonic spead.  From then we saw it oune an hour.  The second time we saw it ,its color changed white and it was flying under a jet plane, then it paused in the air then shot off into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An hour later it reappears and it was flaoting right over the water coming staight for us, my uncle patled the boat near the bank and we hid under some shrubery.  We saw it again about an hour after that this time it paused over the trees, my uncle shined his light at it and it shot off into the sky and that was the last time we saw it. It is well known in Louisiana that the Navy Seals do survival training oin the swamps. My oter uncle told me about one time he saw twelve Black Helecopters fly over the trees. he is not informed on Conspiracy Topics, so thats how I Know hes not lieing. Who knows what this was maybe it was a Black Project or maybe Exterterestrial Life, but I do know the craft was smart enough to leave when it saw the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last I forgot to mention is it flashed like a strobe light and it was dome shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This report is from a source that chose to remain anonymous.))<n>

Since I live in Little Rock, the city lights block out most of the stars. Anyway, Me and my brother were watching the stars when we see an object, more like a star, traveling across the sky. I know it wasn&#39;t a meteor, because I commonly watch for those. I also knew it wasn&#39;t a satelitte, because they havesome sort of blinking to them. It looked like a star going across the sky. I kept my eye on it until it went behind a tree. I didn&#39;t se it come out the other side, so I thought it was wierd. A few minutes later, I see this BRIGHT light (like 50 stars put together) come back the opposite direction from behind the same tree. I saw it and shined my flash light at it and it became dimmer and dimmer until it was the same &#34;star&#34; I had seen earlier traveling across the sky. I shined my light at it again, and it faded into nothingness. I guess it became as black as the night sky. It wasn&#39;t a helicopter, because there was no noise, or a plane for the same reason. It just traveled across the sky in a straiht line. a white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot be certain what it was the witness observed, but it seems reminiscent of an orbitting object.  The fact that it dimmed is characteristic of a satellite as it &#34;flies&#34; into the shadow of the Earth, and is no longer illuminated by sunlight.  There are several very large objects in orbit that have a very bright reflection albedo, e.g. Mir, the Space Shuttle, and the I.S.S..  Also, the Iridium satellites can cause some of what the witness describes.  However, we are not certain.  PD))<n>

The object was not observed until it began to change intensity so no pattern of movement was observed beforehand. The phenomena was unlike a meteor (which rapidly streaks) or a satellite moving evenly across the night sky. Since the light covered no distance in the sky a possible explanation would be that something under some degree of control (?) passed through the sun&#39;s light as the object either exited or enter the earth&#39;s atmosphere. This idea parallels video tapes on television which seem to spotlight mysterious objects in the earth&#39;s high atmosphere. This UFO report is similar to other website reports of objects at satellite/star level.<n>

A married couple in their 50&#39;s who are neighbors of mine were sitting on their front porch on Friday 7/14 and reported a strange phenomenon at a distance of about two city blocks, looking west toward the Tooele Army Depot.  Please keep in mind that these people are not very articulate and described what they saw in very simple terms (their description in quotes).  A &#34;beam of light&#34;, possibly six to eight ft. in width, suddenly descended to the ground from an unknown source.  They indicated no source but described the light as similar to that of a &#34;police helicopter shining its spotlight&#34;.  There was no sound.  The light stayed trained on the same spot for perhaps less than a minute and then seemed to &#34;disintegrate&#34; in an upward direction during which there were &#34;sparkles&#34; (similar to something from &#34;Star Trek&#34;), followed by &#34;smoke&#34;.  The phenonenon then disappeared.  The couple shared their experience with several people and two other parties: a teenage girl, her parents and brother approximately a half mile from this location and another married couple doing some late night fishing near Utah Lake, about an hour and a half south of Tooele, reported startlingly similar phenomenon.  The neighbors also reported hearing a similar experience from a woman in Modesto CA on talk radio a few days later. This was the day/night of the government&#39;s unsuccessful test of the space-based defense system, which I believe took place in California.  There may or most likely may not be a correlation. The area in question borders a new housing subdivision, is dark except for a few street lights newly installed in the subdivision, and is bordered to the west by the Tooele Army Depot where chemical/biological munitions are stored in dozens of concrete bunkers.  This wide valley is not illuminated and the mountain range in the distance is approximately 20 miles away.<n>

My first thought, it was an aircraft, and the sun was reflecting off the wings, but it would have to be in a steep climb... since the object was perfectly horizontal... but it is not gaining or losing altitude.  If it were the fuselage that was reflecting the sun, I should be able to see the tail, and if it were the wings, the body of the aircraft should be visible.  It is not getting larger or smaller, as an aircraft would, if it were headed toward you, or away.  It is shining, it is stationary, it appears to be &#39;floating&#39; or suspended, it is silver and reflecting the sun, for a few seconds, then it turns &#39;dark&#39; as if shadowed, but it is the same size, in the same location.  Then after a few seconds it &#39;vanishes&#39; from the same location, never changing it&#39;s size or position?  NOT what I would call ... normal operating procedure for standard aircraft?  Hummmmm... something else to ponder?  Maybe it was just a trick of light on a plain ol&#39; plane?  But it was still VERY odd to plain ol&#39; me!<n>

It must&#39;ve lasted for about 10 minutes or so, but it felt like it was a lot longer, but anyway, I thought that somebody must&#39;ve been camping out in the woods in the middle of the night and made a campfire for light, because it was too warm to have a fire in the first place. Suddenly, the glow started to move slowly left and right then it gradually disappeared. The next day, I go out into the woods to check it out and after walking around for about a half an hour, I find nothing to suggest that there was a fire. This is an area within town that has experienced UFO activity in the past with sightings around the former Greengate Mall in the 70s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

7/14/00 03:00|Fresno|CA|Unknown|not sure, possibly a coup|A Rumble over Fresno California, at aproximately the same time as both a craft of some sort and a shooting star with a silver streak.|7/23/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13443.html|175|ndxe200007| A Rumble over Fresno California, at aproximately the same time as both a craft of some sort and a shooting star with a silver streak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the restroom and I heard a large rumbling sound, like thunder. Then it started to get louder, and car alarms started going off. I pulled up my pants and started to leave the restroom and as I did I noticed that the sound was growing faint. I ran out front, and looked up. I didn&#39;t see anything and the rumbling was growing softer. Now I might have contributed this to a storm of some sort, but there was barely a cloud in the sky and the few that were there, were thin and light. Then as the rumbling was almost gone and the car alarms shut off, I saw in the distance a &#34;U.F.O.&#34; (And when I say U.F.O. I mean Unidentified Flying Object, not a flying saucer nescisarily) of some sorts. It was to far away for me to make out and it seamed to be moving to fast to be a typical plane. As it moved behind some trees (or at least from my perspective), I started scanning the sky for it incase it might have changed course while not in my line of sight. Then from a different angle, what appeared to be a silver shooting star streaked across the sky from my perspective due to my proximity, it was about a foot. But it was a weird shooting star, at least to me. I&#39;ve never known a shooting star to look silvery, and to appear shoot across then disappear in a small flash. My natural inherit fear due to all the alien obduction tv-movies when I was a young child, caused me to go back inside the house. Then I got right on to my computer and typed this up. One so I would remember it as it happened, and two to convey my experience with the rest of the world. Now I don&#39;t know if these were just random phenomena that although was a large coincidence happened. Or if it was a military situation, or even maybe an &#34;alien&#34; experience. All I know is that this was an experience that I will never forget. July 14, 2000 Typing finished at 3:20am which means the experience was more than about 3:00am Pacific Standard Time Now I can not say for certain that the sound came from the object I saw, but I can say that if it did there was some sort of time delay because I heard the sound seamingly coming from one direction and then the object later coming from the oposite direction.<n>

This was a very clear night and when we looked up to see what was happening we all saw a neon blue explosion in the sky that quickly disappeared. Then about a week later as I was walking outside just as I opened the door to my house that faces east looking at mt.hood I saw a long blue zigzaging light across the entire sky from herizon to herizon in a matter of about 10 sec. then I started to research the subject, and witness first hand the ridicule this subject matter gets but I belive more then ever after looking into this that this is real period.

It looked to me like just another star,only it was moving.It moved in a straight line moving towards the east.I know it was&#39;nt an aircraft because I saw no visible strobes on the object.I watched it until it was out of my sight. This was very strange to me because if it were a shooting star, it was moving much too slow and emitting nothing. If this were an aircraft,it was moving very fast and I would have seen some type of strobe or flying lights which I did not.Furthermore,I did observe several commercial aircraft flying that night at approximately 30,000 ft.I could see them coming towards me at a distance and could clearly see the strobes flashing.I even watched them as they passed and could see a visible flashing light until they were out of sight. The objects I observed were flying VERY high above the normal air traffic. I can only estimate them at about 100,000 ft conservatively.If they were in fact commercial aircraft, they were moving at very high speed for that altitude.The second object I saw was in the same flight path as the first,about 10 minutes later. I watched this second object(which also looked like any other star)coming towards me, and when it was directly overhead,it vanished.It just wasn&#39;t there any longer.I looked in the direction it was going for several more minutes and could not see any movement.Shortly after the object vanished,I saw a very brief shooting star or fireball headed in the opposite direction just North of where the object was last seen.Needless to say,I was very curious as to what they might have been,and wondered if one of those stars were watching me watching it.<n>

As I observed the sky, I saw a bright object much like a fireball of bluish white light streak across the sky from approximately where the little dipper is to 24&#34;(I used a ruler for scale)south east of the constellation. The object gradually lessened in intensity and almost seemed to disappear but then I noticed it had not disappeared but had slowed and was hovering east of my home and was now about the same brightness as the surrounding stars. In fact, I thought I had lost it at first because it looked so much like a star. Then, the object began to grow brighter and brighter until it reached approximately the same color as it was when I initially saw it and zoomed off to the east. Shortly after the first &#34;object&#34; took off to the east, a second object which appeared to be much lower than the first crossed the sky in about the same path except lower at a high rate of speed. I would estimate that the object crossed the distance(the 24&#34;)in roughly 1 to 2 seconds. I considered all the possible explainations for what I had just seen but could find no explaination for what they were. There were no port or starboard recognition lights or beacons on these craft, they made no noise and they travelled at a very high rate of speed. The fact that the one hovered for so long before again streaking off rules out any kind of space debris burning up in the atmosphere. I am at a loss to figure it out. Thank you.<n>

It made no sound nor had a jet trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the above date and time, a red circular (ball shaped) craft hovered in the sky, occasionally drifting south.  Sky Harbor International Airport is approximately 17 miles away, so commercial airlines were observed flying below the craft.  A 737 airline, flying approximately 10,000 feet,  was considerably below the craft craft, which appeared to remain still.  In relation to the 737, the craft was approximately  1/20th the size of the 737.  The craft was glowing red and displayed a blinking less red light on top.  Occasionally, the craft would move, but prior to its movement, there appeared to be white sparkles that surrounded the bottom of the craft.   There did not appear any jet trail nor sound.  The craft would occasionally glow a bright red then dim itself.  This went on for several minutes.  The sky was partly cloudy and it was almost dark.  No other lights of similar nature were near.  As the craft drifted south, it would seem to correct itself and return to its original position. After approximately 11:00, the craft moved southward at approximately twice the speed of an airliner, disappearing into the night sky.  Just prior to the craft&#39;s departure, white sparkles seemed to eminate around the bottom of the craft, and the craft itself turned bright red, pulsing red and less red in .25 second intervals.  The night before, a craft which appeared identical to this one appeared in relatively the same area at the same time.  The craft was filmed  and  was aired on the 6:00 news in Phoenix on 7/13/2000.  The family that saw the UFO were interviewed and the video was scrutinezed by the local MUFON representatives.  The newscast was the Channel 3 news.<n>

Being in the flight pattern for Phoenix Sky Harbor, I lke to point out the low flying (descending) aircraft to my son. When this particular light did not have the usual accompanying white and blue lights like the other aircrafts, I kept watching it intently. I also thought it was strange and unusual because it was moving from NW and heading towards my home which is SE. The airport would have been to the object&#39;s West position. It appeared to be hovering as it moved, without any up or down movement. It stopped just above my home and shined like a brilliant red star. It didn&#39;t appear to have any body, however, the object was too bright to see a dark shaped fuselage of any type. I had my daughter get my camera and I took several (4) snapshots of the object with other commercial aircraft in the frame. After observing it for approximately 20-25 minutes, it disappeared.<n>

It was moving to the east as this happened. The mostion was extremly smooth, and it wwas perfectly silent. At first I thught It was a firework od the sort that shoots in the air and comes down on a parachute, but it dropped in several short, quick bursts, unlike the glide of a parachute. Its possible that someone was flying a kite with a light abd propeller attached, but it looked to be at least the altitude of a short range private aircraft, and there wasnt any wind on the ground and it moved too fast. I dont think this is outside the scope of an elaborate hoax, but if it was a hoax it was a pretty fucking good one (it also must have been moving away if it was as high as it looked because it disapeared behind the treeline. my friend:I was looking over the shoulder of my freind and I happen to see a star like object yet much brighter.I slowly watched this object move in the northeast to the east. As i watched I lost site of it over the trees.<n>

I   am pretty sure there is not the  airplane or other commercial flying boat ( I have served in the Army for two years  and trained to identify  air crafts in the sky  because my job was to fire the anti-craft machine gun). This unbelievable flying object moved slowly and QUITELY  cross Route 280 from northeast to southwest. Two of my friends were at the other car and headed to the same direction which we came  back from a party .  My car was  one mile  behind theirs, they were closer this object than my car. They watched the bottom of this object and should reported it to you too . I know here very well and can tell you it is an UFO. Thank you ((Personal information deleted)) Kearny, NJ 07032<n>

IN CASA ARKANSAS NEAR THE BASE OF MT. PETTITJEAN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was visiting my father when all this took place. My father and I were sitting on his porch with my cousin when something caught our eyes. It is so dark out there that anything in the sky could be seen very easily. It was cigar shaped but it was so tiny. Like a star. The color was green. And the light strobed. As it moved, the strobe made it look like it was skipping across the sky. They all looked like this.  At first we saw just the one. We walked out into the driveway to get a better look of the entire sky and saw two more. Each one of them flew erratically. They flew in all different directions and would come back and go again. My step mother and niece came out to see what the commotion was and they too witnessed it all. At one point, one of the lights split into three and each of those lights went off in separate directions, then would come flying back and join together again as one. You would think as fast as they traveled there would be a collision, but there wasn’t one. And the main shape never differed, not even when they broke apart and rejoined. We watched this for two hours that first night. Until eventually they just one by one flew off over Pettit Jean Mt. Toward the east.  We saw these lights for 10 nights straight. And on the 10th night, straight out in front of my fathers house, there is a valley and we watched these lights fly over that valley when they disappeared. A few minutes later a BRIGHT diamond looking light came from nowhere and hovered above the trees. A few seconds later something long and glowing red was dropped out of this light and into the forest below then the whole thing vanished completely. When I told my uncle,  who is Ret Air Force he told me about the reports in the area of cattle mutilation. That is all there is out there in the Casa area. COWS and more cows.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At that moment a white ufo shot over the top of the red one I was taping. I caught both of them on the tripod. The red one then was gone. The white one that shot over the red one was going so fast it was frightening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This report is submitted by the co-investigator with Mr. Tom King, both of whom succeeded in video-taping the object of interest simultaneously.

I remembered reading about these red UFOs recently on this website a couple of days ago. I wondered if this was one of them so I ran thru the house and took a spotting scope into the backyard to observe it. I couldn&#39;t make out any further details with the scope other than a pulsing red light. Next I ran in and grabbed a Hi-8 videocamera and a tripod. I went outside to set up the gear. I taped the object on the tripod, then proceeded to place numerous calls around the Phoenix valley to other skywatchers. On the third call Jeff Willes answered and immediately gathered his videocamera with my 5X telephoto lenses I loaned him. He also videotaped the blood red object as I did with a tripod. We&#39;ll probably post stills or video on our website www.ufovideo.com in a day or so. Until then we&#39;ll be keeping the Phoenix valley under watch during the 7-9 pm time period for a while.

As I looked SE I noticed a cylindrical shape hovering in the sky. I was looking between two trees approx. 20 ft apart. The object was grey or brown in color and would shimmer or reflect bright light on the top. I seemed to be appoximately 1 - 2 miles away. I couldn&#39;t really judge the distance due to the fact that I did not know what I could compare it to to judge the size, then the distance. It hovered, but not completely still. It seemed to move up and then to one side or another; then down and to the other side - an almost &#34;square&#34; pattern. It then moved in an easterly direction. I had to move to my right to keep an eye on it. It then picked up speed...a lot of speed. It moved very fast to the east, past the tree that was in my line of site, and then almost straight up into the cloud cover. Approximately 30 seconds later, a small jet, (possibly a LearJet?) crossed the sky at approximately the same line as my sight was for the object. My fiance was with me, but when I finally realized what I was looking at, I asked her to look in the same direction, between the two trees. She said she could not see what I was pointing at. It was at that time the object moved to the east and then up.<n>

The moon had already set, so the sky was very dark. The milky way was glowing, and as I was looking up at it streaching from South West to North East I saw a blue light pass over at a very high altitude. It moved very slowly and I figured that it was a satelite in orbit. It was moving along the milky way and as I watched it, the object did something which I have never seen a satelite do! The color of the object changed from a star blue to a brilliant white light and increased in magnitude. It then dimmed back to the star blue. After that it again changed to a brighter blue and dimmed again. I know that it was not an illusion caused by clouds as it was a very clear sky! As the object moved down range it faded into the night sky.<n>

It did this with three lights twice and then moved a little to the west and then five lights came on like described earlier. Then we wer looking in the same spot for it again and then about forty miles to the east of first location five lights came on and you could see a triangular shape, it did this in this spot two or three times and then went back to it&#39;s original starting point and lit up five lights and then went farther out to sea and lit up three lights. Within five minutes we saw and HEARD 3 fighter planes in the sky above us screaming towards Panama City one of them hung back and went towards the north. We didn&#39;t see the &#34;strange&#34; orange lights anymore after we spotted the planes.<n>
7/10/00 22:45|Wellington (New Zealand)||Changing|round 4 hrs|It was changing shape and the colours were beautiful|7/23/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13389.html|215|ndxe200007| It was changing shape and the colours were beautiful<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must admit ever since I was a kid I have always wanted to see a UFO. I just finished reading a book and went to the kitchen to get some food and for some reason I went outside and looked up at the stars and thought I hope I see a UFO and when i looked up again I saw two flashing lights above a mountian across the vally from my house one red and one green naturally at first I thought it was a plane but I couldnt hear it and it wasnt moving so then I thought it could be a planet but I noticed it was swaying and moving unsteadly not smoothly like a plane and I have never seen a plane stay in one place for a long ammount of time before I kept watching for about five more minutes and came to the conclusion that its nothing and it was a plane and I must be soupid to think it was a UFO. So I ran inside and got my brother who was watching tv at the time when he saw it he told me it was a planet until it moved again back and forward very slowley the thought of it being a plane didnt really enter his head because we know what a plane flying through the night sky looks like we watched for about ten more minutes and I was still trying to get my head around what I was seeing. My brother told me to go and get the telescope so I ran to my bedroom and grabbed it I hadent used it in ages so it wasnt assembled as I proceded to assemble the tripod my brother caught it on the telescope and told me it defanitly wasnt a plane or planet he said it looked like a triangle of red,blue,green and white light. It hovered there for about five more minutes and thenvanished just as I got the tripod assembled jez I was pissed. We deciced to stay outside for a second chance of seeing it again and about three minutes later we saw it on the other side of the vally we were so happy to see it again but it was further away this time and moving slowley across the vally we decided to go and wake my mother up. She came out to have a look and said it was a plane and about ten minutes later a plane flew past we all laughed and we could hear it was a plane we then went inside and set the telescope up inside we all stood there watching it for a while and then my mum went to bed my brother and I caught it in the telescope. It was so cool through the telescope it looked like a dome but it had no apparent shape at one stage it looked like a red fireball and then a five cent coin. The colours were clearer through the telescope and were very beautiful it was mostly blue with green,red and white flashes with a hint of orange the colours kept changing as well. It didnt look like it was very steady moving around viontly my brother went to bed at about 1:35am but I stayed up watching it fly so far away that I could hardly see it I fell asleep before it dissapeared. It was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. NO IT WASNT A WEATHER BALOON I&#39;M NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON TO MAKE UP A STORY LIKE THIS.<n>

We had done a Canyon that day and everybody except for me and my mate were already in bed. We were drinking our second beer when I think my mate said look at that and we saw what we first thought was a satalite, but the object zoomed across the sky  like nothing I ever seen than came to a complete stop and hovered above the trees. By this time we were quiet excited and yelled out to everybody else the only person that heard me was my step mother who could not be bothered getting up. The objected sort of hovered up and down until it dissappeared below the tree line. The object looked like a 4 pointed star with a red glow around the outside it was a constant glow not flashing like an aircraft. The object would have been a few Kilometers away.<n>

They were too low to be a commercial jet.  After about  a minute and a half of watching them they spead up to a terrific speed  and disappeared!

It was nearly straight up, moving VERY slow to the north.  It looked like a star.  It kept its course going north, I figured it must be at 30,000-40,000 feet.  About as large as one wing of a commercial jet flying at 35,000.  I watched it for about 10 minutes in which it had traveled to about 45 degrees above north horizon.  Then it got close to a cloud and changed course to the WNW.  I was able to follow it for about 3 more minutes before it was to far away to see.  Broken clouds where at I would guess 10,000 feet and moving to east.  There was some cotton seeds blowing in wind at I would guess 100 feet, they where moving north also.  Then about 10 minutes later I saw another one!  This one appeared slightly to the northeast of direct above.  It was moving slightly faster and to the west.  There where more clouds and when it went behind one it actually was in front of it.  The strange thing is it went from a star light like object to dark, it showed up against the white cloud!  When it came out from in front of cloud it was still white/star like.  It changed course after about 1 minute and started moving NNW.  I watched it pass in front of some more clouds and lost sight of it as it got to far away.  I do not think it could be a balloon because it was at a lesser altitude than the clouds yet they where moving in different directions.  I&#39;ll never know what it was, but it was not a airplane or helicopter.  It was like a &#34;light&#34; than just a white object.  Must not have been to large since it was at a lower altitude than I first thought it was. You won&#39;t believe it but I saw it again on Tuesday.  I noticed it almost straight up slightly to the east.  Did not move for a couple of minutes.  Then started to drift SLOWLY to south.  Then started to move slowly north.  Meandered to east.  At this time it &#34;faded&#34; but was still visible.  It brightened back to original intensity.  Then picked up some speed, although still very slow, began moving NNW.  Then WNW.  Followed it to around 30 degrees above horizon.  I had to ask myself if I was imagining it.  This time I tried to keep my head still to see what kind of movement I could detect.  It seemed, although I can&#39;t be for sure, that it would meander back forth to and fro.  It is bright enough that if you pointed it out to someone they would be able to see it easily.  I have no explanation.  There where no clouds.  Still saw cotton seeds at lower altitudes.  Does anyone know if they gather into huge balls?  I have seen small clumps like 10 joined together but they are not in a perfect sphere.  This is Wednesday and I did not see it today.  I am going to bring binoculars tomorrow just in case.  I followed it this time for 20+ minutes.  Do not remember which direction wind was blowing.<n>

Just stepped one foot onto porch when this bright light caught my eye in the sky. It was white like a very bright full moon with a tail traveling over the top of my hourse at very high speed.  I estimate it visually to be about 5 feet across with  maybe 8ft. long tail. It seemed to be only a few feet above the  electrical wires running down the street. When it got over the wires it vanished as quickly as it appeared. It seemed to be a solid mass as you could not see through any part of it. The sky was extremely clear that night and this object made no sound.My house is located on the south side of the street. If you have any idea as to what this was please email me at saj50@aol.com. I am very huanted by what I saw and need a logical explanation of this bright round light with a tail which went zooming over my house and the vanished into thin air.<n>

The object was round 1/16 in dia and was yellow in color. There was a small bright circle in the center with three black dots in the circle.This was followed by a black ring,bright ring,black ring,bright ring and a finale black ring. There was a bright aura around the edge of the object.Every so often the rings would change in to what looked like a spiral pattern. At his point I woke up my seven year old sun to come and take a look.He said it looked like a bullseye in the sky. The object would move around a area about 6 in in diameter then it finaly stopped and stayed stationary and moved with the rest of the stars crossing the sky.I found it interesting how the background sky would pass out of veiw as time went on but this just stayed put until it moved with the rest of the skyscape.I watched it until 02:00 when clouds coverd my view.<n>

I showed the clip to a few volunteers that were there and they could not identify the object either. lacking the equipment to zoom in and see the object better I made a copy of the clip and sent it into a local UFO investigating outfit. They reviewed the clip and their responce was &#34;Verry Interesting, We are sending this out to texas for further study&#34; That is the last I heard of the matter. I have made several inquiries since then and got no responce.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up to the sky and I saw a contra-trail from as far as my eyes could see southwest to the northeast. It was a rather interesting trail... As a footnote of report of the lights over the Levittown area, my friend, his parents and half of his block witnessed the whole event also.<n>

Then as I looked at it again i noticed it starting to go up in the sky twords the right. So I told my brother to come see the object in the sky while it was starting to go up higher than it was before.  So we went outside to watch it and it started to fly around for a while,then went back to it&#39;s &#34;starting point&#34;. Then it started to start moving again then some aircrafts that looked like airplanes start to chase it. than it took off at an amasing speed and appered to dissaper.<n>

At about 2200 hours, I was the passenger and spotted a greenish object streaking across the sky at about 2 o&#39;clock position. I have to guess the view angle at about 15 degrees from my position. It was viewable to about 20-25 degrees to the southeast. I checked a map and that is the approximate direction to Modesto from our position as we were heading east. The object was going from west to east at a high velocity as it was viewable for only one second. My initial thought that it was a meteor but it was quite large, about a quarter of a fingernail held at arm&#39;s length. The driver of the truck also noted it and we both wondered what the hell it was. It was hard to determine the shape as it was somewhat blurred, either there was haze in the sky or it was very far away. (This may be the same object reported in Ceres, CA)The location of Forestville, CA in Coordinates, is 122W53.5 38N28.4 Our position was about 3 miles south/southeast of that point.<n>

While talking to my neighbor in her yard, we and our kids (4 between us, ages 6 - 9) ) spotted a huge golden fireball trailing sparks, moving from south to north.  I&#39;m not good with distances, but I thought it was maybe three miles east of us (Stanwood, WA) and maybe a mile south.  It would have been very close to Interstate 5 between Stanwood and Arlington.  I don&#39;t know how high up it was, but it was a handspan above the rooftops we could see from our vantage point. We quit thinking the fireball was just a fireball because it moved rather slowly with a curve to its tail, and then it pulled straight up.  The sparks cut out, the thing nearly disappeared into a mote of light.  Then it reignited, the fireball this time looking like it was moving from east to west.  During various maneouvers a brilliant red oval of light appeared under the fireball, as a second fireball moved in from the south.  Both fireballs and the red light winked out, then one fireball reignited and looked as though it was moving away before it winked out. These things almost looked like intelligent fireworks, which has got my neighbor thinking the lights could have been part of the annual airshow in Arlington.  I&#39;m not so sure since the fireballs sans tails would have been the size of my fingernail at arm&#39;s length even though they were a little distance away.  A single plane in the same location would have been much, much smaller.  Also, the crowd that would have been watching any nighttime airshow would have been several miles south of where this took place.  I will say this lightshow was the prettiest thing I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky....<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very strange, luminous blue &#34;cloud&#34; at around 8:pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I both witnessed a strange neon blue cloud in the sky, just after 8:pm.  Cloud is the best word I could use to describe it, but its shape was too strange and defined to be an actual cloud.  At first it looked sort of like a beam from a flood light, only with no origin.  It had defined edges, like from a flashlight, but at the end of the &#34;cloud&#34; it changed direction, with a sort of triangular point.  The sky was not totally black yet, but there were no other clouds in the sky what so ever.  This &#34;cloud&#34;/thing was definatlly luminous.  It didn&#39;t move or do anything else strange, but in all my life I&#39;ve never seen anything else like it.  My girlfriend agreed that she&#39;d never seen anything like it.  The next day at work, two co-workers said they saw the same thing, but one of them said they saw something in addition.  In her desription, she said she first saw a bright light in the sky, brighter than the moon and about as large as a basketball.  It put out three beams of light, one from each side and one from the middle.  She went in her house to go get her mother to see it, but when she came out it was gone, and all that was left was that blue neon &#34;cloud&#34; in its place.  I looked in the local newspapers the next few days, but saw no reports of this strange occurence, which made me delay in make any report myself.  I&#39;ve never made a report before, but this was that strange.  Even stranger was that two days in that same week, prior to the blue &#34;cloud&#34; I saw some strange things in the sky at a far distance.  Both in daylight hours, and one of the times with my girlfriend their with me while we were washing the car.  She is also skeptical about ufo&#39;s and things, but she agreed on both occurences that what we saw was clearly unidentifiable.  I&#39;ve read only one report the was very similar to the luminous blue &#34;cloud&#34; I had seen, which is partially what made me give mine as well.<n>
7/8/00 20:00|Ceres|CA|Unknown|8 minutes|Blue Streak with UFO Trailing in Ceres, California|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13366.html|238|ndxe200007| Blue Streak with UFO Trailing in Ceres, California<n> <n><n> <n><n> Untill yesterday, I was pretty skeptical as to the existence of extraterestrial life on among the heavens; last night changed my whole perspective.And I&#39;d swear on the bible to you, that this is 100% true. It was myself(((name deleted))), My brothers ((two names deleted)), and our friend ((name deleted)). We had just paid to get into the Ceres Drive-in in Cere&#39;s, CA. Anyways, we were at like the first bend turn to get to the screen we were about to watch our movie on, when David says, &#34;dood, there&#39;s something in the sky up there.&#34; At that point everyone else in the car wanted to see what he was talking about so I ducked my head from the back seat so i could look out the front window and what I saw i truly can not justify. Picture if you can a summer day just coming to a head in the evening, the sun was just down, and the sky was a deep, but still lit, baby blue. Above and to the far right of our screen there was (now this was totally a visual experience) this blueish-neon streak in the sky, something I have never seen before and you could tell it was totally foreign to the sky...it was like something from a sci-fi movie, like special effects. it was about 3 inches in length in the sky, and it was such a clear night, it looked close. Now just after this streak there was a dusty trail of smoke starting from the small end of what would look like a stretched tear drop, but of smoke, and directly in the end of it was a bright white light, that seemed straining, searching almost through that fog/smoke, kinda like a smake crawls, not exactly in a straight line. Now I couldn&#39;t make out any shape of what the &#34;light-emitting thing&#34; might have even looked like, because it was surrounded almost entirely by that damn smoke. My brother ken said he saw lights around the light, but I couldn&#39;t say because I didn&#39;t concentrate on the light..i was too busy trying to make some logical excuse for the neon blue streak in our sky.About an hour later, into out movie, i was still checking out the window to watch that streak and see if it had dissapeared, b! ut it di dn&#39;t, it took a long time. Then i noticed off to the right sky there were about 7 planes, all in in close formation, with their little flashing lights, all coming what seemed towards us. I&#39;ve never seen that many planes flying that close, such a small amount of sky, i don&#39;t know if they had anything to do with what we saw, but i have a feeling they did. All we could all say was, &#34;what the hell is that??&#34; It was shocking, because i&#39;ve never seen anything like that before, and it kind of brought a sense of reality crashing in rather suddenly. Anyways, i&#39;m not sure how long it may have been there before we originally noticed it, but I don&#39;t think verly long. And after I first spotted it after david pointed it out, if i had to give a time that it was in the sky, i&#39;d say maybe a quick 6-8 seconds...maybe less. It was going in a more or less straight course, then like I said maybe 6 or 8 or seconds into it, this thing just vanished into thin air. The smoke was still there, and so was the blue streak. The smoke evaporated within a few minutes, but the strange blue streak in the sky, stayed for at least an hour. And we were not the only ones to see this thing, there were people everywhere; we were in a drive-in movie lot! people were standing outside their cars pointing in the sky, talking on their cell phones. it was a very strange thing, and I&#39;ve never seen anything like that around here, or even heard of anything like that. That&#39;s why I know it wasn&#39;t right, something was definitely there, and many people were witness to it. I haven&#39;t heard any local news yet, or read any articles, but it did just happen yesterday, i checked online at the modesto bee, (a local paper) but there is nothing, and there is no Cere&#39;s paper online. so i don&#39;t know if anyone reported this yet, but I can garauntee someone will besides me. What I saw was in my mind alien; very unidentified and rather alarming. I haven&#39;t told anyone about it except my mom, this was my best idea to try to spread the news about what I saw, and to let othe! rs out t here know who might be skeptics, so was i, but this was as real as it gets. and i to tell you the truth I wish i hadn&#39;t seen it, i wish I could still believe that things like this are only fantasy, or made up stories, but I can&#39;t. I saw it and so did a lot of other people.<n>

The light was a dim oval shape .  The white light seemed to fan downwards like a helicopter spotlight covering a huge area.  At first this is what we thought it was, a helicopter.  But, then as the white light dissipated an electric blue streak appeared to shine from the ground upwards to the now fading light.  After 3 minutes the oval light disappeared in the form of a dust cloud in which the blue streak remained illuminated. For the remainder of the time the blue light kept glowing , even when no other clouds in the sky were glowing.  This blue cloud stood out because it was glowing and it&#39;s intense blue colour.  Finally it gradually disappeared.<n>

There was a huge flat light coming out of a little circle in the sky.  It looked as if it was spotlighting houses.  It was moving around.  At first we thought it was a helicopter, but when we got out of the car, you couln&#39;t hear anything.  The circle turned into an oval, and then into a little slit where the light was coming from.  Then, it looked like it turned around, and the source dissapeared.  The light was still shining down, but it began to fade, and seemed to dissapate into the air.  The light turned into what looked like a greenish teal residue, and then slowly faded.  The source was really far away, but the light was very big, so it&#39;s hard to believe it was a helicopter.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bright white beam and a large, bright blue beam and the white beam object disappeared behind an out of place &#39;cloud&#39; .<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 9:30 pm this evening I got out of my car and in turning around caught sight of a bright!! light in the sky towards the western end of the (Coachella) valley.  At first it appeared to be an airplane unfortunately aimed.  A very large cloud hovered all around this light-appearing somewhat like a duststorm would; with a misty look to it.  This combination made the bright light resemble those movie shots from *inside* a theater, with the flickering light and smoke-effects.  (Although this light was steady and not flickering) My immediate second thought was that it was a police copter out looking for someone as they often do. I continued to watch the light as it moved slowly up and to the left (my left..around 10 pm on a clockface) It moved-not too far, distancewise, but over and up, where it went behind the cloud/smoke/dust/mist and reflected, from behind, in a very bright, round manner. Around this time I am noticing another/more light that at first I guessed might be this &#34;police copter&#34; using a blue searchlight, although the *cone* of this blue strip of light was pointed down, as though it was a searchlight from the *ground* pointing up at the light. This strip of light was fairly wider, it seemed, than the white strip that was coming from the object. There was, although it was dark, a fairly well-defined sense of where this cloud started and stopped in the sky, since it was well illuminated. I took note of the sky and climate: The night was clear with stars speckling the sky.  The moon was...? about a quarter?  Not too big, not obtrusive. The temperature *here* had to be around 89/90-as the thermometer in the car said it was 89 when I was about 5 minutes from home. 		So I watched as the white light (beam) moved behind the clouds just as the moon would, and waited for it to come out from the other side of the cloud.  It failed to do so.  I scoured the visible sky for what had become of the object...there was nothing moving (through the air) that was even remotely close enough to the area, to have originated from there.  I did not see anything moving in what would have seemed to be the proper trajectory. The light had dimmed to nothing.  There was *not* any cloud-cover tonight, I could see the stars all around. The blue strip/beam of light remained...still pointing down towards the right .  I stood there for several minutes as this effect slowly faded-at the outset this was a fairly bright shade of blue, almost a light turquoise/seagreen type of color. I tapped on the window for my daughter who sent a message via AOL to my mother who lives next door. So we all hung out for a few minutes and looked as the brightness started to fade and the eventual result was an oblongis/vague triangle &#39;cloud&#39; in a pale, pale blue tint and then just fading into transparence and then gone.  In the meantime my housemate approached me on her way home from being out and said she had seen the same thing although from her viewpoint (about 3 miles and closing, coming in from the west I think) she had seen something of an &#39;x&#39; or cross-shaped item.  She told me she would draw a picture of what she&#39;d seen. From the moment of my first noticing it until the time we went into the house about 10/15 minutes had passed.<n>

The light was steady, or hovering. It was not moving at all, the light had a point where it looked almost like a &#34;light bulb&#34; with a light trail that shaped into a a tringle shape, as the light faded there was a blue spot, streak or residue left hang in the sky. This was a very clear mark that remained for almost 45 mins, the color was a very vivid blue and stood out very well aganst the black night sky. I do not know what it was but I am not the only one who was asking questions about it when My husband and I stopped at the Hoover Dam,  a couple in there mid 50&#39;s asked us (without any comment form us) if we had seen anything in the sky a while ago.

The white steam or discharge was trailing it with a giant blue/green streak trailing straight behind it.  The white discharge was shaped like an arrow in front of the blue/green streak.  Then the bright light vaporized, leaving behind a pronounced blue/green streak that lasted for 20 minutes. I was with a friend who saw the whole thing with me.  Any ideas about how I might find out if anyone else saw it? I am 43 years old, business owner with two children, 18 years and 21 years old.  I have never seen a UFO before.  This is my first!   Very exciting!<n>

However it appeared like a stationary light and was very strong and bright. After approx 5 minutes the light disapeared and an unusual cloud remained which appeared slightly illuminated. This cloud was lower than other clouds and lasted for approx 30 minutes until it faded. Other cars on the freeway had stopped to look at this unusual glowing cloud.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Grey Object hovers over house in Covina, surrounds observer with a beam of light then bright blue shape remains in sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following was reported to me by my brother (extended family - he and his wife are my &#34;brother and sister&#34;.  Friday (July 7, 2000), around 9:30 p.m., my brother , who lives in Covina, CA, was taking out trash.  As he walked back towards the house, he noticed something moving towards the house.  within seconds, an object hovered over his house.  He said it was larger than a helicopter, had no visible propellers, etc., was grey, had some blue lights.  No wind nor sound came from the object.  A beam of white light suddenly shone on him.  He was frightened.  He called his wife but she did not hear him so he ran into the house to get her.  By the time they both came outside, the object appeared to be miles high.  All that was visible was a bright blue oval shape cloudy image.  It remained there for a long while then disappeared.  My brother reported this to me this morning.  His wife confirmed that she was a bright blue oval shape against the dark sky and that it remained there for a long while.  She said that my brother was shaking when he came in to get her.  My brother is convinced the object that hovered over his house was a UFO; as may be expected, he is frightened. This afternoon, I contacted my son-in-law, who told me that my daughter had seen a bright white object in the sky on the same evening (in Monrovia, CA, around the same time).  My daughter confirmed this and said the large, bright light did not move and that it emitted a beam.  She and her friend had joked that it was a UFO (Neither believes in UFOs - My son-in-law and I do). My grandson heard my conversation and he said that his friend Andy (who lives in El Monte, CA) had seen a light in the sky on Friday. He had told my grandson and some friends (at a slmber party) about the large flash he and his grandmother had seen and he said that,later, his grandmother him told she had heard it was a missle exploding.   I contacted Andy, who said his grandma (aa very religious person and non-UFO believer) had seen it.  I spoke with her and she confirmed seeing a large white light, surrounded by bluish cloud/mist on the same night at the same time.  She said at first she thought it might be a religious experience (so had my brother) but then noted that this light just remained there and then there was a large white flash.  She said that it was reported on tv that something had gone wrong with a missle and it had been exploded. All of the above was related to me at different times by different individuals who had not been in contact with each other.  I can testify to the honesty of the individuals who saw the object/light.  None believed in UFOs but are now believing that there are visitors out there.<n>

There was a light, which looked like a police helicopters light, surrounded by a green illuminating haze. As if the light was shining through green clouds. The object moved from one point in the sky to another. Then it was if the object was going further back up in the sky and faded away. The green haze was still there, and that too faded. The neighborhood children also saw it.<n>

It was around 9:30 (?) and we were just leaving Tonopah we were about 20 miles out in the desert.  We saw to the left of the Hwy. (about 1 mile off the road) an object in the sky that at first we thought was a helicopter with a search light on-- Jesse my nephew and I agreed that it could not have been a helicopter because it was to high up in the sky.  The light started to get wider-actually it never moved from side to side it just kept getting wider (maybe a 1/4 mile wide) then a blue light (more like a beam) came down from within the bright light--then the blue light stayed (sort of floated in the air) and the bright light sort of turned into a haze/mist and what ever generated the bright light disappeared.  It was pretty weird.  Do you have any ideas of what it could have been?<n>

The &#34;head&#34; then moved forward and let out a second burst of tail in front of the first.  Then the &#34;head&#34; seemed to explode and disappear.  The tails remained visible for a long time (many minutes)after.  As the tails faded they were replaced by a flourescent aqua blue glow. There were 4 in our car; one retired firefighter, one hospital department director, two college students.  One person stopped alongside us was an seismic activity researcher, we didn&#39;t get his name but his license plate was from Oregon &#34;((license deleted))&#34;.<n>

We were at the area where we have gone for years (and never seen anything but stars) and we saw a Satellite. I said, if we check the time, we can see it again tomorrow night. So I turned on the car key to see the clock. It read 9:21, when I turned off the key, I looked out the front window of the car. I said, &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; and my wife said, &#34;what?&#34; I continued looking at it and said, &#34;That!&#34; she looked up and saw what I was looking at and grasp my hand. We just stared in disbelief. There was a bright slice of light. It was in a perfect triangle. The source of the light or light bulb like thig was about 10 feet around. No light traveled up or to the sides. Just straight down and it had a sharp crisptness to it. It was sweeping the ground traveling from south west to north east. The light was about 1/4 mile in the sky, just over the tips of the mountain closest to us. It was about three miles in front of us, coming toward us. The light swept the ground in about 1/2 mile swath. The light was sharp. That is, It didn&#39;t travel past the sharp edge of the triangle shape pointing toward the ground. There was a greenish blue glow to the east of it about 60 feet from what appeared to be a craft.  The glow appeared like phosphorus in the sky. All we could see of the craft was a blackness. Kind of saucer shape and kind of oval. It appeared to be thick It looked as though from the bottom of the craft to the bottom edge of the light that it would be about 6 feet. The light was like it was out over the front edge of the craft, pointing down. The blackness behind and under the light looked to be about 50 feet around and kind of like a saucer but a deep saucer dropping below the craft like a belly. The light, like I said, was a perfect triangle as it swept the ground. No light was behind the light and no light in front of the light. In othere words, it was not like a spot light that has an oval shape on the ground. The light was extremely bright and! we coul d see the ground where it was pointing as if noon day sun. But absolutely white. No yellowish tint. The devise / saucer seemed to be creating some kind of fog. but it just kind of radiated from the craft. It didn&#39;t blast away from the craft and the light left no trail in the fog it was creating. The valley behind it was glowing a bright white and we could clearly make out the shape of the mountain. The light behind the mountain appeared to be from another source and shown like sun rays out of the valley. Whate sun rays. The light continued toward us very slowly with absolutely no sound. It got to within a half of a mile of us and then in the blink of the eye, the craft and light were gone. But the fog stayed. The fog didn&#39;t sweep up with the leaving of the craft. It just hung there. The glow in the mountains continued for 10 minutes after the source was gone. The phosphorus greenish blue stayed for 23 minutes. After the craft left, the ground where it had been appeared to show brighter. I mean it was like the sun came out for a while. We could see the field in front of us and the side of the mountain that was behind it. This light faded as the greenish blue glow faded until it was gone. About 10 minutes after the craft left, a helicopter flew over. The racket that made, made us realize how quiet the saucer was. No noise at all. About 5 minutes after the craft left, all of red rock cayon filld with fog. The temprature out there was in the 96. We sat there for another 1/2 hour, after all signs of it had left and the fog remained. We pulled out of out spot and drove over to the fog and it was completely gone. It took us less than 5 minutes to get to where the fog had been.<n>

It was a noiseless slow moving (horizontally) low flying object. From the bottom of it a very-very bright beam of blue light  was emnating (diameter of the origin of light was about 6 inches).  That divergent beam of cosmic blue light was reaching up to the ground. We stopped as we thought soon the blue light would be upon us.  But then suddenly this thing switched off lights.  It immediately disappeared and the trace it left behind clearly looked as though it suddenly changed its flight direction and went vertically upwards at tremendous speed. Most surprising thing was the the beam of light which it was emnating remained still above our apartment complex for about 5 minutes and slowly faded away. I was excited and stunned because the whole thing didn&#39;t look natural. I immediately calledup a friend of mine. He came over to our house and we chatted for quite some time about this. We tried tuning into TV news channels but couldn&#39;t find anything about this. At around midnight I searched into web for UFO related links and found that lot of people had reported this strange sighting at approximately the same time from Palo Alto, Los angles, San Diago etc..... I also reported this on that web site.  Responses have started coming in. I don&#39;t know what it was but I&#39;ll never be able to forget it.............<n>

I and several freinds spotted what we thought was a spot light coming in our direction. there were no clouds in the sky and it was very clear. the object was southeast moving at a slow rate of speed to the north. we observed the object for approximately 5 minutes when it appeared to be moving away at a high rate of speed. within 30 seconds it was out of sight , but left a blue contrail behind in its wake. the blue cloud or contrail stayed in the air and didnt move for another 15 to 20 minutes before it dissapated. there was no sound and the object appeared to be approximately 3 to 4 miles from our position. the blue cloud or contrail had an earie glow. i have never seen any kind of craft like this and all my friends are as baffled as i am.<n>

My husband pointed out what looked like a Bright white light ...like the kind a Helicopter has on the bottom,but MUCH brighter. There was a bright Halo around it. It seemed to be backing away from us....after about a minute or two, a blue beam came from the right hand side towards the ground in a 45 degree angle. The blue beam seemed to stay....as if an emission from the bright light. My husband said he noticed a red-coloration by the blue beam, which I noticed as well (but it was difficult to see). He also mentioned that with the halo effect it appeared 3D. As the light backed away...the halo took on the blue light and got brighter....and seemed to spread out. We all agreed that the Halo was MUCH bigger than a basket ball held at arms length. My friend asked the neighbor boys if they had seen this before (one of them had lived in the neighborhood for 6 years) and he said, &#34;Yes, All the time!&#34;....he went on to add that they were &#34;Space Shuttle launches&#34;.........Which obviously could NOT be.....Over LA? Towards the West (over the ocean)?? Once the halo had &#34;disappated&#34; we thought we could see a light (like a satellite...but a bit brighter and larger) FAR away.......seemed to be the distance of a satellite......but Much higher in the sky. Later on my friend said she saw a report on the LA news that there had been some sort of &#34;missle launch/test&#34; at 9:15 p.m. on that very night.  If this IS the case I would LOVE for someone to let me know....because what WE saw sure didn&#39;t look like what I would think a missle launch would look like. Background of observers......We were NOT in any sort of altered state whatsoever ...and were NOT tired at ALL. I have a college degree in Psychology and my friend has her master&#39;s degree in Psychology.<n>

The sky was mostly clear at the time. The light was fog-like and first was a longer stripe, then 5 minutes after I went to see it again and it had changed to a more round shape with undefined edges. Very unusual color and it was quite large. I didn&#39;t see any movement. After 30 minutes I went to check it again and by that time clouds had covered the area and I couldn&#39;t see the light anymore. This incident reminds quite a lot of the one I saw reported on 03/13 at 8pm in the same area.<n>

I happened to notice, for a few seconds, what seemed to be a tiny oval-shaped object move behind a cloud....it was so brief that I didn&#39;t think much of it at first. A moment or so later, I looked up and saw it again, this time in a large, cloudless area of bright blue sky...it looked very far away..my best guess is about 20,000-25,000 feet up...I figured it was far too high up to be a bird, and even though it was very tiny from my perspective..about half the size of a bb held at arm&#39;s length, I could still make out an oval shape to it.  It looked well lit from the sun, but not real bright...I pretty much had to keep my eyes on it at all times to keep from losing it.  It was moving in a straight line at a pretty steady pace..and at first, I almost dismissed it as a passenger plane...until it did a loop...a pretty sharp loop, actually....it went straight in another direction, and looped again....altogether, I believe it changed direction about 4 times, each time making turns that I think were far too tight to have been a plane.   I never heard any kind of sound to it, and after a couple of minutes of watching it, I lost it behind the clouds.<n>

Grabbing the binoculers all I could see at the tale end was a blinking white light. I can&#39;t say how, but it knew I was watching and it slowly moved behind a tree out of my sit. Then it moved up above the tree. The object moved like a bat out of hell, heading west. But it made no sound. Catching a climse of the back end, it looked like a U on it&#39;s side.<n>

7/7/00 01:25|Pembroke (Canada)|ON|Unknown|4-5 seconds|I saw something unexplainable and was concerned for the Military Base 8 miles away!|4/8/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22446.html|272|ndxe200007| I saw something unexplainable and was concerned for the Military Base 8 miles away!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very dark night; low cloud cover w/light rain. I saw two large circular emerald - green lights from my third floor apartment window and jumped up to see.  The centres of these lights were white.  There was a 10 storey building approximately 1000 feet directly across the road from my location and since the &#34;object&#34; was between me and it, I estimate the elevation to have been 500 - 800 feet at a distance of 150 yards. Also these &#34;lights&#34; would have been about 15 - 20 feet apart and attached to the same object (which I couldn&#39;t make out). This object was motionless; then I watched it zoomed off in level flight and in a straight line. (Approximately 4 seconds) This event position was at 45deg 43.23min North: 77deg 41min West. Direction of travel WNW; 270deg magnetic + 12deg Var =282deg (I&#39;m a private pilot) Conditiond were VFR (Visual flight rules) so visibility would have been not more than 7 nautical miles.  Since the object vanished into a pin point in 4 sec; that would make the approximate ground speed to be 9,450 Mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I notified the Military Police at CFB Petawawa (Where it would pass to the south) and reported the event. I also called the local Police to report the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Monday, July 10/00 I called the Army Base again to confirm my call...it was not logged in and they said they didn&#39;t know anything about the incident! I&#39;ve just kept this to myself since that day.<n>

We walked around the block she lives on (It&#39;s large, about a 1/2 mile walk ), and came to rest on an adjacent street corner. All night we had been amazed at how clear the sky was, noting the usually hazy horizon. It was uncommonly clear on this night. We saw three lights, star-like in appearance, flying northeast at 12 0&#39;clock high. They appeared to be in a formation, with the leader forming the peak of an arrowhead. the wingmen never really faultered, but seemed more in unison with the leader&#39;s sways and dips. It continued ( at which my girl and I both concluded) must have been an incredible rate of speed, before each one slowed down seperatly and faded off, one by one into space.<n>

He first told me he lives in the next town north of Airdrie, Alberta. Back in the year 2000 he was living in Calgary, Alberta and they had just purchased the home north of Airdrie. The fellow works evenings, so one night when he finished off his shift at work, he asked a good friend if he wanted to take a drive and have a look at his new home he had purchased. He told me it was a beautiful evening and they decided to take the trip to look at the new home. They headed out, both men discussing the distance they would be traveling from Calgary to the new home. The driver thought they would be traveling some 40 kilometers, but his friend thought it would be a little further then that. The driver hit the button on the odometer which set it at zero kilometers. This way they would know just how far they were about to travel one way. The two men arrived safely at their destination and had a look around and took some time talking etc... It was starting to get later into the evening so they thought it best to get back on the road heading towards home. The passenger in the vehicle mentioned to the driver that he had in-laws living in Airdrie and would it be ok if they swung by to show the driver their home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they drove along the highway outside of Airdrie the driver noticed some very bright lights coming up from behind them. The lights were very bright, has the passenger had turned around to look he commented on the brightness and how fast the lights were approaching them. Both men thinking this was a vehicle never gave it a lot of thought, other than these lights which were almost blinding to the driver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now here is where the story takes a strange twist. All of a sudden the fellows came upon a large sign, it read &#34;Country Hill Boulevard&#34; which is the first exit to Calgary. What is puzzling is that from when the strange lights came up from behind them and to the sign which read &#34;Country Hill Boulevard&#34;, there is a possibility that some time has gone missing. Both men do not recall driving through Airdrie at all. The driver took a look at the odometer and he noticed they may be missing 20 kilometers. As he mentioned to me, he never gave any of this much thought, but did find it rather strange. The driver also said he has driven this stretch of highway many times and nothing like this has ever taken place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked the man if he or his friend had ever had any vivid dreams and he said no. As far as he knows nothing out of the ordinary has happened to him other than this one strange event. The driver did mention that his friend did lose a little sleep over the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witnesses for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We had the top off our car and my husband said, &#34;What&#39;s that above us?&#34; I looked up and saw 2 lights which were traveling one behind the other...headed west/northwest....They were SO close together that I assumed they HAD to be one light at each end of a Cigar shaped object. We watched it for at LEAST 10 minutes. About 2 minutes into it....a red light Came ON in between the 2 white lights (none of the lights blinked). It stayed on for a minute or so...then went off. It turned on....then off...a couple more times. We watched it until it went behind a mountain. When we finally rounded the mountain (15 minutes or so) I saw 2 bright lights on the horizon....FAR away from each other. May have been insignificant.... As I watched ...one of the lights just went off. Strange!<n>

Slowly moving east then gone!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date was July 6, 2000. An easy date to verify since it was the date of President Clinton&#39;s visit to Missouri University here in Coloumbia, MO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had just become dark. I was on my bicycle and was peddling west on Wilks Blvd. just north of Columbia Collage.  I stopped at 8th street. As as I crossed 8th street I noticed a very bright light in the sky, slightly to the south of my location but north of the Missouri University complex and the downtown business district.  It was like a helicoptor search light and seemed to be at about two to three thousand feet altitude. However, there was no red or green running light, or strobe light; and there was no noise!  I then noticed there was a second, similar bright light at least two football fields to the south; and a third similar, bright light at least three football fields to the east! The lights formed a huge triangle in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that they were very quiet military helicopters hovering over the sight of President Clinton&#39;s address to the nation from the university campus. Then I noticed that within the huge triangle the stars were blotted out!  There was a huge, apparently solid object hovering in the night sky over the city of Columbia, Missouri!  There was a police car parked on 8th street and as I started to go toward the squad car the three lights in the sky started moving in tandem slowly to the east. The police car started moving north towards me and I tried to flag them down; but they evidently had been dispatched and they paid no attention to my attempt to stop them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights at the tips of the triangular craft never changed in color or brightness.  There were no other lights or distinguishable characteristics visible or audible to me. As I peddled to the south to maintain my view of the UFO I looked down the street and when I looked back up and it was gone!  It just disappeared!  I had heard of Art Bell&#39;s tales of big black triangles in the sky and WAS a complete skeptic of the phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a grade school teacher. I am an ex-special forces medic who became a chiropractor (PCC, 1969).  I don&#39;t drink, smoke or do recreational or pharmaceutical drugs.  I am a well read, 65 years young &#34;health nut&#34; who takes very good care of my self. I have flown and jumped from many different aircraft. I have a good sense of what I observed.  I  believe that what I saw was not created by our then-current or now current human technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SOME VERY INTELLIGENT ENTITY IS OBSERVING US; just like we observe our flocks and heards!  I hope we don&#39;t get treated by them like we treat our plants and animals!  We had best straighten up our behavior and fly right... The consenquences of our acts could be frightening.

7/6/00 20:45|South Ontario|CA|Cylinder|Three minutes|Bright, white lights blinking in random pattern coming from very translucent cylinder that made no sound and was lit up by a jet.|8/25/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13839.html|279|ndxe200007| Bright, white lights blinking in random pattern coming from very translucent cylinder that made no sound and was lit up by a jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:45 pm, I was looking at stars in south sky. A number of BRIGHT (almost phosphoresant) little lights rose above a tree south of us. They were very close together, and I thought they were residual fireworks from the Fourth. It rose a little higher in the sky, and I realized it was a craft of some kind. We live in the LAx and Ontario flight paths, so we are used to crafts of all kinds. This thing was a bunch of little blinking (random) very white, almost tranluscent lights. It came north toward where I was sitting. It got close enough that I could vaguely determine that it was almost like an octagonal shaped cylinder. The funny thing was that it was very hard to get a depth perception on. It made NO SOUND at all. I was able to determine that it was lower than the planes to LAX and higher than the ones to Ontario. It came north and then made an exact right angle turn to the west. It rose higher in the sky,as it proceded west. A plane going to LAX was coming up behind it, but it was very, very difficult to judge the height or depth of this thing. It was eery. As I was trying to figure out exactly how high above the plane it was, the jet turned on all of it&#39;s lights right behind it!!!!  It followed it for about five seconds, and then the thing just disappeared, leaving only the jet to LAX in the sky. I called LAX, but of course got nothing. As I stated, we live in the flight paths for two major airports and have for fifteen years. We are used to seeing and being able to identify just about anything that goes over-head. We have seen everything from the Stealth to the Concord, to trial aircraft flying out of Miro Airport in Rialto, Calif, to every kind of blimp and helicopter you can imagine.  I am 45 years old and have NEVER seen anything like this thing. Thank you.<n>

7/6/00 20:30|Thornton|CO|Cylinder|05 minutes|Long yellowish cylinder, narrow in the middle, passes steadily and slowly east of DIA, then vanishes after halfing.|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13305.html|281|ndxe200007| Long yellowish cylinder, narrow in the middle, passes steadily and slowly east of DIA, then vanishes after halfing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out having a cigarette break at work. Noticing the colors at the beginning of the sunset, I noticed a bright yellow, almost white object coming out of the western sky. Knowing that this was probably the reflection of the sun on an east bound jet, I didn&#39;t give it much thought, as there were several passenger jets heading both east and west bound that I could see also. It was partially cloudy, but no heavy cloud cover, and it was mostly clear out. What began to seem strange to me,was that NONE of the passenger jets that I could see were &#34;reflecting&#34; the sunset, in the same manner. While I watched a little closer, unlike the jets that I could also see, this object did not have any wings visible. All through this time, no wings were seen at all, and the object continued heading east, in a straight line, and a steady, continuous speed. (About the speed of the jets I was seeing on either side, and going in east and westerly directions.) It did seem to be going slightly slower, as some eastbound jets going to DIA, had passed it on either side. At no time was their any variance in the color also. It maintained a bright yellow, almost white &#34;glow&#34;. As it passed over head, I STILL did not see ant wings, no noises above the traffic on I-25, to my west, and it was then that I saw that the middle of the cylinder was narrower than the ends, as if it was 2 cylinders, that had a &#34;docking area&#34; that met in the middle. Again, it never deviated its speed or direction. As it passed over me, going on to the east, I saw that there was a small cloud, that appeared to be in a direct line, with where the object was heading. At no time were there any blinking running lights, as there were on the passing aircraft. When the object went into the cloud, I kept watching to where I thought that it would come out. Any other aircraft that I have watched, would be through that small of a type of a cloud, in 3-5 seconds, max. I saw nothing at all, for over 30 seconds, and when I saw the light again, it appeared to be about half the size, still a bright yellow, and then after about 10-15 more seconds, it disappeared. I never saw any wings. It never deviated in the direction or speed, and after it &#34;halfed itself&#34;, it just disappeared. No &#34;blink out&#34;, no quick rise or fall, it was just not there anymore. I know I saw at least 6 aircraft going in other directions, that might have seen this object also. I lit another cigarette, and ran through what I had seen, and no &#34;logical&#34; explanation came to me. Wen it passed overhead, it seemed to be probably twice the length of a jetliner and probably 1 1/2 -2 times the girth, of an &#34;average airliner. With the clarity and length of my sighting, I felt I should report this in the hopes that others had seen it, and have reported it also.<n>

The weather was calm, 70 degrees, clear skies. We were looking at a few pink clouds just after sunset when suddenly a very bright cylinder-shaped object appeared at about 30 degrees above the horizon, at the 1 0&#39;clock position above us. I observed the object for about 30 minutes through bioculars.  There were no wings, no windows, no markings, no sound, no contrail. The object had no lights, except for one moments when a reflection from the sun, I assume, beamed out from the side nearest the sun, 9by now set). This bright reflection lasted only a moment, and was replaced by a black line on the leading edge and bottom surface. The object was lilted down and to the left. After a moment, it started to move very slowly from right to left and down toward the horizon. It took 30 minutes to move from its original position  of one o&#39;clock down to the horizon, or seven o&#39;clock, a position a few miles north of Marinette, WI. That was about one degree per minute, way too slow for an airliner, etc. By the time it went over the horizon, it had become pink as well, as it was heading toward and beyond where the sunset position had been. This event was witness by my wife, and was observed in daylight to dusk. It did not vary in speed or direction, and held to its slow, downward tilted descent and speed without change or variation.<n>

7/6/00 01:30|Blood-Vein River (Canada)|MB|Unknown|7 seconds|Unknown military aircraft over wilderness in Manitoba|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16455.html|285|ndxe200007| Unknown military aircraft over wilderness in Manitoba<n> <n><n> <n><n> During a canoeing trip in the back country of Manitoba, a friend and I decided to stay awake for the Aurora Borealis.  We were sitting on the edge of a lake, looking across the water in complete silence.  There was no wind, no moon, and the sky was crystal clear.  (we were both completely sober)  An aircraft suddenly approached us from the left at subsonic speed (we heard it approach) and trailed off to the left at high speed.  It was loud and distinct.  We tracked the movement of the sound with our heads, but saw nothing.  It passed by right in front of us without a visual blemish on the starlit sky.  Most unusual was the noise: Two noises actually.  One was the sound of a spinning rotor with a gentle swoosh of a ceiling fan, not a chopping or clapping helicopter-type noise.  The other, more subtle noise was that of polished metal grinding against metal with only slight friction.  But that was it, no sound of a engine, powerplant, propwash, or any sound usually associated with known aircraft. My friend and I were stunned, both of us had the same reaction to and recollection of the event.  We are both atheists, do not believe in ghosts, superstitions, or ET&#39;s.  I believe that we witnessed a man-made aircraft of unknown origin using unknown technology.  There may not have been other people within miles of our location, but there is a hope others in the area had a similar experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The sound reported is not dissimilar to sounds reported to us that appear to be associated with bona fide sightings of UFO&#39;s.  However, the sound could also have emanated from a military aircraft, designed for almost silent flight.  Military units dedicated to &#34;Special Operations&#34; are thought to possess helicopters, for example, that are much quieter in flight than typical helicopters.  PD))<n>

I caught it out of the corner of my eye.  It happened so fast!  I wish I could have viewed it longer.  Anyways, it made no sound and it never changed color.  It partially illumnated a cloud bank as it flew into it.  As I said, it was shaped like a crescent, but the lower end was shorter, giving it the look of a cuvry boomerang at an etreme angle.  People tell me, &#34;It must be a rocket, or a jet afterburner,&#34; but I know it wasn&#39;t.  I used to live in St. Cloud FL. and see the space shuttle lift off, illuminating the whole horizon and jet planes flying overhead, heading to and from the air force base.

It suddenly appeared starting out as a tiny dot much like the Mir,  became larger up to the size of what Jupiter would look like, then suddenly began to become smaller and smaller and then disappeared altogether.  It went from North to South.  I thought at first maybe it was the Mir as my wife and I watch the stars at nite and are familiar with occasionally seeing satellites go by.  I have a little science background and to me, it looked as though a satellite had somehow begun to dip back down into our atmosphere, and then went back up into its orbit, however it never blinked, changed color, or looked like anything other than a satellite.  I still do not necessarily believe it was anything other than a satellite, but so out of control?<n>

It first appeared to me to be an airplane leaving behind a smog trail. However, I then noticed that the trail was not getting longer as the object moved significantly towards the ocean. Then I realized that it was not a trail at all, but rather a single object with a light in the front, wich I originally thought was an airplane. This could not have been a conventional aircraft first and foremost because of its size. The object would only be covered from my eyes&#39; view if I would hold out a pen a few inches from my face. This is too large for any conventional aircraft, considering that the object was pretty high in the sky. It was also NOT making any noise. A few minuters after this object dissapeared in the westwardly direction, I saw 4 black fighter jets headed in the same direction (these were making plenty of noise) as well as another fighter jet following the first four about 30 seconds behind.<n>

Pilot spotted object and asked us passengers, &#34;Do you see that?&#34; ...In front, to the right and below the plane, we see a shiny metallic coffee can shaped object - no wings, no strings or wrinkles like a mylar balloon -- just a shiny silver colored object reflecting sunlight (It was a clear day with haze only in distant horizon). Object appeared only as big as a pencil eraser at arms length. Object traveled steadily, but not speedily in nearly straight beeline north, passing us on right, but rose slightly to our plane&#39;s altitude as it passed. Definitely was not being carried the wind like a balloon. Object NAVIGATED north. Pilot radioed to air traffic control for radar identification of target. ATC said &#34;Showing no traffic in your area&#34;. Pilot explained to me later that before he pointed it out to us, it came in swiftly from the ocean - from the front left - above the plane, then moved swiftly from left to right above and in front of the plane at a distance before descending to the right below the plane. Then he pointed the object out to us. ATC was tracking other targets, like parasailers, at other points on this flight from Atlantic City to Cape May. It was very odd. Distance was difficult to determine, but I haven&#39;t had a chance to discuss those details with my pilot cousin yet. He keeps detailed flight notes, so the exact altitude, position and his estimated distance of the object should be obtainable.<n>

At the same time I notice a bright green light passing over Ballard. The object was going from south to north w/a steady high speed. The object was high and below the clouds layer. The object was bright but not hurting my eyes. The object is not a fire ball nor is it a comet. A couple minutes later, when I turned east at 65th St NW I notice that the a white light (a size of a bright star) was moving slowly from south to north. Two second later the object disapper in a blink of an eye. I notice that the sky was clear and blue. Just for your information I was in the Army and I know what I saw was not an airplane or a weather ballon. I was also informed by my father that there were many sightining in Poland but in the past years the goverment stop notfying the public of this sighting.<n>

The craft appears to be cigar or flat  saucer in shape...and has a white light and flashing red and blue-green lights. It makes no sound and appears stationary. It is viewed to the south. It seems to have the ability to dim itself when there are aircraft in the vicinity. It usually remains in the area for approximately an hour and then simply disappears.<n>

It was quite high up, and appeared to be a bright star.  But, the object darted back and forth, keeping in the same general area of the sky.  It being July 4th, we initially dismissed it as some sort of fireworks, but the object remained, nearly straight above us for at least an hour and a half.  It continued it&#39;s behavior of darting back and forth for the duration of the sighting.  It appeared to make some subtle color changes (orangish to reddish to purplish) but we can&#39;t be sure.  We could have been staring at it for a long time causing our eyes to play tricks on us (I&#39;m a natural skeptic) but if I was forced to answer; I say it did.  The sky was cloudless and there was no wind, and no sound emitted.  I recorded it on my video camera but with the absence of background stars it gives almost no evidence of it&#39;s behavior.  It only shows a light in the sky.  Also, after an hour of observing, we heard the sound of jet aircraft but none were sighted.  They (or it)were probably under the treeline (we were in a heavily wooded campground) out of our line of sight.  My campmate claims he saw something eject from the object, but I did not witness that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The report is reminiscent of the sighting of a celestial body, but that is only a guess.  NUFORC received multiple reports of a peculiar red light, sighted from Tacoma, WA, which is reported to have hovered over Puget Sound for an estimated 7 minutes, and which then was seen to suddenly accelerate and disappear over the mountains to the east in a matter of a few seconds.

Approximately a minute later I observerd a second light traveling along the same flight path, demonstrating the same flight characteristics.  The lights were fairly dim, about as bright as an average star, and about the same size.  Neither light blinked, flashed or twinkled in any way.  Both objects were at about 70 degrees above the horizon, and and managed to travel from mid-sky to the northern horizon in about 15 seconds.  Both objects appeared to wobble or weave slightly as they traveled, and made no discernable sound. It is highly unlikely that this was a firework of any kind.  The display we were watching was a non professional one, and at this point there had been a lull of about five minutes since the last firework had been launched.  They could not have been sparks because they lasted too long, and their flight path started down wind of the launch site. In all probability I would not have noticed these objects had I not been focused on the sky since they were not particularly bright, and would probably not have been visible at all near city lights.  The only thing that made them eye catching was the speed at which they moved and the wobbling motion. I believe that I was the only one that noticed the first object, but the second object was seen by three other people in our group.<n>

It was a Saturday, and if it wasn&#39;t exactly 4th of July, it was the closest weekend because everyone was watching fireworks displays.  Soon, the big displays were gone, all but the driver, front seat passenger, and myself were asleep, and I was only seeing a few personal fireworks in the air.  I noticed bright white/pale blue lights kind of ahead of us to the left.  There were three, and if you could play connect the dots they looked to be at a perftect triangle formation, then as I watched them longer, I noticed a fourth light slightly off to the right,  and the angles of the triangle formation were changing.  They were just hovering.  The one to the right at times seemed to go the middle of the fomation, and at one point I thought I had seen a fifth one, but it was gone quickly if I did. They were mostly shining white, but at one point looked bluish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to get the driver and passengers&#39; attentions, but they had music on and were talking, and I didn&#39;t want to wake up the two rows in front of me.  I managed to wake up a co-worker, and they looked and saw what I was seeing, agreed that it was strange, and went back to sleep.  We got closer to the objects and I thought maybe they were a series of three towers, but then I couldn&#39;t explain the fourth and possible fifth.  I lost sight of them shortly after we got off the toll road, when we entered a very wooded, piney area.  I had watched them for a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I became aware of a single red light, looking to be over Tacoma, and very high; MUCH higher that fireworks.  There is a lot of airplane traffic in this area in and out of Sea-Tac, so at first I just assumed it was an incoming aircraft.  A few minutes later I looked back and noticed it had not moved.  Incidently, it&#39;s position was lined up so that a point of one of the downtown buildings pointed directly towards it, so it was easy to see that it was not moving. I pointed it out to my husband; at this point it had been there about five minutes.  As we watched, we saw an outgoing plane fly near it, but the plane looked to be much higher, although it&#39;s hard to be sure of the light&#39;s altitude.  There were some light, high clouds that evening, and it was at about that elevation, as we could see them passing in front of the light. After being absolutely stationary for at least 10 minutes, perhaps 15, it took off at a fairly fast rate of speed, (faster than air traffic) towards the South and disapeared into the clouds (or the light went out).  I tried to view the object through our very crappy binoculars, but it just looked like a steady, red light.  When it took off it may have started blinking, or it may have been the cloud layer; hard to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for this time and date.  PD))<n>

There was light cloud cover in the area. The light was hanging in a clear spot in the sky. At first, I thought it might be a flare, but after 2-3 minutes without moving or changing intensity, I realized it was something other than a flare. The object seemed to have a slight aura around it - it was not an aircraft light. Two of my friends also saw the light after I remarked how it was odd that this light had not moved. After 2-3 minutes, the light began to strobe between bright/medium intensity, then began to accelerate away from me. It seemed to take a slight hooking turn just prior to heading directly away in a straight line. As it passed over a thin cloud, I saw the light shine through the cloud.  So, the object/light was higher in altitude than the clouds.  The object accelerated smoothly, getting dimmer, and also strobing faster as it traveled away, until it passed out of sight. I&#39;ve been in the military and my profession is a computer programmer/analyst. I&#39;m familiar with aircraft, weather patterns, and astronomy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUIFORC Note:  Please see other reports for this time and date.  PD))<n>

Then it suddenly changed course and headed westerly at a high rate of speed pulsating furiously until it was out of site.  There was cloud cover so it had to be below the ceiling.  It seemed to disappear into the clouds so I am guessing that it was gaining altitude as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for this time and date.  PD))<n>

We had been doing this for over an hour when my son yelled at us to &#34;look at that firework!&#34; What appeared to be a skydiver (I thought) with a bright orange flare, was spiraling, but not really downwards!  We could all see the smoke from the trail.  Being a pilot, I thought there was certainly an explanation for this.  I guessed it to be about 10000 feet AGL, and for over two minutes it illuminated the clouds and did not descend.  Seemingly, at about three minutes, it appeared to travel downward in wide, slow descending circles.  Then at about four + minutes, it went &#34;out.&#34;  I didn&#39;t think anything at all about this, other than how strange...But today, I received a letter from my brother in Des Moines, Iowa.  (his note posted here): &#34;about 9:15 on the 4th, i saw a strange light in the sky. at the climax of the lion&#39;s park fireworks show, i noticed a bright red light on a cloud just west of ny circle. it looked like a lasar light on the bottom of the cloud, but it didn&#39;t go &#34;into&#34; it. strange. the guy in the driveway next to mine said, &#34;what&#39;s that light?&#34; I said I thought it was a lasar...then it started to move OFF the cloud and was in the blackness between two clouds. The clouds were moving NE slowly and the light moved independently on a more easterly tack, very slowly...like the clouds. it came to a dead stop directly overhead...i walked up about fifty feet to mary and our neighbors who were watching the fireworks. &#34;what&#39;s that?&#34; I said...they all looked at it and it began to move slowly to the east again...it went behind a couple of clouds, emerging into the void between. still bright red. definitely not a reflection from the sun, which was way down by then. constant brightness; no fluctuation. the 15 yr old neighbor kid ran in to get his telescope. i went in for the binoculars, which i couldn&#39;t find immediately and I went back out. The light had moved further east, and the neighbor lady said she saw a bright red spot leave from it and shoot off to the north quickly. her 10 yr old son said he saw this too. about this time the telescope comes out, and the kid fixed the position...when i looked at it now, it was over dsm. the color changed from red to orange to yellow to white, blinked a couple times and went out...like a switch. we didn&#39;t see it again. i called news 13...the guy there said several other people called to describe the same light. no explanation...never saw anything in the paper either. haven&#39;t told this to anyone else except you. don&#39;t want to end up in a loony UFO bin and i&#39;m glad there were other witnesses. cool huh? --------- This was my brothers account of what I&#39;m now wondering is a related incident??? My being in Florida (EST 10:15) and his being in Iowa (CST 9:15).  Could this be the same event viewed simultaneously from Iowa and Florida?  Certainly there would be other reports from anyplace in between, but I didn&#39;t see any on your sight! Crazy!<n>

This ball of light hovered for the 1 hour time we were there and was still present when we left. During the observation, which I taped on my camcorder, we noticed that the object moved slightly east then would return to original location. This object was too high to be a beacon or a helicopter hovering. On my film footage it shows a small plane that circles Des Moines every year to watch the fireworks, this plane was well below the object and give a great point of reference as well as nearby buildings as to height, size etc. The local paper has done an article on this but no one knows of the film footage I have except my family. Any suggestions on what this might have been, if anyone else has reported this sighting and what to do with my film footage? Another person here has reported in that article that later, after we left, that another red ball came out from underneath the object and flew away. I cannot verify this. When we left the ojbect was still in sky moving very slowly.<n>

I noticed a red light in the southern sky away from the fireworks, approximately 45 degrees up from the horizon, sitting motionless.  I asked my fiance if she saw it too, and she stated yes.  We watched it for a couple of minutes and it did nothing.  We both got up and went down to the parking lot and I got out a pair of binoculars to view it with.  My binoculars are fairly low quality and they did not help much, but I did observe something apparently fall from the light and leave a burning trail as it went down to the south of us.  Another guy was in the lot when we were looking at it, and I asked if he saw it too, and he stated he did.  I told my fiance to stay there while I ran up to get a cell phone to call somebody to see if they could observe it.  But while I was running up to our apartment, my fiance said it grew smaller and vanished.  While we were still out in the parking lot, it (or something similar to it) appeared or reappeared in approximately the same position in the sky, but only further to the east.  This light, too, vanished after only a short period of time.  My fiance and I both discussed what it might have been.  Could it have been a burning ember from the fireworks caught in the upper atmosphere winds?  We surmised not because we did not see any motion whatsoever.  An airplane or a helicopter?  Like I stated, we thought not because of the lack of motion.  An acquaintance suggested it might have been a homemade hot air balloon.  That seemed plausible to me because, when I was a kid, my dad used to make them out of sheets of plastic and sterno fuel.  Anyway, I know we were not the only ones to see this, because I&#39;ve read other accounts of this on this web site and the next day on a local radio talk show, I&#39;ve been told people were calling in describing the same object.  Was this of extraterrestrial origin?  I have no idea (and I tend to be a skeptic), but it does fall under! the def inition of UFO-Unidentified Flying Object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other similar reports from across the U.

When we got out on the grass in the front yard, I looked up at the moon, which was a cresant. I guess about that same time I saw the red light, one of my buddies did too. We both acknowledged that it was there, then my other friend saw it. It was slightly below and left of the moon. At first, I thought it was a star, but it was alittle too large to be one and it was red. Then friend #1 said it might be Venus, and I said it might be Mars. A few seconds later, it just disappeared. I didn&#39;t notice it dim at all, it&#39;s like the light just turned off. I though maybe a cloud had gone in front of it, but it was pretty clear that night and we kept a look out for it for a half an hour later, and it still didn&#39;t appear back.<n>

Apparently hundreds of witnesses, but 48 interviewed, representing 27 different locations around the city.  At two widely separate locations a smaller red (steady) glowing light descended from main object, with several witnesses indicating a right-angle turn by the descending object.  Light was seen as larger than airliner flying at about 2600 feet (a lower altitude than object) as airliner made its approach to Des Moines airport.  From witness reports and some triangulation, it is estimated that main object was 70-100 feet in size, and at an altitude somewhere between 3,000 - 6,500 feet.  FAA reported no blimps or laser shows in area; balloons ruled out (main object would have moved AGAINST the wind, no matter what the wind direction at ground level or at higher altitudes.

We were facing west, watching the sun set.  As the fireworks began, I found I was drawn to a bright red light just to the right of the fireworks.  I pointed it out to my husband and we speculated on it.  If it was moving, it was very slowly towards us because we couldn&#39;t discern much, if any, motion.  We thought it must be a plane and tried to focus on the fireworks.  But we kept being drawn back to it because it wasn&#39;t behaving like any plane we&#39;d seen and it didn&#39;t seem to be at the right altitude either.  It stayed there a long time and we heard others around us pointing it out as well.  It was there through the whole display and possibly longer (we had to get the children home). Later, the local free paper ran an article on a local UFO investigator and the recent sighting.  The report mentioned the light moving from West Des Moines to Windsor Heights and that it was seen to have dropped 1 or 2 objects (flashing red lights, I believe they said), but we hadn&#39;t seen that.  Of course, looking near and through fireworks likely obscured any other blinking red lights!  Many people in the city saw it, since so many of us were out for the holiday shows.  A follow-up report in the same paper said that it could not have been a plane, fireworks, weather balloon, etc.  There is no explanation as of yet.  I am probably just one of many voices reporting this sighting, but I thought I&#39;d add what we saw that night in case it helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Similar reports of red lights from several locations in the U.S..

It was amazing! myself, my wife, my brother inlaw, and a stranger next to us all saw it. There is a good chance more people saw it, but it was only there for 5 to 10 seconds. I remember it as a white round light quite big considering how far away it was. At first I thought it was a falling star, but it was faster. Then it paused, and I was thinking what the heck! Then it zipped off!

I was riding my bike down Bay street headed towards Pierpont ave when I noticed bright lights coming from about 40-50 yards above the water of Racket River to my right. There were multiple lights in a vertical line following each other, if you looked directly at them it would look like the shape of the big an little hand on a clock lit up like it was 1:25. they came on like a switch, the power was bright enough to cast shadows from the trees and houses in front of the water. It was dusk and i assumed the light source was fire works because of the holiday. But when I looked at them they were motionless, they were not falling down like a firework cascade would normally do. I realized pretty quick that all of the lights were slowly moving together as if they were all connected to the same object. Then the lights when out, they were only illuminated brightly for less than 10-20 seconds. You could still see the light very dimly lit, the object was changing its position in the sky, it was turning from vertical to horizontal. I was silent, it made no noise I can recall. It was clear that it was triangle in shape, its size was around 50 yards roughly. It was hard to say how, but I fell like it was not that thick. It then moved very gradually up into the sky until i could no longer see it. The whole event took around 2-3 minutes, but I will never forget it. I thought it was a government project or something. Whatever it was I have never seen commercial technology move the way it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

There was a light moving across the handle.  There was no strobe like you see in general aircraft (which is what caught my eye). The light was roughly the same size and brightness of the stars in the BD handle; in fact, it looked like a slow-moving star.  It was slightly below and to the left of the star at the tip of the handle, and moved in a straight line towards the star joining the handle/bowl.  Somewhat like it was drawing a hypotenuse across the 3 stars in the handle.  At that point it disappeared.  I kept watching to see if it might have been a plane that had turned, but I didn&#39;t see the light moving after that.  About 30-35 seconds after the light disappeared, a light from about the same spot shot downward very quickly, like a shooting star but much higher velocity.  If you hold a ruler up at arm&#39;s length, I saw the light for about 2-2 1/2 inches, then it disappeared.<n>

Then looking out of the windshield I say a capsule shaped green glowing object in the sky directly over head and said to my boyfriend, what the hell is that a giant fire fly, he looked and then in the next instant it landed infront of us on the highway the only way we were able to see this was because of the huge flash of green light that it gave off.  I immedaitley turn the car around and drove the opposite direction.  While I was doing this my boyfriend saw the craft it was disk shaped, black with red under glow.   We were driving away, not being able to move very fast because of the weather conditions, we travled at least four miles when I spotted the craft now glowing solid green following us it was about a mile away just above tree line, I told my boyfriend that it was behind us and he saw the same thing too.  So I sped up driving at least 75 miles per hour.  We were both terrified and did not get a good or curious feeling from or about this thing.  When I looked again in the rearview it was not there.  We drove what seemed like an enternity back into Colebrookand reported it to the police.<n>

Anyway , aprox 9:45 while fireworks were going my girlfriend and I saw what seemed to be a shooting star going east to west . It burnt out , from our vantage point, right above the fireworks, but up in the sky a bit.(an open hands width @ arms length). Then right at the spot it burnt out this light started blinking . (The light was quite a bit brighter than any of the stars and didnt have a steady blink like a aircraft.) Then the akwardly blinking light moved horizontally tward the north we&#39;d say half the distance between anderson and redding in a couple of seconds.(5 miles distance i think)Then it went south back over the fireworks, stopped, blinked a few times  then the blinking stopped and that was it. It def. was not any aircraft i have ever seen, my pops a pilot and i have grown up around avation, and that was no plane ! We could see the commuter flights going out of redding heading south and they were way slower and lower on the horizon than the blinking light.

I was looking east  when i saw at least a dozen objects heading south. They appeared from ground level and rapidly gained altitude. what got my attention was that these silver things looked like the wind was blowing long silver balloons. Each strip turned color.  From a silver to red and blue.   The last one I saw turned due east.  When that happened, I saw what I&#39;ll call the after burners.  I distinctively saw six after burners that formed circle. Each burner was circular and white. Then it disappeared.   It was then, that I realized what the other objects were.  I say that because I had seen a nother single object on May 26th at 1pm going west to north to west.  That event lasted about a minute.<n>

It made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, in the township of Footbridge WI,(just outside of Kewaunee) a friend of mine and I were planning to go fishing in the Kewaunee River. The spot we picked to go is very dark, no lights from houses or street lights. It&#39;s basically a dead end parking lot. We were sitting by our cars talking and it was one of those calm nights where you could hear a dog barking from a mile away.The sky was very very clear, all the stars you could see were visable. Minutes prior a jet had flown over us and it was VERY high up in the air, and we could hear it because it was so calm outside. Not more than 20 minutes later, another flying object came through, only, we never saw anything like it. It had an orange glow underneath and to the sides. This craft was no more than an eighth mile high, and unlike the jet, no sound was coming from it. We were probably 1/2 mile from it and we watched it fly over the trees from the east to the west, slowly for about 2 minutes. My friend had then called his brother on his cellphone and asked him to look outside at it. (His brother lived about 2 miles from there). He was already outside watching it and said he could not tell what it was. The way it would jerk around and how close to the trees it flew. From where my friend and I were sitting, the craft went over the treeline and we couldnt see it anymore. His brother watched and he said half a minute later, it completely vanished.

7/2/00 22:30|Ice House Campground (Hiway 50)|CA|Formation|20 minutes|Triangular formation of lights (not one object) + additional objects|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13288.html|327|ndxe200007| Triangular formation of lights (not one object) + additional objects<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two witnesses were experienced Amateur Astronomers Two events spaced over a 20 minute timeframe. Witnesses were using a Mead ETX 125 and binoculars to ID messier objects for pleasure viewing.   A bright (brighter than any star)  Blue light was observed coming from close to North, first noticed at about 75 degress above horizon (moving south).   We initially assumed it to be a satelitte.  The light quickly varied from bright to VERY bright,  and sumultaneously turned sharply to move in a Easternly direction.  Light diminished dramatically after turn, and light did not move in a straight line but swerved sharply as it traveled in a generally Easternly direction.   We were able to observe with both the binoculars and the Mead, as speed was very slow (very similar to a normal satalitte speed), but the object remained a blue point source under magnification.  One member of the party (the guy with the binoculars), indicated that the object had a less bright companion about 10 degress south (higher in the sky) that shadowed its movments, but the others in the party did not see this object.  Object crossed perhaps 40 degress of sky before disappearing (slowly disappeared).   Most disconcerting was anomolous movement.   Turns were far to tights for any aircraft we were familiar with. 2nd observation occured about 15 minutes later.   Again an object appeared from north, at about the same location.  However, brightness did not seem to vary during sighting.  The object (moderately bright blue light),  was noticed at about 60 degress above horizon moving south (via binoculars.   Object moved to about 75 dgress above northern horizon, met two other objects that were stationery at that spot (we had assumed were stars), then all thre objects moved &#34;as one triangular structure&#34; to the east.  We carefully observed background stars between objects as the triangle moved east (with binoculars and the Mead scope).   The triangular formation was intially isoceles, but the lead object moved slightly north during the easternly flight so that the formation apeared as a right triangle by the time the objetcs faded in the east (there was a little haze in the eastern sky in the direction of Lake Tahoe).  Again speed was very similar to satellite motion.  All three objects were exactly the same brightness (blue points of light).  Total time watching formation move perhaps 4 to 5 minutes.<n>

At first I thought it might be part of a control tower, but then it started moving, and I saw the saucer shape of the object.  There was a strip of flashing lights around the bottom of the spacecraft. It was moving from right to left in the sky, and was larger and brighter than an airplane in another part of the sky. It was also travelling much faster than the airplane. When I picked up my son I told him what I saw, and he started making fun of me because he thought I was crazy.  Once I pointed it out to him in the sky, still travelling very rapidly, he believed me. The object was moving away from us, so we drove in the direction it was going.  After a few minutes, it was on the horizon, and finally it disappeared from sight.<n>

That is why we all happened to be outside looking up at the sky.  About 10pm we saw a white light in the distant sky to the northeast and the object was moving from the north to the south or southwest.  It was very distant, you could tell it was very high and it was moving much faster than a plane.  Everyone was talking about it and I suggested that it might be a satellite as I heard they move faster than planes.  About that time we saw another one - this one seemed to be coming from east to west and then another from south to north and so on. They seem to be appearing one at a time from the black night sky - almost as if they were stars that had been stationary and then just started moving.  We would watch them until they travelled out of our sight.  We thought that was an awful lot of satellites. One in particular, as it travelled from north to south and then westward out of our line of vision, seemed to flare very brightly for a second and then go back to normal. Also there was one that changed direction and at one point seemed almost to fishtail, or swirl. We aren&#39;t trying to indicate we saw alien crafts - as we are sure it was probably satellites, but we&#39;re curious as to what it could be.  We felt to stupid to call the airport and ask if they had anything on their radar. We watched for about 30 minutes and then it was like popcorn that was almost popped, there weren&#39;t so many and they weren&#39;t as often so we went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As the formation was flying, the 90-degree angle was in the lower-left position. These objects were certainly in space and possibly satellites, only if there are satellites flying in such formation. Since I am unaware of any satellites flying in a perfect triangular position, I am contemplating the possibility of UFO&#39;s. From Earth, the objects looked similar to orbitting satellites. If any person knows of additional, pertinent information which may enlighten the observer, please reply via my email at: ((e-address deleted.  NUFORC responded to witness with information about U. S. Navy satellite program)). I am currently a graduate student at the University of Washington studying ((degree deleted)). I originally grew up in Glenview, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. In the past I have been skeptical about the existence of UFO&#39;s and I tend to think the crafts I saw were satelites, but the perfect formation of a triangle makes me wonder.

It appeared in the west and travel northeast as it continued to burn bigger and brighter, and then seemed to be burning up. It seemed to be altering its&#39; path, not following a straight trajectory. It seemed as if it was going to crash. There was no sound that accompanied the phenomenon.It was enormous in size even though it appeared to be very far out in space.This was visible from an altitude of over 10,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California and it appeared to go down in the desert area somewhat east of Mt. Whitney as it disappeared out of our sight behind a group of mountains. I have never witnessed anything like this ever, and it was way too big to be any ordinary plane crash. If it was a meteor of any type certainly it would have been reported by the media. I am interested in knowing if anyone else saw this phenomena, and what kind of explanation there could be.<n>

At a medium altitude, aprox. 2 or 3 miles up. We had intermitant fog cover to look through when observing this object. It had an exhaust and was brightly lit. The front was rounded and moved at a constant speed. It did not appear to be losing altitude but it did look like it was burning up. We observe this object to be a white and brightly lit with no blinking lights of a normal plane. It had an exhaust tail that was quite uniform in two sections out the back. It made no sound like any other plane going the speed of sound.<n>

My wife and I saw it straight in front of us (facing south), at an elevation of about 30 degrees. It moved left ro right. I would describe the left to right movement as going from 12:00 (straight ahead) to 11:00 in 8 seconds or so. We watched move straight and level as best we could tell untill it disappeared over the rooftops.<n>

I looked out of the side window and saw an object suspended just above the trees.  It was absolutely stationary. The only thing visible was the windows.  They were all equally lit.  The color of the light was uniform and identical to the color given off by an ordinary incandescent light bulb. There were two rows of windows, one row across on top of another(upper and lower, vertically in line) and approximately 18-20 across. All windows were the same size, about 6-8 feet high by 8-10 feet across.  The object was between 150 - 200 feet away. I stared at it intently without even blinking, expecting that I would see somebody come to one of the windows, if I didn&#39;t take my eyes off of them.  At the same time I was watching, I was yelling at my friend, who was driving, to pull over.  I repeated myself very sternly to pull over 4-5 times.  He was preoccupied at that very same time searching the middle of the seat for! his tin of chewing tobacco with his right hand, while driving with his left hand and never took his eyes off of the road.So he didn&#39;t see it.  I couldn&#39;t tell him to look because we had just came off of a curve, before I saw what I saw and we were heading for another curve shortly.  Also, I think I was just so excited, that the only words that I could get out of my mouth was &#34;pull over&#34; repeatedly.  Has we approached the next curve the object became obscured by trees and a house for 2-3 seconds and then we pulled over after that.  The place where we pulled over was only about 2-3 seconds past the time that I lost visual contact and the area between where we stopped and where the object had been was totally clear, but it was not there any more.  Neither was there anything visible any where in the entire sky. My friend was very irate and asked me what the big emergency was which we needed to pull over for.  I told him what I saw and he just seemed perturbed about it and didn&#39;t seem! like he believed me. The road is a road that I drive almost e! very day , about a mile and a half from my house.  What I saw was akin to seeing a well lit, 2 story, 125 foot long office building floating stationary over a familiar area of trees that would normally be clear of any lights.  It was a very clear, very crisp sighting of something very solid and real.  I&#39;ve got to tell you also that I had an immediate thought that crossed my mind as soon as I could not see the object any more and that was, &#34;Could we have just been abducted even though it appears that we never left the vehicle, didn&#39;t lose any time, didn&#39;t pull over until the object couldn&#39;t be seen, and it seems that I was very aware of what I saw before, during and after, exactly as I have explained it here.&#34;  What I saw sticks with me like glue and it seems to get under my skin more and more as time goes by.  The past few years I have searched the internet for pictures and diagrams of objects other people have seen, hoping to find out if anybody else saw the same thing at any time.  I came! across the sketch that Barney Hill made of the object that they saw.  It looked to me that it was the same thing that I saw, only looking at it from the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was approximatley 2 miles distance and was heading in our direction. As we watched it grew into 2 orange lights which appeared to be travelling at high speed. It was below cloud height and above the Burton Dasset hills which have been known to have unusual occurrances in the past. After a couple of minutes one of the orange lights just disappeared and then the other. There was no logical reason for the lights to be there as the area was rural with no houses or other buildings in the vicinity. There was no sound but it appeared that the orange light was emitting an auroa around itself before it disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness uses the European convention for a numerical date.

I was driving home from an ASU night class, and noticed the lights as I neared my house, near the southern base of Camelback. I thought at first it must be some optical illusion or some kind of reflection, but it was obviously not a reflection. These were lights, similar to those seen hovering over Phoenix in March, 1997. (I just saw a television special and pictures from the night in March, 1997, and was shocked to see the exact same thing captured on tape) The lights hovered for what seemed like a very long time. In fact, I felt very uncomfortable and frightened because I was living alone. The lights stretched out in a arc type fashion, stationary, evenly spaced and appeared to be as big as Camelback Mountain. They were very close to the top of the mountain. I looked away for a few moments and when I looked back they had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was coming down lower and lower and closer to the car lower than the 3 story Pac Bell building on March Lane.  It seemed as wide as the goodyear  blimp.  I was cutting behind the building to get to the aparment complex next door.  I rolled down the window to hear a motor and it was completely silent.  That was when i got scared.  The car almost stalled.  At that point I panicked and prayed to God that we not get taken up as I have heard that happens to people.  I checked my clock to make sure no time would had been lost.  I took my adult friend and her 2 children home (in the complex) and then raced back home.  When I got home I went to my backyard and could see it in a distance moving toward UOP.  I was also shocked at the boldness of it moving so slowly and so low.  My back yard was on Brookside Road at the levy.  I watched my clock and arrived home without losing any time.  I was stunned to the point of not seeming able to speak about it and my friend was as well.    A couple of years later I brought it up and asked her and her children exactly what they saw and it was the same.  Just recently I have felt able to tell others.   I still cannot even believe we saw it and I really do believe  that had I not prayed we would have been taken up.  I am now a 55 year old woman and at the time was managing properties in Stockton for a developer out of Roseville.  I had been with them for close to 3 years.  I am a professional woman and at that time my children were enrolled in private school.  My friend was in her late 20&#39;s at the time and  the  children were 10 and 8 years old.  Neither of us used drugs or alchohol.  Needless to say it was very frightening and I still look over my shoulder in  fear.  When I was about 6 years old I had seen a saucer very low moving fast across the horizon in Bay City, Michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could see spotlights emanating from the craft to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The road curves to the right and we are now driving towards the house, which is still on my right. Next thing I remember is looking up/out the back window and seeing the craft above the car. Each of the corners of the craft was full of multiple changing colors of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I remember is yelling to turn the car around which we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother in law, wife and I followed and watched the craft leisurely ascend to the clouds at a 30 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the only one who remembers seeing the craft the entire time. My wife and mother in law were in the front seat talking from what I remember and I never made a sound during the event until the time when I yelled to turn the car around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Up until the time I yelled turn the car around it was evening and dark out.  When we were following/watching the craft ascend it was light out felt like 4pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the only event that has happened in my life.  As a boy I remember seeing a head looking in my window on several occasions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember seeing a glowing light following our car when we were driving back from Eugene, OR to North Bend, OR where I grew up.  The light eventually flew towards and over the car.

The object was approximately 5 miles to our North and traveling from East to West.  The  object traveled approximately 4 miles  in 2 to 3 seconds. The object was descending on a 30 degree angle and disappeared into the ground. It was too difficult to estimate the size but it was not extremely large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Your actions and reactions before, during and after the incident?  Driving north on 1900 West stopping at the light at 1200 South Ogden, UT  The event was too short to react.  As the object was obviously going to hit the ground we expected to see an explosion of some kind but nothing happened.  Only the 2 of us in the front seats saw the object   How you lost sight of the phenomenon?   The object was descending on a 30 degree angle and disappeared into the ground somewhere near Farr West or Plain City.  No farther than 4000 North nor closer than 2700 North.

While outside watching birds with my wife, I was scanning the sky when I noticed what I at first took to be the bird we were looking for. Then I thought it was a small plane circling high overhead. It wasn&#39;t a bird. No movement of wings, it was a distinctive plane shape, rigid. That&#39;s what I used the &#34;cross&#34; shape; it&#39;s the closest description. I took a second look because several things bothered me: the object did not appear to be that high for its size. It wasn&#39;t a private plane. I can&#39;t explain that well. It just felt wrong. It seemed too small, and I started thinking it was a remote controlled device. But it seemed too high for that. There was no one near us however, and there was no sound at all, not the sound of a plane in the distance or that distinctive whine of a remote controlled toy plane. This is a quiet summer day in the country, and the object was over a empty field. You can hear planes all the time, from jets to smaller craft. I saw a private plane fly overhead during this time, and the difference was obvious. If this is all that happened, I would assume it was only one of the above: a high flying small plane, or a remote controlled plane. I wouldn&#39;t have thought much about it at all. But what it did next was very strange. I noted that it was flying lazy circles, like a bird, but a very rigid flight. That&#39;s why I could observe it for so long. Suddenly, the object &#34;took off&#34; shooting toward the northwest in a straight line. It disappeared from sight well down the road to the highway, OH route 66. It went very fast, gone in a second, and again, it was a perfectly straight flight path. Not the swooping movement of a bird. It shot off, like a gun fired it. It did not descend or make any bird-like movements. No noise, and it went too far for it to be a remote controlled toy. It astounded me. I don&#39;t claim that it&#39;s a UFO, but well, I can&#39;t explain it away, and it did not act anything like I expected it. It flew very fast and did not deviate from the direct line. My wife did not observe this part of it, and in fact focused on another object that was a bird, so she had stopped observing my object a few minutes before.<n>

I realized it was moving much to fast to be a clound and it had no running lights of any kind, which I thought was strange. I ran into my house and got a pair of binoculars, and raced back outside. I located and observed the object for about 5 to 7 seconds before I lost sight. It was an oblong oval shaped object, greater in height then width, black or dark gray in color, and at first I thought it might be a hot air balloon, but then I realized the shape was wrong because it was  symetrical about the horizontal axis and it was moving very fast, at least with the velocity of an aircraft. I thought I could make out vertical lines running down the side, but this impression was formed just as I was losing site. It was moving North to South across the LA Harbor area. Latitude 33.943182 Longitude -118.408042 (MapBlast). I called the LA Harbor Division Police department and at the time I called, no one else had reported see it.

Well again we had to turn around and head north again only to our surprise it was waiting, we immed. turned back around south and headed toward baker at the speed of 90 mph+  Brian then asked where it was, when i turned to look it was right on top of us, I could see what appeared to be airline engines in the back window, when i looked out the passanger window i could clearly tell this was no plane for the bottom of this aircraft was directly above us, but there was no noise, I yelled to get us out of here and proceded to raise the car windows, the windowswould not shut for they were bowed in, I noticed how bright it was in the car and at first thought it was the panel lights of the car, i reached down and turn them off and that is when we both noticed the lime green glow in the car, I looked straight ahead and noticed a car comming toward us and yelled for brian to watch out, when suddenly our ears popped and the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see second report from second witness in the vehicle that allegedly was chased.

I have hesitated to say anything up until now.  I work at a hospital in Midland Michigan on midnight shift.  I was outside on break walking west on Sugnet street at a little after 3:00 a.m. At the intersection of Valley Drive and Sugnet street I looked to the west up above the trees ahead of me.  It was a very clear night and a lot of stars were out.  I saw a VERY BRIGHT star hanging stationary just above the angle of the tree tops.  I thought maybe it was Venus, but it was VERY BRIGHT, too bright to be Venus.  It was so unusual that I stopped and just stood watching it. I had never seen anything like it in my life.  All of a sudden, over a period of 5 to 7 seconds the light gradually dimmed.  It dimmed down to approximately the same brightness as the numerous background stars.  It either dimmed, or it was possibly moving directly away from me at high speed.  There was no way to tell.  I kept my eyes on it, and suddenly it started MOVING slowly to the right (south) at a constant rate.  It moved for about 15 seconds and then stopped again.  I still had my eyes on it. At that point I pulled out my pocket laser that I carried to ping deer with when I&#39;m out on break, and using some twigs high up in the trees across the street as an aiming aid, I started pinging it with my laser. I was zinging it pretty good, but got no noticable response.  I then lost track of which speck it was amongst the faint stars.  I thought about it for awhile after returning to my work area, and decided to call Midland 911.  I asked if they had had any reports of strange lights in the sky that night.  The gal said, &#34;No, why did you see something?&#34;  I responded, &#34;Yes.&#34;  &#34;Do you want to talk about it?&#34; she asked.  I hesitated, and then thought what the heck, and I told her.  She was very interested in all the details.  I told her it was really weird.  Neither she nor I knew what to do with the report, so I said &#34;Just put it in the log,&#34; and we both laughed.  Later in the shift, around 4 or 5am, someone told me ! that the re had been two ladies standing outside of the Labor and Delivery entrance smoking.  They were under the parking lot lights and saw nothing but total darkness above them, however, they HEARD what sounded to them like something passing overhead in the darkness.  Whatever it was, they said it sounded BIG, it was flying low, and it was moving FAST.  Come to find out, THAT incident occurred about ten minutes AFTER I was pinging the mysterious light in the sky with my pocket laser.  It felt really strange when I suddenly realized that the two incidents may have been connected.  It sounded to me like whatever I saw and pinged with my laser maybe came back for a closer inspection of the hospital campus with its lights off.  Maybe.  I hesitated to post this report up until now, because I didn&#39;t record the exact date that it happened, but after reading the sighting posted out of Sanford Michigan I decided to break silence and submit this report of what I experienced (as well as the two ladies outside smoking ten minutes later).  Nothing else unusual was noted.<n>

7/1/00 02:30|Bismarck|ND|Light|10 min.|A small light slightly bigger than the surrounding stars darting to and fro for about ten minutes.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14479.html|360|ndxe200007| A small light slightly bigger than the surrounding stars darting to and fro for about ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out of the garage about 2:30 in the morning to have a smoke.  As I always do, I looked skyward to see what could be seen.  I spotted a light slightly bigger than the surrounding stars darting back and forth...moving to the left, hovering, then moving to the right.  It would hover there, than move to the left again.  Rather than a straight to and fro motion, it&#39;s path had kind of a circular jog at 9am and 3pm.  It was like it was circling around in a very tight arc instead of going in reverse, if this makes sense. It repeated this pattern over and over again the whole time I was watching it.  It was not exactly regular though, the time it hovered at opposite poles varied slightly.   As I recall, the light was comprised of three smaller lights, red white and green side by side, perhaps slightly triangular.  It randomly glittered but was not blinking.  It didn&#39;t seem to always return to the same place...it would dart rather quickly to it&#39;s next position, seem to hesitate momentarily, then move back again.  Because of it&#39;s dimunitive size, it was hard to gauge it&#39;s distance.  I could think of no earthly object or reason for this manifestation.  I finally became cold and went indoors.  I went back outdoors several times in the next hour to see if it was still there, and it was.  I finally fell asleep around 4am and that was the last I know of it.  Not very spectacular, but that&#39;s the way it happened.  The thing that most stands out in my mind is that I could think of no rational reason for this to be occuring in the middle of the night in the middle of North Dakota.  I did look for it several nights afterwards and did not spot it.<n>
7/1/00 01:00|Santa Rosa|CA|Sphere|4-5 hours|lots and lots of lights|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67504.html|361|ndxe200007| lots and lots of lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> To begin myself, my stepdad and a friend of mine were working in Santa Rosa on a commercial building and were sleeping on site.It was sunday evening/monday morning,we had just arrived there from a 5 hour drive,usually we slept in a van conversion but it was in the shop so we were in my compact car,it was still warm so my stepdad and friend decided to bed down outside,I was going to recline my seat and get a few hours before work started,I had my eye&#39;s closed for maybe 2 or 3 minutes when best as I can describe a feeling or a sense &#34;forced&#34; me to open my eyes and look to the north where I saw a &#34;star&#34; begin to &#34;dance&#34; in the sky, at first it was very slight and grew increasingly more pronounced,going from say where the sun is at 2 o&#39;clock right down to the horizon,sometimes straight sometimes in a tight spiral,down then back up again for about five minutes,once i convinced myself I wasn&#39;t dreaming I woke my stepdad and friend,they looked and confirmed that I wasn&#39;t seeing things,but were more interested in sleeping so dozed off again.More curious by now I grabbed my binoculars and watched some more, but now there were 3 of them,they held a triangular shape which seemed solid now, and continued to &#34;dance&#34;,but now they or it was &#34;dancing&#34; evreywhere,up/down,side to side,spinning,blinking in and out of view at lightning speed,when I looked without the binos it appeared as a triangular shaped object,but with them I could see 3 seperate spheres,that didn&#39;t appear to be connected to each other(I could see stars between them).The spheres themselves were &#34;thirded&#34;,rows of lights in the middle third and the &#34;thirds&#34; were rotating or spinning..the top and bottom counterclockwise,the middle clockwise.Ok here it gets weirder,the sky was clear except in the northeast just above the foothills a small thundertorm was heading inland,from where we were you could see clear night sky and the storm heading up the mountains in the NE,with the binos I could see the middle row portions firing lights or somethin! g into t he storm clouds periodically,when they did this lightning would flash in the clouds,this went on for about an hour and then suddenly even more &#34;stars&#34; began to shoot in  from all directions of the sky to begin thier own &#34;dance&#34;,some stayed as single spheres others coalesced as more triangles,for about thirty minutes new ones would come in,it was quite a sight to behold let me tell you,i watched absolutely mesmerized for roughly 3 more hours at this time 2 of the triangular configurations kind of blended into a &#34;star of david&#34; shape and appeared to move right towards me when they got as near as I could say within 1000 ft above me and an 1/8th of mile away I could see what looked like a 5 to 6 thousand foot across object now and it was &#34;cloaked&#34; for lack of a better word, in a star field,that is to say when looking directly at it now I saw night sky ,but blurred somehow like a mirage effect,it hovered for a few minutes thenbegan to drift away slowly at first then faster then &#34;poof&#34;..gone,when it did that all the rest of the &#34;star&#34; which had been &#34;dancing&#34; in the background shot away in all directions as well.To conclude since seeing this my life has never been the same..i wont elaborate on that sorry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.
