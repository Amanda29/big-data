Gradually, lights consistent with airplane were clearly seen, so no big deal.  Then what can only be described as an object of some type was jettisoned from the &#34;plane&#34; and floated downward for approx 5 seconds. There was a very clear light trail as it fell and my first thought was that the plane had jettisoned garbage (etc.)...until the falling object stopped, hoevered a moment, then moved laterally for another 5 or seconds and then halted. We had been out with my brother&#39;s son earlier with his new telescope and there were very few stars at that time to view (clear night, half moon).  When I left the house, there were more visible stars, but still few on the northern horizon.  I do know there was only one star clearly visible in the area where the plane was flying prior to the object falling.  After that object had taken up position, there were now two stars in the sky. My brother is a former LtJG with the Navy and pulled out binoculars to observe the plane before it peeled off.  His comment: &#39;I don&#39;t recognize the light patterns on the plane&#39; although he has been out for a seven years and things likely have changed. I have no idea how to characterize what we saw, though my first guess is that this is not a UFO per se but a surveillance device of some type.  Time issue: from the time the object dropped, it was about 15 seconds before the plane crossed near us (not directly overhead, but reasonably close).<n>

The intensity of the light decreased consistent with distance to that of a very small star as the object disappeared at the N/E horizon.

A number of people are seeing an object in the sky. I have personally saw it on two different occaitoins.  There is a light that appears in the sky in the north and sometimes in the north west. The object lights up for approx. 15 seconds and then fades away. Sometimes it will appear in the north and then in about 10 to 15 mins later it will suddenly appear in the north west. The pattern is random. Last night there were four adults in our yard talking and it suddenly appeard again. We all saw it. I ran and got my binoculars but was unable to see clearly what the object looked like due to the short time that it was visable. Over the last 7 months there have also been sightings of 3 and somtimes 4 red flare colored lights hovering and sometimes moving in all different directions. They appear together and then move in dissimilar directions.<n>

5/30/01 21:20|Chicago|IL|Other|a moment|Curving streak of light zooming astonishly fast seen last night over Chicago, and I got it on tape!|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17995.html|6|ndxe200105| Curving streak of light zooming astonishly fast seen last night over Chicago, and I got it on tape!<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Wednesday, May 30th, 2001, I was watching tv. When it was 9:00pm, I turned to the nightly WGN Chicago news program (courtesy of a cable channel; I&#39;m in TN). I had decided to watch it because I wanted to see if they were going to follow up on a report they&#39;d had the night before. Some minutes into the news cast, they began to do the weather. Before I go any further, there&#39;s something I need to explain so you can understand what I&#39;m talking about. I have a lot of time on my hands, I guess you could say, and for about the last year or so I&#39;ve been taping (with a VCR) those shots I suppose most news casts have where during the weather the screen switches to some live view of the city. I&#39;ve been doing this all this time in hopes of catching something strange on tape. And Wednesday night, after a year or so of waiting, it finally paid off! So, when that sort of shot came on, I was taping it. And within seconds, I was shocked to see what I&#39;d been waiting for all this time: a bright streak of light shot across the upper middle part of the screen and went BEHIND some buildings in the background, going INCREDIBLY fast. MUCH MUCH MUCH faster than ANY jet could go! So fast that I was only able to get a good look at it when moments later I went downstairs and used the other VCR to slow the tape down to a minimum. When it wasn&#39;t on slow motion, this is what it looked like: almost identical in appearance to a common shooting star, kind of streak-ish, but it was very different in that ITS DIRECTION MADE A HUGE CURVE!!! I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes. It (or another one) would also appear again a few seconds later, this time shooting up from the lower right hand corner of the screen and zooming just as quickly to the upper left! (AGAIN, THIS/THESE WAS NOT A SHOOTING STAR!!!) Upon playing it like I said in slow motion, it was also noticed that a third streak could easily be seen (you couldn&#39;t miss it!) coming into the picture just as the camera finally went back to the newscasters. Needless to say, I HAVE THE TAPE and I&#39;ll always keep it. I don&#39;t remember the exact time, but it was around 9:20pm CST. The streaks were a bright yellowish-white in color. As for my background, I&#39;m 18, and I&#39;ll be going to college in August.<n>
5/30/01 15:00|Sacramento|CA|Cylinder|2-3 minutes|Shiny cylindrical shaped object seen over Sacramento California|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17865.html|7|ndxe200105| Shiny cylindrical shaped object seen over Sacramento California<n> <n><n> <n><n> While enroute to the theater to see  a movie on May 30th, 2001, at 3:00 ppm in the afternoon.My wife and I noticed what I believed to be a commercial jet aircraft. The sky was clear and we were traveling in a westward direction. The object was at about the &#34;11:00&#34; position in a south west direction from our position. Because of my interest and background in Ufology I tend to pay a little more attention to things in the sky then the average individual. I naturally assumed this was a plane ascending from the Sacramento airporrt, and was at such an angle that I could not see it&#39;s wings. As we drove for a few blocks the object seemed to hang in the air, which again I assumed that we didn&#39;t notice it&#39;s movement because &#34;we&#34; were moving. At that point we made a left turn, proceeding south and the object was now directly in front of us at about the 11:00 position.Being that we had traveled a good distance I and were a a different angle to the object, we should have seen the wings at that point. Having no reference point, I&#39;m going to guess the size of this thing as that of a commercial aircraft as that&#39; what I thought it was in the first place. It was a very shiny metalic and all one color, and cylindrical in shape. Well now as one might imagine, I became very excited, and pulled over to get a good look at this thing. When I did so, my vision was obstructed from some trees, so I got out of the vehicle and walked to the other side of the trees until I had that portion of the sky back in my field of view. The object was gone. Based on the rate of speed this object was traveling, and the length of time we had it in our field of view, if it was a conventional aircraft, we should have still been able to see it. So in conclusion this object was only out of our sight for a few seconds, and would have had to move at an incredible speed to be out of our field of view. I look forward to any news of other witnesses.<n>

It is extremely rare that he will wake me up. I got up, let the dog outside and noticed a completely silent, but lighted object in sky. It was brightly lit (white light) and there were very bright flashing lights (white light) directly underneath which were either rotating or pulsating from different areas underneath... no pattern to flashing. The object was travelling South to North, although at first it seemed to be stationary for about 1 minute or so. It slowly made its way to the horizon and left my field of view. Initially I would estimate it may have been approximately  1 mile beyond my location travelling North. Perhaps this was some sort of military craft, although completely silent. Travis AFB is North of my location... very strange indeed. I only wish I had grabbed my video camera. I was just standing there trying to figure out what I was seeing. This is the first time that I have ever seen anything like this and have heard of your website through Art Bell&#39;s radio show.<n>

The one on the right was higher in the air. It looked to us as though they were communicating to each other.  The one on the left disappeared.  We tried to video tape the one on the right.  Last night we went outside to check.  It was a cloudy night , so we thought there was no way that we would see anything.  The were no stars, the moon was barely visable, but one of the UFO&#39;s was in the same area as the night before, however with the fog, or clouds, we did not get a good look.  This is no joke.  Am trying to find out how to report it. There were UFO sightings in our town years ago that were investigated and are documented from what we have been told.  A lot of people think it&#39;s a big joke, but my husband and I have seen them on three seperate times now.<n>

I first saw it was an airplane but this one was flying very high and did not have the red blinking lights all airplanes have and there was no noise coming from it. When it disapeared into the clouds there was an additional flash of light about ten times bigger than the object. This flash did not come from the object itself. This flash of light looked like one of those spotlights they use for promotions but it was not fully round and it flashed for about 2 seconds. All I want to know is if somebody else in Tempe, Chandler, or Scotsdale saw the same thing. As I said, it flew south so people in the Casa Grande, Arizona area would have to have seen the same thing.<n>
5/29/01 19:53|Torrance|CA|Changing|15 minutes|I watched what I thought was an exhaust trail in the sky over Torrance as it moved, changed shape and color in the sky|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17854.html|13|ndxe200105| I watched what I thought was an exhaust trail in the sky over Torrance as it moved, changed shape and color in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday, May 29, I was driving in the South Bay area of Los Angeles county throught the city of Torrance.  I had driven east on Sepulveda Blvd and turned north onto Madrona (Prairie Ave), traveling north. As I was passing Del Amo Fashion Mall, I casually glanced up at the sky and saw what I first thought was the exhaust trail of a jet plane. I was going to dismiss it but it looked kind of odd. It was white and kind of short and stubby looking, like the plane had just turned on the exhaust.  The shape reminded me of the forked tail of a bird.  The thing that was most unusual was that it appeared to be at an angle that looked like the &#34;jet&#34; was diving.  This was an angle of about 60 degrees or more from the horizion.  It was sighted to my left, northwest of where I was driving. I thought it was somewhere near LAX Airport or over the ocean near the airport. Because of that angle, I began to keep my eye on it because it looked like something that was crash-diving.  I thought that it may be a meteor or space junk re-entering the atmosphere but it did not appear to move.  The trail did not get any longer and it did not dissapate.  It did appear that the two tails were merging into one. At this time I looked at my clock and the time was 7:55 PM PDT.  When I noticed that this &#34;exhaust cloud&#34; had not moved I paid closer attention because it did not act like a jet or anything leaving an exhaust trail behind.  Then at about 8:00 the exhaust cloud appeared to move!  At first I thought it was an optical illusion since I was still driving so I closed my eyes quickly and then looked back at it and it was moving!  The whole &#34;cloud&#34; had began to move! What I thought was the leading end (pointing downward) started to arch around, pulling the whole &#34;cloud&#34; with it into a horizontal line!  As it moved it began to glow and changed colors from white to a  bright orange-white line that then remained stationary in the sky glowing orange-white.  At this point I came to a stop light where there were cars ahead of me that cau! sed the view to be obscured.  When we started to move again, this &#34;line&#34;  was still horizontal to the ground but it also seemed to be lower in the sky than before.  Unfortunately as I moved toward Hawthorne CA, the houses and trees were more dense so it was more difficult to see this object.  I continued to sight it until I reached the area of Marine Ave and Prairie Ave where it was then obscured by trees and buildings.  I stopped at my home for less than 5 minutes and then tried to spot it again as I drove toward the 105 freeway but I could no longer see the object.  I don&#39;t know how it moved away or if it did but it was no longer visible.<n>

I work outside and being an avid ufo buff I watch the skies as much as possible.  I watched the object for about 5 minutes until it went behind some clouds and I lost it.  The interesting thing is that while watching the object a commercial plane flew right under or close by it.  Due to my angle of vision I could not tell how close. The object was silver in color and a little smaller than the size of a pinky nail at arms length. Also, a I watched the object there seemed to be a haze or unfocusable area around it.  No sound, and no light.<n>

On 5/28/2001 at 10:10PM CT in Schaumburg, IL I witnessed the following event while walking my dog in the office park where I work.   Visibility was moderate to good and the moon was clearly visible in the high SW sky.  I normally witness slow moving lights at least every other night which I generally assume are low orbiting satellites or other orbiting man made objects visible to the naked eye. This night proved to be no exception when I sited a slow moving light, which came into my visible horizon from the center of the constellation Orion on about a 15 degree arc westbound.  The slower then normal movement and higher than normal arc suggested a higher orbit to me.  The light was of the same power relative to the constellation, constant, clear and easily discernable.  After approximately 35 seconds the light was approximately 20 degrees past straight above me in my eastern horizon when a very fast moving light appeared overhead (I was lying on my back, looking up and slightly NE so &#34;overhead&#34; means S/SE).  This light crossed from my Southern horizon a few degrees east of due north to the first light in not more than 5 seconds. Its  speed initially startled me. This was too slow and deliberate and visible for too long to be falling debris or a meteorite.   Also, it was about twice as bright as the first light.  I took these facts to mean it was a very low altitude satellite.  My heart literally skipped a beat as the odds of catching two visible satellites crossing paths flashed in my mind.  Rather than simply cross paths, however, they met exactly.  The brighter, fast moving light was not visible after the intersection and the slower dimmer light seemed more slow and more dim and in fact disappeared within another 10 seconds.  While the first of these facts may be explained by the slow moving object exceeding my eastern horizon, it was at least 1/3 higher on that horizon when I lost site of it than in the Western horizon when I first sited it.  I see no simple explanation for the disappearance of the fast mover 20 degrees past directly overhead when I sited it at least 90 degrees in the Southern Horizon. I returned to the site today with a compass and took accurate readings from the very place I sat the night before (the grass was still pressed down).  The data above should be exact to within about 5 degrees.  The amazing fact is that I did not look at my watch.  A friend did call me when I just left the office on foot with my dog and the phone log read 9:45 on my friends phone.  It takes me 7 minutes to walk to our spot and as it was chilly night here, I started thinking about leaving after only 15 minutes. I own a software consulting company here in Schaumburg Illinois and consult for a specialty coatings company that caters to the U.S. Navy and U.S.A.F.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we found him to be an exceptionally skilled observer and reporter of objective fact.  Under ordinary circumstances, we would have assumed that a witness who reported such an event would be describing two satellites, which happened to be visible in proximity to one another.  However, the witness in this case had allowed for such a possibility, and had rejected that on the basis of facts of the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Further, we observe that an orbitting body in polar orbit, traveling to the north, would not enter the Earth&#39;s shadow.  We share the witness&#39;s interest in this sighting.  PD))<n>

I wanted to see how well it could zoom in on a high flying jet. I set out a lawn chair, and watched the sky until I could find a plane. The moon was out, and I was looking at it.. to the right of the moon I saw an object that was about to pass in front of it. That&#39;s where I began filming. The object was so small and high up, I had a hard time zooming in on it in focus. If it wasn&#39;t for the moon, I would have hard even a harder time, because it helped the camera focus. The center of the video was cut out by the Cleveland Ufology Project (Who I gave the video to).. which contained several minutes of me zooming in and out trying to find the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Cleveland Ufology project gave the video to Dr. Bruce Maccabee.. a leading Ufologist. Who told me after viewing the video..  The object appears to change shape, like a string of balloons, but I know it&#39;s not that, I don&#39;t know what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I handed over the video to the Cleveland Ufology Project..  I handed it over to the news.. Cleveland Fox 8.  They said it was an optical allusion of a jet.. I find that impossible because of the maneuvers it makes, such as at the beginning.. its flying sideways, and in reverse while facing forward.  Then it turns facing down towards earth all while appearing not to drop in altitude or slow down..  it turns until it faces forward with its direction of flight, but always stays moving the same direction.<n>

It came to a stop and hovered at what I would estimate to be between 3-8 thousand feet. it was a vertical shaft of white/yellow light with a red light shaped like an upside down horseshoe at the bottom. it pulsated and dimed. when bright it had a triangular shaped light near the top. it made no sound as it moved. it stayed in it&#39;s hover and sometimes turned, bobbed around and weaved. then i noticed further away another one with a similar shape and color pattern. at times these ufo&#39;s alighned themselves at the same angles as if in formation. they stayed like this for approximately 2 hours before i saw what i thought was some sort of helicopter or plane comeing to check them out. it turned out to be another craft that was more square in shape and seemed to sparkle or light up at a more rapid rate. this smaller craft seemed lower to the ground, maybe around 2-3 thousand feet. what was striking about all of this is that it was a fairly cloudy night, but when the ufo&#39;s were presant the clouds seemed to part the same way a boat makes a wake behind it. dogs in the neighborhood were howling as this was taking place. these ufo&#39;s could move in any direction and made no sound. the sky/clouds seemed to take on a reddish hue when they were lit. they would dim themselves then get bright again. they left after a few hours then came back at around 3-4am ...same cloud wake, same position in the sky...right before they left the one closest to me seemed to approach the other farther away then they dissapeared. it was the greatest thing i ever saw in my life and i will go to my grave believing that what i saw could not be of this earth.<n>

Well after the fire finally went out we all turned over, and looked at all of the stars then all of a sudden three strange crafts flew over our tents about 250 yards up. They had extremely bright lights a redish, orange color we all got on our bikes and followed them (they were easy to follow on the account of the bright lights). We finally got to the bay after about half a mile of riding it stopped over the water and stayed there for ever we were about to leave when a bunch of really bright lights went off we could&#39;nt see anything when the lights eventually went out they were gone we managed to get a picture of it. My friends our really flabergasted still to this day about what we saw we went home immediately and instead of staying outside any longer we went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From about 9:30 PM to 10 PM, towards the NE and SE, I saw a light blinking three times, then no further activity.  One of these was yellowish, moving vertically, one white and stationary, and one of them was white and moving diagonally up, and it blinked three times, than another three before it disappeared.  The only one that didn&#39;t do this was SE and very low, moving back and forth behind some trees.  I only see one at a time, so I don&#39;t know how many there are. I think this is a regular occurrence, and shall try to keep watching. On a weirder note, the things seem to disappear when I call them to the attention of another person.  I am probably reading too much into this, but there have been other stories like that. Oh yes-and that night, before sunset, I saw four military choppers in the area.  You never know..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is anonymous.  We do not know what is being reported here.  PD))<n>

On one of the pictures, I sight an ball-form object the origin of which I cannot understand. On one side it is rather transparent, on the other side it makes deep shadow. Moreover, the elliptic shape of shadow seems be not in full correspondence with the shape of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took the photo of the object unwittingly; I didn&#39;t mention it that time. Thus, I didn&#39;t observe it directly by my eyes. Therefore, only from the context of the surrounding environment (bushes, hills on the background) I value the dimension of the object as 10 &amp; 20 meters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course, I scaned accessible to me video records of other participants of the flight. On one of them, I found the object. It was taken roughly 50 seconds later (the aircraft flight a circle). The object has divided into two pieces and was rising up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time is approximate.  PD))<n>

It appeared to reflect light from a metalic surface.  Attempts to view it closer with binoculars made it appear to be two spheres joined together.  We photographed and video taped the object(s).  As clouds passed in front of it it remained luminous but held it&#39;s position.  It appeared for approx 1 hour, and we became bored with it and went about our day, but kept checking for it. Clouds became more dense and it was obscured.  Witnesses were myself, my husband, and our 2 sons ages 11 &amp; 12.<n>

At first I believed it to be a police helicopter or a satalite of some form, this was until it began moving very quickly to the east. The speed inwhich it moved ruled out a helicopter and its direction ruled out a satalite as they move with the Earth to the west. We looked through the telescope and saw a pyramid shaped object with four red lights, one on every corner. The object seemed to be rotating as it moved. The rotating increased in speed just before it moved away at a speed which seemed to be very slow although the object became very small very quickly, this leads me to the conclusion that the object was moving at an incredible speed away from us. This would explain the loss of size.<n>

I ran to the car to get my binoculars naively thinking that if this was too bright to be a regular satellite, maybe it was the International Space Station.  When the object was about at zenith, it slowed to a stop.  My friend and others camping in the area exclaimed in surprise when this happened.  I trained my binoculars on the object and discovered that it was actually two objects, one glowing bright yellow that we had been following with our naked eyes, and the other much dimmer and glowing a deep, deep blue.  While the yellow object was now moving very slowly and steadily, the blue object seemed to orbit tightly, rapidly, and haphazardly around the yellow object, constantly changing directions and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After meandering around the sky above us for maybe 1 or 2 minutes, it began to climb.  I could not judge its altitude.  People around us thought it was anywhere from 20,000 to 100,000 feet up.  Through the binoculars, I guessed that it was about 1,000 to 10,000 feet up and climbing, but who knows?  Eventually, the blue object slipped behind the yellow object and I never saw it again.  At that moment the yellow object began to gyrate rapidly and wildly in a small area and seemed to leave a short trail.  I thought maybe my binoculars were shaking, but this was not the case since the background stars were not themselves gyrating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued to climb quite rapidly until it was difficult to see even with the binoculars and then we lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m guessing this whole thing lasted about 6 minutes, and the whole time we did not hear a sound from the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is certainly possible that this was some kind of hoax since the RTMC might be a tempting target for hoaxers.  I also considered aircraft from a nearby airport, but its behavior and appearance were unlike any aircraft I have ever seen, and it did not make a sound.  The RTMC is held up in the mountains at a YMCA camp.  The air that night was cool and very still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to see if at any point the space between these lights would block out the stars behind it, but I could not come to any conclusions mostly because it was always moving and was small even in the binoculars.  Funny that I had a nice digital video camera in the back seat of the car and didn&#39;t even think to use it!  About a year after this happened, I contacted an organizer via e-mail.  He saw it, too, but felt that the object was &#34;in the hundreds of feet up&#34;, and given the venue was probably a hoax of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a computer programmer and my friend is a mechanical and electrical engineer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location of the RTMC can be found here:  http://www.rtmcastronomyexpo.org/index.html<n>

This sighting was entirely below storm clouds.  THree times I saw a blinking white light--first, about 10, low, going back and forth a few times.  It disappeared when I told Dad to look at it.  THe second time, I happened to glance out my window and it blinked three times, perfectly stationary--and I know there&#39;s no tower in that spot.  THe third time--wow!  At about 10:40, the light started careening wildly around, probably did it for 7 seconds or so, and then I stopped watching.  I didn&#39;t want to see any more!<n>

They hovered and blinked. He was so scared he cold not move. He tried to wake his little bother but could not wake him. After a few minutes there was a rumble out side his window and the lights and noise went away. After that all the Dogs started howling. I got up to yell at my dogs but my son did not tell me till the next day. Now my son is very scared of the dark. He has to sleep with the lights on now. He told me that he don&#39;t want the lights out because he thinks something will come for him but he can&#39;t say what.<n>

My stepmom, youngest stepbrother, me and possibly my other stepbrother, saw the &#34;object&#34; sometime in May-June 2001 around 9-10pm or so. I don&#39;t know if anyone besides us seen it. I&#39;m not sure if it was just our imagination, a small unannounced explosion, or a small meteorite that wasn&#39;t found/reported or something else. It only lasted a few seconds, so I wasn&#39;t able to grab the camera from my dad&#39;s room to take a picture. The next morning, my stepmom heard that there was a farm with dead cows and other animals in a field around the same area we saw the weird light. We aren&#39;t sure if it&#39;s true or not.

5/26/01 20:00|Olympia|WA|Disk|4 minutes|young children experience a near abduction by a UFO in their own back yard in Olympia, Washington, May 2001.|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20771.html|35|ndxe200105| young children experience a near abduction by a UFO in their own back yard in Olympia, Washington, May 2001.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two children ages 6 and 9 witnessed in their back yard a huge flying object in the sky that flew toward them at a sharp angle and rested over them with a huge bright white light in the center beaming down on them.  They both ran for cover under the eve overhang of the backyard cottage.  They were screaming for their mother in the house,  &#34;mom, mom, help us, help us&#34;.  The oldest felt that the &#34;space ship&#34; as she called it was trying to steal them.  This is why she grabbed her younger sister and hid from the light.  Both girls have drawn the pictures of what they saw.  The saucer shaped UFO had many, many lights circling around the edge of the UFO that seemed to change shape and the middle had a huge center of bright blinding light the size of the cottage itself.  After about 3 minutes, they both ran through the beam of light for about 5 feet and got to the back door where their mom was standing inside the door.  When they began toward the house across those five feet, the &#34;space ship&#34; took off at high speed diagonally in the sky and disappeared.  The UFO made a horendously loud sound as it hovered over them, both girls said.  When their mom tried to go out to see, the girls struggled to keep her in afraid that the &#34;space ship&#34; would steal her away from them.  She within a minute was out in the back yard and around the front yard looking for evidence of any airplane and it was dark and silent.  The surrounding area did not have many trees and the sky was mostly visible.  There was no trace.  The girls continued to be clingy for the rest of the night.  The mother remembers the lights of the house flickering and for some reason did not barely hear the sound nor react to the calls of the children as would be expected.  She does not understand this at all.  She is a very protective mother and watches her children closely.  What is intruiging to the mother about this incident is that her children had not been exposed to any UFO pictures, books, TV, videos, CDs or even ideas.  They did not watch television, n! or did t hey attend a public school.  They were completely nieve and yet they drew a picture that resembled other UFOs that the mom has seen drawn and described an experience that was truly terrifying and real for them.  She wonders why they felt like the &#34;space ship&#34; was trying to take them away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their father has encountered a UFO in another house three years earlier where the sound was so loud he was holding his ears and the light was blinding.  The same mother, his wife  and the two girls much younger were in the house and barely heard the sound and did not see the blinding light.  They were all in the house but in separate rooms.  She wonders what all this means.  Why has her husband and children seen UFOs in her presence when she did not.<n>

Sky was light blue as the Sun was already behind the Mountains. Object was round and white with center larger and brighter then Mars sighting at 23:00. A white aurora surrounded it with two pulsating points. If the object were a clock the points would be at 10:00 and 2:00. The points grew short then long (At first I thought this might be a new two tailed comet). I took my view finder off of my telescope and observed that the object was divided into three colors. The left edge was purple, the center was lime green, and the right was an orange/yellow color. Couldn&#39;t utilize my telescope due to the Tripod being attached to our Jet Ski. As we continued for our Arizona destination, all inside the truck kept observing it. At this time it was fully dark. Small cloud formations were seen moving under the object at various intervals, until it just disappeared.<n>

A bright yellowish-gold sphere like triangle, moving in circular motions. Straight up and straight down, lights got brighter before it moved in rapid streaks. There is also star looking objects located in a circualr design around this object, some of the &#34;stars&#34; were like a blue-diamond color &amp; the rest were the same color as the big one,it seemed as though they were moving the same exact direction, speed, and distance as the big one. It looked as though the sky was covered and these rotating objects have not changed The big one (is in the middle of this formation)would stop in mid-air and not move for awhile. This object has stayed within the same area for quite some time now. I know this has to be a sighting...Don&#39;t you???? Breathtaking, but not knowing how to get a closer/better look at this. Incredible!!! The sky behind and on the sides of the object was lit up. Now it has been in the sky for at least 3 hours, it has moved to the east,looks like the lights are bright white and a beam is coming from it. it is zig-zagging with rapid speed and then stopping and just hovering. I have taken pictures, but have not yet developed, considering it is still in the sky.<n>
5/26/01 01:15|Hillsboro|OR|Light|20 minutes|Strange light in Hillsboro, OR  (1 week after same type of sighting reported in Hillsboro by other witnesses.)|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17800.html|42|ndxe200105| Strange light in Hillsboro, OR  (1 week after same type of sighting reported in Hillsboro by other witnesses.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early Saturday morning of May 26th around 0100, I went outside for some fresh air and gaze at some stars. It was very nice outside so I went back in to tell my girlfriend to come out and see a very beautiful nightsky, since we&#39;re both avid stargazers. She came out and I went back inside for a few minutes, as I watching TV, she ran in the house to grab the binoculars, saying she&#39;s seeing strange lights flying around. She ran in again and told me to hurry up and come out. OK, OK I said to myself, probably a airplane or something. I waited for a commercial to come on and went outside. She excitedly gave me the binoculars and pointed to the direction of these lights. Before raising the binocs to my eyes, I saw a couple of flashes in the distance, low on the horizon maybe 20 to 30 degrees up. As I looked in the glasses, sure enough, a flashing &amp; dancing light, blinking reds, whites and blues. The direction we were looking was a SSE direction from our patio. It was flashing on &amp; off changing colors and moving so erraticly, I knew right away I was seeing something strange, not an airplane, a star, or planet. We&#39;re both amature astronomers and look at the nightsky alot, we both never seen anything close to this! My girlfriend had been watching this object for about 10 minutes before me, and I observed this for about 10 minutes myself. The way this light was moving around was so strange, blinking and showing up in a different direction, but staying in 1 general area the whole time we watched it. I strated getting dimmer towards the end and slowly sank below a distant tree and disappeared. We both are clueless on what this was, a definante UFO dancing under a very beautiful Mars and flashing in and around a rising Sagittarius constellation. Just Incredible! I thought about this websight right away since I reported a fireball a few months earlier. Low and behold! Checked the May 2001 reports and saw a report of a light seen in Hillsboro, OR by 3 witnesses on May 20th, word for word described exactly like what we&#39;d seen (on May 26th) We could&#39;nt believe it. They reported having a videotape of their sighting. We don&#39;t have any photographic evidence, but sure would like to see their video! Other witnesses said they seen the object in the vicinity of Farmington Road and 210th Ave. Thats the exact area we were seeing our sighting, we&#39;re loacted by the area of Minter Bridge and River roads, a couple of miles from Farmington Road.  Again, really need to see this video! Thanks<n>

I went into my room and went to bed, but was compelled to look out my window.  I looked and saw two orange colored dots.  The first one flew off quickly, northward, while the second one stayed.  It went up, down to the let, back to the starting point, down right, and slowly rose upward, as if it had just abducted sombody.  After that, I instantly fell asleep, though I know I was not aslep the, for I remember a splitting headache as it left.  It looked as if all this was happening in the center of a trailor court to the west almost a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Just about star size, reflective like it was reflecting the sun.  It looked like it had something on the back that was flipping back and forth also reflective. I didn&#39;t see it leaving a trail and their was no sound.  Just guessing maybe 20,000 feet up.  I thought it was a high altitude baloon but it was going very fast.  I estimate it was going about four times faster than the jets in the flight path to DFW overhead.  The path it took was in a straight line to the west.  When I went around on the other side of the house to try and see it the sun was in my eyes.<n>

From white, to red, to blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were stargazing, and I happened to look towards the south.  There were three what I thought were three stars, or satellites in a perfect equalateral triangle, when lo and behold one of the triangular points of light leaves the triangle and starts heading to the north.  I pointed it out to my friend, it looked like a medium bright star.  Then, all of a sudden, it became a very bright white light...my friend said, &#34;Hey, that satellite just winked at us!&#34;  Then, it turned from a bright white color, to a very ruddy, rusty red color.  Then, it went from rusty red, to a strange blue color...from blue back to that weird red color.  It seemed to be going about the same speed across the sky as a satellite, and kept a very straight course.  Eventually, it looked like it was getting even higher (it looked damn high to begin with), until it eventually disappeared from sight.  It was a nice, colorful show.  Can satellites do this?  I have never seen one that could go from white to red to blue before.<n>

I saw what I thought was an airplane off in the distance.  It was too far to make out a shape, and all I saw was a flashing light. It was heading south bound at a pretty high rate of speed when i just stopped and started heading north bound.  Again, it stopped and just sat there.  I went inside to get my grandmother just to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing things.  When she came outside, it was still sitting in the same spot, and after about 3 or 4 minutes it began to move up and down.  We were both perplexed as to what could be flying like this, so we went and got my step mother.  She too thought it was weird. It was flying in very odd patterns. like zig zags, and in circles, and straight up and down.  They finally got bored with watching it, but I stayed outside.  It had been blinking the whole time, but after about 4 minutes of them going inside, it had an extremely bright flash and it was gone.<n>

Did anyone else see these lights?<n>

It was like a diamond shape object. It had like one light on each side, and in the top middle another line with little lights. It seemed like it was like a crystal color. When the sun started coming up, the crystal color and the lights seemed to fade away. It turned into a silver color. It was in the same position for two hours. It also seemed like it was spinning. Then around 6:20 it just vanished like magic.<n>

It was brighter and much larger than Venus, which I could plainly see to the left. At the time of the sighting I was in my car listening to a local talk radio show and someone called confirming what I was looking at. The last time I could see the object It had gained altitude greatly, this was about 6am. Many people had to of seen this due to the duration of the sighting and the population density in the area.<n>

We were driving south on a road near an elementary school and a small neighborhood.  We first saw a ball of light hovering above the treelines.  It seemed to me like there was a car stuck in the top of a tree with it&#39;s brights on, as we were driving past it, I noticed that is was cirular.  It then ascended straight up, and appeared to be going southwest towards another neighborhood, I then sped up to about 60 miles per hour and watched it above more treelines.  Then it disappeared.  That whole part lasted only about 20 seconds.  We talked about what was just seen, and continued driving back to my house, about 2 miles away, as we approached the airport area, we noticed a lot of activity in the sky.  We counted approximately 9 helicopters, and about 7 smaller aircraft.  As we came to a stoplight we noticed a huge triangular craft, that seemed about 1,000 ( I know it had to be more) feet above my car, I went to get out of my car, but my friend stopped me.  We could see the underbelly of this craft, it was huge!  It had red, blue, and white lights, none of which were blinking and made no sort of sound... also the craft appeared somewhat shiny. It was just heading north in a very slow fashion.  My friend, who is in the Navy said it reminded him of a &#34;Super-sized Harrier jet, minus wings.&#34;  I have no idea what that means, but that is how he described it.  This aircraft continues North and did a 180 in the sky, just like that turned a half circle and headed south, then we lost sight of it.  we were about 6 miles from my house and were still counting other small aircraft in the sky.  Right as we turned into the main road that leads to my neighborhood entrance, we was another one of the triangle craft.  ( I am not sure if it was the same one, or a different one, if it was the same, it had somehow gotten to where we were without us seeing it)  This craft seemed to be much higher than the other one, and it circled my neighborhood.  It was still visib! le when we pulled into my garage.  I personally was terrified, and called the airport.  My friend went out back and tried to see if he could see anything through the trees.  He could not.  The lady at the airport was very frantic and hung up on me.  So I did nothing else about it.<n>

We were playing outside baseball I believe whenever we happend to notice a bright glowing light over one of the hills, it didnt really have a color that I can describe and it was a little smaller than a golfball size, my friend said that there was a radio tower nearby and thats probably what it was. We kept playing our game and we ended it at about 10pm whenever we couldnt see anymore. We got in the car with his parents and began the trip back to his house. We drove for about 10 minutes whenever I happend to look out of the window and notice that I could still see the bright light. I told everyone in the car (including his mother and father) and me and him started to stare at it behind of us. What was weird about it was that no matter how far we traveled it never got any smaller. Then we came to a stop sign and I seen it ..this is hard to talk about its really freaking me out just remembering it, it makes my eyes tear up and I get goosebumps.. but it stretched from a circle to a long line in the sky the same color as the orb, this line was about 2 inches long and it just appeared as if the craft completely changed shape, it went past the car then returned to an orb shape and waited for the car to get ahead of it and started moving again we watched and watched until we went over a another hill and couldnt see it any more. We went back to his house and watched all night to see if we could see it but we never saw it again..Ive never really told anyone about it because it scares me to think about it even to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first we only saw two of them, but they seemed to split in half and become four.  We watched as they appeared to be passing back and forth between one another. We could not judge their size but they seemed to fluctuate between red and blue.  They stayed there a long time before suddenly shooting off.  Oddly though ever since we have had a compulsion to make oddly shaped models out of instant potatoe - which we think is unusual as we normally don&#39;t eat anything that isn&#39;t organic.<n>

I can describe it best as a rotating oval with green lights around it. I at first thought it was a blimp but quickly realized that is was not anything I have ever seen before. It moved Northward at a slow rate. Slow enough I ran inside, told my friend who followed, and ran out the back door to follow its progress and was able to still see it on the way moving north. I then decided to get in the car and chase it. I turned onto Third and drove north passing Iroquois Manor. I then turned up Kingston heading toward Southern Pkwy at which time I again could see the object near Iroquois Park. I lost it behind some trees then and never saw it again. We both saw this and are certain it wasn&#39;t any conventional aricraft.<n>

I watched it for a few seconds and pointed it out to my husband who was sitting next to me (he was the passenger, I was the driver) and he saw it immediately.  This round shaped object traveled faster than any plane, but slower than a meteorite, was not a plane or helicopter.  We watched it fly westwards towards the Malibu area in an arc, and vanish in the sky.  Immediately afterwards, I saw two helicopters flying, coming from the southwest to north flashing their lights. The helicopters were lower and closer than the craft we saw.  I had the feeling these helicopters had seen the object and were trying to find it, can&#39;t say why I had the feeling - just did.<n>

Anyways, I was standing on my porch smoking and I happened to look up towards La and at about 30 degrees up in the sky I saw a very bright sphere pulsing a white light on and off the span between pulses was about 1/2 to 1 second.. I watched it for about ten pulses (hence my event duration) and it then it faded from sight. I got up out of my chair and walekd out onto my lawn to see if it had gone behind the trees..Nothing.. I don&#39;t know what it was but I will swear on my life that it was not a plane, helicopter or anything recognizable to me.<n>

(elev.3195 ft. &amp; part of the White Mountain National Forest), in North Conway, NH, I was gazing several miles out at the remainder of light from the dusk sky. At best guess, I&#39;d say between 700-1000 feet above the highest peek and perfectly aligned with the horizon, one bright, star-like light/size appeared from no where. The first light split into a second identical light and quickly moved horizontaly southward leaving a very faint and momentary light stream behind it. It moved about 300ft to the left of the still lit, first light and came to a complete and sudden stop. At this point, the second light did the exact same thing as the first (eg: same split, same size, same light trail, same distance, same sudden stop) leaving three identical lights above the mountain for about three seconds. Then, once in position the first light dissapeared (much like someone switching off a light), followed by the second, and then the third. Since there was still enough dusk light in the sky, I scanned the sky for the silouet of a plane, a glider or anything that might have given off such a light.......the sky was perfectly clear, with the exeption of a few faint stars just beginning to appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was this in the sky in North Hollywood Ca. This happen during the early 1980&#39;s  In 2001, I lived in La Mesa California and resided in a 2 bedroom apt in a upstairs unit. I remember lying in my bedroom on the bed, and the room was brightly lit. I felt tired, and I asked my live-in boyfriend to go to a nearby taco shop for Mexican food. After he left I dosed off and feel asleep. The next thing know is my boyfriend returns and as he is entering my bedroom, he says very load &#34;wake up! The food is here&#34; as I opened my eyes I saw a gray like creature do a spin and disappear near my bedroom window. The first thought that ran through my mind was that after I feel asleep something was in the room with me. I didn’t tell my boyfriend for fear that he would think I was nuts. So, I didn&#39;t a word to anyone about what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE NEXT NIGHT: I had been on my computer most of the night. I then told my boyfriend that I was going to bed early, he stopped watching T.V and joined to go to bed. As we got into to bed I turned the lights off, but the room was lit from a light outside attached to the building. So, the bedroom wasn&#39;t completely dark. My boyfriend and I feel asleep after talking for a little while. In the middle of the night I woke up sweating, for some reason I was very hot. I got up from the bed and walked to my right to the corner of the room to wipe my face from sweat with one of the clean towels that I had in a laundry basket on the floor. As leaned down I grabbed the towel and wiped my face, and as I was wiping my face I notice something behind me that seemed to be small quickly run past me I turn to my left and looked to the floor and saw nothing. Then as I laid I dropped the towel, again I saw something moved. I turned to the right side of myself and looked toward the floor and saw nothing, and just as though I am seeing things. I notice something behind me to the left side. I quickly turn and looked and saw this small creature hovelling down to the floor. It had lizard type skin; it was mixed of colors of Black, dark green, dark gray. The little creature stood up and stretched his arms that had attached skin that appeared to be broken wings. The eyes were black and the feet looked liked hoof of a pig or horse. When the little creature aroused up it stood about 8 ft. tall, and it moved in a slow jerking move jerking manner. It stepped across the bed in one step, while it was stepped across the bed boyfriend woke up and tried to yell there was no sound he was only moving in the bed in fear. After the little creature stepped across the bed it turn toward me backing up it&#39;s back up away from the bed then it stopped with it&#39;s arm and body in a hunch, and sat still. I look at it and wonder how it be so small again, boyfriend was trying to turn on the bedroom light and hear him asking me &#34;what the HELL is that thing?&#34; I was speechless and never said a word because the small creature was still in the room looking straight through me. I look down at toward the floor to wonder where its long legs had gone. I notice that was another creature sitting next to it with its head hunched down to fit in the room. This creature was enormous in size. It had I long face with black eyes, it sat like a dog sitting straight up. I notice that it had two horns attached to its head that went straight back, it had the same colors as the little creature, but the feet were different. I so afraid because it was so BIG! That is when began to shake all over. Suddenly, I though about all of the people that said they were abducted and not believed. Then suddenly in a (psychic way) for a quick moment I saw a far away planet, where many humans were and not returned to earth. I was these many of the same type of creatures in a militant stance. They seemed to be angry, and then it all went away. I saw the two creatures standing in the room again. I thought of my children, and thought that I would never see them again. Suddenly I hear the large creature say with an angry tone &#34;LOOK AT THOSE HUMANS&#34;, that&#39;s is when I quickly jump onto the bed and buried my head into the blankets and began praying, I quickly yelled TURN ON THE LIGHT! I don&#39;t why I said that. My boyfriend said I&#39;m trying, I&#39;m trying it won&#39;t come on. Then suddenly the light comes on, and I jumped toward him, and we look at the direction of the creatures and they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this seemed like it took place in 5 mins but it was really hours, because I ran out of the room to called my family and noticed the time and it was almost 5:00AM in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t think that I have ever been that scared in my life. To this day I wonder if anyone else had seen anything like that. I have looked on the Internet and have never come across an event like my boyfriend’s and mine. I do believe that what I saw in that brief vision like moment was these creatures preparing to attack us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not concerned if this is believe by others and many may say that, but I only wanted to share my story with others just in case they have had experienced the same thing as I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

Then I noticed right away there was circle shape object was making a straight line from north to south then made a loop around and shot out south at supersonic speed. It was redish purple in color and from where I was sitting I could tell it was very far from me and only a quarter inch across in the sky. This was my 1st sighting in my life and I am 47 y/o. It&#39;s changed the way I think about things forever. My friend saw one similar to the one I saw tonite and told me to report it right away which is what I have done. I never thought I would have ever seen such a thing with my own naked eye. It was amazing.<n>
5/21/01 22:00|Budapest (Hungary)||Light|max 1 minute|small star became very bright light. Faded back to star and moved away.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17723.html|74|ndxe200105| small star became very bright light. Faded back to star and moved away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my balcony facing east (having a quiet smoke) and just staring at the stars. Suddenly one of the stars became bigger and brighter. At first I thought it was a plane on approach to Ferihegy, Budapest airport. They often turn the &#34;headlamps&#34; on when over our part of the North of Budapest. However there was no noise and the &#34;lamp&#34; was very, very bright. It was also very big. I estimate about the size of a finger tip with arm outstretched. Furthermore it never moved for about 10 to 15 seconds. Then the light faded back to a small star size over a period of about 10 seconds and moved north and disappeared after another 10 seconds. The move to the north was only about two hand widths before it vanished. I thought it could have been an aircraft turning away from me. But aircraft with landing lamps do not turn that quickly. There was no noise and no other aircraft lamps (strobe, etc). I have watched other aircraft this evening and when they are near (about 2 miles) I can see the other lamps and the &#34;headlamps&#34; are not anywhere near the size or the brightness of the unidentified flying object. Here I speak literally rather than emotionally. Another thought was of a meteorite. But meteorites move quickly. This was stationery and then moved to one side after fading. Very strange. Any thoughts?<n>

I turned to my husband and said what kind of plane is that?  It was huge.  He said it wasn&#39;t a plane it was too big and it wasn&#39;t moving.  I said get the camera. He got the camera and started taking pictures.  I got on the phone and called the news station and they said I was the only call they had received and that they would check into it.  The lights were Very bright.  Three across. Kind of an orangish color.  They were situated for above the &#39;Mandalay bay&#39; hotel (that is where they looked like they were from our view) they seemed to tilt a little bit. Then one by one the lights slowly faded until they were gone.  A little while later (about 15 min.) they were back but farther towards the mountains (more towards the Stratosphere) They were in more of a chevron v.  Same thing happened but this time I called a couple of people to look and the only one to answer was my sister-in-law, but from her home she couldn&#39;t see anything.  I called another news station and the guy just laughed.  I told him we had pictures but all he said was he would check it out.<n>

It started with what was believed to be a shooting star from the general direction of the sighting.  One bright light appered and seemed to not move.  Then a sencond light appeared to the south of the first, then disappeared.  The second light reappeared followed by a third, then a forth, then a fith.  The pattern of which oreder they appeared I&#39;m not sure, but I am sure the first to appear was the last to disappear.  They were in a random patteren with the first light maintaining the highest point.  All lights appeared to stay stationary.  They then disappered one at a time, with the last one splitting into two lights before it disappeared.  This sighting lasted around 20 mins. I was able to capture sighting on video camera, although it it was getting to be dusk you are able to see all lights and watch them disappear.<n>

I had a schedule at hand and a good pair of binoculars. At 01:10 GMT, what appeared to be a satellite showed up in the southwest, moving to the northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unbelievably, it instantly made a 90 degree turn to the northwest. After making that instant change in direction,it began to slow down to a stop! Then I saw another,coming from the southeast on a course to join the first craft. As #2 was approaching #1, #3 showed up in the far northwest. It was not as bright as the other two and appeared smaller, but was very fast.I followed it for about 5 seconds and when I looked for #1 and #2, they both had disappeared. These craft were surely not satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 1 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

The objects were like laser light and changing shape. they followed us quiete a while and we could see them from the windshield very clearly. My friend being a religous person claimed that they could be angels. The objects appeared to be around 50 meters above us. Those 4 object were seperating and coming back together again. If some kind of flying objects would follow us and take pictures or so, they would fly the same way they did. I have seen the same kind of object previously around September 1983 in Istanbul. The similar object was moving big distances very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The report is reminiscent of four advertising lights in the night sky.

They claimed to be able to manipulate matter, and like, they made this tree turn into an amazing babe!!!!! She danced around and this amazing far out music was all around!!! Then one of the lights said &#34;check this out man if you don&#39;t believe we&#39;re for real&#34; and the whole sky went &#39;crrrrrrr&#39; and changed into like an amazing whirlpool of colour and sounds and more babes!!!!!! It was WICKED man! They said they had to go and visit a cool planet full of talking fish in another galaxy, but will return soon to check we aren&#39;t at war etc.<n>

He asked to to come and look at it through the window.  I too witnessed the bright orange glow that seemed to light up the ground and sky.  We then went outside to get a better look.  Once outside we both witnessed six objects in the sky.  They were grouped in pairs.  There were 4 lights, 3 in front-almost in a row-and one in back, forming a triangle shape on the object.  The light in back was  red-the three in front were white-appearing a bit yellowish-blinking in sequence from left to right.  They were lower in the sky than the stars and lower than most airplanes, moving quite rapidly.  When one object would blink another object would blink back.  One pair flew directly over our heads.  This is when we saw the most detail as discribed above.  The three pairs were spaced in three different directions in the sky all flying in approximately the same direction.  They then disappeared.  It was a very clear night.<n>

It looked like a small airplane was in the sky with landing lights on. Location South of Famington Road by like 5-20 Miles and South of the hills in the back ground before hillsboro metro. (Say go left for 10 mi. from Farmington at 210th) As I saw it I told him I thought it was a plane and went back to watching the show. THEN, he said oh my god look at that, THAT IS NOT A PLANE! I looked and saw the light suddenly get wider in the sky like 10 airplane landing lights side by side and it was at like a 25 degree angle in the sky! It was flashing as bright as an arc welder and looking like a giant crack in the sky with an arc welder showing through from behind! Then it got small and dim once again. Then it faded out and came on in an area that was across the sky and this time had a dim red light that pulsed dim then bright. It was moving very slowly towards the original spot and then it kinda started to glow brighter and the red light faded and it kept repeating this dimming out of site on a clear starry night and then appearing in another spot and then flashing very brightly not like any thing you have ever seen in the air. Like sparks in an arc welder at say maybe 2000 feet. I ran for my video cam and started to film what this light was doing as it seemed to have a kinda revolving black circle or spot that went around it and the whole thing started to change colors like a lava lamp of rainbow colors very bright. At sdome points the lights were almost to bright to look directly at. This whole color thing lasted for only a short few seconds, but made us all gasp as did the bright welding flashes. I said enough and ran for the van with my cam. I went out to Farmington at about 206th and started West. I stopped after turning left onto a side road. I could see it about 5 miles away between me and the hillside. It was not just blinking kinda red and looked a lot like a helicopters lights but made no sound on this very quiet country road. Suddenly as I pulled over up the road (I thought I still had the cam on stand bye but I later found I was too shocked to hit start button.) I stopped to see a better cam shot and it pointed a direct red light more in my direction that looked sort of directional. Then it let got dim white and let out a very bright! white b urst of light that made me gasp! I went on but couldn&#39;t get closer and finally lost it among the skyline.

A sun-shining Sunday afternoon, I watched a lone, low storm cloud move southward towards the city.  As I was helping a customer fix email connectivity, I focused on watching the cloud swirls and wisps.  I noticed a shiny flicker under the cloud ceiling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I honed in on the shine, I clearly saw 5 oval, pill shaped crafts, stationary in a 5 dot pattern formation.  The ships would then all swing up and out, down and back in to produce a new 5 dot pattern. (I likened it to braille patterns.  I got the impression they were producing communication with the different patterns.)  They continued to display different patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly put my customer on hold and ran to an adjacent room where 4 of my co-workers were on calls.  I hollered with authority for all of them to put their calls on hold and hurry to my window.  All 5 of us stood at the window watching these crafts move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed, under the southern most tip of this lone storm cloud, was a 6th craft fully stationary.  As if in a supervisory roll, or to monitor any &#34;dot pattern&#34; messages being sent to them, idk.   The storm cloud was not high in the sky, it was smaller and by itself, so lots of sun shine.  All 6 air ships had dark bottoms and shiny metallic roofs.  I figured the dark bottoms helped them stay concealed under the dark looking storm cloud.  You probably wouldn&#39;t notice them being underneath, they may not have caught your eye to make you look up.  Remember, I was on the 18th floor looking across to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flew over the area of Rocky Mountain Arsenal State Park, or the Oil Refinery in Commerce City.

This was unusual as we have no street or bright lights in the vicinity. This light was almost shining on my face. My cat was looking out the window as I got up and looked out the door. I saw approximately 3 unidentified flying objects hovering and darting right and left from each other, almost playing tag in a Northeast direction. These craft were at a distance like a low airplane. They were diamond/cyclinder shaped with bright, small lights bouncing off and changing color. I hid behind the wall and when next I looked they were gone...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

We suspect that a UFO would probably not hover over Ottawa for two hours, and we receive only one report about the incident.  That is only a supposition, however.  PD))<n>
5/20/01 01:30|Yarmouth (Canada)|NS|Light|5 hrs|Four lights over Yarmouth Harbour that would blink off and on and move at rapid speeds and then remain motionless|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17757.html|92|ndxe200105| Four lights over Yarmouth Harbour that would blink off and on and move at rapid speeds and then remain motionless<n> <n><n> <n><n> After midnight I was driving south down Main Street in Yarmouth when I noticed what looked to be a star out my driver&#39;s side window to the South East. I then thought the light must be a planet because it was so bright. I was marvelling at the brightness of the light when it all of the sudden became less and less bright until I couldn&#39;t see it. I was astonished and speechless. I pulled over to the side of the street in a parking spot. Not many people were around and there was only the occaisional taxi that was driving people home for the night. The light then came back on and was in the exact same spot as before. I scanned the same region of the sky and found what seemed to be three more stars of less brightness. For three minutes all the lights stayed in place. Then some of the lesser lights moved around at astonishing speeds as the very bright light stayed in place. It was like fireflies in the sky. Then the lesser lights stopped on dimes in the sky and remained still. They appeared to be elevated about 7500 ft to 10000 ft in the sky. It was hard to tell how large the craft or lights were. I was a little spooked by this and went to get a coffee around 2 a.m. in the morning. After getting out of the coffee shop around 3 a.m. the lights were still in sky. Every so often the lights would blink out and I could not see them. Then as soon as I thought they were gone they would reappear in the same vicinity. At one point three lights (the bright light along with two less bright lights) seemed to form a triangular formation. I was blown away by how still these lights were. The last time I saw the lights was at dawn over the Yarmouth Harbour. I will never forget this event during my lifetime.<n>

I walked to the bank of the Swift river which runs beside the campground. I noticed a light moving across the horizon from east to west. The night was cloudy and the light was below the clouds moving in a straight line. This was a solid bright white light traveling about the speed of a jet. I&#39;ve seen jets before up in these mountains and they had blinking lights. Passaconaway is located in a mountain valley so the object could not have been more than mile from our location. I yelled to my brother inlaw and he also observed it. We did not here any sound and I backed away from the river listening for any noise as the object went out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

When they saw it, My aunt started running and screaming, Finally it looked as though it dissappeared. Okay we went into the screened porch area, and sat around and talked about it for about an hour or so, and then my son looked out in the sky and there it was again, except this time it was four round balls of light, the same color,but this time it had formed like a triangle shape in the sky.

May 19,2001 Two people saw a cigar shaped metalic object extremely high above the scattered clouds.  It was first sited by my friend and we didn&#39;t know what it was.  It flew directly over us until it was out of our sight.  It gleamed in the sun and was moving at a very high speed.  The shape was more of a elongated oval.  From our perspective it looked somewhat like a missile or something that we could not identify.  We watched this object for approximately two or three minutes.<n>

As I waited for the jet to fly near the object I noticed that the jet, approximately five to six thousand feet in alltitude, was nowhere near the object. The object seemed miles higher. As we watched the object for several minutes, we questioned what we were looking at and all had the same observation.The craft tipped sideways several times and revealed a oblong saucer shape. One time as we watched, it tipped forward. There also seemed to be a haze of some sort around the object. Only one conflicting observation among the three was made,one of us thought there was a shine to the object. The only thing odd about the object was it just didn&#39;t belong there. There was no fear or excitement,no noize of any kind. The sky was perfectly clear not a trace of a cloud. This was not a ballon of any kind,no hellicoptor or plane or planet. We all had plenty of time to watch this object which stood rather still most of the time. It acted like it was watching something.<n>

It took less that a minute for the light to cross the entire sky and out of our sight.  We were all pretty confused as to what it could have been and tried explaining it, but everything we could come up with didn&#39;t seem to fit.  It moved at a constant speed, it didn&#39;t fade in and out or flicker, which a meteor would do, and moved far too fast to be a sattelite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

It appears as a satilite at times and dissapears like some of the other reports that people have posted here. This object appeared this time at about 15 degrees directly south of the zenith at 9:34 pm on 5/18/01... The object moved directly north from south and moved very slow after turning a very dim orange in color. This object appeared right before my eyes at the location i mentioned and was a very bright light blue like light that got 3 times the size of the planet Jupter at it&#39;s brightest and when it dos this it dosn&#39;t look to be hardly moving at all if any across the sky....... After about 10 or 15 seconds glowing bright like mentioned it dims very rapidly to a dim orange in color and starts moving off very slowly still but faster than when it was brightly lit up. Since ive been seeing this object for over 3 years now ive given it a name and call it Kilometer 6....... When i observe this object again i will refer to it as such and thanks for reading..<n>
5/18/01 21:34|Mounds View/Blaine|MN|Rectangle|8 Minutes|5/18/01 Minnesota sighting of unusual object which ejected at least 3 others before splitting in two and disappearing.|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20898.html|110|ndxe200105| 5/18/01 Minnesota sighting of unusual object which ejected at least 3 others before splitting in two and disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I had just finished watching the Blues/Avalanche NHL playoff game on TV (which ended abruptly in overtime) and as I was frustrated that my team lost, I immediately proceeded to get ready to drive my sister home to St. Paul. She went outside ahead of me, while I grabbed a quick glass of water for the road. It was about 2134 CST on May 18, 2001.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds later she yelled for me to hurry and take a look at something which was moving slowly almost directly overhead in the sky (which was clear). I stepped out of the doorway and looked up. What we saw for the next 6 minutes is as follows: A large object almost directly overhead, slightly east of our position, which was at a point just west of Interstate 35W and just south of US Highway 10 in Mounds View, Minnesota, USA. As I have been trained in this area, I estimated this object to be at an altitude of somewhere between 8000 to 10000 feet. The object first appeared as an oddly shaped rectangle though roundish on the bottom, with a deep-orange seemingly pulsating or shimmering underbelly, similar to a liquid metal appearance, with what appeared to be brighter orange highlites (which appeared as possibly tubular openings) in the front end which I viewed just prior to it passing overhead, which then hid those frontal features. It also appeared to have a halo, or jellyfish type of bubble on the top of the object well above the shimmering orange bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving very slowly from the east to the west/northwest, and made no sound, and no other lights of any kind were visible, though its general shape seemed to ebb as its orange underside was unstable as it was pulsating slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this was something that I have never witnessed before, it seemed significant enough for me to dash inside to grab my video camera, and I  was fortunate enough to tape nearly two minutes of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After taping this object for nearly a minute, I was surprised to see that another object seemed to be released from the main object and zip away from it fairly quickly, with this splitting visible in the frames prior to my nervous jerking of the camera to get a better angle as it was moving behind trees. Within seconds, the object released an additional two (possibly three) objects which are clearly visible on the tape. These objects seemed to fall in a downward motion though they could have been moving into the distance. One object is shown to fall off vertically behind trees while it suddenly reappears a second later moving horizontally and completely disappearing a few seconds later. This also is clearly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this second release of smaller objects, there was no apparent change in the main object&#39;s structure, though it seemed with the naked eye to dim slightly after the release.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About thirty seconds later, the main object then split into two major sections and the sped off in opposite trajectories from each other though in a seemingly downward motion in relation to the camera&#39;s angle, which was pointed upward at an approximate 45 degree angle in relation to the ground. The objects then disappeared from view behind trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have estimated that in relation to the camera&#39;s angular position, that this object split apart in the vicinity of Coon Rapids, Anoka, or Champlin, Minnesota, or in that general region, to the northwest of Mounds View.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were at least three witnesses from our location: myself, my twenty-year old sister, and my forty-nine year old then roommate, who only saw the object briefly. I yelled for another individual who had been entering his vehicle a half-block away to look, but the person either didn&#39;t understand or didn&#39;t fully hear me trying to get his attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My personal credentials include military service in the United States Army as an MOS 16T10 (Patriot Missile). As this is an Air Defense position, I was specifically trained to spot and identify all known types of aircraft and other flying objects (balloons, missiles, drones, military flares, meteorological phenomona, etc.). Despite my background, I have no experience with the object I witnessed this particular evening. I can personally attest to the facts presented herein, and can faithfully presume that it was not an aircraft, nor a &#34;shooting star&#34; (meteorite), nor a military flare, and certainly not a weather balloon (the wind was blowing from the west to east at about 10-15 mph yet the object was moving east to west/northwest -into the wind). Additionally, the sun had already set, yet the object was luminescent or emitting its own light on the side not facing the sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time that this object was sighted, I did notice a high-flying commercial jetliner that was flying from west to east at an approximate altitude of 36,000 feet, and was visible from its exhaust contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In terms of its possible size, I would judge this object as it first appeared overhead to be the size of between a 747-400 and a C-5A military transport aircraft. The object certainly was well below the altitude of the high-flying commercial jet which was moving in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To describe its size in a simple form, if you basically stretched both arms over your head and put two thumbs (and possibly another half of one thumb) next to each other, that&#39;s the size it appeared at its closest point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to share this story with your investigators and the general public because I felt that it was significant enough to warrant further investigation to determine what the object could possibly have been, and as to whether there were other witnesses ( which I have noticed that there was another sighting in the St. Paul, Minnesota suburb of Hastings about 2 hours previous to mine with a similar description) and if there have been other similar sightings with similar object behavioral characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There has been some local investigation by the Minnesota MUFON network field investigator, and he is apparently still putting the finishing touches on his report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am highly interested in knowing if your organization has connections to those who may have experience with video tapes, and who would be interested in examining the tape to determine the light source evident on it, and possibly enhancing the tape to show more detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your efforts regarding this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In closing, I would also like to share that within a few days of this sighting, I made attempts to get local media coverage of this sighting. Copies of the tape were made in the studios of KARE 11 (NBC affiliate), WCCO 4 (CBS affiliate), and KSTP 5 (ABC affiliate). None of the organizations returned any information regarding the sighting for a possible story, which I find highly unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also contacted the local air traffic control center, which is a major regional center located in Farmington, Minnesota. They told me to contact the control tower at MSP (Minneapolis/St. Paul International). I spoke to a supervisor (whose name I&#39;ll give if needed) there regarding possible radar tapes from that evening to see if an object was sighted, but was told a few days later that nothing unusual was on those tapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also interested in what local television weather radar, NWS radar, and NOAA weather radar scans show for that specific time period on 18 May 01.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you once again.<n>

I was driving the Quad and my friend on the back seemed to be shocking me with static-like electricity. We both were feeling very odd in a good way. I saw a bright light ahead of me and I stoppped the bike and turned off the ignition. We were hearing very high frequency sounds that would change pitches to sounds I have never heard before. Sounded like the pitch a cricket makes but steady. The sound also sounded like we were under very large power lines. The sound a neon light transformer makes. They were effecting our emotions with the sounds they were making. We felt totally enlighted by these visitors. They were giving our bodies rushes of chills and overflowing feelings of peace. Best feeling either one of us has ever had. They were doing this at will and we were loving it. We stopped 3 more times along the 12 mile road to watch them. Same things happened every time. There were at least 10 of them following us down the road. We were surrounded by them. They also made a very low frequency bass noise too. They were having fun with us. One of them was on our left coming over the hill. A bright white light that we could see approaching through a Palo Verde tree on the hillside. It came closer and closer to about 100 yards away about 120 feet high. Then it went to the right going slow. Behind us were smaller red lights flurrying around like nothing I have ever seen. I feel they know what you are thinking and you can communicate with them. I would ask questions to them in my mind and the answers would come in feelings corrisponding spontaniouslly with the sounds (vibrations) that they would make to us. The second time we stopped I heard and felt a presence behind us about 50 feet on the right. I was not ready to see an alien yet so I did not even look. I just started my bike and took off. This was the most incredible experience my friend and I have ever had. Now he is a believer and I am 100! % convin ced now. We are not alone.<n>

I had been fishing with my father on the Dania Beach pier since midnight. It was also a moonlit sky, with the Moon positioned over the Eastern sky which lit up the water and clouds below,  As I looked out over the surf I witnessed a red light coming from my left field of vision moving left to right over the water, a few miles out. Behind this light, my father and I witnessed two contrails that were lit up by the moonlight, which seemed to chase this bright red light, which did not pulsate or change color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light suddenly stopped for a second and lowered its elevation, made a quick maneuver to the right and continued south along the coast. The contrails could not keep pace with the light, which then again stopped, this time the orb seemed to expand and become brighter. It then bursted into many fine particles like an industrial firework, then this same process went into reverse and it seemed to implode and collapse on itself and then disappeared over the water. No sound was heard or did we see debris of any kind fall from the orb. My jaw just dropped and we could not believe what we had just witnessed. The contrails finally fizzed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a matter of a minute we then witnessed two military jets fly into this area over the water. They were military because they had one red pulsing light on the fuselage and I grew up on an air force base and I am familiar with how fast they move.  These jets were probably scrambled from Homestead AFB. We then thought, could the military be conducting missile tests over open waters right off the coast? We tried to come up with a rational explanation. Until this day I feel that the military was trying to shoot this object (UFO) down.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was mooving  directly above me from east to west. I thought it was a satelite untill the light did a radical change of direction,making about a 30 degree turn to the south west without banking or slowing. It was then I could see the object had shape and a white glow. It made another sharp turn without banking and now was flying due south. The object never made noise and had allmost a wobbly, eratic way of flying,though it flew quite fast. I watched the object fly south for what I judged was about three miles when it did a 360 degree turn without banking or slowing down and came back over me.  It appeared to be a little lower and looked to be somewhat trianguler.  The object continued on this path and flew into some clouds and I never saw it again.<n>

We observed how clear the night sky was and could see some constellations.  Two moving objects that were not stars were overhead.  They seemed to fly closer than airplanes fly.  One had lights that quickly chased around it in a straight line.  The other had a more sporadic light pattern going all over it.  They crossed paths and moved in opposite directions in the sky.  All three of us stood together and tried to rationalize what the objects could be.  None of us had seen anything like this before. We watched the objects for several minutes.<n>

I was with three of my students in my car after a long vocal recording session.  Two youngsters were in the back seat, one was seated up front. It was approximately 10:20pm, we were just leaving the recording studio, which is located in the back yard of a private resident.  I pulled my car forward and was about to make a U-turn when I saw a large object moving slowly South, in the sky, just over a large tree.  It had one light on the belly of the craft, which illuminated the bottom.  It appeared to be a light gray metallic color.  The shape of the craft appeared to be triangular, however, we could not see the top.  It was in close proximity though, because we could clearly see the color, and a metallic reflection from the light. I stopped the car and pointed out this low flying craft to my students.  We all thought it was a military vessel because of how big it was, and, we were about fifteen miles away from McClullan Air Force Base. However, one of my students commented on how slowly it was moving.  It appeared as though it was just hovering, because it moved so slowly.  I shut off the motor of my car and rolled down my window.  This is when my students became agitated.  There was no sound whatsoever.  Then the craft went beneath the tree line quite suddenly. My students became very nervous and asked me to re-start the car and begin our trip home.  The car started fine.  We all continued to gaze at the large tree as I cirlcled the car in the opposite direction.  It was when I stopped gazing, and put my eyes back on the road that I heard my students cry out, for the craft had re-appeared and was moving much faster now.  I stopped the car to watch.  It was indeed moving faster, and in the same direction. One of the kids started to cry, and become almost hysterical, yelling out  &#34;Go, Go!&#34;.  I turned my eyes back to the raod and hit the trottle.  All three cried out again, almost shrieking, because the craft had shot straight up in the sky and disappeared.  I did not see this however, but by the pale faces of the kids, and the tears welling up in one child&#39;s eyes, I didn&#39;t doubt for a moment what had happened. The kids begged me to drive faster to get home, all the while, keeping a fixed eye out the back window. I am not an expert, nor amateur in military or commercial craft, and neither are the kids.  It could have very well been something that could have been identified.  But, for a craft to suddenly move straight up and disappear seems brow raising. What is also interesting, is that the kids have not spoken a word of this to any of their friends.  I asked why, they stated that it scares them too much to talk about it.  Well, I suppose you can blame that on too much tv and movie influence, I just don&#39;t know. All I do know, is what we all saw that night, and how frightened the kids were...yes, I was a bit nervous myself.  I know the kids and I won&#39;t forget this experience either. I personally would like to know what it was.  If this sounds like a common craft, I would like to be told what it is, so I can tell the kids.<n>

Subsequent investigaton shows cloud ceiling at 9,000 ft. with family estimating altitude of 5,000 feet, with closest approach 85 degrees almost overhead.  Viewed through binoculars by husband and wife, with 378 feet linear diameter field of view @1,000 yards(translating into approx. 7 degrees angular field).  Binocular field of view could not contain the entire triangular object.  That is, husband and wife could NOT see the entire object within the field of view of their binoculars.  Obviously, these witness estimates cannot pinpoint the exact altitude, dimensions, etc. of this object, BUT these are credible witnesses who are able to question their own perceptions.  Investigators on this case, having checked law enforcement, Iowa state climatologist, and FAA, are convinced that whatever was seen was, indeed, &#34;HUGE,&#34; and since we cannot easily explain it, it remains in the UFO category. ADDED TO INVESTIGATORS&#39; INTEREST IN THE AMES AREA, are reports of a neighbor to the above family having seen an unexplained aerial object BETWEEN/BESIDE their adjacent homes on a previous occasion. ALSO, the wife witness in the above case had a daytime sighting three years ago near the southwestern part of Ames (this is town of permanent population of around 30,000....student population at Iowa State University obviously swells the population considerably) PLUS, we have been contacted with abduction reports by several individuals in the Ames area - all witnesses thus far check out as highly educated, credible individuals with (as far as we can tell) their &#34;psychological&#34; feet on the ground, i.e. not wanting to over-conclude, but realizing that they&#39;ve been able to remain conscious at least part of the time during encounters involving UFOs. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT - only 7 miles from Ames in 1996, two crop formations were discovered, with plant and soil samples subsequently being submitted to Dr. W. C. Levengood&#39;s non-profit laboratory in Michigan, with lab results clearly showing anomalies associated with the formations. AS AN INVESTIGATOR, I NOTE THAT someone else from the Ames, Iowa area turned in a report to NUFORC recently, without leaving their name so that they could be contacted by MUFON investigators.  I would like any individuals who are reluctant to report to us to know that MUFON DOES NOT REVEAL WITNESS IDENTITY, unless that witness is willing to be revealed publicly.  We have NO WISH TO EXPLOIT ANYONE!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Bev Trout for submitting the report.  We encourage any other wintesses to the event to contact her directly.  In addition, we would invite other witnesses to submit brief reports to NUFORC, using our Online Report Form.  Thank you.  PD))<n>

It seemed to be stationary and several thousand feet away, I watched it for about about 3 minutes. It did not move in relationship with our aircraft. I had unbuckled my seat belt to get a better look when the stewardess told me to refasten my belt. In that brief moment that I looked at the stewardess and then looked back out the window, the UFO had disappeared. At 8:22 it reappeared about 50 to 100 miles away! It was much smaller now, very close to the horizion and I could see that it was moving very fast, it was not leaving a vapor trail but it was still glowing very bright. We were coming up on a thunderhead and our flight went to the left of it. The UFO went to the right of the thunderhead at 8:25 PM. When we got around it the UFO was gone and I never saw it again. At 8:30 PM another airliner passed about 2000 feet below us, this winged aircraft was plainly visible and not the same type of craft I had just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several sighting reports submitted by same source.

I was watching it for about a minute--it seemed to be a bit wobbly when finally after 45 seconds after I watched it, it then burst in to two smaller objects of the same size.  They did proceeded to move in a strait line from where the initial object was.  They were moving very slowly and they were both travelling in opposide directions-- one going southwest, the other going northeast... watched the object for another minute or so and then watch it go over the tree line.<n>

I saw what looked to be a triangular craft traveling north - northeast at a fairly high rate of speed. There weren&#39;t any sounds of aircraft. I didn&#39;t notice any lights but could see the outline of the object. I guess I was a little surprised and didn&#39;t think to move at first but, in a second or two, ran around the rail and into the yard to see if I could catch another look and I couldn&#39;t spot it. I was hesitant to report the sighting because it was such a short one and I had recently watched a program about triangular objects possibly being the stealth blimp (I thought I might just be seeing things). I am usure of the exact night and didn&#39;t have any plans of posting this, but I had been to your sight before and as an after thought decided I would check out the sightings and see if there were any recent ones in Oklahoma. You don&#39;t need to post this, I just thought it might be helpful in conjunction with the other tringular sightings reported here this month.<n>

I could not tell the particular shpae of the object, only that the band of yellow light appeared to be rectangular in shape. The object dipeed down, with very quick &amp; precise movements, it quickly moved from the left to the right, it made circular motions, and it changed direction. I could tell when it turned towards another direction, because i could see less of the yellow  band of light. This went on for 45 minutes, it also basically stayed in the same area, though at one point, it turned direction, pointing down, diagonally at a 45 degree angle &amp; quickly zipped down in a diagonal direction. I did not see any other lights, and could not tell the shape, I also could not hear anything from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness calls again to report that the object apparently was visible again on the evening of Wednesday, 16MY01, although in a different area of the sky, and smaller in appearance.

The evening of the event I had just returned home, noticed the clear, moonless sky with only a slight haze that reduced visibilty approaching the horizon, and decided to spend some time seeing what I could see.  I shut off all the lights on my property but one that was blocked from my view by a tree, other than that the nearest light source was from my neighbors over 200 yards away.  As my eyes were somewhat adjusted to the dark by my drive home I was able to see that even through the haze lower in the sky magnitude four stars were still visible, except to the south where the glare of Syracuse blocks all but the brightest.  Scanning the sky for the usual satellite pass (I&#39;m a great fan of Heavens Above &amp; J-Pass) or even better the elusive meteor I caught a flash in my peripheral vision.  Knowing well that it was probably too late to see the display I turned in the direction of the flash (northeast) looking for any trace of a faint afterglow of the shooting star.  To my surprise in direct and clear view, three more flashes, points of light, brilliant, white, each about a second in duration, travelling on a path from low in the North to high in the East, each at a different angle.  At the time the lights seemed to rotate as though what I was seeing was actually sunlight shining off a highly reflective spinning satellite, or it may just have been twinkle do to the atmosphere.  The event was only a matter of seconds.  This was like nothing I have ever seen and over the years I&#39;ve seen alot. (hundreds of satellites &amp; meteors, aurora, fireballs, and even a re-entry!)  Continuing to watch the sky for about fifteen minutes for something to help me realize what this was turned up nothing, no &#34;flying star&#34; of a satellite, no regular red, white, green pulse of an aircraft, no jet noise.  I did not realize immediately because of an ubstructed view but the lights occurred in the constellation Cy! gnus, sp ecifically in the triangle described by Gamma Cygni, Delta Cygni, and Deneb.  The lights (I would equal to the shine of the ISS on a good pass) were much brighter than these stars as well as nearby Vega.  I have checked the mentioned Web sites and found satellites in the general wide area of the lights, but I do not believe that is what I saw. (no fade in/out of a satellite)  I am skeptical of UFOs but not ETIs, so here are some wild theories based on what I saw:  a bird or bat flying in and out of the shine of the one floodlight I left on; a satellite boosting to higher orbit; shooting stars entering head on in my direction.  I find it hard to believe any of these.<n>

This formation was followed by a huge ship that was rectangular,completely black with no lights at all.  This was followed by two more cresent formations,15 balls in each group, followed again by 15 balls flying at random,but in a tight gride. There looked like there was an observation window in the front of the big ship were you could see the outline of two individuals(aliens?). This sighting happened in broad day light.  I think the most incredible thing is the big ship was surrounded by what looked like fighters (balls of light) which lead me to conclude that were ever this ship came from it needed to protect itself.  Although this ship looked and acted peaceful, it was obviously prepared to protect itself, which in my mind would mean there are aliens out there that are not friendly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve tried for years to report this but didn&#39;t know how.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I observ air craft going over and it is obvious that the objects we are seeing are in space, not in our atmospher. They travel straight, then they sometimes stop, then move sideways and usually come from or go to or travel by that bright star. We have observed shoting stars while seeing the objects, and actually watched one as it passed in front of the bright star. Looking thru the telescope, objects appear to be a bright light, with a light hugh of red lights around it, not noticable with out the telescope. Objects also seem to make turn around trips to this bright star. I am 36 years old, My husband is 49, My daughter is 20, All of us have watched this for the past 4 nights around the same time.

The plane looked like a Boeing 747 or larger and was travelling from East to West at a height of between about 1500 and 2000 feet, or about 4 hand spans at arms length. The plane produced a contrail (chemtrail?) from the trailing edges of all wing and tail components. There were no engine pods observable on the aircraft anywhere, there was no noise at all. There were no beacon light flashing on the aircraft?. If you look at a map of Hobart the plane was flying over the top of the city and most of the suburbs of the city. It was coloured dark grey (battleship grey?). There were a large number of ribs running under the wings (in parallel with the fuselage.

My hobby is my telescope.  After I start the car I look up to see what planets are where.  On this particular morning I saw what appeared to be two saturns until one started moving.  I watched for a second, then ran in the house to get my wife and my daughter to see what I was seeing.  I then ran in to get the digital camera.  It appeared to be a bright light that flickered.  It was flying north in a wavering line. My wife went in to finish getting ready for work and I went around the house to get more pictures.  The object went behind the clouds and blinked three red lights then three white lights.  After leaving for work at around 4:55 I saw a plane flying from east to west.<n>

It was perfectly quiet and still outside and I scanned the sky as I always do for UFOs and I have done so the past nine years with no results until today. I was facing northeast, then looked up and just overhead and to my right I saw a lumious spheroid shape, moderately bright, white and yellowish-tinged, passing in a straight line from the Santa Barbara Channel in the southeast, to the northeast towards Bakersfield. It travelled in what seemed to be a course crossing directly over the southern end of town. At first I had to eliminate other possibilities: airplane, satellite, meteorite, space station, etc. I felt that it was too low to be in space and it was silent, so it couldn&#39;t be a plane of any kind. Also the light itself was too round and uniform in shape, and too yellowish in luminescence, from the point when it was over my right shoulder to the time I watched it disappear over the horizon of the mountains. A conventional space vehicle or satellite would show bright white and gradually either brighten or dim out as it crossed the terminator. This did neither. This thing was just too big and yellow anyway and did not change much in luminosity. It was just too big to be either a marker light or a landing light of any kind and it was not on any established airways. I estimate that it was at somewhere around 30,000 feet give or take a few thousand and the light was easily the size of an airliner. I also rule out any natural phenomena such as meteors. There was no flaming tail and no streaking. It was just not that fast either. It cruised along at a fairly brisk pace which I would estimate at a up to 300 hundred miles per hour. But it was high enough for me to watch it for at least two minutes. I noticed no fluctuations in its course, but it did seem to fluctuate in speed and altitude slightly. I am extremely careful about such things and this is my first report in nine years of sky-w! atching. I feel I have a good sense of such objects from being a private pilot and having spent four years in the Air Force. I have never seen anything like it in my life. I am about 90% sure it was not of this world, but am open to other explanations.<n>

I was taking my dog out before I turned in for the night. I live approximately six miles from town so it is quite dark at night. I sat down on my porch waiting for my dog, the porch is orientated to the due West. My eye caught something moving and at first assumed it was an airplane or helicopter. It was not moving &#39;right&#39; for a plane and then thought it must be a helicopter at a high hover. It was slowing drifting and then changed color. It was then that I was curious, it was not a plane, why then would it have wing lights that are different colored? I called my for wife to see it and she was not very impressed. It was nothing spectacular. An aircraft was then flying nearly over me at this time and I used it to attempt to judge the distance and altitude of the light. I judged it to be approximately 20 to 25 miles west of me and at 5000 feet above the ground. During the time I observed the light it changed colors several times, at times appearing red, white or blue/white.When it changed colors it blended, it just did not change as if one side was one color and another side was another color. It never moved quickly or any higher or closer. My wife observed it for approximately 5 minutes and then called my Father in law to watch it with me. He watched it with me for another 10 minutes. He said that he observed another two lights to the south that resembled the first. I then called the County Sheriff and asked if they had had any other calls. The Deputy I spoke to then went to the roof and attempted to observe it as well. I know nothing of his observations or lack of. At 0010 hrs the light darkened to a dark red and descended out of site slowly and I did not observe it again. I have served in the Army during Desert Storm and have seen many of the worlds&#39; high performance aircraft at very close and far distances in combat maneuvers. I have ridden in Pavelows, Pavehawks, Ch-53&#39;s, British High Pro Ch-47&#39;s, and other conventional types of aircrafts and I have never seen anything like this. I can not explain what I saw. The only other point of interest is that the light had to be very close to the Idaho National Engineering &amp; Environmental Labratory, site of many nuclear reactors and testing facilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness and found him to be quite credible.

It continued this pattern several times before it hovered for a time and suddenly disappeared.<n>

All evening he had been explaining to me about constellations.  It was a clear moonless night.  There were no clouds and the stars were very clear.  At about 23.00 hrs we went up to the roof of my house to see the sky.  My friend was showing me the constellations Scorpio and the Great Bear.  We were facing North at around 23.15 hrs when suddenly we saw an object in the sky right above our heads.  It was as huge as as an aeroplane as normally viewed from the ground.  We do not know when it actually appeared in the sky before we saw it.  The object was brown in colour, moving gently and steadily across the sky from south to north.  It seemed like it was sailing in the sky.  There was no sound or lights emanating from it.  What was clearly visible was that it had a honeycomb like structure (as if it was made up of many similar cell like components).  It was almost T-shaped with a long tail.  The horizontal of the &#39;T&#39; formed the front of the object. There was a haze around it.  It seemed to be surrounded by some form of energy field or flux which looked like the object was in a fluid like state.  The whole object and the surrounding flux was shimmering as it sailed past (the shimmering was similar to the view one gets when looking at something through the gases emanting from the exhaust of an aircraft just before take of or when one looks at the horizon on a hot day). Within about 5 secs from when we first saw it, the object suddenly faded out of view as if went into an invisible mode. The size of the object was the same visually when it faded away as when we first saw. It did not diminish in size. My friend and I then sat down to explore all possible explanations for the phenomenon and when we were convinced that it was a alien craft, we decided to call the office of the city&#39;s largest daily on the night of Monday, 14th May to inform them about the sighting. They were least interested in the sighting. We immediately sat down to record all that we could remember about the sighting. I have tried my best to give a graphic representation of the sighting. The .jpg file shows what the object looked like. In the gif animation I have tried to show the shimering nature. The flash file shows how it looked as it sailed past and how it faded away right before our eyes. Also enclosed is a map of Bangalore city and its location in the Southern India. What was really surprisng was on the morning of 15th May, the dailies all over India carried news articles about this strange mysterious ape like creature with robotic features that was sighted in Delhi. This creature has apparently attacked and injured more than hundred people over the last few days. (The first of these attacks started on April 8th, 2001 at Ghaziabad, India). Though none of the victims have been fatally wounded, there have been two deaths reported where one the victims reportedly jumped off the building while trying to escape the creature and the other, a pregnant woman tripped on the stairs and sustained fatal injuries on her head in the fall. All other victims carry abrasions on their hands, face and legs. Some have even commplained of their toes being bitten off. Reports of the appearance and capabilities of the creature vary slightly from person to person. Some have reported that the creature can jump to great heights when chased. It has been able to move at phenomnal speeds. There are also reports that simultaneous attacks have occurred at different places giving rise to the suspicion that there may be more than one of its kind around. The lastest sighting of the creature as of May 22nd, 2001 is that it has been spooted in the sate of Rajasthan to the west of India. The police initally suspected aliens but for some reason known only to them the stopped giving those versions and went on to propound other theories. I am very sure that there is a connection between the our sighting and what is happening at Delhi. That is why we have taken pains to carefully reconstruct the sighting in as detailed a manner as possible.

Being that I live in a second floor condo and the light formation that was incredibly large (as far as the point to point distance of each of these lights at each corner of the triangle object were) , and very bright, -it quickly disappeared from my balcony view... so I ran downstairs and to the back of my building into open space, but the object had already disappeared in less than a minute from when I had originally spotted it.

In regards to the question of the triangle form I saw this eve 05/13/01 @ aprox 10:30 pm mtn time. Yes, it did appear to be moving slightly South/eastwardly. Basically what I saw was three points of light in a perfect triangular form. I saw no object within these three points , albeit the perfect unison movement of the lights together and the steady pace they traveled at suggested the three corner lights that formed the perfect triangle were the corners of an object I simply could not see with my naked eye.  Each of these three  lights were no bigger than the star dots one sees with their naked eye when staring up at the night sky, however the vast distance between each point was tremendous, much larger than any sattelite  or space<n> <n><n> shuttle could be and the brightness of each dot of &#34;seeming&#34; star light was comparable to the shine reflect of a planet being viewed in the night sky with little more than a pair of binnoculars. The departure from my sight was due as follows: As it moved away in its south eastward direction-  The roof of my balcony blocked my view.. by the time I raced downstairs and made my way to the back of my condo into open space it was already gone. However, please note: That although to my naked eye it appeared to move at a steady pace (much like one sees an airplane in the night sky moving at a steady pace),... It took me aprox only 60 seconds or less to reach that open space in the back of my condo. Now, Considering the apparant largeness of this triangular formation, for it to have disappeared from view altogether or be out of my eyes range in this short period of time, I can only imagine it was in fact traveling at a much greater speed than my eyes originally perceived.  I read some of the reports at the sightings web site about a ?stealth blimp?.. in the shape of an enormous triangle and am currently surfing around the web to see if I can dig up some info on it to see if it perhaps was due to fly over the Denver area this eve...  Albeit, if you have any ideas on what this particular object was.. I do hope you might email me back when you get a chance to let me know. After reading some of the other recent reports filed, apparently others in this area of the west have seen similar triangle point objects as well, that have yet to be explained.<n> <n><n> Thanks,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END FIRST RESPONSE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((SECOND RESPONSE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport: In my follow up web investigation for info about my 5/13/01 unexplained ighting, I learned that according to skunk works at Lockeed, reported in an article by ((author deleted)) @ ((publication deleted)) site:  http:((URL deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw fits the perfect description given for the Stealth Blimp, which apparently has the ability to elude radar and be virtually invisible to the eye in the night sky - so that all one sees are three triangle blips of seeming star light. It is reported that this blimp is also aprox 1,000 feet long!<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, apparently the project is top secret so the public is not allowed to know when it makes its test runs or operations or where. So am betting this is EXACTLY! what I saw tonight..-And- what others have been reporting over the past month or two. If you know of any possible way of obtaining a possible confirmation of this, I&#39;d sure appreciate it if ya&#39;d let me know! :-)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks,  ((name deleted))<n>

We were outside with his telescope having some fun at about 10:00 PM when we saw three objects travelling in a delta formation at a very high altitude.  They were not jets.  Just single points of white light that must has been hundreds of miles apart all traveling very fast in a west to east direction.  If I held my arm out, the distance between the objects was a 1.5&#34; to 2&#34; spread of my fingers. Do you know of any satellites that meet this description?]<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The report may describe the three satellites that are frequently reported to NUFORC.  We suspect the satellites are part of the U. S. Navy &#34;N.O.S.S.&#34; program, under which a triplet of satellites can be seen in the night skies, flying in unwavering formation, for several weeks at a time.  However, that is only a guess.

Getting to the entrance to the city  i was listening to my radio, my friend was driving and i was just looking upto the sky  with the window open,i saw this orange light aproaching from the NW side and i though was an airplane, i look away and look back not giving any thoughts to it,when i look again was already in top of the car still thinking was an airplane i just went back to my business, i saw it again going closer to us, but to the NE and i thought &#34;have to be an helicoper it was to big and low and i saw something moving inside the orange glow. it wasn  an airplane i was sure , but the more i look i got convince it wasnt normal,,, was like a cigar form of something inside moving like side to side very fast(what i thought first was an hellicopter) i notice the orange glow was all around and over the object and not under or top of it! and was amaze how close it felt and fast, no noise came from it either and suddenly it just move from one point to the other like in fractions of seconds and desapear!! i was screaming to my friend I think i saw a u.f.o.! when i was litle me and my granfather saw 3 orange lights in the sky in v formation that  suddenly just break formation and dessapear the same way.. i am just in shock still... had never been involve in something this close.<n>
5/12/01 22:00|New York City (Staten Island)|NY|Formation|3 minutes|Staten Island ( UFO? ) Formation on 05/12/01|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17620.html|172|ndxe200105| Staten Island ( UFO? ) Formation on 05/12/01<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok, now this just happened 2 hours ago here in Staten Island and it has me very worried. I was outside with my friend ((name deleted)), skygazing like I have done for years, I am an avid astronomy buff. I know all of the things that should be in the sky, why and all of that. Tonight I saw something in the sky that I cannot explain, and when I think of all the possible things it could have been, the closest thing I can envision is a formation of Air Force jets. We were skygazing all over the sky, but when I first saw the formation, it was in the south/ south east.   It slowly moved from the S/SE to the North then vanished out of sight.  I quickly asked my friend if he saw it as well, and he looked and said what the hell is that ((name deleted))?  I said I have no idea, standing there with my eyes wide. My first reaction was that it was a seagull being lit up by the street lights and we could see the belly of it. But then i realized it was not, due to the fact that this was WAY too high to be any bird. Or was it? I quickly took the binoculars we were using to tour the city sky and focused on the formation. to my surprise, it looked the same as it did with my naked eye. These were 10X50 binocs, and I cannot explain why i did not see any more detail. Now this is where it gets tricky, because it was either a very large object, or perhaps dozens of small objects flying in formation. they were all a solid red color, but *very* faint. My friend thought they changed color to a dull orange, but I could not see that. They did not blink, it was just a steady, *very* dull red of basically dots moving across the sky VERY high up. Have you ever seen a sattelite from earth when it passes overhead? Well, it looked like that, a steady light, but not white, red, and much duller than a sattelite. I only wish I had my telescope out. I was SO mad later on for not bringing it out. When we could not see them anymore, my friend wanted to go do something else, but I said wait- listen. Do you hear anything? He said no. I heard nothing the ENTIRE time, and I know what a plane sounds like even that high up. It was dead quiet, no sounds after they passed over head, nothing. It was very errie in fact. I in my 10 years of being an amature astronomer, have never seen anything like this in the sky, and nothing I know of in space can produce this, and nothing I know of in terms of aircraft can produce this to my knowledge.  And I know alot about space and the sky. The weather was crystal clear, with great seeing and no humidity. A cold front passed by about 2 hours before the event, and when I thought about it I wondered if I saw my first &#39; ball lightning&#39; but the stories I have heard about ball lightning none of them say it can last this long, nor be this high. I do not know what else to say. I never expected to post to this website, I only started to come here to read the reports people post and try to think what they could have been in the &#39;real world&#39; , like a certian star out that night or something. etc. I wish I could find out what it was in the sky, it confused me. It scared me frankly, cause nothing I have ever learned prepared me for this. This is the first time I saw something in the sky that I could not explain right away since I was a child, and learning in school. Well, here is the report, as quickly as I can write it. Sorry for the typos, I am so tired. :)  Oh wait I just remembered, as always, there was tons of air traffic in the NYC metro area, planes going to kennedy, newark, etc. I am used to their patterns and they were flying the same patterns when this was going on to my knowledge. But I was looking at the formation the most. :)<n>

Arc shaped flight path, than dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went out star gazing to the Natchez Trace. A nice rural area to get away from the city lights. My wife and two boys, ages 6 and 11 went along. We were lying on cots when I noticed a three &#34;stars&#34; in a triangular fashion. They were very high, like a satellite in distance as far as how high they appeared. Difficult to judge. Regardless, I felt dizzy because it appeared that the &#34;stars&#34; were moving. Kind of like when you lay back and watch the clouds move and get disorientated. I realized, however, by watching other stars that the objects were indeed moving. I basically freaked out. From the distance that they appeared to be away the objects had to be MILES apart. Possibly 10 miles each? I would have to ask someone who is an expert on it. They moved slowly, from the distance we were seeing, and in an arc. Certainly NOTHING man made could make the arc shape movement at that height and with such an abnormal movement. They didn not go in a perfect arc. Rather the formation somewhat lumbered along. I didn&#39;t notice and cannot say for sure that the object was not a whole oject rather than a formation. I was to excited to pay attention if it blocked out stars as it moved. It didn&#39;t appear that it did. It was an arc overall but no apparent path that they were going. Everyone watched it in amazement. The formation was not an even sided  triangular. Easy to draw but harder to explain. The object literally faded into the night after, what seemed like, about two minutes in view. Not going fast, just disappearing. I personally am a ((deleted)) in computer networking and an ((deleted)) books. My spouse is an aspiring ((deleted)) in Nashville, TN. Two ((children)), typical ((children)) I suppose. They didn&#39;t really understand the significance other than dad getting so excited. There was absolutely no sound from the objects at all, and it is quiet there. Too far up to hear a sound though, as it was more at a satellite height or higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be serious minded, and seemingly quite credible.  Our first suspicion was that the witnesses may have been witnessing three satellites flying in unwavering formation, but his impression was that they did not move in a straight line.  Moreover, they all appeared to disappear from their view at the same instant.  Satellites probably would have disappeared sequentially, as each of them entered the Earth&#39;s terminator, I.e. shadowed side, away from the Sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please see other reports for this same date from all across the U.

5/12/01 21:45|Scappoose|OR|Triangle|10 minutes|UFO 1/10 of a mile away seen for 10 minutes in Scappoose, Oregon|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17643.html|174|ndxe200105| UFO 1/10 of a mile away seen for 10 minutes in Scappoose, Oregon<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving northbound on Highway 30 from Portland, Oregon to Astoria, through a small town called Scappoose at approximately 9:45pm on Saturday, May 12, 2001.  (There&#39;s really not all that much to describe about Scappoose other than the fact that it, like my hometown, Astoria, sits alongside the Columbia River.)  Just out of town, in the sky, I noticed a very bright yellow/white light descending -- straight down and northerly.  I pulled my truck off to the side of the highway so that I could get a better look at it.  My first thought was that it was a meteorite and I was concerned that, because of its speed, size and direction, it was going to hit the Pacific Ocean!  As it got closer, I noticed it wasn&#39;t as far away as I had originally thought, so, ever more curious, I got back on the road.  Then it went behind a hill with large pine trees -- or so I thought.  Assuming it was going beyond the horizon, rather than IN the trees, I figured it was just a (REALLY BIG) shooting star and the “show was over.”  But as I neared the hill, I saw that it had &#34;morphed&#34; into an actual &#34;ship.&#34;  Bright lights -- ((colors temporarily deleted until investigation is completed)) -- began blinking within the trees and the craft rose straight up out of the trees.  I pulled the car over again, in disbelief, and watched it for a few seconds. It began moving as though it were going to cross the highway, so I got back on the road after two cars drove by.  The craft, wider than the 4-lane highway and approximately 10 feet above the telephone wires (50 feet up), flew directly over the cars.  Both cars’ brake lights came on, but neither stopped!  I sped up, and as it crossed the highway, I anxiously looked for a road to turn down.  I turned east onto a small road, crossed the RR tracks and sped up, all the while keeping my eyes on the craft, which I could see through the trees.  It was now heading south at approximately 20-25 miles per hour. (I want to note that these lights -- ((colors deleted)) -- were blinking very brightly and in an interesting rhythm, but there was no reflection on the actual craft.  Though it was nearly invisible, the best way to describe its shape would be to say ((deleted)), based on the blinking light pattern.  More importantly,  I was able to make out this shape in two previous sightings several months ago in Astoria.  I’m quite certain that this May 12 sighting was the same kind of craft my partner and I have witnessed {she, three times, once with photos; and myself, twice}, based on the light patterns.  They’re very distinctive.) I got out of my truck and watched as the craft stopped and hovered above ((deleted)).  It was approximately 1/10 mile east of me, and 50 feet up. After a few seconds, the lights ((deleted)). There was no sound or movement.  Strangely aware that they knew I was watching, I became frightened, and, legs shaking, got back in the truck, where my usually very active dog was sitting quietly staring in the direction of the craft, and turned west for the highway.  I drove about 20 feet, then stopped when, through my side window, simultaneously, a car pulled up behind me and the craft ((deleted)) -- lights on.  I jumped out of the truck and pointed, yelling, “UFO!”  The ((deleted--people))), got out of their car as well and stood staring at it as the lights became very active -- fast and bright -- and it zoomed off to the ((direction deleted)) (maybe 3 miles?).  It stayed in the same location there -- far up in the sky.  We were all understandably excited, yelling, “UFO!”  “Can you believe this?”  The man said, “I was in the ((government)) for years and that was no plane!  It wasn’t a helicopter either -- I’ve never seen anything like that!”  He said they had just driven past the location of the craft where I saw it hovering, but hadn’t seen it. Directly below it was, as he said, “A big herd of cattle.” Just then, with the original craft in a stationary position in the distant east sky (lights still blinking), another very bright white light appeared from the southeast and flew very fast in a northwesterly direction.  I said, “Now what’s that?!”  The man said, “Maybe they’ve sent a plane out to check it out.”  I replied, “There isn’t a military base around here, is there?”  As I said it, he yelled, “That ain’t no plane!”  I turned to see it that it had stopped abruptly behind a cloud.  Lights flashed and reflected in the cloud, and it shot straight up, with a trail of light behind it, and disappeared. The show was over.  Without even thinking to get their names or give them mine, we got in our cars and drove off.  I can only hope that they may be doing the same thing at this moment -- reporting the incident -- so that we can connect and relay more details to this amazing account. (NOTE:  The ((deleted)) had very ((deleted)) ((deleted)) hair which he had ((deleted)) -- I had the most interaction with him.  The woman, I think had shoulder length ((deleted)) hair.  There was a little ((deleted)) inbetween them in the front seat -- about ((deleted)) years old.  The car, as I remember, was a grey 1990’s ((deleted))?  They left me and headed south on Highway 30, apparently to make sure the ((deleted))” was OK.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we found her to be an exceptionally credible witness.  Her description of the incident was quite detailed, and we suspect the description above is quite accurate.  Deleted passages will be restored, once an investigation is completed.  We have deleted certain passages to protect the identities of the other witnesses, who are thought to be residents of this small town, and also to protect certain aspects of the sighting, so that future reports will be factual and objective, not just repeats of the original report.  We deem this to be a very interesting report.  PD))<n>

I was traveling north to south on the West outerbelt of Columbus, Ohio, heading for the Roberts road exit.  The day and time I&#39;m sure of (Thursday - 12:50 PM).  I could see an object traveling south to north (just off the outerbelt) heading my way.  It was a cloudy, gray day. The object was not traveling at a great speed, and it was only probably two hundred yards in the air.  My first reaction was to pull off to the side of the road, but I immediately realized the object would be out of sight by that time.  The object was round, and doomed and very dirty looking. What stuck in my mind for several days was the object reminded me of a picture I had seen several times, years back, on TV.  My reaction to the picture on TV was &#34;This round, doomed, dirty looking, fakey looking object is suppose to be a UFO.  No way.&#34;   I wonder now.  Because it was 12:50 Pm and the outerbelt was crowded, their had to be hundreds of cars that saw the same thing I did.  But they probably were heading to or from work, or had other business, and brushed off the object like I did.  The object did look like what I always pictured a UFO not to look like.  Just curious if anyone else from Columbus reported the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

They all laughed, but as they were laughing all six of the objects came towards us. They flashed a light at us that was so bright. It was probably the brightest light I had ever ever seen . I cant remember anything ellse. All I know is that the next morning I was in my bed. I dont know if I was aubducted or what? I m acctually really scared.

Then I realized that despite all that,it was too late to be the station. The station always sets around ten o&#39;clock, it was now after tweleve. About five minutes later we pulled in front of our home. Once the car stopped I pointed it out to my husband and then I noticed it was moving.

They then started to ascend- very slowly. They formed a triangle formation and it stayed like that for a few minutes. They then appeared to rotate at a slight angle. The eerie thing about it was that it was in perfect sychronisity. A light then connected each craft and a perfect triangle was formed. This took place for the best part of 10 minutes. My friend and I witnessed in total amazement and we seemed to be inarticulate as to what we were witnessing. The lights then rather quickly dispersed across the skies all heading in different directions. We witnessed  one of the crafts as it was in close promximity to us; but decided to head back as we were quite startled by the whole experience.<n>

Then verified by &#34;C&#34; &amp; &#34;B&#34; well above sloped rooftops of houses next street south, moving horizontally just above power lines. The lack of visible wings and lack of any vapor trail behind object was most notible; one observor speculated it may be a rocket of some sort, but no exhaust was seen and no sounds were heard. The object passed behind broad Vapor trails created by passenger aircraft moving in opposite direction. As we talked and walked westward toward my garage, it became easier to lose sight of object as it slowly receeded into the southwestern sky into haze and partial overcast.  No wings or rudder structures or emanations noted by any of us. It moved much faster than the occasional Goodyear Blimp often seen in this area, and any lighter than air craft we&#39;ve seen is shaped like fat cigar, with markings or running lights which this shiny object never displayed. We are hoping to see a report on this sighting on the 11 pm news, but still skeptical.  It was suggested this object could be a large satellite in orbit, but even the ISS should not appear so large from this latitude.<n>

It was round and bright but too low to be a star and seemed to be following the highway. It was no chopper or plane becaused it was sphere shaped. The following day it appeared again and spotted by several people at the park and ride.  The following day expecting another sighting of the sphere my uncle grabbed his binoculars to get a close up view.  What he saw was bright orb surrounded by a outer layer of of some sort like the way and ameoba looks under a microscope.  As hit traveled down the highway the outer layers moved around like water ripples.  I don&#39;t know if this is  extraterrestial or not but it is defitely wierd I am going to check it out and see it for my self as it has been spotted four days already by several people. Im going to take a digital camera to get some shots. Only problem is it is only seen like at 4:30 in the moring and its hard for me to wake up that early even for a ufo spotting and with my luck I will show up with a digital and the sphere will not appear that day.more to come hopefully<n>

I have been trying to get my friends to post a report because they actually saw the object. They said it was a disk with varied moving lights and one very bright shaft pointing down at the beach where the campers were. I experienced a strange sensation of drifting and then awoke in my tent shivering. I sat up and looked out at a very light sky, though it was a weird sunrise and noticed my tent was brightly lit in an orange glow. I went back to sleep . In the morning we had to pack up and while we were waiting to leave my friends told me of our &#34;visitors&#34;. Ever since then I have been checking your web site and am infatuated now with the extent of new UFO activity. Last May I felt like I had been examined by them because I had dreams. I would like to have some more information and respectful backup to this encounter. I believe that it is time for humans to acknowledge the existence of ET activity and am becomong worried that our government is not prepared for the inevitble. You don&#39;t have to publish this. I need someone to know about my experience. My husband thinks I&#39;m nuts.<n>

I sat there to relax &amp; enjoy the peace and serenity. I saw 2 red objects move from right to left. At first I thought they were airplanes, but the one object merged into the other &amp; became one! Also, I felt very anxious &amp; afraid. I don&#39;t feel that way when I see planes in the sky late at night. The object stopped in mid-air &amp; hovered! The moon was out &amp; it was very clear so it was easy to see. I didn&#39;t hear an engine. The object would change in shape- get smaller, then bigger. It jst hovered. It stayed red, &amp; did not flash on &amp; off.  I watched it for about 20 min! Then I began feeling extremely anxious &amp; afraid. I wanted to stay &amp; watch it, being curious; yet, I felt afraid.  I turned up the hill to the right of the object, &amp; the object got closer &amp; closer to me! I left &amp; went up the hill. However, this was the wrong way! I&#39;m not familiar with Newberry Park. I don&#39;t live there. So I turned around &amp; went down to where I was before. The object was still there. I wanted to leave, feeling very afraid, so I did. I watched the object in my rearview mirror, until it was out of sight. I have never had a UFO encounter before. I am actually very skeptical. However, after this experience, I am a believer. I have never had such intense feelings of fear before from seeing an object in the sky. I have seen many airplanes in the sky before at this time of night &amp; never felt fear. This was different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness and found her to be quite eloquent in her description of the event, and quite credible in her description of the objects she witnessed.  She is highly educated in the medical profession.  She had not witnessed what she thought might be a UFO before this event.  We assume that the time and date are correct.  We do not know what &#34;2604 hrs.&#34; indicates on the 24-hr. clock.  We presume the witness means the morning of 11MY01, but we are not sure.   PD))<n>

5/10/01 23:30|Lawrence|KS|Triangle||Possible Explanation for 9/29/1999 Lawrence, KS Sighting|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17592.html|191|ndxe200105| Possible Explanation for 9/29/1999 Lawrence, KS Sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> In your reported sightings database for Kansas there is a sighting in Lawrence, KS for 9/29/1999 at 21:37 PM (reported on 9/30/1999, with note as date changed from 2000) of a triangular craft flying over 23rd street near Checkers grocery store. My girlfriend and I saw something very similar last night (5/10/2001, at roughly 11:35 PM) from the Checkers parking lot that was definitely a jet aircraft (I think a commercial airliner). The aircraft was very low in the sky (larger than a quarter at arms length) and moving from the SW to the NE. It was moving rapidly relative to an observer on the ground, though not especially fast relative to another conventional aircraft in the sky, and due to the darkness of the sky and lighting pattern on the aircraft when viewed directly underneath it had a vague boomerang or triangular shape. However, as I was standing outside and could concentrate on watching the object (unlike the person who reported the 1999 sighting, who was driving in his car), I could barely make out an aircraft body and tail section bisecting the boomerang. The craft looked very strange when I first noticed it, as it had two unblinking(?) white lights (one on each wing) roughly 2/3 to 3/4 of the way back on each wing (measured from the body to the tip of the wing) and a single unblinking(?) red light on the body between the wings (thus the apparent V shape), but as before once I stared at it awhile I could make out the body of the aircraft. I heard no sound when it flew overhead, though as there was a thunderstorm some distance to the north (thus significant winds at the jet&amp;#8217;s altitude) that&amp;#8217;s not surprising. The jet was in sight for about 30 seconds or so (very rough time estimate). Lawrence is in the flight path of several commercial airlines stopping at MCI (Kansas City International) airport and has been for the past several years (as early as 1996 my friends and I used to sit out on the patio with cigarettes and beer and, to pass the evening hours, played a game where we would see who could see each jet first as it flew overhead from SW to NE). Between 8:00 PM and midnight dozens of jets cross over the town from SW to NE, though not usually at such a low altitude. I suspect that what the man and his wife saw on 9/29/1999 was a low altitude jet on approach to MCI.<n>

The lights were symetrical in shape to that of a triangle.  each light represented the tip of a triangle.(connect the dots)  The lights never devated from the distant of each other light.  It stayed the same distant and travelled straight on a heading from nw to se.  It finally reached the light pollution and we lost sight of it.  Never heard a noise.  At first I thought it was a couple of satellites but I have never seen satellites travel at the same speed or the same flight path so uniformly.  I can say this as it past a star in the outlined area I could see that star so it either was hollow or beyond the stars.  I just do not know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The report is consistent with several other reports NUFORC has received of these three lights, apparently orbitting in unwavering formation.  A similar phenomenon has been reported in past years, and we believe they may be three satellites placed in orbit by the U. S. Navy.  The program is referred to as the &#34;N.O.S.S.&#34; satellite surveillance system.  We do not know what purpose the satellites have.  PD))<n>

She is a teacher and I am an engineer.  When I can get out of the Big City (San Diego) I like to look up into the night sky.  This night was cloudless, visability excellent.  We were taking a leisurely walk when I looked up right at an amorphous, semi-transparent cloud-like light area (not lighted but lighter than the background sky) moving towards us at about 70 degrees in the southern sky.  My first thought was that it was a flock of light-colored birds flying at night and I called it to the attention of my girlfriend.  It became quickly obvious to both of us it wasn&#39;t birds.  You could see the stars through it.  It varied in its lightness throughout its area (maybe two thumbwidths roundish at arms length), like a group of thin clouds moving together.  It wasn&#39;t an object or objects.  It was amorphous.  In the course of about 4 seconds it moved to roughly 70 degrees north (total about 40 degrees) and faded from view.  Estimated height 500-1000 feet, speed maybe 200 mph.  As this was taking place my mind was trying to put this in a compartment of the known and it completely failed.  My girlfriend&#39;s response was kind of like &#34;Well that was interesting.&#34;  My response was more like &#34;What the heck did we just see?  That makes no sense.  What the heck did we just see?&#34;  To reiterate, it was calm, warm, and completely cloudless that night.<n>

At first I thought they were hot air balloons, but as I watched them they did not move. As the clouds were going bye they sat there not moving.I thought that was strange....So we watched for a while longer,trying to guess what they were.Then the most amazing thing happened,they started to move.Four of them came together to form a sqare,then one left as the three remaining formed a triangle,then the one that left came back and formed a retriangle.The most amazing thing I have ever seen!We watched for over 45 mins.and they never left the sky where we were looking at.Looked like silver shiny balls in the sky.Another lady and her daughter saw them also,I know I believe in ufo&#39;s now cause I used every possible thing it could be.Airplanes move,hot air balloons can not sit in midair without moving with the wind,at least not 45 mins.The clouds moved under them for they were very high in the sky.Still tell this story today and am amazed with what we saw! Date I gave you is not sure,If you are interested I could find out closer date because there was a fire at a paint factory near bye,so I could date it better.I would like to know if others have seen this,so I hope you read this and give an explaination!Truly Amazed!<n>

It seemed to hover for a period, no noise at all, and the color and luminosity  never changed. For some reason, it was impossible to tell how large, or how far it was away. after it hovered for a minute or two just above the tree line, it started doing amazing manuevers, speeding incredibly in one direction, only to come to a sudden stop, then reversing. A human couldn&#39;t possibly take that kind of &#34;g&#34; force. We were scared enough that we wouldn&#39;t even turn on the flashlight, not wanting to draw attention to ourselves.After as few minutes of these manuevers, it sped off behind the trees, out of our sight.It left no trail in the sky. we waited at least an hour before we turned our lights on,abandoning our fishing trip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally decided to file a report, simply because I quit worrying about the opinions of other people.

We still could not make out any shape of aircraft, but the light became clearer and we determined there were four yellowish lights with reddish halos. Then we started losing sight of it as it got farther away. Within a second of our last sighting, it completely vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is anonymous.  PD))<n>

I thought that I would open the small upstairs bathroom window which faces West and see if I could spot what was going on. I stuck my head out the window for about 3 minutes or so, looked around, and then I suddenly saw one fairly large orange light which was illuminated for about 2 seconds, then went out. Imediately after that, a second one appeared closely to the left of it (from my view) and repeated the same thing. You could still see a dim halo of the first one, so it seemed as though the lights were paired together. The object/s were dead silent and completely stationary in the sky. I would have estimated that they were 5-10 miles away.  I yelled to my wife and son so they could hopefully witness this. We watched out the window for another 10 minutes or so and didn&#39;t see a thing. My son became quite frightened because he knew I was not kidding. The jets seemed to be continually cirlcling around overhead while this was happening, almost as if they too were trying to identify the objects. For about another half hour we could still hear the jets, so I thought I would look again. This time I chose to open and look out my son&#39;s bedroom window which also faces west. Now it is about 10:35, and this time a total of four large orange lights had flashed and went out in about a 3-4 second duration. I yelled for my wife and son once again, and only my wife was able to witness a second sequence of flashing orange lights. This time it appeared to be two pairs of lights equally spaced between one another. We were all quite excited about this and contemplated notifying the local police to see if anyone else had witnessed this. Shortly after the second sighting, the sounds of the jets suspiciously went away. Hopefully someone else out there witnessed this and can file their report. It shure was strange but fantastic.<n>

I looked out over the desert basin that lies to the west and I noticed a light which sat motionless and changed colors white-yellow-orange-reddish. It seems to have been 10 miles away. The object then moved at an extreme rate of speed, much faster than any jet I have seen, and came to an immediate stop. There was no acceleration or decceleration. Only a complete stop or moving very fast. It would hover for a few moments and then move a distance and hover again. I watched the object do this for about 10 minutes. I turned my head and looked away for a few moments and it was gone. I never heard a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Attached are two scans of a photo of a bizarre object I unknowingly (at the time) photographed. I wouldn&#39;t have noticed the object except for a relative (who has better close up vision) pointing it out to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PLACE: Ryazan, Russia, c 250km SE from Moscow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DATE &amp; TIME: May 9th 2001, c 9:00 (May 9th is the &#34;Day of Victory&#34; over NAZI Germany holiday in Russia, as this photo was being taken Ryazan&#39;s military were preparing for their parade. Ryazan is Russia&#39;s West Point or Sandhurst) PHOTOGRAPHY INFO: Kodacolor Plus 200ISO film with full automatic camera focussed on the tree below the object (i.e. at infinity).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lighting is sharply from the left, from the morning sun on a clear, Spring day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PHOTO BACKGROUND: Taken from the 1st floor (1st above ground floor) bedroom window of a flat in Ryazan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The block of apartments on the left is about 15 stories high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SCAN 1: Highest magnification scan I can achieve. This is a 600DPI scan of an enlargement I got at the local photo shop. Zoom out about three times to see it clearly. I have tried to get some more detail using Paint Shop Pro&#39;s photo enhancement tools to enhance contrast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SCAN 2: the full frame original photo scanned in at 200DPI.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OBSERVATIONS ABOUT OBJECT: I could not say either the distance or altitude of the object from the photo. It appears to be stationery. For what it MAY have been doing hanging there see NOTES ON MY LIFE below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However IF that is a MiG31 / F15 size fighter slung underneath (see below), then the craft is about 25-30 meters from &#34;prow&#34; to stern, and would be about a kilometer away. This would put it over another residential area of Ryazan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen many photos of UFOs but nothing like this. This is a very odd object, and to my amateur eye looks like either a HUMAN device or an alien / human hybrid device.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say that because of the large antenna dish apparent on the right hand side. That just looks very terrestrial tech to me. This dish would also be incredibly un-aerodynamic. There may be another on the right of the high dome (above the command center with windows?) at top of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot see how the craft could travel at any speed with these large dishes hanging out unless a) the dishes could be retracted during flight or b) the craft utilizes some form of trans-dimensional drive or c) it just flies very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also there APPEARS to be a twin finned military fighter jet slung beneath the object (!) like a MiG31 or U.S. equivalent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note the ship like &#34;prow&#34; on the craft and the bump above that which reminds me of the active sonar array on the prow of some submarines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the 200DPI scan a light &#34;aura&#34; is visible around the craft. I only have &#34;High Color&#34; on my PC and can&#39;t say if this is an artifact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&amp;#8217;t help but wonder that IF this is a human piloted craft, whether it is being run by Russians (it is on their territory, but I have suffered &#34;phenomena&#34; that may be associated with this craft in many other countries), or if it is being run by Americans, doing a test of their ability to &#34;penetrate&#34;  Russian airspace &amp; influence people in that country with the phenomena listed below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE ON MY LIFE &amp; RELEVANCE to this PHOTO: To my conscious knowledge I only once SAW a UFO from the outside with my own eyes on one occasion prior to photographing this, but that was during a period when I didn&#39;t WANT to believe in any such thing and I went inside ignoring it, possibly under a form of mind control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and ex-wife had seen UFOs of the saucer type and also a sharp, black, isosceles triangular craft in the years before this picture was taken near my flat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the subject of an abduction experience when I was six years old. Prior to this I was a very happy, lucky and socially successful person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My memory of the abduction experience is one of being taken to a round &#34;theatre&#34; like room by a strange, large, being from my bed in our family holiday house. I felt an intense EVIL from the being who abducted me, and a projection of that evil onto me, such as some assaulters project on to their victims.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several other similar aliens in the craft. I have no memory of physical examinations. But I do remember they &#34;judged&#34; me and came to some decision about me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt;From that night on I suddenly lost all my good friends. Many were physically taken away. From then on I have lived under a regimen of: constant, strict isolation. The only relationships I am allowed are negative, painful or abusive towards me; despite coming from a very well off family I have been forced to live in poverty, always about 10% below subsistence no matter what I do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People associated with me are subject to mind control that puts the most awful negative ideas in their heads about me. Those who resists this and wants to be with me is PHYSICALLY removed by various means, often involving third parties interfering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have continued to live for the interests that I had from before the abduction: studying the meaning of life and working to help humanity. It is something of a family tradition coming through my father.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHAT IS RELEVANT TO THIS PICTURE is that during the year before this craft was inadvertently taken, I and the two other occupants of that flat in Ryazan, were subjected to a massive program of attacks: direct energy attacks, such as uncontrollable itching, attacks of needles all over the body, uncontrollable coughing with no infection, incredibly disturbed digestion (including constant flatulence), extreme knife like headaches  just for starters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never experienced such a &#34;full spectrum attack&#34; since the months after I had left my original home at age 18, several decades ago. That was in another continent away from Russia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO THESE ATTACKS, just not as concentrated as when I was 18 and in Ryazan, IN EVERY CONTINENT (except Africa and South America where I haven&#39;t been). These attacks have followed me wherever I have gone around the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been assessed by numerous psychological experts and they can find no abnormalities of the mind, except evidence of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from the horror I have faced since I was six. I am now middle aged and my health is very badly affected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> POSSIBLY identifying this bizarre craft may shed some light on what has been plaguing my life for so long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the best to all who seek the truth,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Both photos forwarded to NUFORC look like a black splotch in the sky.  The photos are ambiguous, we feel.  PD))<n>

There were no lights or after tail to indicate fuel.  First it looked like a balloon but then rounder travelling much faster than a plane as I can see planes every day as we are in their path.  It looked completely black.  Whether the phot can be enlarged several times I do not know yet until I get the film developed.  There does seem to appear a lighter aura round the object, no sound.  From where it disappeared some 3-4 minutes an aircraft passenger was still climbing leaving England.<n>

I lost time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was coming home after an evening at my singing group and an object followed my car down the street.  I heard a large noise and I was given a command that came into my mind, Not to move.  Then I felt like the object was going over top of my car and I remember thinking I would have to see what it was as it seemed to move to the right.  I looked out car window, it was difficult to see, it was very dark, no Moon was out, and I saw a triangular shaped object I thought was some military plane, but it was too low, it barely cleared a house and it had a few small lights in the back of it, hardly visible, the craft was moving very slowly as if it was huffering.  Then it was gone.  I remember getting a message that it was O.K. it was just a plane, not to worry.  I was not even upset, but looked at my watch when I came in the driveway and it was 22:55.  I had lost some time.  Even though I seemed to be in a non caring state I still wondered were it went and I thought I should be able to see it.  It was as if they gave me a message not too worry and not to think twice about what happened.  Later it kind of felt like it could not have happened, but it did.  Later I thought about when I was looking out the window and I felt a little strange like I was fighting a trance.  For the next two weeks I was very tired.  The colour of object was black, like black metal.  I think I noticed my car lights inside car flick once as it was pulling up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of alleged event is approximate.

We were near the side of the lake way up where some trees were and where we set our tent and campfire up. My uncle stayed there for a while. Me, my uncle, my cousin, and his girlfriend were sitting there at the camp the first night we stayed. It was a clear sky and stars covered the sky and it was a full moon. We looked up at the sky after my cousin was telling us about &#34;how we never know what&#39;s up there. The galaxy is infinite&#34; and things like that that me and him was always talking about. We looked up and looked at the stars and we saw a flying ball of bright yellow light soaring slowly through the sky. I saw it first, then my cousin pointed it out. It moved slowly across the sky. It appeared not to be a &#34;shooting star&#34; because it was moving so slow for a long time. It finally reached a point where it seemed to have disappeared into the atmosphere and a bright orange light appeared. My mouth was opened the whole time and I never realized it. I never saw anything like that before. We saw a jet near the object before it disappeared. The UFO never flashed a light. The jet did. It was spectacular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/7/01 20:10|Penn Valley/Lake Wildwood|CA|Triangle|3 min|I got a real close look...|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17547.html|213|ndxe200105| I got a real close look...<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sons(2) and three frinds called me outside to our deck to observe a strange light moving around in the sky about a 1000 yards from our home. Upon seeing the light(s), it appeared to be a plane w/landing lights on hovering avove a hill. After watching it for a minute or so with no sound I grabbed a camera. The craft slowly came our way very slowly but still no noise. I snapped photos(not developed as of this writing) as it came towards us at about 200 feet in the air. As it passed very slowly over the house I could hear no sound. It was shapped like a large wing with white lights eluminating the bottom. The bottom was not smooth but had a lot of structure. As it came towards me it had two big white lights close together pointing forward and also blue, red and white lights. Moved slow out of sight.<n>

One larger toward the front and one smaller directly behind it.  It was moving very fast and heading west/southwest.  It made no noise, and appeared out of nowhere and disappeared just as fast.  It was moving horizontaly over the trees (high over the trees) and was in front of the clouds.  I couldn&#39;t tell if it appeared and then disappeared, or whether the lights came on and then went off again (which would hide it from view in the night sky).  It was not a spot light or an airplane.  A spotlight would change in distance as it tracked across the clouds, and the beam would be visible and could be tracked to it&#39;s source.  It had no running lights like a plane would, and as I stated earlier, it was silent.  I live near and work at Paine Field, so I see planes come and go all day long, and this was something completely different.  I believe it was one craft, but might possibly have been two, assuming they could travel VERY close together.<n>
5/6/01 21:30|Santa Rosa|CA|Unknown|6 to 10 seconds|Low flying craft with 2 huge Lights/Portals near San Franscio, Ca|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17818.html|215|ndxe200105| Low flying craft with 2 huge Lights/Portals near San Franscio, Ca<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I finally have had my first waking-conscious sighting, and am I excited about it! I saw it on Sunday evening (May 6th) at about 9:30!  I went outside as I do every night to &#34;check out&#34; the sky. I sat down and looked across the valley having a wide range of sky to view.....then, I looked straight up! That&#39;s when movement of something caught my eye slightly  toward the left (south) of me. 2 huge lights were moving south toward San Francisco away from me! I thought, &#34;Gee, I didn&#39;t know planes had tail lights like that! Gee, that plane is awfully low!  Hey! absolutely NO sound!&#34;    By now I am very interested!!!!!!  I tried so hard to make this a plane! Yet, no red or blue lights blinking, I couldn&#39;t make out the wings either! During the week I have watched the full moon change size as it rises. I would say the size of the moon at about 70 degrees-maybe 60 degrees- above its horizon, is the size of  each of the 2 lights/portals on this craft! That&#39;s pretty big!  (I was expecting portals to be about the size of cruise ships portals.) It was difficult to see the body of the craft as it seemed to match the sky. The moon was not up far enough to cast any light on it. I did have the impression the area of the lights was oval and I felt that the outer edges of the circular lights marked the outer edge of the craft. I felt the lights/portals were in the lower ½ of the height of the craft.. I could be wrong here...... I also had the impression that the height of it was long. And, above the light section the craft started to get narrow. Maybe my eye caught this, I don&#39;t know how I know this. The Height: Now, I am not good at judging heights in the dark, but I will do my best here. I am 700 feet up from the valley floor, oak trees in question are about 60ft. tall, and the branches reach out to about 45 feet. The area I viewed the craft in was: (with one eye shut)one hand from wrist to fingers plus the length of my another hand&#39;s fingers. The width of the craft where the portal area was: (with one eye shut)4 palm knuckles across. My guess is that the craft was 1000 feet above me, making the craft large. If the craft was up higher than that, this was a huge craft! Hard to tell for the lights were SO large. When I first went outside apparently the craft was going right over my head! When I noticed it, the craft bottom had already passed me. The brightness of the lights/portals dulled everything else about the craft as well as no moon shining on it. No light was emitted outward from these lights/portals, it was all internal lighting. I had no missing time. During the long 6 to 10 seconds of viewing it and afterward, I felt calm, happy. There was like a gentleness to the craft. What a treat this was for me!!<n>
5/6/01 21:09|Oakland|CA|Formation|10 seconds|Dim, fast-moving, rapidly-changing formation startles Bay Area satellite observer.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17537.html|216|ndxe200105| Dim, fast-moving, rapidly-changing formation startles Bay Area satellite observer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:09 p.m. PDT May 6, 2001 during late twilight, I was standing on the roof of my apartment building concentrating on an area of the sky just south of the constellation Leo awaiting the appearance of a satellite (Cosmos 1943 Rocket, U.S. Spacecom number 19120), which was scheduled to (and did) appear in this area at 9:11 p.m. (Observation of low Earth orbit satellites is an occasional pasttime of mine; I use a satellite tracking program to predict visible satellite passes.) About 5-degrees south of the star Regulus (or at about 207-degrees true, 55-degrees elevation), my attention was diverted by a dim formation of what I think was five points of white (or starlight-like) light moving east to west. I estimate the brightness of each light to be about magnitude 3.0, only slightly brighter than the dimmest stars visible in our local sky at the time. Apparent size of the formation was approximately 1/2-degree, or the size of the full moon. The shape of the formation was initially diamond-shaped but did not remain constant -- the distances between the lights changed rapidly and the overall shape changed to more of a square or trapezoidal shape. There seemed to be a fifth light which may have been ziz-zagging behind the other four. As I stepped out from behind the wall I was using to block nearby streetlights, the lights quickly pulled into line with each other, and distictly resembled a V-formation as viewed from behind and slightly below (i.e. a nearly-horizontal &#34;V&#34;). The formation faded in the southwest sky (about 240-degrees true) at an elevation of about 30 degrees, appearing to recede into the distance. The formation covered about 30 degrees of the sky in about ten seconds and traversed an arc, the formation&#39;s bearing smoothly shifing from west to southwest. (I consulted sky maps after the fact for azimuth/elevation estimates.) The dimness of the objects, combined with their speed and my own perplexity while observing them, make exact recollection of their maneuvers imprecise. During the observation! , I was preoccupied with comprehending what I was seeing. My first thought was high-altitude aircraft or missiles, but the lights&#39; maneuverability ruled that out. About midway through the observation, I thought that the lights took on a slightly ruddy color, and I considered the fact that I was seeing a formation of birds reflecting the orange sodium vapor streetights of the city. I tried to make out flapping wings or some type of form but could not -- to move that quickly across the sky and relative to one another, birds would have to be fairly low and, given the brightness of the sky (residual twilight, urban light pollution and full moon), I should have been able to make out silhouettes. I am a radio broadcast engineer by trade with a lifelong interest in science and astronomy. I have seen many things in the sky (yes, I&#39;ve even seen the insect-eating UFOs in Excalibur&#39;s spotlight in Vegas), but nothing I could not identify. I don&#39;t know what I saw tonight, but that may be due to the short observation time and faintness of the objects. I am submitting this report in the event that it corroborates other reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  I believe we spoke briefly with this witness.  We found him to be highly credible, as his written report seems to suggest, as well.  PD))<n>

It was a sunset colored and cloudless sky. We came over the mountain/hill thing on Rt.23 where u get a good veiw.  We saw these shiny orange things in the sky.  1 was to the right of the sun, it was siny orange color,like a weird shape, another just like it to the right with another by it which was either a disk or a meteor with a trail.  Some either seemed to move away in the sky or dip below the horizon and some just simply vanished.  But a few others would just pop out of no where, it was really cool but weird. Toward the end of the event me and my mom saw one that just appeared and it definitley was moving fast than the others, it definitley had a tail, i think it was a meteor,  by the time it was completley dark all of them were gone.  there were no more than 5 in the sky at one time. There must have been other witnesses cause planes from the airport took off,  about 3 planes so we werent the only ones that saw im guessing.  And the airport wasnt military if that helps.<n>

It stayed in the same exact same place for about twenty minutes and then disappered below the horizon or into the ocean(could not tell due to the distance) when some boats started to pass close by. It did not look like any conventional or military aircraft I have ever seen,and I ruled out a sailfishing kite because it stayed in the same place for at least a twenty minute period , and it was not the same shape of a kite.

The light very quickly dropped down to about 500 yards (estimating from the desert floor), and suddenly disappeared. The sighting lasted about three seconds.<n>

The appeared to be in a formation similar to ducks. (a V) The moved at different speeds, when first noticed, they were moving fairly slow. But after only a few seconds, they sped up and moved very fast. (much to fast for a plane) Then after a few seconds, they slowed down and changed directions. There is no way that a plane could have changed directions in the way these lights did. PLUS, we noticed for the first time that they broke formation. (at first we thought they were all from one craft) but now we realized they were completely different objects. We lost them as they went over Saddleback Mountain.<n>

Approximately 8 p.m. that evening my wife and another person were sitting at a table on a deck overlooking the Delaware River. The other side of the river is approximately 800 feet away and a rise of trees graduates to a ridge. The direction was West. The party was in its early stages when I heard a reaction by someone to &#34;come quickly...look!&#34; I quickly ran out on the porch and looked West above the  ridge at the sky on the other side of the river. This is what I saw: A pale yellow oval object moving at a relatively slow speed heading East towards my friends home. At first I thought it was an unusual aircraft( strange shape and size...larger than a helicopter, smaller than airplane).  There were some clouds in the sky and there was moonlight. Then SUDDENLY the object changed direction almost 90 degrees south)- and also moved high rate of speed... instantly , zooming out of sight!. My thoughts were that it could not possibly be any aircraft I have ever seen in my 53 years . I saw something that stayed with me for a long time in my mind...could not get over the idea that seeing is believing. To make matters more interesting MY FRIEND IS A BOOK PUBLISHER AND ONE OF HIS AUTHORS OF ((title deleted)) PREDICTED WE WOULD HAVE ALIENS VISIT THE AREA THAT EVENING!!!!!! I went to the party to have a good time and didn&#39;t give this prognostication a second thought. I BELIEVE I HAVE EXPERIENCED MY FIRST U.F.O SIGHTING!<n>

We watched them change formation, come together, spread apart and hover for about 45 minutes. Then, from the south 18 more dimmer lights in a long formation slowly moved in a northern direction, eventually coming together with the two brighter lights in a central cluster. They stayed in that cluster for about 15 minutes, occasionally forming 3 pointed triangles and flashing green and red alternating colors as they moved. As the sun dipped in the western sky they became gradually dimmer until we could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If anyone was witness to this event, we would welcome additional reports.

5/5/01 12:00|Santa Cruz|CA|Disk|20 minutes|Shiny, silver, metallic disc with three small lights horizontaly side by side on the outer edge and rotated.|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87864.html|229|ndxe200105| Shiny, silver, metallic disc with three small lights horizontaly side by side on the outer edge and rotated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the first half of the year 2001 I was living in the surfing town of Santa Cruz, California. Around the first or second week of the month of May I was sitting in my bedroom one Saturday afternoon.  It was a perfect California sky.  All blue with no clouds at all.  I was sitting in a beach chair that had very short legs so I was very low to the floor and I was facing towards the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a very large picture window and from the vantage point of my beach chair being low I could see a large portion of the sky above the Santa Cruz Mountains/Silicon Valley region.  The only object that I could see was the top portion the telephone pole outside with one wire going the length of the window I was looking through.  After about five minutes of looking at the sky to the north I noticed a tiny flicker of light way up in the sky.  After a few more minutes I realized that it was not moving, so I payed more attention to it.  The flicker and non-movement made me doubt that it was a plain.  So I got up and went to the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am fortunate to have perfect 20/20 vision and focused extremely hard on the light.  Once I settled my vision I noticed that it was NOT a plain but something odd.  I continued watching it a little longer and could make out a circular shape around the flickering light.  I then went into the living room and got a pair of old binoculars that had one broken lense.  I used the telephone pole and the wire as a reference point to locate the object with the one lense that worked, and then focused in on it.  After I settled my arms and got the best focus I could I was shocked to be looking at a U.F.O.  It was a silver metallic disc with three, small, round lights on the outer edge of the disc.  They were side by side and very close together.  The lights spun around the disc as it rotated in place.  The disc was at a bit of an angle and was reflecting the sun off the top of the disc causing it to flicker with the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disc would also get caught in turbulence every few seconds and wobble as it spun around. I tried to time the spin by watching the lights and I estimated that a complete rotation of the lights took about 1 and a half seconds up to two seconds.  The craft appeared to be up at commercial airline heights of 25,000 to 35,000 feet.  Plus when I watched it with my naked eyes it seemed to be about the size of a commercial jetliner.  From the time I first noticed the flicker to the end when my eyes got tired I am guessing I watched it for about 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My final portion of this report I would like to state clearly, the same way each witness did during the 2001 U.F.O. Press Club conference in Washington D.C. that I will testify in front of Congress to what I witnessed on that day in May of 2001 in Santa Cruz, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

Trajectory absolutely rectilinear.  Altitude estimated to about 5000-10000 ft, 2 to 4 miles away. Speed compatible with, or possibly faster than a jet fighter, certainly much faster than an air liner, but much slower than a meteorite. The object disappeared behind the trees. Witnesses were facing West, directly perpendicular to the object trajectory. Trajectory was between Moffet Field AirBase (in the back of the witnessess, in the East) and Stanford University and had to cross the 101 freeway. The area is densely populated with residential and business. Sky was clear with moon light. Moon was in the South East, to the left and in the back of the witnesses. Object appeared as self luminous, quite bright, size about 1/5 to 1/4 of moon, difficult to assess because of glow surrounding it and luminous trail (?) about 3 to 4 times the size of the object itself. Colors were mostly light green, white and some orange red in the trail. There was no obvious sound heard, however the witnesses were at an outside music concert at the time and may not have been able to hear it if there was one. My wife an I both saw it and pointed it out to another gentleman next to us. Local police was contacted, but did not have any report of this event.<n>

It kinda moved really fast going left to right about 3 feet at a time. It then gave a low-pitched noise that made the stereo shake like a bass amp was in the room. As it did this, a second but smaller one appeared from the bottom of it. The noise then stopped and it flew up until it was about 40ft. When i saw it, it was about 20ft off the ground. It flew straight up then stopped with little or no slowing down, it went NE and with the other bigger one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.

The object appeared to be moving in an easterly direction while I was moving north in a ((type of vehicle deleted)) vehicle. It is because of my job that I am reluctant to make this report at all. My area of patrol is a 24 square mile region that borders the Pennsylvania-Ohio line and is located approximately 15 miles east of the Youngstown, Ohio Airport and  Air Force Reserve Base. I am familiar with most of the types of planes, helicopters,  and dirigibles that fly in and around this area. The object I saw on this particular day was a silver color that was definitely more intense than any of the planes I usually see. The object was circular in shape and had no visible wings. Because I was in a moving vehicle travelling at a speed of 45 miles per hour, I could not estimate the speed of the object as it moved in an easterly direction. I can only guess its size and distance from me as 1 to 2 miles  and the approximate size of a quarter held at arms length. I attempted to pull off the roadway to get a better visual and maybe a still photo, but as I slowed down the object accelerated upward at a tremendous speed and was gone in an instant. The weather was sunny and the sky was exceptionally clear this day with few clouds. The reason that this is so notable is because this area is usually shrouded in cloud coverage known as the Great Lakes Effect, relative to the clouds that form over the Great Lakes Region and move in a southeasterly direction through Ohio and Pennsylvania. It has been 1 week since that sighting and I have not heard any other reports regarding the object on that day.  This report is a result of my interest in knowing if anyone else had witnessed that particular event.<n>

While we were filming the moon, I saw a large dull red object with a tail go through the sky. It appeared to fall from the moon, then it did a turn and headed in a southerly direction .  As much as we tried to capture it on film we didn&#39;t, by the time my husband was pointing the camera in the right direction it was gone. Some strange things happened during this time frame.  All  of the neighborhood dogs were barking and even the two cows that live next door were &#34;mooing&#34;. When we re-wound the tape to see if we caught the object that I saw, a low range, pulsating noise came through on the video that we did NOT hear audibly while filming. It went from soft to  very load and appeared as if it was coming towards us then it sounded as though it  went right through us!  It got very soft going away from us , then it disappeared. It was the oddest noise, kind of like something pulsating under water with a slight&#34; swishing in water&#34; sound too.  My husband said that it sounded like an ultrasound of an unborn baby, you know that swishing pulsing muffled sound. Anyway, the dogs and the cows all calmed down  right after this occurrence as well. My husband and I looked at one another and said, &#34;what the heck was that?&#34; and we both asked each other,&#34; did you hear that at all while we were filming&#34; ? My husband thought that something was wrong with the camera, so we filmed more stuff and it worked beautifully. Neither one of us heard anything except the normal background noises, you know, cars and of course the dogs and the cows.  We live out in a rural area on a one acre parcel. Most of the local houses are on acreage and the dogs don&#39;t bark unless someone or something has caught their attention. As for the cows, they  don&#39;t make any noise at night ever, that we can remember.  We are wondering if this  was a sound that we could NOT hear but the animals were hearing !  The animals all appeared agitated as well as uneasy.  FYI, we live in an area a little east of Mc Cord Air force base and Fort Lewis army base. We as wondering if  the military was conducting a test of  some kind, possibly  ELF or pulsating equipment?  We have the tape if you would like to hear it, or I  can try and load it onto the net and send it to you .<n>

I live very close to the Vancouver airport and have seen hundreds of aircraft (commercial and military) in the last couple years. This aircraft(s) was bizzare. It was as if there was one &#34;leader light&#34; that kept a very straight course. There was one light on the left and one on the right side that kept very haphazzard courses, swirling around the middle light, but never crossing in front or behind it. The lights seemed fairly high, but were uncommonly bright for that height. Judging from what I assumed its height was, the velocity made it clear it was not a commercial aircraft, and even passed a military plane&#39;s speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw three lights, but was unable to tell if there were three separate crafts. The reason for posting this sighting now instead of last year, is because I just read on www.ufobc.ca of someone else seeing a similar craft at almost the same time.<n>
5/1/01 23:00|Owls Head|ME|Diamond|15 seconds|Must have been an alien satalite sent to scan our planet...doubtful it was a ship carrying actual aliens|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43112.html|245|ndxe200105| Must have been an alien satalite sent to scan our planet...doubtful it was a ship carrying actual aliens<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved east to west across the night sky. It had a red light at the end of each point. As it moved forward across the sky it was also flipping at a regular rate. As it moved across the sky a new point would flip into position and it continued to regularly flip and change its orientation all the way across the sky. I can say that i could see a very black body, with the help of the red light at each point. The object was much darker than the lighter star lit background. I was facing south, towards the ocean and looking up at the object about 65 or 70 degrees from the southern horizon. I hollared for my brother to come out side and see this. I&#39;m not sure if he made it out there in time. I waited too long to come to my senses to get a witness, when it finally dawned on me i&#39;m not sure if he made it in time but i&#39;m sure i gave him a full description of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

At first I thought that it may have been a plane landing at a nearby airport, but I watched for about 15-20 minutes and it never moved.  I drove down 3 different roads so that I could see it from different angles.  It looked the same from all 3 locations.  It was a round ball of light, and it didn&#39;t move. I continued to drive home; I was hoping that it would still be there when I got home so that I could show my husband, but after about 15-20minutes, I saw the ball of light disappear, some red streaks of light shoot out from the top and bottom of it , and then it shot straight up into the sky until I could no longer see it. It took about 3-4 seconds for it to disappear out of sight straight up.<n>

I wish I would have had a camera.  It was so large, yet was so silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I am telling this now is because I seen where someone else described the exact same ship that I seen.

5/1/01 18:00|Okeechobee|FL|Light|30 minutes|strange light in the sky, to high to be street light and to low to be aircraft|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43512.html|248|ndxe200105| strange light in the sky, to high to be street light and to low to be aircraft<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always been skeptical about UFOs, until May 2001.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to pick up my daughter from school around 6:00 P.M.. in Okeechobee and when we were coming back home to Kissimmee prairie it was dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was about 2 miles from my camper trailer I saw a bright light hovering above the trees. I was not alone on this sighting; my three daughters were with me and they saw the light, too.  We were coming into the prairie and when I saw this bright light I slowed down; I wasn&#39;t sure what to make of it.  I did know I had never seen anything like it before. It was dark and the only thing I could see was the bright light flashing down in the trees. I knew it wasn&#39;t an airplane or helicopter because there wasn&#39;t any flashing colored light. This light stayed in one place until I got closer. When I got closer, about two blocks from it, the bright light turned off. This scared me. I knew whatever it was had seen the lights of my car so I hurried up and went home to my trailer which was four blocks north of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home I asked my husband if he&#39;d seen the light and he said no, he was watching TV. I asked him to come outside and when he did I told him what I saw. He said it was an airplane; he didn&#39;t believe me.  While I was telling him about this bright light and looking in the same direction, the light came back on in the same place as before. We watched it for about fifteen minutes in one spot but it was not moving or making any noise. It was too dark to see anything except this bright light which just stayed in one place. After about fifteen minutes the lights turned off. I was really curious after this and stayed outside looking into the sky. Then, about five minutes from the time the light went off it reappeared north of my trailer over the trees again. This time it was moving slowly towards our trailer. I&#39;d say it was about three blocks north of us this time. This was getting really scary by now. I could feel the hair on my arms standing up. We turned the lights on our car and the light in the sky went off. When the light reappeared for the third time it was a little further than before. This time it was over a cattle field. I kept an eye on it and couldn&#39;t believe what I saw. I saw lights being shot down from the huge light in the sky. I heard the noise the light beam made. I say &#34;light beam&#34; because that is the only type of noise I&#39;ve ever heard like that.  That was on TV, so I&#39;m not too fond of saying that. If I could describe it any other way I would.  When we saw this we jumped in our car and went closer to where other people lived.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the prairie {Kissimmee} the houses and trailers  are not close to each other and in 2001 there were no street lights and the roads were not paved. I&#39;d say there were about twenty houses in that area at the time. Around the area we were in we only had one neighbor who lived four blocks from us. The next day my three daughters went to school and asked our neighbor&#39;s kids if they&#39;d seen the light and they said no, it was probably the military in the area. I&#39;m from Louisiana and never saw such a thing before. I wouldn&#39;t know if it was military or not but I do know for a fact if wasn&#39;t a helicopter or airplane, for helicopters and airplanes don&#39;t stay in one spot for a long period of time and they have colored flashing lights and this didn&#39;t. SO FOR ME AND MY FAMILY IT WAS A UFO {UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT}.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/1/01 17:30|Henderson|NV|Unknown|3 minutes|I have no doubt of what I saw.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63166.html|249|ndxe200105| I have no doubt of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around April, 2001 in Henderson, Nevada that I was standing in the parking lot of a commercial center.  Around 5:30 P.M., in daylight, I noticed in the sky over my right shoulder a craft hovering in the sky.  I was in the area of Pecos and Sunset Road facing east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the craft, and it was in the distance, perhaps hovering somewhere between me and Hoover Dam at 2:30 O’Clock position.  I saw it for maybe 2 or 3 seconds and then the winds made a huge howling sound (like a whoosh)  and the craft moved at lightning speed and disappeared straight on to the horizon, first bearing right then left.  (At first I thought it was a Stealth from Nellis Airfore Base on exercise, but this craft was much larger than a Stealth, perhaps the size of maybe 100 feet wide and maybe 15 feet high.)  I dismissed it as something crazy as it was near the approach of McCarran Airport in Las Vegas, but I never forgot it, and no one will ever convince me that I had not seen an alien craft.  It wasn’t a saucer shape though… it was different….it was square, perhaps on a curved edge, as it is hazy in my recollection.  However,  it was definitely not a “round” or “oval” vehicle.  There was a certain squareness to it, perhaps with angular edges.  I remember lights too, from the interior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow, saw your piece on CNN and decided to submit this.  It’s what I experienced.  What else can I say?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

No wind no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At  14:56 two witness were out getting groceries out of car.  Looked up East from our back alley (live in Condo) observed very bright white round object high in blue sky going very fast in Easterly direction toward moon which was also visible. They said it passed in front of moon and dissapeared behind the trees.  Clear day, no wind, no sound,flying faster than plane or other flying known object would travel and still  be visible. We live 1 block sourth of 47th Ave and Thomas. The witness are a 16yr old female  and a grandmother.  No drinking, or drugs in background.  A good student at high school and the Grandmother is well educated and very able to tell the difference between flying objects having lived through the WWII and being an observer of aircraft relating to that period. We live in a frequent flight path of Airplanes going to and from Sky Harbor International Airport.  This was not a known plane of any type that we are aware of. Student did state that it was so brilliantly white that she thought it was a piece of paper blowing swifly by the wind. Grandmoter looked and said no it was going to straight and sure to be blown.  They believe that it was a disk or soemthing round like that, that flew swiftly out of sight going East. Also there was no wind at ground level that could account for this. Grandmother did state that she thought it was pretty high up in the sky.<n>

The object was a spherical shape with a purple haze around it with a purple trail/ tail.  The sphere looked like it was emitting electricity to the haze or the other way around.  Then it returned into the cover of the clouds and I never saw it again.  This occurred at Lajes Air Base on the island of Terceira in the Azores.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a clear, cloudless afternoon, when my mate noticed a single bright, cigar-shaped object in the sky.  It was dark grey in colour, with a bright white light (possible a reflection) along it&#39;s western side and made no audible noise.  As we are located in remote Western Australia, we don&#39;t get a lot of aircraft overhead, (besides our own planes that are easily recognisible) so we were quite bewildered.  The object appeared almost stationary, only just moving East across the sky for several minutes.  My mate went and got the digital camera, came back outside and took a photo of the object.  Shortly afterwards it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
