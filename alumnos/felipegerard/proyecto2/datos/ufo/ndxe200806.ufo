It continued to dim till the light had completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have checked NASA and didn’t see any launches for today and that doesn’t make much sense anyways because of the direction of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why I’m writing this because I am sure someone that reads this probably has more knowledge on the whereabouts of China’s and Korea’s timing with their launches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It might be just a test or something and completely explainable, but figured I write to see if there was anyone who needed a collaborator.<n>

I happened to look up threw my moon roof of my car and noticed a bright white light toward Mount Adams which was at a south west direction from our location, but it seemed to be right over Yakima. At first I thought it was a airplane but it had no flashing lights like an airplane. I also observed an airplane fly by this object, the airplane was heading towards Seattle. When I realized the object was not a airplane I told my female friends “what is that”. My friend in the passenger seat tried to look at it threw the moon roof but didn’t see it, so she looked out the window, as she did that the light just in a blink of the eye turned very small like a star in the sky. Me and her observed the object fly north in a upward direction until it vanished into space. I have talked to another female friend of mine who also said her and another friend had seen this light at the same time for about 20 minutes, they were on Mead and 13th ave looking south west when they observed the light. I was wondering if anyone else has seen this light and also see it fly away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it was the moon cause of the size.  But as i got closer to home it was more visible.  It look like a big pale yellow bug light, with smaller multicolored light circling it.  The night sky was clear so I could see it clearly.  I just dismissed it and went back inside.  There was no sound and it was traveling subsonic.  No sonic boom.<n>

Just outside of town on Hwy 287, we were surrounded by at least a dozen &#34;flash bulb&#34; like lights that were hovering at maybe 100ft over the road and keeping pace with our SUV at 80mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One hovered silently right over our car, moving with us and as I watched it out the passanger window, it &#34;flashed&#34; like an old fashioned camera flash bulb when I was looking right up in to it.  It then crossed over the highway and headed back north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The phenomenon lasted for at least 10 minutes.<n>

This all occurred after the 50c pleasantville toll and before the 2$ toll wherever that is. I am driving slow about 60mphs, it had been raining a bit earlier and was still drizzling off and on. I am writing this about 5 hours after the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving along I notice a Triangular shaped abject hovering directly above the highway maybe 40 feet, very close to us. It seemed to be moving very slowly, no more than 10mph&#39;s and it may have been staying still, its tough to judge going down a highway. The object was directly above the highway, with the front point pointing directly at oncoming traffic, I passed directly underneath it and past it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I keep driving still about 60 mphs for a good 3-4 minutes and as I&#39;m thinking what the hell was that thing I see it ahead of me again, same distance above groud, exact same thing. This time I slowdown somewhat to get a good look at this thing and as I pass by underneath it this time, I roll down my window to see if I could hear anything, but did not hear anything. There wasn&#39;t a ton of traffic, but there was a good amount of cars around a couple zooming past me as I slowed down to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a black triangular shaped object about 25 feet each way, with white lights on the corners, the 2 back lights did not appear to emit any kind of shine, just very pure white lights. I did get a good look at the front light though, which did emit a light beam strait ahead of it that I noticed. The light itself was the whole front tip of the triangle, the front ended in a single tipped point, the light starting from that point seemed to extend about a foot back seeming almost crystal like as it seemed somewhat see through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did my best to look underneath it as I got close, I did see some white lights on the bottom of the craft. The object didn&#39;t seem to have any aura or haze around it, When I noticed it the first time I immediately thought it must be a helicopter hovering so close to the ground probably enforcing the speed limit, it turned out not to be a helicopter. And that is it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
6/30/08 22:00|Pacific Ocean (near California coast)||Unknown|5-7 minutes|Two Sailors notice Air Contact while on watch that was not showing up on radar.|5/2/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109012.html|8|ndxe200806| Two Sailors notice Air Contact while on watch that was not showing up on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night while underway onboard an Aircraft Carrier, myself and another sailor were on the 2000 to 0000 Port-Fantail Look Out Watch in the Pacific off the coast of the United States.  I spotted an “Air Contact” and immediately got on Comm’s to report it in.  However, that was proven to be difficult.  I first started to report it as a white light coming from through the fog.  When I attempted to get its elevation, using my hand, it would not stay in one position for no more than a split second and I was only able to provide a target range that it was moving back and forth between.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was reporting it in to the Bridge.  The Bridge could not see it using bino’s, nor was it showing up on radar.  The Bridge and I were stressing the issue, because we had flight op&#39;s going on with Jets in the air.  I had already confirmed with the other sailor that he could see it too so that I knew I wasn’t just seeing things.  The Bridge communicated back to me that it was probably just someone on the flight deck shining a flashlight into the fog.  I reported back that it wasn’t shining into the fog and that it was coming from in the fog.  It wasn’t like a light shining towards me either. It was a lighted object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after the encounter started was when I went from reporting it as a light to reporting it in as an object.  I could then see it as an object that was “Camouflaged”, in a way, with the fog.  The fog made it very difficult to get a good shape of it.  The constant darting backwards, forwards, up, and down diagonally made it very difficult as well.  It was almost egg shaped, but distorted.  Everything about it made it to where you could almost get a good description of it, but then lose good sight of it before you could really process it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5-7 minutes or so, I lost contact with the Air Contact.  Myself and the other sailor were weirded-out knowing that we could the Air Contact yet it did not show up on radar or able to be seen by anyone else.  It remained to be an unidentified Air Contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It did not throw any light beam or light up tree tops, just a very fast, very bright light ?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Actually scared me and I&#39;ve lived in the mountains my whole life, still have no explanation for what we seen.<n>

At the time I had a pathfinder with a sun roof that was open.  The hangers and runways were to my left (East).  This is the vicinity that I saw the light in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have grown up my entire life around the air force base and have been familiar with all kinds of craft, and the lights and how they look at night.  I have lived south of the base, East, North, and West.  I&#39;m familiar with the flight paths.  I was also married to someone in the military.  It would be difficult for me confuse what I saw with any known military air craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had not been dark too long when I saw it. It was sometime around 6 or 7.  My son was in the car but was only around three yrs old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up toward my Left/East and saw a glowing light.  It was an orange color but almost a white orange, not really a darker orange.  It wasn&#39;t a small light that you would confuse with some smaller lights on aircraft.  All I could make of it was that it was a larger, unmistakable light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen probably 3 or 4 shooting stars as well.  This object would almost resemble a shooting star except that it had no tail at all, it was larger, it was more orange, and it moved MUCH more slowly.  It was so unlike any aircraft or aircraft lights that I didn&#39;t even consider it to be this even though it was seen on base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately thought it was a shooting start, but an instant reaction was.. .I can&#39;t see how that could possible be a shooting star either...I&#39;ve never in my life seen one that slow, without a tail or streak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought maybe it was a flare but even flares move faster than that so there is no way.  I&#39;m really not sure what it could have been but it certainly struck me odd enough that I KNEW it was strange and nothing I could reason.  I was surprised  I literally stopped my car in the road and watched it move southwest at an angle through my sun roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first I&#39;ve mentioned it in any way.....I never said anything because there wasn&#39;t a second witness and figured people would call me crazy.  There was no audible sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates no specific date in 2008.  PD))<n>

When the &#39;firefly&#39; arrived at the bottom of the bushes it got a bit brighter. My son said &#39;walk with me&#39; and nothing else to his 2 friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they came around the corner of the bushes, the &#39;firefly&#39; suddenly turned bright blue and grew to the size of a baseball and shot at an angle over a parked school bus and disappeared into the sky.  All 3 witnesses saw the bright blue baseball sized light and were startled considerably when it made the sudden physical change and took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just at my sons place tonite for 4th of July celebration and both the other 2 witnesses were there, and made the same exclamation about how it startled them and how it zoomed into the sky from the base of the bushes.  And they all said there was no sound from the object.  It seemed to be a definite reaction to their presence.<n>

Changed shape to bow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> June 30th 2008 around 5:00 pm eastern time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a big thunderstorm coming from the north that had not reached us yet. The storm was moving fast heading south. Me and my wife where on the porch looking at the clouds when we saw a silver cylinder in a vertical position moving at a steady speed, steady path, from east to west. We saw it for about 30 seconds until the view was blocked by the woods. The object looked like a thick, big, metal Pringles can. It did not make any noise and it was not afected by the strong storm winds. I am guessing it was about 1,000 feet from the ground, it did not touch the clouds. The other weird thing that happened was that when it was getting out of our view for about 5 seconds it looked like a vertical bow, like a bow tie. I tought it was my eyes playing tricks on me until my wife said “did you just see that?, it turned into a bow”. If anyone knows if there are weather ballons, or other artifacts that are like this object  please let me know. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Well this was back in 2008 when me and my friend were in my backyard just messing around, and we look into the sky and see these crafts just floating through.  But they seemed friendly.  They were respectively moving around each other.  It is hard to explain.  Like if they were moving, some of them would go in front of the other and just circle each other as they flew along.  But it just seemed they were goof friends or something.  The thing about this sighting is there was noise.  You would see them vagely in the clouds but you could hear this odd, hovering sound if you would to say.  It had like a faint hovering sound that I can;t explain.  We ran into my parents room where they were watching tv and they didnt beleive us by the time they looked out the window they were gone..<n> <n><n> <n><n> No proof was recorded only 1 other witness<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 2008 is approximate.

They were both next to each other at first, then they started to move apart in different directions.  I know for sure that they weren&#39;t airplanes because neither had any flashing lights and airplanes don&#39;t move that quick in the sky.  I lost sighting as I turned the corner to my friend&#39;s house and as I pulled up in the drive way, I got out of the car to see which direction they went and sure enough, I caught one of them and got a better look at it as it was flying across the sky. There was no noise as it flew across the sky.  As I was staring at the moving light in the sky, my friend came out of the house and saw it too.  He then, told me so that what ever that was, it wasn&#39;t an airplane.  It was really spooky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I saw a circle like, balloon like, white sphere in the sky.   I first saw the object when I was on my back looking to my right which was south.  My head was west and my feet were pointed in a eastly direction.  The craft moved very guickly directly over me.  When I fisrt saw the object it appeared to be higher in altitude when I kept my eye on it  , it seemed to become bigger but still moving away to fast for me to believe. By the time I got off my raft and to the side of the pool it was a lot higher and was headed north at a high rate of speed  about 800 miles per hour.  I live in a fight patten   for Burbank Airport and I see planes coming in and out.  This was moving at least 3 to 4 times the speed as a regular aircraft........<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/30/08 03:15|Bakersfield|CA|Disk|5 seconds|One night, at 3am, I witnessed a disc hovering in the sky, and a giant flash erupted and it sped, disappeared at the speed of light.|6/20/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/110/S110190.html|27|ndxe200806| One night, at 3am, I witnessed a disc hovering in the sky, and a giant flash erupted and it sped, disappeared at the speed of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved back into my parents house in SW Bakersfield because my boyfriend&#39;s (at the time) mother did not like me, and living in a tiny back house with them was horrible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a summer night in 2008, my boyfriend called me at around 2:30 am crying and asking me to please pick him up because his mother was kicking him out of the house, again.  I told him I would be right there.  I was not asleep, nor was I sleepy.  I am usually awake until 3-4 am any ways (I am a nocturnal person).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I parked my car in the next alley, ran to their alley, and crept to their window to spy.  I saw nothing, but could hear them loud and clear arguing, again.  I noticed my boyfriend&#39;s sister&#39;s car parked there, and I hated her, so I let the air out of her rear tires.  I got bored waiting for them to finish arguing, so I out of the alley, and around to the front house.  I stood on the very right side of the front chain link fence, and I could kind of see through to the back yard&#39;s back house&#39;s tiny kitchen window.  I got frustrated that I was not able to successfully spy.  So I got off the fence and, in boredom, looked up at the night sky.  And I saw a UFO floating perfectly in the sky!  It wasn&#39;t too close and not at all far away.  It was about the altitude that a police helicopter would be at if it were searching for a suspect, that should give you an idea.  The UFO was metallic silver, shaped like a disc but it had a flat bottom.  There were no windows, lines, bolts, it was clean. I saw it immediately, and I remember saying &#34;OOh myy GOD!&#34;  And it turned on: two red lights appeared on the tail, and a giant flash appeared in front of it, and the UFO immediately went through the flash at the speed of light.  All that was left was two red lines of disappearing light left over from the speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They faded away, and I was in shock for maybe several seconds, and I started freaking out, in a good way, jumping and running around yelling &#34;OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!&#34; And I looked around to see if anyone else was around to see it.  No one was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at my cell phone and it was 3:15 am, and no one else saw it because everyone was asleep. I will never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on, maybe a year later, two other people and I saw 4 UFOS.  I will submit another report for that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I then thought, &#34;I`m about to witness an accident&#34;, but the two objects came in contact with eachother and stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediatly afterwards, the yellow object made a complete 360 degree turn around the other object with the point (triangle shaped) facing the object #1 the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it completed the circle, object #2 began to glide away until out of sight behind the trees.  Object #1 glided for a moment, shot upwards into the sky, and then stood still like a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked into my house to grab a camera to get a photo of object #1, it then disappeared completely.

I was traveling south on 34b and had just gotten out of the 35 mph speed zone, i was maybe a 2 miles away from King Ferry when my van just died no lights no engine, my hands are bad because of the work I do so i had to lean up to try and start the van.  When I leaned forward is when i saw the bullet shaped craft slowly floating by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out my drivers side window and had a direct line of sight at the side of it, there were no markings on the side of it any where.  My 1st thought for whatever reason was to look for any markings that were USAF, it was only the height of a electric pole above me and slightly behind me.  It was a light color white/gray maybe white/blue i can only be sure it was a light color.  The thing that has stuck with me since the sighting is, the bottom of the craft it had 3 seperate panels that were all lite with a white light.  The panels were the entire size of the bullet shape craft, each panel though was seperate. It also had wings on the sides and to me only looked to be maybe 3 feet tall in total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never have really understood what i saw still don&#39;t but, the entire craft was the length of the chevy custom van i was driving at the time.  After it floated off far enough my van just magicly came back to life engine was on as well as the lights, and i was gone as was as my van would go really freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The part of real estate that happened at is nothing but farm land, was always curious if farms ended up with missing animals during that time.  Another thing i almost forgot was this thing was completely quiet and unreasonably low as it traveled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in 2008 is approximate.

While we were sitting on the swings we noticed what I thought were stars seperate from one another. One object was brighter than the other, the brighter &#34;star&#34; moved then stopped and moved again and stayed in place for hours.The dimmer &#34;star&#34; moved a little faster and stayed in place for the same duration as the other object.They moved probably about 150 miles apart from one another and like I said stayed in place for as long as we were observing.30 minutes later another star moved as a jet flew in its direction.This &#34;star&#34; also stayed in place after it moved out of the path of the jetliner.It appears as if there are many ufos that resemble stars in the night sky!.I have had many sightings on and around the 4th of july,maybe the aliens get brave and move closer to earth to view the fireworks,I dont know.I know how a satellite moves and looks and satellites dont stop and go and seperate from one another then stay stationary for the rest of the night.

It moved further south until we can only saw a flashing small light which made us rule out a blimp. This is when my sister started videotaping. While keeping an eye on this small light, another one appeared on our left side and we caught the string of lights also running from left to right but we also saw what appeared to be an array of lights from the bottom before we saw the running string of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

6/29/08 20:15|Milton|FL|Triangle|2 hours|During a power outage I heard unusually loud roaring from a nearby naval base and saw a triangular shaped orange craft.|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64210.html|40|ndxe200806| During a power outage I heard unusually loud roaring from a nearby naval base and saw a triangular shaped orange craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 29, 2008 my hometown of Milton, Florida experienced extremely volatile thunderstorms for most of the early morning hours continuing for most of the day.  As a result our electricity went out numerous times for a few minutes each until approximately 7:45 pm when it went out for what turned out to be over two hours.  My family home is located right next to Whiting Field NAS helicopter training school (check my address on Google Earth - we have the y-shaped driveway) and during the ten years we have lived here we  have grown accustomed to seeing and hearing a variety of aircraft on a regular basis.  On one occasion a few years ago we had the unexpected pleasure of watching the famous Blue Angels practicing at Whiting for a show on Pensacola Beach.  During their practice we only had to stand on our front porch or in the yard to see the spectacular show firsthand, and the planes were flying so low we could even make out the yellow lettering on each plane.  We also were privy to the enormous noise of the six jets flying in formation which was VERY loud.  On this particular Sunday evening in June, however, we learned that the noise of the Blue Angels paled in comparison to what we heard that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 8:15 that evening my husband and father decided to take a ride toward town to see how extensive the power outage was.  As they were leaving I stepped onto the front porch to smoke a cigarette and as they drove down our driveway an extremely loud roaring began emanating from the direction of Whiting Field.  At first I simply thought that there was some sort of large jet taking off from there (even though they cannot ordinarily accommodate the largest jets), but the noise continued to increase in volume until our windows began vibrating violently and dishes and glassware began to topple over.  This jet-like noise was at least ten times louder than the six Blue Angel jets had been and continued for at least five minutes until it began fading out, but when it ended it did not sound like a regular takeoff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after the loud noise subsided we began hearing a large number of varying types of aircraft.  My son is a Navy veteran who worked on jets and can easily differentiate between different types of engines and he identified several helicopters, small jets, and even prop planes.  Although some of these aircraft sounded familiar to us we all agreed that they were not all the usual training helicopters and planes, plus there was still enough daylight to view them with binoculars and many did not have the distinctive orange and white coloring or the customary lighting.  My son said that it sounded like every aircraft on the base had been scrambled, and those in the air did not fly in the same direction they usually do, but maintained a large circular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this flurry of activity I was looking northeast (Whiting field is west of us) and was stunned to see a bright yellow-orange glow in a vaguely triangular shape.  We have a water tower adjoining our property and this gave me some perspective regarding the size of the craft and it was larger than the tower.  Due to the power outage it was pitch black outside and we are certain that there could have been no other source of the light, which began to pulse (NOT blink or flicker).  This craft flew in a westerly direction for a short distance and then flew straight up very briefly and simply vanished as if the light had switched off, but it never made any noise at all.  The other aircraft continued to fly over many times until the power came back on around 10:00 pm and shortly thereafter ceased completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition to my son and me, other witnesses included my other son and my mother, and when they returned my husband and father informed us that they had also heard the noise and thought they saw something in the sky that was not typical of the aircraft we usually see.  My older son and I were the only ones outside who witnessed the actual orange colored craft. Due to the extreme volume of the roar that preceded the extraordinary flurry of aircraft taking off from Whiting Field we were all terrified of what was happening.  It is so unusual to see aircraft that late at night, and we simply could not imagine what was causing all the commotion. The timing in relation to the storm and power outage also was very unsettling – it started right after the power went out and ended right after the power came back on.  Of course the base has its own sources of power, so we were perplexed about why this event would coincide with a neighborhood outage.  The next morning I was unable to find any reference to this event when I checked the regular internet news websites for our area, both newspaper and television.  I even called the local paper and the administration offices of Whiting field.  The Pensacola News Journal had no reports of anything unusual other than storm damage and the gentleman I spoke with on the base said he had no reports of anything out of the ordinary either. This was a little hard to swallow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the fact that some members of our family, especially my husband, had seen unexplained events before in and around Pensacola, my family insisted that I report what happened although we had never felt compelled to do so before.  If your organization is able to find out what may or may not have happened we would greatly appreciate it.  Perhaps I haven’t waited long enough to give others time to report it locally, but I suspect there may be no other reports because no one here will take me seriously.  Any help you can give us in this matter will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I told them no its too early for a shooting star its not dark yet its only 8pm. About 2 minutes later they said.. there&#39;s another one.. so I looked that time. It was a silver bullet shaped object going across the sky at a fast rate of speed, first I thought it was a plane, but then noticed it had no water vapor trails behind it. My 17 yr old girl went in the house to get the camera to take a picture. We tried to get a picture of several of them but for some reason they would not show up on camera, but we did get a picture of 11 of the 20 that came over the house all traveling in the same direction. The objects at first were only coming over about every 2 to 5 minutes then after about 10 of them, they were occurring about every 30 seconds to 1 minute. At times there were 2 of them in the sky above the house. Two of the objects were changing from red to black.  All of the objects were traveling from west to east. We live in a small town and in my years I have never seen this much air traffic in a 30 minute period. Only 2 planes came through and they both had water vapor behind them and they were not traveling in the same path as the other objects<n>

There were yellow lights gyrating around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 3:00am on 6/29/08 and me and to friends watched an object with yellow lights gyrating around it. Every time I tried to take a picture with my phone it would disappear then re appear a few seconds later. Then it disappeared for a few seconds then re appeared half way across the sky. Evey 20 mins or so it would emit a red/orange glow that would only last maybe a 1/2 a second then stop. The object also never stayed in just one spot in the sky it hovered moving in a triangular pattern. We finally went inside because we thought it was watching us and it kind of scared us. Ever since I have been having strange dreams.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

6/28/08 23:15|Logan- Columbus|OH|Light|25 minutes|Circulating light in sky followed our direction  for a distance of 30 miles.|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64214.html|47|ndxe200806| Circulating light in sky followed our direction  for a distance of 30 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday evening, my husband and I were travelling back to Columbus from Marietta.  As we were driving through Logan, around 11:15 pm, my husband noticed out of his window some light activity in the clouds.   I looked and saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we both assumed it was a spotlight of some sort because the light kept going in a circle.  For the entire duration of the activity, not once did we ever see a solid beam from the ground.  Not once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to follow 33 west from Logan all the way into Columbus / Canal winchester and for 30 miles,  the light followed alongside our left.  As we lost sight of it, our clock  read 11:53pm<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a science major and my husband and I are both very reasonable, logical people, raising 4 children which forces us to pay attention to everything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reasoning that there is no way a spotlight from Logan could have stayed beside us for 30 miles +,    Our next assumption was that it had to be some type of craft, just above the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light we were watching went in consistently large circles the entire time, 30 minutes, as if it were running along the outside/underside of a circular craft, very large at that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At times it seemed to go faster and then slower, but always in circles. I was seated in the passenger seat.  The circulating light would lag behind our vehicle a bit and I had to turn my head toward the back windows to see it,  then it would jump ahead where I could look out in front of the vehicle and see it clearly out of the window,  in front and next to my husband.  At these times of speed change of the craft, we were driving a straight course of road, so it was not our direction changing, the craft itself was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was frustrated that he couldnt get a lengthy glimpse of it to evaluate more throughly what it could be, and so I even held the wheel for him so he could take a longer look for himself.    Again,  we are both well educated individuals.   His father was a pilot, and I am studying Astronomy, and therefore we both have amatuer knowledge normal aircraft.  This was nothing that could be explained by logical events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I like answers to the questions I have, I even did a web search to be sure there werent any grand openings in the area. (Even tho there is seriously no possible way that any light could travel alongside of our vehicle for 30 miles,  and have been from any stationary object,)   I did the search , because I wanted to make sure.  There was nothing of the sort, and therefore eliminated that possibility We mentioned telephoning Rickenbacher airport Base to alert them of an unidentified craft approaching their airspace, but when Ive inquired with them before, I didnt get very far.   They are a military installation and so I understand why some information is not public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I were to assume the size of the craft, around which the light was running,   I would say it was easily the size of at least 2 football fields.      The light did not fade, or stop, or reverse directions or anything.   It went in cirlces,  and looked as if it were on the underside of a giant circular/disk object that was very very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It travelling just above the clouds so we could not see the craft itself. It followed route 33 into Canal Winchester, at which point my husband and I had to head north, but the light continued following 33 until we could not see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very baffling how a light followed our path, in the sky for a distance of 30 whole miles.   I have never seen anything that lasted that long before.<n>

It was moving  southbound, over US-395 near the intersection with Whitney Portal Rd.  My friend and I were out of our car on Whitney Portal Rd, looking at stars, when my friend spotted the object to the east (toward US-395 (Main St)).  The object was silent, not moving very quickly and appeared to be about 150-200 feet above the ground, and approximately 50-60 ft in length, 20-30 ft deep and about 10-15 ft thick (all estimates).  When first spotted, the object appeared to become semi-transluscent and then solid, and throughout the observation, appeared very very dim.  It slowly glided behind some trees, and when we went to the other side of the trees, it was no longer there.  We went back the next night (same time and location) but did not see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Approximately northerly location. Craft was round, with lights (appearing red, white, green bluish) which were located around exterior of object.  Use of a telescope made the light changes easily visible, although they were also visible with the naked eye.  The object was observed from approximately 10:30 to after 3:00 am and was still visible when fatigue won out over observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An hour or two before we quite observing, a second smaller object with the same lighting appeared in the sky below and to the left of the larger object.  It generated the same lights on a smaller scale.

It was me and my brother.  We were star gazing and talking about things when to the east of us we saw what looked like a star.  It was orange in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, we thought it was the planet Venus.  But then it slowly started to move.  At first, it appeared to be moving up but it was heading towards us due west.  When the craft was moving over head we could see a triangular body with red lights underneath it.  We followed it til i moved out of sight.<n>

I told my neighbor it looked like a plane was on fire.  As is came closer it was traveling  at the same speed and height.  I realized it was not a plane and was not on fire.  It was round.  We watched it as it passed overhead thinking it was a shooting star.  Then decided it could not be since there was no tail and the way it was traveling.  As it went off in the distance the shape of it being a circle was even more clearer and it appeared grey.  The fire appearance was on the bottom of the craft.<n>

It is irregular in rate, sometimes once and then two or three in a row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first night I saw the object it landed in the woods behind my house.  I woke up my wife and then she saw it with me as it left.  Then about 2 nights later, around the same time, we again witnessed about 2 of these flying, flashing white lights at different locations in the tree line of the woods.  We tried to video tape them but it just came out dark.  The tape sounds like the Blair Witch Project.  I saw it one more time in the beginning of this month, September 2008, in the yard again next to my pool again around 3 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The white circular light was making subtile movements up, down, left, and right.  It almost seemed to be hovering. It remained still for a short time and then every minute or so it would move again. This &#34;light&#34; seems closer than that of the other stars.  I watched other stars and this one was different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I watched this &#34;light&#34; for 35 mins now.  We thought we should make sure we weren&#39;t crazy so we called a friend.  Our friend sat and watched from his house across town and saw the same as us.  That&#39;s when we decided to make this report.  We watched for about 35 minutes and kind of got freaked out and that&#39;s when we came in.  We will continue watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our neighborhood doesn&#39;t have any lights so the sky is very clear.  We were observing from our front yard. We were not sure which direction it was in, so my boyfriend got a compass out of the attic. Our compass pointed twords the east.  Thank you for you time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Delete it if you want, I felt obligated to write this. first off, I dont believe in UFOs. I find it unfeasible and unreasonable for a craft to come here. At about 12:10 AM, I saw an odd siting. I was simply sitting on my couch playing a video game, trying to fall asleep, when I saw a light outside my window. I figured it was a star, but when I looked up, it appeared to be falling. I assumed it was a shooting star, so I tried to catch it fast. I then realised the light was &#34;fish tailing&#34;. It was falling down in a spiral fashion, not leaving a streak or anything behind it. It did not get dimmer, start to flicker, or do anything abnormal, other than spiral.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if the direction I am looking is north, but I do know that to the north of our city there is plutonium tanks that are submerged in the sand in one of the cities above us. Whether that has anything to do with it, I do not know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

That was the first thing I found to be extraordinary for what I had just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is a bit difficult to estimate its size, because it appeared to look as if it were at a relatively low altitude. The best way to describe the size I saw would be to say  it appeared to be about the size of my thumbnail at my arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was flying VERY fast (i.e. I&#39;d say it took approximately 2 seconds from the time I noticed it for it to have spanned about 120 degrees of arc) and flew only in a straight line at constant velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for its appearance it was dark, dark gray with a shape looking like it could have been octagonal. There were lights of dim red in color in conic shape at each of the vertices pointing towards the center  This is definitely the most perplexing and incredible thing I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to draw an image, but I have to say the lighting was much dimmer than what I had drawn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://img127.imageshack.us/img127/5527/ufokr9.jpg<n>

On the way we seen about 10 - 15 people at another campsite looking up at the sky. A woman at that campsite said &#34;there it is again.&#34; So, we all stopped and looked up to the sky and seen a bright orange/yellow orb like object moving from north to the south. It was moving very slow then disappeared. About one minute later it appeared again same color, size, moving very slow in the same direction, then disappeared. I have seen satellights moving across the sky before and this was too close to the earth to be one. They were the wrong size and color for a light on a plane or helicopter. I have seen several shooting stars in my life and these moved way too slow for it to be that. It was a clear night no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not ask the woman how long or how many times she and her friends had seen the object because I ran back to my campsite to get my camera. I took two pictures of the object the second time it appeared, but it did not show up in the image. None of us can explain what the object was. It was the weirdest thing we have ever seen in the sky. We were at a concert in middle of a feild. The attendance at this concert was about 70,000 so I am sure we were not the only ones who observed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my group of obsevers there was a Teacher, two Veterinarians, Auto Damage Appraiser, Office Clerk, Plumber and a Machinist.

At first I thought it was a helicopter, because I was near the Medical Center area, and it appeared as it was hovering.  I thought to myself for a few seconds, and remembered that the medical helicopter is white and blue.  I remember thinking that the object didn&#39;t look like a helicopter, and that the object didn&#39;t appear to be moving toward me or away from me.  I passed a three bridge underpass, and when I looked for it, it was gone.  I looked in the direction of the Medical Center, and I didn&#39;t see a helicopter.  I traveled another 2 minutes on the interstate and looked in the direction of where I saw the object and I saw a jet flying through the area.  I thought maybe that&#39;s what I had seen, but I remeber that the object was hovering, which a jet can&#39;t do.  I was kind of puzzled because nothing like this had happened to me before.

I was heading north into New Brunswick NJ. from route 130 just coming off the route 1 overpass when I saw a rectangular object which seemed very large, (about finger length with the arm extended.) above the town. The object appeared more like a projection than a solid form, it was a very light yellow with a smaller square with lines thru it of a darker shade in the left corner of it. The object was there by itself (no airplanes) it was not moving. As I drove forward in traffic a tree blocked my view. I was stopped by a traffic light for 10 to 15 seconds by time I moved forward it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving south on I-65 from Hayden Alabama down to Birmingham were I work and also have an apartment. As I was driving I noticed something off to my right, way off in the distance just sort of hovering above the trees. I describe it to my friends as if a giant man had a giant Frisbee turned on it’s side and flipping it up above the trees. It was on it’s side sort of spinning, it hovered for a second, then dropped like it was going to go back behind the trees, but as soon as it dipped down almost out of sight it came back up again hovered for a second again and began to rise slowly. At that point I drove behind a hill and couldn’t see it anymore, when I came out from behind the hill I looked for it but never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a maybe unrelated incident, a few nights before I saw this my cell phone signal went out for a few hours, between the about 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. I finally got in touch with my cell phone provider and the man on the phone told me that service was out from Texas through Virginia, which he further explained was an unprecedented phenomena and they couldn’t explain why.<n>

It had rained and I wanted to see if it was still overcast guessing at whether it might rain again or perhaps in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a streak of light in the western sky and had thought at first it was a bolt of lightning.  However as I continued to view the growing darkness of night I realized that there were silent bright white globe&#39;s or sphere&#39;s with trailing lines of light that simultaneously came out of each direction--north, south, east and west; met in the northern sky spun in a clockwise direction three or four times and then each went back from where they came to start the dance in the twilight over again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These &#34;lights&#34; were not saucer or cylinder shape they were &#34;globes&#34; or &#34;sphere&#39;s&#34; of intensely bright white light they appeared to be as large if not slightly larger than the full moon.  As they traveled from each direction bright white light trailed behind them.  When they met and spun they appeared to look like four &#34;ying and yang&#34; shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live about one to one and a half miles away from several car dealerships which are in the north and I thought to myself that perhaps it was a laser light show used as an advertising tool.  Waterbury, Connecticut is known for its steep hills and valleys so to me it seemed impossible as each globe went to the north south east and west as far as the eye could see; if it was a laser show a hill or valley would get in the way stopping me from seeing its straight continuous path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These &#34;globes&#34; traveled faster than any plane, helicopter or jet that I have ever witnessed in my fifty plus years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not drink alcohol and I do not take any illegal substances I was not sleeping before I took my dog outside so I wasn&#39;t dreaming.  I have NEVER seen anything like this.  My one regret is that I didn&#39;t have my camera phone with me as this sighting lasted more then five to ten minutes and I could have gotten some great shots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I witnessed this in June (2008) several other people have come forward to claim that they&#39;ve seen similar &#34;lights&#34; have called the police and have even made it to the Waterbury Republican newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If there is an explanation for this I would sure like to hear it....since then....I go nowhere without my camera phone!<n>
6/26/08 20:30|Texarkana|TX|Other|3 minutes, twice|I saw this object once before at night from the side and app. 1/2 mile away about 6 months ago, but it was right over head this time (1|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64868.html|77|ndxe200806| I saw this object once before at night from the side and app. 1/2 mile away about 6 months ago, but it was right over head this time (1,000&#39; or less) in day light! It&#39;s huge and it&#39;s silent!!! I beleive it to be a secret aircraft or a real UFO. I&#39;m familiar with milary a commercial aircraft shapes and behavier what i saw Thursday June 26th 2008 is the oddest shape craft i&#39;ve ever seen. It looked like a B-1 bomber and an F-16 rammed together. The sun was setting but there was plenty of light so could clearly see the shape and get an idea of it&#39;s size. The front of the craft had a standard &#39;high speed&#39; fighter jet shape swept wing (30&#39;wide) without a tail section a very long fuesalage and a large main swept-wing. I would estimate the overall length to be 90&#39;-100&#39;(feet), and the wing-span of the main wing to be 80&#39;-90&#39;(feet). The color was dark non-refective gray almost ceramic looking. This craft was moving very slowly towards the South East at around 8:30pm. I watched it for about 3 minutes then it faded out. App. 60 minutes later it came back from the South East on a North Western heading moving much faster but still silent. By this time the sky was dark and could clearly see lights on it. This craft was totally &#39;silent&#39; and it had a delta (triangle shape) pattern of cream colored lights on the front half of the craft, with duller, dimmer cream colored lights on the tips of the main wing. I had seen this craft once before after dark from the side and i could tell that the front delta pattern of lights were slightly lower and a little brighter than the others. All of the lights on this craft are constant, they don&#39;t &#39;blink&#39; and there are no traditional aircraft green or red running lights. This craft is odd, it&#39;s huge and it&#39;s silent!!!. I beleive a few other people in this area ( Texarkana, Hooks, Lake Wright Patman Texas,: Foreman, Fouke Arkansas, and Idabel Oklahoma.) have seen it but only after dark. I know some have reported as a UFO.  ???<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

In the mountains we are used to seeing alot more due to the elevation, including satellites, shooting stars, constellations, even planets, much more than we see in Massachusetts. What my older brother and I saw that night was nothing like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rest of family went to sleep, it was just the two of us, sitting on a large rock looking at the stars. Out of nowhere, in the middle of the sky, a round white light appeared, it seemed to be as far away as the stars. Then as fast as it had appeared, defying all laws of motion, aircraft, it looped extremely fast and dissapeered in a trail. Very far from the city, nothing but trees, mountains in the distance, and a glassy lake reflecting it all, everything we see is plain as day.  the best i can describe, is it appeared in a white flash, then blasted into a U shaped motion, leaving a white haze trail litterally as if it went into hyperspace. and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i turned to my brother to say &#34;did you see that?&#34; he spoke the same words, and we instantly knew we saw somthing extraordinary. However, my brother&#39;s account of the event, and mine, are different. I saw a flash of light that moved in amazing rate and direction, he said he saw a massive object, appear, then dissapeer. Maybe it was his angle, i did not see a large actual object, but for me to see this light if it was as far away as i think it was, must have been very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a flare, or a plane, or anything i&#39;ve ever seen in the sky before. i don&#39;t know of anything that can change it&#39;s course without being acted on by an outside force. Not looking for an investigation, we just want to help with the search for the truth behind all of these sightings, so I wanted to report this thinking maybe there were more sightings like ours in upstate NY.

By the time he came in to get me, object had moved to a different location in the sky, and was also accomanied by a second.  We got out the binoculars and watched them move in a very random pattern.  Every once in a while they would stop, the whole time moving or not the stayed in a line formation one on top of the other a decent yet close ways away from each other. Then a third came in out of nowhere, more faint then the other two but worked its way toward the line formation.  It was hard to tell the shape as it was night but as they moved they looked like blue lines of electricity.  When the biggest one stopped you could see a slight shape of circular and blue triangular lines showed up on its shape.  The one above it never stopped long enough to see a correct shape.  We are both from a small town, and have seen many before and they always come in three&#39;s.  We have seen them together and apart from each other so this is no unusual occurance for us.  This is the first time reporting it.  We are only reporting it now because it has happened so often.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

6/25/08 22:00|Sheffield (UK/England)||Circle|10 minutes|5 lights, Diamond formation above street. UK 2008.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106089.html|85|ndxe200806| 5 lights, Diamond formation above street. UK 2008<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was mid-summer in 2008, I estimate around the time of June around 10pm at night. Myself and a friend of mine left our home to grab some food from a nearby chinese takeout.  As we walked along the road, I glanced up into the sky above the restaurant and noticed 5 solid orange lights, in a diamond/kite formation silently hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate the distance to these crafts from ourselves at approximately 250m away, we paused in our tracks and simply observed what was happening.  The two points of light on either side of this formation(the left and the right respectively) began to slowly move towards each other, in a very smooth and seemingly controlled manner, passing each other and becoming stationary in each others original position (essentially these two lights cross paths and swapped sides on this formation), around 60 seconds later they reverted back to their original positions before disappearing, leaving only 3 lights remaining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These 3 lights began descending to what I would estimate approximately 100m in height above us, and began moving down the street towards us, passing over head.  The formation had became somewhat of a .. &#34;convoy&#34; following one after the other in single file.  The first of the 3 lights passed by approximately 50m and as it did so, the solid orange light emitting from the first craft, simply turned &#34;off&#34;.  Now that the glare of the lights were gone, we could see a circular craft of some sort, silhouetted  against the night sky, it was rotating anti-clockwise very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could tell the craft was rotating due to the fact there appeared to be some kind of components on the exterior hull, slightly darker in colour than the craft itself.  The craft was a silver raw metal kind of colour, as it continued by we stared at this craft intently but strangely enough.. without blinking or turning away, the craft vanished.  It didn&#39;t whiz off at high speed, or make any jerky movements, it was there and then it wasn&#39;t..<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second and third craft did exactly as the first craft had done, it moved over our heads around 50m away from us with the lights turning off at the same point as the first craft, the same type of craft was seen silhouetted against the sky, spinning anti-clockwise very slowly, with the same outside markings as the first craft. It too simply vanished while looking right at it, as did the third craft moments later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no sound, no humming or vibrating which also puzzled us both. My friend observed everything I did, standing no less than 2m away from myself on the corner of the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am fairly certain these were not Chinese lanterns, as their path of flight and movement appeared to be extremely steady and controlled, I do not believe paper chinese lanterns can move in a controlled manner, they&#39;re carried by the wind and these objects were clearly not affected by the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In hindsight, I do not know why I did not attempt to take any pictures or evidence of this encounter. The reason it&#39;s taken me 5 years to make a report of this sighting, is for two reasons:  1) Every time I bring up this encounter with anybody, friends, family, strangers, I am subject to ridicule and people questioning my sanity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) I have struggled trying to locate the proper authorities to report this to whilst living in the UK.

It was 9:55pm at night and I was looking at the stars.  There were two ships out on the horizon that I could see their dimly lit lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I saw a bright gold glowing light over the ocean.  Since it was over the ocean at night, it was difficult to judge distance, but I know it was closer than the two boats out at sea.  At first I thought it was a flare and that a boat was in trouble.  Or, possibly a firework - but it never exploded the way fireworks do.  Then, another gold light lit up to the right of the first.  It was the same size and brightness.  Then a third lit up and it was the same brightness and all three were in a perfectly straight line and perfectly evenly spaced.  The first dimmed and went out and a fourth lit up to the right of the third.  Again, evenly spaced, same brightness, and all in a perfectly straight line.  The second light dimmed and went out and a fifth lit up.  The third dimmed and went out and then the remaining two dimmed and went out one at a time.  All of this happened evenly spaced out in timing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if they made any sound since it was over the ocean, and the waves were so loud, that was all I could hear.  About a minute or two later, to the left of where we saw the first lights, another light appeared.  It seemed slightly less bright than the first group.  Then a second lit up.  At this point, I can&#39;t be clear on what I saw because I was trying to get my camera to cooperate to get a picture.  I only saw two lights this time, but there could have been more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t explain any of the lights.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like them before.  I was surprised by the brightness of them.  The didn&#39;t move or travel anywhere, just hovered and then went out.  I don&#39;t know if this was all part of one entity or if it was 5 separate ones.  If anyone else has seen something like this, I would love to know about it!<n>

One still the other two moved to the right and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were relaxing int he pool on afternoon. He was playing with the dog as I lay on my raft catching some sun. the sky was clear blue. I saw a shining object fairly high in the sky. At first I just thought it was an airplane. We see alot of planes in the area. we live behiind the white tank mountains and close to the Air Force Base, so I know the difference between regular air craft and a jet. Normally when there are planes in the sky you can hear them. The sounds seems to bounce of the mountains. But , there was no noise. I cant say how far away it was. After about 2 Minutes I noticed it had not moved. My husband said it was probably just a piece of trash or a bird. It was very shiny. I noticed moments later that there was three objects of the exact same sape and refplectivness. These were not birds nor was it trash. I watched them and one of the shapes to the right seemed to be moving away to the right of the other and up at the same time. The object on the far left moved to the left and disappered. The object in the middle seemed to be not moving at all. Within an instant I no longer saw any of them. The one in the middle did not fly across the sky like the other two it just suddenly was gone. My husband saw them as well. I now this was not any aircraft that we see normally because of it&#39;s reflectivness or that it made no sound. the movement was not like any airplanr or jet in the area. Some of my friends and family claim to have seen unexplainable things in this area for years. Mostly at night. this was the first time I had seen something like this in the daytime. This area had alot of unexplainable activity and if I knew how I would investigate further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I humoured him and asked him to do a vid, he did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here it is for reference:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3U6s9JCly4  Here is some other guy....<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLFdGEOftMo  Any way, he got deleted off of myspace after posting that. He later contacted me and said I can do this .... just offer a pure and simple prayer and he (Yahweh) will show. I am not that religious, but did go as far as verifying that yes this was the original name in the Bible YHYH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So first night, I said a prayer and felt like a nut, I finished my beer and went inside. What am I doing I Thought....<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, some almond eye&#39;ed people came to my door and wanted to read from the Bible. They were not Jehovah&#39;s but something different... Elohim something....<n> <n><n> <n><n> They read from a NIV Bible and it was something about Israel from the sky. Their look was different two women, one extraordinary beautiful. So I was happy to chat longer...<n> <n><n> <n><n> So thinking this was some Internet Cult or a weird coincidence that night I said the prayer again to check this out. I did see, orbs and flashes the first night. I could not believe it, I saw Yahweh?  Next night, summer, I just had to see one more time, another simple prayer, pure and true.... 3 minutes or so a huge flash and another orb. OMG!  I don&#39;t know what to make of it, it changed my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

My friend and I were talking about UFOs and he mentioned how he was listening to a radio station where a guy was talking about how he saw a UFO in the sky and the person on the radio described it as if you were to hold up your thumbnail to the sky that’s how big it was. So, my friend and I put our thumbs up to compare how big this thing was that the radio person saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after we put our thumbs in the air, we see a ball of light zip through the sky for a few seconds. The light was of a blue or green tint. It flew below the clouds very fast and was not a plane. The light did not move in a straight motion either, it went straight, then bumped to the left and curved, then continued to go straight. We concluded that it couldn’t have been a shooting star or anything of that matter because it did not move in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I actually was able to asee the milky way. Anyway I was looking up w my binoculars in a star cluster i saw what I thought to be a satelite. while I took the bioculars away from my face to see the object with my naked eye i lost sight of it it was heading north way in the atmosphere. It was starting to get cold I went in my truck to put on another shirt as i closed the door and walked back to my observing position I saw a huge green fireball like object very luminous object at a low altitude maybe 1000ft or less heading north I do not know what it was but it was not a meteor but it was breathtaking to say the least...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about two or three times larger than Arcturus. We watched it to see if it was moving or was going to move. It didn&#39;t move for as long as we saw it, about 20 seconds, and then it was lights out. It just disappeared. It was a crystal clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

STERLING, VA<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure the qualifies but last night 6-24-08 around 9:10 p.m. while sitting in my back yard, I was observing the clear sky and bright stars.  I was facing towards the Potomac River looking slightly north-west at a group of three bright stars that formed an astrological triangle.  I am no expert but I think it was a group that includes Polaris.  As I was gazing at these stars just to the left a very bright light flashed head on then disappeared.  It did not shoot across the sky it came on then went out almost like someone turned on a flashlight in the sky then turned it off.   It was 10 times the size of the stars I was looking at. Only thing I can think of perhaps I was witnessing a meteor head on instead of sideways. Is this possible? or did something explode?<n>

I saw an small object in the sky. Approx at a 40-50 degree angle from ground..  I first thought it was an airplane or bird hovering, but this coght my interest when it began moving, like irregular sudden changes in direction I went to my window, and saw the same object shoot over the sky toward south, not far, maybe a km or so, hard to determine. Suddenly  it did a sharp turn west, toward Winnipeg airport. It was moving so quickly it took just a few seconds to  dissapear from my view, because of trees in the neighborhood. I then went outside, and was watching the sky for approx. 2 minutes, and then I saw it again, return from west side of the city. It just came back for a few seconds and made a quick circle on the sky and flew west direction.  It is a  sunny day, blue skies, with a light haze at western and northern horizon. What facinated me was the incredible fast speed the object was moving and sudden turns. It was not an airplane, or a bird, because of the incredible high speed it was moving. what I saw, I don`t have a clue. I will be watching the skies today and tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went out at 1:30 pm and captured the Triangle shadow, came in downloaded the pictures and went back out again at 2:15 pm where I captured the Purple disc.  I&#39;ve enclosed both photos. None of these things were visible to my eye at the time the photo&#39;s were taken.  We live on top of a small ridge and are surrounded by heavy woods, then farm land into the rolling hills.  We are located 10 miles from the nearest small town.   These photo&#39;s were taken at the top of the ridge where my pole barn and horse pasture is located.  I have a pretty clear view of the sky with the tree line evident.  Other people in our area have experienced strange electrical problems according to the repair man, who has been busy fixing the problems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These pictures were taken with a Fujifilm Finepix S700 Digital camera on Auto setting.<n>

One large one small.  The larger object was square brown and mostly transparent with spots.   Although the larger object was square it had the characteristics of an amebae organism.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object was much smaller and very close buy the larger object.  The second object appeared to be of a very shinny silver material but extremely thin. The second object was floating horizontal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was first spotted in the western sky by the first person.  Person # 1 called a coworker over and both saw the larger transparent object but the coworker could not see the thin second object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were stationary and the wind made the larger object wave like a flag because the object was flat.  There were NO aircraft around what-so-ever.  The thin silver object seemed to be pulling or holding the larger object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A large very dark shadow moved over the building and when the witnesses looked back to wear the object they were both gone.  No clouds and a very windy day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event left a &#39;feeling&#39; or impression with one of the witnesses that there was something wrong the event.  Something wasn&#39;t right.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a small object bright white in color, oval shaped, heading in a northwesterly direction. After a few seconds passing by the moon it turned to a directly north heading. It then proceeded on this path for several minutes stopping and starting in its movements. I used the edge of the building to get some kind of reference that the object had actually stopped in mid flight. It seemed to wobble at times when it would start to move then stop again. I kept using the side of the building the entire time to make sure what I was seeing was actually true. I honestly don’t know what I saw but it was unlike anything I have ever seen before. I have no reason to make any of this up and will probably never know what it really could have been but it had an impact on me and my coworkers that viewed it with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It is set to take a snapshot once each minute and store the resultant monochrome images on disk.  On the morning in question, what appears to be a metallic orb appeared in the cloud layer, I&#39;m guessing at around 6000 feet. An airplane had passed by a few minutes earlier and its con-trail can be seen dissipating close to the object&#39;s position. It was quite windy at the time and the clouds can be seen moving from west to east through the 14 frames the object was visible, but the object appeared more or less stationary. On the 15th frame the object had abruptly disapeared from view. It was not a balloon. I checked if any major stars, planets or satellites might have explained the sighting at that time but could find none.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then suddenly it would become one again.  Then the strobe would dissapear and for split second appear a good distance away from its path of direction before instantly appearing back again on path, as if it were dancing, or struggling to stay in this dimension.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then thought that it might be a meteorite that was heading directly towards me.  The light then went dim again and seemed to be either traveling away from me into space or just faded out until it was just a pin prick of light and then I could not see it any more.  It only traveled about one inch from left to right. The sky was very clear.  I have never seen anything like this.  Did anyone else see it?<n>

At first glance I wrote it off as a star or a planet, and then I noticed two more bright objects. I have always been into astronomy and this was unlike anything I had ever seen before. I was deeply excited so I raced home and ran outback and the object that was in the upper left had disappeared but the middle and the bottom right one was still there. At this point I ran in and got my Step Sister and her friend to confirm that this was not a star by just showing them what I was looking at and they too were struck with a since of confusion as to what it was. The one that was in the bottom right hand corner had moved up above the center one and started to move towards the north. While the center object appeared to stand almost still in the sky, moving only slightly but in such a way to suggest that it was not just moving due to the rotation of the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared as bright objects and looked like they had a triangle shape to them similar to a stealth bomber. I know that there is a bombing range and an urban training center just about twenty or so miles in the direction that they where in which is east relative to Seymour. But I am certain that they were not because I have observed the flight habits of them at air shows and my stepsister grew up in an air force family and she was convinced that it was unlike anything she had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Short list of details...<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the observation we saw many aircraft pass through the sky (aprox. 4-7). There was a blur around the objects. I went in to get my telescope and it is when I came out that the second one had started to move away. I was only able to get a quick glimpse of the middle object because it seemed to move every time I would get it in my sighting scope before I looked through the scope.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It has red and white blinking lights, possibly on opposite sides of the object, so it makes it a little difficult to tell in which direction it&#39;s travelling at ny one point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching carefully this evening, however, the object, which appeared to the south and west of Holt, very high in the sky, was moving in such a jerky and erratic fashion that it drew my attention.  It wasn&#39;t moving straight at all, but seemed to be moving from side to side in a zig zag pattern, like someone crossing over stepping stones to cross a creek.  It moved from SE to NW, then veered off E, then N.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said, I&#39;ve seen something like this several times before.  I usually sit on my back porch in the evening to smoke a cigarette (have a grandbaby in the house, so I don&#39;t smoke around her).  And NO, I wasn&#39;t smoking anything else:-).  Anyway, this has begun to puzzle me, so I looked up several key words on the internet, and am surprised there don&#39;t seem to be any regular explanations to them.  Couldn&#39;t it be like a satellite or a surveillance vehicle (not that THAT would be a comfort...)?  At one time, I could have sworn I saw one of these blinking red and white light things do a U-turn in the sky, but don&#39;t think that&#39;s possible, going at that velocity!  I see these at least several times a week, so I&#39;m inclined to believe there&#39;s a good explanation--I just don&#39;t have a clue what it might be.  It&#39;s so high in the sky, and must be moving so fast to proceed across as it does--I just can&#39;t explain how something moving that fast could change course so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d sure appreciate any logical explanation that you could give me.  Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked outside and saw flashing lights, and solid blue and red lights. The noise was obviously a helicopter and I confirmed this when I looked at it with binoculars. The helicopter was a pitch black color against the dark bluish/black sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The helicopter flashed white lights non-stop, repeatedly. It moved around in circles for about 15 minutes making less than 20 revolutions, over my neighborhood and the surrounding neighborhood. I&#39;m guessing other people were looking out and wondering why a helicopter was flying about and making so much noise at this time of the night and especially in a huge area of land that is mostly residential zone (off of the Bothell Everett Highway/164th St). The helicopter finally flew away after 15 minutes towards the direction of where the Bothell Everett Highway would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, there is a FEMA/Army Reserve base near Bothell. My first thought was troops doing training exercises with helicopters. However, why over a residential area and why circle a specific area for ~15 minutes? What did the repeating flash of the white light mean? My next thought was the traffic or weatherman or something. The 11 o&#39;clock news was almost finished though and in my opinion I don&#39;t think you could&#39;ve seen I-5 or I-405 from where the helicopter was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Probably nothing?  Just thought it may be of interest.<n>
6/23/08 23:10|Papillion|NE|Unknown|seconds|Bright light behind a haze changed from white-ish yellow to blue colors.|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64113.html|112|ndxe200806| Bright light behind a haze changed from white-ish yellow to blue colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on my front porch looking down at the ground in deep thought when a bright light in the sky straight ahead of me caught my attention. The light was very bright white-ish yellow as if it were a street light. I could not see an exact shape as this light seemed to be behind a haze. Within 3 seconds of looking up at the light it switched to a medium blue color then bright blue-ish white and then back to the medium blue color. As soon as the light started to change to the blue color it took off in the sky heading north and disappeared within 3-4 seconds. There was no sound as this happened. I would like to point out that the light was not in the sky when I first stepped out onto my porch. I would also like to point out that I live not too far from Offutt AFB &amp; I see airplanes pass over my house all the time. This was not an airplane. This took off in the sky much faster than any plane I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was the same sixze, height, brightness and speed as an airplane. The light was white.We thought nothing of it until it started to get bright. It just got brighter and brighter until it was extremely bright, When the light got extremely bright it had a kind of haze around it like  bright headlights late at night.then immediately following it faded out until it dissapeared. The whole thing took probably only 10 or 15 seconds. My husband is a medical assistant in a doctors office and i am a stay at home mother of 3.

We saw what we thought were two airplanes in the sky directly above us. It was strange because they were flying WAY too close to each other. Usually the airplanes I see leave some lead time between their flight path but these two lights were one directly behind the other. It seemed impossible. After we noticed them they appeared stop for a second and then the one in front started moving while the second one didnt seem to move. I remember that my boyfriend looked at me and  said - is it not moving or is it me? As we continued to watch and the second light started to move but now in a totally different flight path. I continued to watch and thought my eyes were playing tricks on me because I thought I saw was sparks coming from the tail of the plane. I kept blinking my eyes to try to focus on what I was seeing. I watched until I didnt see them any more. A couple things to note are there was absolutely no sound which is unusual for planes we usually see/hear in our area and the lights were blinking white, red and green which to me looked like airplane lights. I thought it was worth reporting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was facing north looking out over the parking lot when I noticed a very bright greenish light appear suddenly over Phinney Ridge for about two seconds in my line of site above the parking lot, then floated for about 2 seconds to the northwest and then disappeared just above the light of sight beyond the tree at the north-west side of the parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately shouted out, “holy s**t did you guys just see that.” Except for one of the guys seeing something out of the corner of his eye, no one else did. This was not a huge surprise as I was the only one facing north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was still quite light to the northwest and there were small scattered high clouds in the sky. From what I remember the light appeared to be well in front of the clouds, so I do not think it was a meteor. I have never seen a meteor at dusk. If it was a meteor, it was perhaps the brightest one that I have ever seen and it had a greenish tint to it. I would say it had a magnitude of brightness perhaps 5 times as bright as Mars when it is the closest to earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watch the Seattle skyline when I go out for walks in the evenings and am familiar with the flight patterns and the lights on the helicopters and airplanes flying above Seattle. I actually scan the skyline for any unusual moving lights or objects. The normal lights move at a snails pace compared to this light. This light just showed up out of nowhere, then disappeared. I have never seen a light moving like this above Seattle or any sky anywhere.<n>

6/23/08 21:45|Sarasota|FL|Triangle|5 minutes|((HOAX??))  Two craft with seven orange lights on each, and a vague, dark triangular shape that housed the lights.|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64096.html|118|ndxe200806| Two craft with seven orange lights on each, and a vague, dark triangular shape that housed the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out riding my bicycle when i noticed an odd orange glowing orb over a large span of forest to the East, resting just above the treeline. The light has never been there before in any of my previous night time bike rides, so my attention was captured. Then a tree got in the way and I couldn&#39;t seem to find the light again, I even doubled back to where I had last been able to see it, but it was gone. I then looked to the other side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was here that I saw the first of the two crafts. It was travelling low and to the South at a very slow speed. It gave off a very low humming noise almost like a ver muted engigine, but unlike any engine I&#39;ve ever heard, especially at such a low altitude. There were seven orange lights placed at distinct locations on the craft. Five were in a row in the central region of the craft and the other two were placed so the seven lights looked like a cross with the short horizontal line at an angle. The lights are represnted by the &#34;o&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -o- -o--o--o------o--o- -o-  The triangular shape seemed to mirror the shape of the lights, however that is hard to illustrate for you as i did for the lights... The craft moved from the right to left as you view the illustration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I lost sight of the craft for four to five seconds as I made a ninety degree turn onto another street. In this very short stretch of time, the craft had gone from flying parallel with me towards the south, to flying parallel with me to the west. Then I came to an area with ponds on both sides of the road, permitting a large area of sight on all sides of me. As I glanced to the left to see if there were any more of these ships, I saw another further away but also flying parallel with my cycling to the west. It looked exactly the same, only the two lights out of line were in the opposite position and it had a red light (illustrated by &#34;X&#34;) as well. Looking like this: -o- -o--o--X---o--o--o- -o-  This craft flew from left to right, as you view the diagram. None of the lights flashed or fluttered at any point during the experience. Then the two ships sped up slightly and disappeared over the horrizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax.  Date is flawed.  Student report.  PD))<n>

It was around 9:00pm. maybe around 45 minutes after 9pm but I am not sure so I will just keep it in the 9:00 hour. Anyway, I walked outside my front door and proceeded to the drive way where some of my family members were getting out of the car and I looked up in the sky right in front of me and saw a blast of light. I can&#39;t explain what it was and I don&#39;t know if it was a UFO or not but it has been on my mind and I need an explanation for what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The blast of light was similar to lightning and acted like a firework. Except there was no lightning or fireworks in the sky because I looked to make sure and the light didn&#39;t fade off like a firework but just kind of sucked itself in and disappeared. It lasted about 3 seconds and had no sound that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was definitely something I have never seen before and thats the best way I can describe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Unpacking car into garage when I heard a strange sound. A whirring sound that seemed to have no direction. Sounded a bit like a washing machine on spin cycle but with a much deeper bass sound. At one point it was quite loud then it began to fade. I stood there trying to gather what direction it was coming from but couldn&#39;t figure it out. Called wife out of house but by the time she came out the sound was weakening away. It was a dry day cloudy there had been rain earlier. Our house is situated on a flight path have heard helicopters, propeller planes and Jets many times of various sizes and at various heights. We also live a couple of miles to two quarries but this was no lorry sound or explosives. We don&#39;t live close to water. We are in the countryside neighbors at a good distance. It wasn&#39;t farm machinery my uncle has a farm used to work on it in the summer. Since it happened I have been trying to rule it out in some way but I cannot find an explanation. I&#39;m a software engineer used to detail I also have a passion for aircraft. After it happened I went walking around the fields but came across nothing. I feel a bit silly reporting this but just thought I should report it to someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As it rises from the trees spiraling in the air it continued to spin as it went off into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sunflower seed shaped aircraft that flies horizontally and vertically while in a rotating motion, this aircraft that is a dull blue gray was rounded everywhere and had some sort of window or some circular shaped panels all over the back side  I don’t know if that’s what made it move or if they are lights, windows I don’t know.  This aircraft flies silently send slow breaking the laws of gravity is what it seems to me. I just had an encounter and wanted to document it and get it off my mind.

The oval was horizontal to the horizon. From the size, I judged it to be an approaching airliner a long way off, but one that seemed too far away to have been on it’s glide path that early. It wavered laterally and vertically just slightly, as it approached (these changes in position were slow and gradual). I estimate it was about a half mile out from the runway when it appeared to slow down. As it grew darker- to a grayish color – and very slowly shrunk in size, I realized that it had changed course and was traveling almost due West. I could still see it bob and weave – but very faintly as it drifted off. I was on the phone with a Dane County Sheriff as the object finally dropped below the treetops and I could see it no more. The object reminded me of a 20 – 30 foot Mylar balloon mimicking an ultra light aircraft in a moderate wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dispatcher said she would notify the Sheriff’s Office in DeForest – the town over which I estimated it was when I lost sight of it.

We were on a mile long rode with hay fields on either side driving south.  This was about 11:15 pm when we spotted a light in the sky.  As we watched it was traveling south to north and was on a parallel path with the earth.  As it got closer, we were able to see that is was actually a ball of fire, orange in color with red center traveling at a rapid speed (guess of 40 mph) at about the height of a helicopter flying, but with absolutely no sound or smoke trail.  As it passed our position we noticed another bright object following behind, on the exact same path as the first.  This also appeared to be a ball of fire, except it was not as contained as the first one.  When it got even with us, we noticed that the object was looser in form and we could actually see embers falling from the object.  I was concerned of possible fire since it was over a hay field.  They both continued on north northeast until out of site.  I would say the object appeared to be the size of a mid-size car, and it was about 50 yards from us.  The objects looked like what I would think space debris would be like but these two objects were not falling from the sky.  They were on a distinct path.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was standing in the street, on Sandhurst Lane, South Elgin, IL, 60177 USA, facing East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw 3 orange lights travelling West-South-West just above the line of air travel.  They were travelling in a formation, in a triangle, then changed to a straight line formation, then an inverted triangle, before disappearing behind the tree-rooftop-line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched to see if they would re-appear on the other side of the obstructions, and they did, just moments before changing formation again to a straight line, then disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was some slight cloud cover, although not in the area where they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound emitted from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several airline-type jets in the area, although none appeared to be in pursuit of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observer is a female, 39 yo, was fully rested, not under the influence of any substances &amp; is college educated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duration of entire encounter was 5 minutes.<n>

We are right on a golf course and on the other side is a separate neighborhood which we saw all of them almost scan. it was very bizarre then we saw more object that were fireball shaped and moved faster than anything vie ever seen they changed colors from red to yellow and even blue but there was no pattern to these lights. There was eventually over ten of them and they all went to the same area even know they came from all directions they started to disappear but one remained there was a large white fireball shaped one that hover for over an hour we went back to see if it was still there and it was in a different location then another one appeared and they were gone.  There is usually not much if any air traffic being that we live in a very country area. I used to live by an airport though in Orlando fl and I’ve never seen any lights like these or anything that shot up and down and at angles in the sky so quickly. i&#39;m still in shock ive seen some ufos before but this was so close and im 100% positive they were not regular air crafts. just to add it was almost as if they hovered over theses houses like they were scanning the neighborhood. it also seemed as if we saw what looked like a jet fly towards the objects<n>
6/22/08 21:00|Palmersville|TN|Unknown|5 minutes|We saw a burning object flying slowly through the air with no identifiable features.|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64181.html|133|ndxe200806| We saw a burning object flying slowly through the air with no identifiable features.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 22nd, about 9pm, me, my father, and my girlfriend were outside of my house in Northwestern Tennessee when we saw a strange object in the sky. It was large, moving very slowly, and smoke was pouring from it. It was clearly on fire. I know it was huge because when you see something that size in the sky you can normally hear it. I could hear nothing. A few times I thought I could hear roaring, as in a great fire, but I think that was my imagination. It was probably in the sky for as many as five minutes. My mom also saw the object. We could not tell what the shape of the object was, the smoke and flickering flames obscured the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was clearly on fire on TOP of the object, that is, not the whole object was engulfed in flame, as I would imagine a meteor would be if it were reentering the atmosphere. Also, it was going very, very slowly to my eye. It was moving from left to right, probably Northwest to Northeast, if I know my directions in that area, which is likely that I don&#39;t but my parents can tell me for sure with a compass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no discernible arc to the flight path. It disappeared behind the tree line after flying through the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The technique being used which captured the unknown object was HDR (High Dynamic Range)and a series of shots were taken over a periof of circa 10 seconds. The object appeared in only one frame (with said frame,the preceding and following frames being shot on a period of a maximum of approximately 4 seconds). The single object was similar in shape to the space shuttle albeit much more streamlined like a nose cone of a rocket and appeared to have no defined detail other than what appeared to be a wing and curved elements at the rear of the object. The object appeared to be travelling from left to right and seemed to be light coloured, perhaps white.The photograph is available (as are the precedinhg and following shots taken) for review if so desired.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/22/08 19:45|Niles|IL|Chevron|15 seconds|V-shaped craft observed over northern Chicago suburb.|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71523.html|135|ndxe200806| V-shaped craft observed over northern Chicago suburb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object first appeared in the southwest bearing northeast.  The sun had set at about 8:31 p.m. and some ambient light remained near the northwest horizon.  In addition to this light, ground light also added light to the night sky so that the sky was not totally dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed a rippling in the sky out of the corner of my eye.  Drawn to what was causing this phenomenon, I looked at that area of the sky and was able to discern the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was impossible to judge the size of the object, however the appearance of its width in the sky was approximately slightly larger than the width of a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was completely silent and no exhaust could be perceived.  It had no navigation lights.  A very slight perturbation was visible surrounding the craft--a rippling of the atmosphere.  This phenomenon was similar to that observed when heat waves are rising from asphalt on a hot summer day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the craft passed the zenith, it turned towards due north with no perceptible change in speed.   Unlike a conventional aircraft that would have had to bank to affect a turn, this craft simply turned without banking and changed its vector smoothly and rapidly towards the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on my observation -- which lasted no more than 12 to 15 seconds -- I believe this craft is an advanced U.S. Air Force stealth platform designed for secret aerial reconnaissance missions.  It uses an anti-gravity propulsion system, perhaps electro-gravitic.   When it changed its vector it was obvious that the &#34;wings&#34; were not used to keep the craft airborne.  The wings were not needed to provide lift or employed as an aerodynamic airfoil.  This was demonstrated by the fact that it did not bank when executing its turn.  Three dimly lit gray circles under the &#34;wings&#34; were what seemed to provide its &#34;lift&#34; and propulsive force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the luminosity of the night sky the object was easily discernable once I spotted it.  The craft seemed to slide rather than fy through the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is also revealing is that this craft flew directly through the TCAs (terminal control areas) of two major airports:  Chicago O&#39;Hare Airport and Chicagoland Executive Airport (formerly Palwaukee Airport) the nation&#39;s busiest executive airport without any alert that I heard of later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m familiar with both civilian and known military aircraft having attended flight ground school and obtained a private pilot&#39;s license for fixed wing single-engine aircraft back in 1977.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a drawing of the craft in photoshop shortly after my observation so the details would be fresh in my memory.  I will email a JPEG of it to you.<n>

I, myself was very shocked and breath taken, do not believe of other life being on distant planets.  But this event shocked the hell out of me and is making me re-think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw-a purple-ish blue figure in the sky twirling in a box like motion.  It made no sounds and gave us all an ominous feeling in the guts of our stomachs.

What was described is exactly what I that night. So I guess I want to verify what the other person saw that night . I saw two lights moving  high in the night sky moving very fast for about six seconds. The lights were side by side in parallel. The light on the right was moving ahead then behind as they moved from the south to the north. The lights were not very bright. I was glad to read that someone else had seen the same thing that I did from the same city and at the same time. The lights were a reddish-orange color and made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

My mother and I were in my living room I was on my computer and she was watching TV. We live very close to Chickamauga Dam.  Had the window open it was a nice day… sunny partly cloudy very hot…. when a flash of some sort filled the room.  It was like someone was outside taking a picture with a flash… except brighter and lasting only a second or two.  At first I thought there was something wrong with my eyes. There was no sound. When I realized it was not my eyes.  I asked my mother…what was that?   She said “I don’t know something just flashed”.   My electricity did not flicker or anything.  This only happened the one time.  I have not heard if anyone else saw it or not.  We were just curious if any one else saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/22/08 03:00|Agoura Hills|CA|Light|7-10 minutes|Strong, pulsating light that changed colors from red to green to white.  Object appeared stationery in sky|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64056.html|140|ndxe200806| Strong, pulsating light that changed colors from red to green to white.  Object appeared stationery in sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was having trouble sleeping during the early morning hours of June 22, 2008.  I had the TV on, and after the cable had gone out for the second time, I opened up the curtains to look out at the night sky through the sliding glass doors that are in my bedroom.  It was around 3:00 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what at first appeared to be a bright star.  It was in the west, at about 45 degrees elevation.  After looking at it for a bit longer, I saw that the light seemed to be pulsating much more intently than from a flickering star.  As I continued to look, I was able to perceive that the light was also changing colors…..going from a yellow-white, to red to green.  And the pulsating effect seemed very strong.  At this time I thought it might be a plane far off in the distance, so I waited to see if I could detect any movement, by seeing if it was coming closer to me, or moving laterally to my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing it for about 2-3 minutes, it was apparent that it was not moving towards me, away from me, or to either side.  It was in the exact same position relative to me, that I had first seen it in.  The very strong, strange pulsating was continuing, so I decided to get a pair of binoculars that I had in the other room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I trained the binoculars on the light, I was now able to more clearly see the pulsating and changing colors of light.  With the aid of the binoculars, it now appeared to me that the lights were extended outward in a somewhat circular or oval pattern.  I could not detect an object within the perimeter of these lights.  But the lights seemed to almost be dancing in a strobe like fashion.  It gave off a very strong electrical effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now about 6-7 minutes had passed by, and I realized that the object was slowly dropping, much like the sun setting over the horizon.   There was a large hill in my line of sight, so in the next minute or so, the object dropped out of view behind the hill, whose apex was at about 25 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never reported any kind of sighting before this, but felt compelled to do so, as I have never seen anything like this before.   It was clearly not a star, planet or a meteorite.  As I stated, I was able to rule out a conventional airplane.  I was also able to rule out satellites and the International Space Station, after going to several websites and reading what the visual characteristics of such a sighting would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other thing that I could think of would be some kind of helicopter, but the nature and shape of the intense pulsating and changing colored lights, seems to make this likelihood remote, in my opinion.<n>
6/22/08 02:50|San Sebastiam (Spain)||Formation|5 min.|UFO formation over San Sebastian, Spain|6/23/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75843.html|141|ndxe200806| UFO formation over San Sebastian, Spain<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi, I&#39;m writing this report to inform you I have a video of a UFO sighting recorded on a NOKIA N95 8gb cell phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video quality is not very good, since it is taken at night in the city, with the resulting light pollution, and the digital zoom to its maximum capacity. The recording is spectacular although the conditions of brightness and sharpness common to this type of devices.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video can be put under all kind of tests to ensure its authenticity. It is absolutely real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not want to avoid comments identify humorous or otherwise by known or not as well known. I hope you do not mind this detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve got a Private Pilot License, and thank to my experience and knowledge about flying, and the knowing on attitude and maneuvers of aircraft on airspace, that&#39;s why I&#39;m absolutely sure that this are not &#34;conventional&#34; fixed wing aircraft. The only possible explanation would be that they were helicopters, but given the characteristics of air space location, time of sighting, weather and number of traffics sighted, it&#39;s hard to believe we&#39;re talking about this type of aircraft (and also due to other reasons explained below).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let&#39;s  describe the facts:  Location: San Sebastian, Spain Date: 06/22/2008 Time: 2:50 AM (local time)  The facts are set in a rainy late night, after a sultry day, classic Basque coast, in the afternoon that triggers a &#34;gale&#34; that completely changes the weather, thus passing a hot sunny day in excess , a late-night and early morning rain, the sky completely covered (the ceiling would be around 600 or 800 feet). Weather conditions certainly were not ideal, either for VFR (visual) or IFR (instrumental) flights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I leave a disco located near the mouth of Urumea river, 300 ft from the sea, and the first thing I see (outside the disco could at that time be about twenty people watching the scene) is something like flares or fireworks (is the first thing that went through my head just seen the objects).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never leave my amazement when I see that they are objects that have a bright orange light, fixed and weak (although the video appears in a flashing mode), which seem to be quite large, and maintaining a steady ascent flight (improper of a flare or firework).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a sighting made up of at least nine traffic. I say at least it is the number of traffic which document the recording, but I am sure that before I started recording I could see more objects. I think there were around 13 or 15 spotted objects. I think this is a considerable number of traffics, which were moving in groups of 3 or 4, some in pairs and solo, with variable speeds from one another, although all were heading in an east-west direction, looking that its point of departure was off or the sea. I could not hear any sound coming from the objects (sound of rotors, ...). The truth is that my proximity to the disco would probably prevent me hear any sounds associated with them, but it is also true that in the case of many objects, it is logical that it had heard a noise, more so considering that the wind, even weak or very weak intensity, was at that time, and after the passage of the gale, north-northwest direction, so it was not a factor which prevented listening t! o sounds from that area, or that slowed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The recording, in mp4 format and weighing 63.4 MB, has a duration of 4 min. and 25 sec., and has audio (with a &#34;taco&#34; or improper word included).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to say it was something I could not believe. I was watching something that escaped my mind all logic by the circumstances of the moment, and physics of flight if we think of objects such as flares and fireworks. I had never seen anything like that. I have never spotted suspicious objects to be classified as UFOs but from my experience as a pilot and my knowledge of aviation, and from an objective perspective, I cannot give a logical explanation and some of what happened on that late night/early-morning of Sunday June 22nd on the sky of San Sebastian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Trying  to clear any doubts, I first put in touch with local newspaper &#34;El Diario Vasco&#34; once I got home (around 03:30 AM). From the paper, and to my question about whether they had received any calls or had known what had happened, they said no, and the person writing that I attended dealt with the subject telling me that I would have the exclusive on the matter. I did not provide any information in this medium, because my focus was solely on finding out what had happened, beyond creating a notice or cause any unnecessary minimum alarm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later I put in touch with San Sebastian Airport with the intention of resolving any doubt in the case of several traffics had taken off from this airfield, which is unlikely since these facilities are operational only from 06:00 h. to 21:00 pm GMT. Indeed, a member of airport security personnel, along with several Civil Guard troops, at that time the only staff at the facility, tells me that since the closing time of the aerodrome there has not been any takeoff or landing operation. Thus, in the narration of the facts and seeking a possible explanation between the event, he tells me that there must have been a chopper concentration close to the field ... If so, that is, if it were private helicopters, where did they take off? at that time? in those weather conditions? how many? what was their fate? There are many questions, in addition to the already questionable as &#34;normal&#34; physical characteristics of the flight, since no one respects Training, traffic looking! each flight develops its sole discretion, even at times to provoke some kind of collision between aircraft. Also, the navigation lights are anything but navigation lights. They are more comparable to &#34;landing lights&#34;, although these are only used at final approach maneuvers, landing and take-off on, but that&#39;s not all, as the brightness, hue, intensity and very important direction of the light beam, not easily explained. Landing light beams are projected in a sense, the flight path, and not through a kind of focus light at an angle of 360 ° as in this case. In the recording can be viewed at all times the same intensity of each traffic light, regardless of their position, and throughout the flight path east-west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking on the possibility that, being helicopters, were those well known and dilapidated soviet made MIL-MI that usually come from Eastern Europe to Spain for the summer fire season, I contacted next day with the tower of Labacolla Airport (Santiago de Compostela, Spain) for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was a landing operation of such choppers over last morning. The only reason for contacting with Santiago de Compostela Airport was that is the only one airport in the northern half of the Spanish peninsula, with the exception of the Foronda Airport (Vitoria), which operates 24 hours a day (H24 operational). The answer given by the driver in command at that time was negative, indicating that there was only air military exercises of NATO airspace early in the vertical drawn from León to the west, there are therefore any flight plan or known traffic area in the hours watching the events. We are talking about a longitudinal distance between two points (San Sebastia! n - León) approximately 160 nautical miles (300 km). We must take into account the rigor that military and civilian authorities established to determine airspace to such maneuvers, for the danger they entail implicit in the civil air operations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given these responses, only have the option of consulting military authorities and the Radar Control Center in Madrid, Spain. Not being easy the access to these establishments, I leave it to anyone interested in the phenomenon of inquiring beyond the initial investigations carried out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All these details about the physics and flight characteristics of the objects spotted have been discussed with different Airline Transport Pilots of recognized national carriers, they can likewise view the recording made, and very surprised at what is seen in the same, have not been able either to give a priori any explanation of the phenomenon. Like me, they could give as valid only the explanation that they were helicopters, yes, with all the questions raised above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can watch the recording at  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPUZuTwUmPE  Best Regards and thanks a lot!<n>

Off to the left a Bright red light caught my attention. Looked in the direction South East and saw a VERY bright Red light ascending out of the woods....or it seemed to be. The object then stopped in mid air..I&#39;mn guesing 20 or 30 feet out of the tree tops. It then changed colors rapidly from red to green to white and the back to red. Moved towards my direction covering approximately 10 miles in a few seconds. Once the object got closer to me I saw four lights on the object in the pattern Red Green Green Red...and a white light at the end...pulsating brightly. This object passed no more than 400 feet over me...and made absolutley NO noise....I have a 2 million power Q-beam I shined on it....and it looked like the motor cycle from the 80&#39;s movie Tron....that&#39;s the best way I can describe it. It continued moving in a North Westerdly direction till out of sight. I am a military veteran and have seen almost all of the known air craft the military has in its arsenal. This object loooked like nothing I have ever seen while I was in service. I did notoce after the object passed over that I was slightly disoriented and a little dizzy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I work a varying shift pattern so I am around all hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just completed the feed and was closing the door to my shed, when my attention was drawn to a bright, light orange coloured, fluorescent type globe moving in what I describe as a relatively slow zigzag movement. It was travelling from the south west to the north east. It was probably no more than 200 feet high and approximately 100 foot north to my location, travelling over the roof tops. The globe from where I was standing only appeared to be about two foot in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light from the globe was constant and bright, at this point I was not aware of any other lights. I could not see any other features.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no noises of aircraft or ground vehicles at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having passed near to my location, the globe appeared to move into a straight flight path, continuing north east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the object had passed, I immediately ran upstairs and looked out of the bedroom window. I could still see the object, however it was by now quite some distance away, and it appeared to be moving faster than when I had initially observed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I located my binoculars and used them to view the object but I could not identify anything further other than I could now see a steady red light on what I would describe as its left side. I was unable to keep the image steady.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather conditions at the time were fine with a light wind. There was a small amount of cloud about. Visibility was very good. I had a clear and unobstructed view of the globe, initially for about two minutes and then through my binoculars again for about one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have thought about all of the logical things that this could be and I cannot think of anything that would give me an answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are several things that I had to take into consideration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had a long experience of being in and around aircraft, both military and civilian. I have served for 10 years in the Royal Air Force, working in and around various types of military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am currently a Police Officer stationed near to the Air Support Unit from where the police and ambulance service fly their helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a very keen interest in all aircraft and as such I have a flight simulator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Firstly, I live in a military zone. However, the main military aircraft flying is helicopters, mainly Chinook and Puma. It is highly unusual to have military jets flying in the area. However, it is rare for the military in this area to engage in night time flying. At the height that I witnessed the globe, there would have been engine noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Secondly, because of my experience of the police and ambulance helicopters I was able to discount them from my observations. There was no aircraft noise. I have worked with both aircraft on many occasions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live relatively near to Stansted Airport (35miles) and the sky is littered with civil aircraft, however, they never fly this low or so close to the houses. I considered that it may have been the landing lights for the aircraft which are sometimes on, but these obviously go out of sight as the aircraft passes. At the time of this incident I did not see any civil aircraft flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The globe light remained in view for sometime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unfortunate not to have any photographs and there are no other witnesses that I am aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have given full and logical thought to all options and I do not consider that this was a low flying aircraft of any description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As such I have no explanation as to what the flying object was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a sceptic when it comes to UFO’s, however, this was and to me an unexplainable and surreal experience and having discussed the matter with my wife I thought that I would report the matter.<n>

6/21/08 23:00|Lake Arrowhead|CA|Other|20 seconds|Moving star, among stars|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65326.html|146|ndxe200806| Moving star, among stars<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen two objects in my lifetime. The last one was about four years ago, and I never reported it. I will report it here soon. I have to recall the details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This one is the most recent. I have been camping and hiking for decades. I know what a falling star looks like; this was not one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Girlfriend and I were camping at Dogwood, a popular camp site, three miles south of Lake Arrowhead. We were sitting in the forest, facing east, next to the fire ring (with fire in it), just chatting. As usual, I was looking up at the stars. It was a clear, black night and there were many bright stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what appeared to be a star moving slowly, seemingly between the stars.  When it caught my eye, I watched it for a few seconds, and then told my girlfriend to look at it. After some difficulty in pointing it out to her, she saw it too.  By that time it “curled” slightly to the “right”, and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time I knew she was watching it, I asked her “Can you see it? Are you watching it? She said “yes”. Then I said “look, it disappeared!”  I was surprised that it caught my eye because it was very subtle, and my eyesight is bad. I looked like a star—i.e., a white dot. Instead of being in, what I would call the atmosphere of Earth, this object was in the heavens; it was among the stars. I kept looking for its continuation, but nothing more was observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, what also surprises me is that my Girlfriend was very unimpressed by this sighting, telling no one else.  Had she not seen it too, I would have doubted that I’d seen it.<n>

As the lights closed in on us, one appeared to be slightly elongated vertically. Most if it was still a reddish-orange but there was some yellow near the top. One of the lights changed course slightly and headed in a more easterly direction. The other light continued to track NE directly towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed overhead, it appeared to be a dark circular object. Its size was that of a half-dollar held at arms-length. Inside this circle were four equally sized small rings of individual red lights. These rings of light were symmetrically arranged around a larger central red light.  My son said the small rings of light changed color from purple to red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound as the object passed directly overhead. After it passed, it looked like a solid orange light again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time the other object was quite a distance from us and still heading ENE. Its light faded slowly until it was gone. The object that passed us continued to track true and steady NE. It slowly faded until it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object covered 20 degrees elevation in the SW to 20 degrees elevation in the NE in about 2 minutes. I’m a private pilot and amateur astronomer and have never seen anything like this.<n>

When I was talking to my neighbor I noticed this yellow, blue &amp; pinkish star swooping down then curving upwards. I told my friend to look up , but it was too late. This UFO disappeared faster then I could utter the words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen anything like it, but my friend &amp; my wife didn&#39;t take me seriously, but I&#39;ll never forget what I saw. This was what they write about. It will never be credible. That&#39;s why it will never be real.  BUT that doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t occur.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw three orange circular lights in the sky, two flying close together and one farther ahead. They were like a long, stretched out triangle. Then the one that was farther ahead dropped lower than the other two and it became an upside-down triangle. The two lights that were close together separated, and the entire formation became more like a &#34;normal&#34; triangle. It was clear that the three lights were separate and not part of the same object. Next, one light went on farther ahead of the other two lights. The two close lights were in such a position as the bunch was almost in a line. The farthest light then slowly &#34;burnt out,&#34; then the middle one, and finally the last one. During this whole thing, the lights were too low to be a plane, but they definitely were not helicopters. They moved very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It must be noted that the sighting was in the general vicinity of an extremely large, mostly abandoned, quarry.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was far away and was dusk, and at first I thought it was a balloon but its measured slow movement in a straight line across the evening sky made me feel it was something else, and my girlfriend after asked  if that was a balloon, said, &#34;No that’s not a balloon.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was clear to us that it was a UFO, and possibly some sort of advanced technology.   We did not feel scared or anything but it was a peculiar object in the night sky, and something I have never witnessed in all my years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred in  North Hollywood, CA 91606 at approximately 8:00 pm in the evening, just a little south of Victory Blvd..

The distance from our sliding glass door to the boundary wall is about 20 meters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She never opened the door but decided to switch off our lounge light and call me to look at this strange object which appeared on the wall.  She called me over to also look and from where we were standing we saw two very bright cigar shaped lights facing us and a smaller body below that which was the size of a large football.  We could not see clearly through darkness of the night mist but quickly took a picture using my wife&#39;s cellphone camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got a little tense about this issue and just quickly left the lounge and went to our upstairs main bedroom, looking at the picture rather than the actual object.  It soon vanished because as curious yet nervous as I was, I had to peer over our balcony to try and see if I could spot this weird thing again, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From looking at the picture all I can say is that we don&#39;t know what it is but it certainly looked uncommon.  Its lights which actually seem like eyes to me kept looking in our direction till we got the guts to run upstairs out of its &#39;site&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have the picture,don&#39;t know what to make of it,j ust thought we would posted this experience and take it from there.<n>

And what I saw was a thin white fluffy cloud with if I didn’t know better another sun behind it glowing brightly yellow .  It was extremely bright and you couldn’t stare at it just like you can not stare at the sun. The cloud  was only covering the center .. I have no idea what this was. My wife and I both saw it until we got off the highway and weren’t facing it anymore about 5 minutes.  It was at about 10 o’clock  high and the real sun was at 2 o’clock and visible. This thing was huge as large as the sun or larger ..<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live on the third floor of an apartment complex in Thornton, Colorado.  The sky was partly cloudy and the sun was still shining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the birds and insects flying around the parking lot and the traffic moving along the cross streets to the south and east of my balcony.  I looked directly above me to the sky and observed a silver colored disk approximately 30 feet in diameter hovering above me at about 1,000 feet. This object did not make any sound.  As soon as I seen the object, it took off at a very high rate of speed to the north and flew out of sight in a split second and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt that this object somehow knew that I had spotted it and that it had been watching me prior to my seeing it.  I am forever changed from a skeptic to a believer in UFO’s by this sighting.<n>

He says to me hurry up check this out, so I ran up to the porch looked to where he was pointing in the sky, and I saw a huge object way up there hovering,the reason I say huge because of the distance aprox. 30,000 feet up. If you can find a big jet airliner in front of his trail of smoke youve got good eyes wouldnt you say? Anyway I had time to run and get my camera but in a panic I couldnt find it, so I ran back outside my uncle went and got binoculars out of his car to get a closer look at this thing. My neighbors noticed us looking up in amasement, they witnessed the object for several minutes then went to get her digital camera, I am looking at this object with my uncles binoculars let me describe what I saw. I saw no lights, heard no sounds, saw a huge v or triangular object hovering and very slowly moving to the south this was right after a storm had passed..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four of us witnessed this I was wondering how many other people may have reported this today?<n>
6/21/08 14:00|Franklin/Brentwood|TN|Cigar|5 to 8 minutes|Large cigar-ish shaped objects in sky above Franklin/Brentwood Tennessee|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64259.html|160|ndxe200806| Large cigar-ish shaped objects in sky above Franklin/Brentwood Tennessee<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Saturday afternoon June 21st around 14:00 hrs.  My wife and I were heading back home from shopping.  As we were driving North on Seaboard lane.  We stopped for a red light at the intersection of Seaboard and Mallory station road.  I then noticed a large cigarish shaped object in the sky not moving.  It was a semi cloudy day with very blue sky, the object appeared to be sort of a dull silver.  We see planes circling in this area quite often awaiting clearance at the Nashville international airport.  I think planes circle in at around 10,000 ft or so.  This object was large, it was longer and fatter than a Boeing 737 and no wings.  At one point as I watch it and was tying to point out to my wife wear it was I actually thought a plane was going to hit it.  The Plane turned out to be above it, as the plane flew behind it heading north, north east direction.  It was hard for my wife to see it because it was dull silver and blended well in the sky with clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then turned West onto Mallory station road.  I had lost sight of it now.  We then turned North again onto Franklin road.  We proceeded to the intersection of Franklin road and Moores lane.  It was here that I was able to then again see the same object.  Again I tried to point it out to my wife, its was then that she saw a different one east a few miles away in the sky.  Once she was able to see that one, her eyes were now trained and she saw the same one I was looking at back at the intersection of Seaboard and Mallory station rd.  Both object were similar in shape and color, one appear smaller but I think it was a distance thing.  If I were to hold a dime as arms length I would be able to cover the larger one up with half of the dime.  My wife claimed to have seen a 3rd object but I cannot confirm that one for I had only seen the 2.  She claimed they “must be airplanes”.  I argued, planes don’t just hang there especially for that long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I’ve seen objects in this area.  I will be submitting my other encounters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It faces WEST. There is a fence about 40feet from my chair.There are homes on the other side of the fence. From this chair my view is mostly toward the sky at about a 45 degree angle. There a few fairly small trees with at least twenty feet between them. They  are in a North to South alignment.(North to my right.) Bright, sunshine day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was drink from a soft drink bottle, I was looking up and to my right when I noticed a very  bright spot, like light reflecting from a mirror. I have observed commerical aircraft in flight of about this size. Ther speed at a few hunderd miles per hour would have taken at least 20 minutes to travel what this did in 10 to 12 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was easy to discount military because their paint is to reduce light reflection and commerical aircraft are painted also, and not be  &#34;brightly&#34; reflective. Iam a very observant person. I would judge this to be about single engine aircraft size at this distance. (No sound)<n>

It was lightening to the South West.  I had just got out of Crandall when I saw some lightening and immediately followed by a turquoise flash of light near the ground several miles off.  It looked like the lightening may have hit a transformer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later I saw the flash again in the same spot.  It was very bright and lit up the sky like lightening but it emanated from the ground.  It flashed like a fast strobe for about a second.  It had the look of a search light or a focused beam of light where you can see the path the light takes through the air, but it was in a wide arc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer to Seagoville I could see it better and it looked like it was coming from the ground somewhere between 175 and I45.  The light flashed the turquoise light and I was close enough now that I could see pink light mixed in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so bright that it lit everything up in the turquoise color, like how lightening gives everything a blue tint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not sure if something was exploding or if it was firecrackers (it would have had to been an insane amount if it was), or some kind of show going on in a field.  It could very well likely be something mundane.  I just know that I’ve been driving passed that area at that time every Saturday for over a year and I have never seen that before, there or ever. I couldn’t have been the only one that saw it.<n>

When the bottom of the object faced us it had blue lights around it with a red light in the middle.  It moved quickly back and fourth like it was swinging in the air.  Very large and extremly bright when the bottom faced us but barley lite when viewing the side.  It moved back and fourth in an inverted arc and it either went below the building out of view or disappeared.  I have never seen anything like it before so I have to call it a UFO.  I nor my partner could identify it as a plane or craft that we have ever seen.  I work part time as security at a very upscale resort and was on the job when I saw it.  I am also a bank manager as my full time job and a college student.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving home from work.  Initially spotted craft on Old Station Rd, and kept observing it as I drove down Oregon Pass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a black (or at least dark colored) wing initially heading roughly south-southeast.  Wing executed roughly 120 degree turn within an estimated few hundred feet without banking or slowing down, and proceeded over horizon line.  Light arrays looked like running lights I&#39;ve seen on conventional wings (eg. B-2, Boeing&#39;s U.A.V.), but I&#39;ve never seen a wing turn that fast before.  I&#39;ve not even seen vectored thrust aircraft turn that fast before.  Speed was roughly similar to twin-engine private jets I&#39;ve seen operating in the airspace.  No noise that I could hear, but it also appeared to be high and the engine on my truck is loud and windows were up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a note, there is an ultralight pilot who flies regularly in the area.  He usually operates in the morning and early afternoon, but I&#39;ve seen him flying around just before dusk once.  Ultralight is small, low, slow, and brightly colored (mostly white) and makes a buzzing/humming noise when it&#39;s close.  It often looks like it&#39;s hovering if viewed from a distance.  What I saw was higher, faster, darker and bigger than the ultralight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

The object was closer when it was elevating than when it first came in. As it elevated it seemed to look like a comets nose buring into the atmosphere but going Up instead. Its lights got very bright, We said &#34; Looks like its fireing up&#34; ....then when its lights were at theyre peak..it went from zero to Soound of light! As it went up it just dissapeared. Nothing can go that fast, ive always believed in this but till NOW i had never seen ((anything)) like this, im glad me and mi cousin experienced that. I know that me and my cousin were not the only ones awake at that time...there has to be others whose saw the same shit..Seemed like it would have been around past traver..tulare county maybe..im in Parlier, it didnt seem to far when it was ascending..i had to be south somewhere..not too far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the complete story, not one word is a lie, and this for me was defenite proof of what ive always wanted to see and now my eyes are really opening, JULY-20-2008, CENTRAL VALLEY UFO SIGHTING, if any other eyewitnesses were out that night and saw this ufo come in play and blast back off into space, that sh*t was the most craziest sh*t i have really seen, unfu*king believable..but it happened so im telling you now, There IS something other than just humans..so we should all be watching the skies sooner or later.<n>

The sky was dark  blue with some sparse cirrus type clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking into the sky in front of me I had observed what appeared to be an unmistakable disc, a very bright shinny metallic silver, a silver unlike any I had seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had thought to myself, maybe it is a very shinny old plane moving forward, however it was moving slightly to my right as if semi-hovering.  I could not take my eye’s off of it as it,  again ever so slowly shifted to the right .  I had also noticed a jet much farther distant and very  high with it’s vapor trails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself this is definitely a disc and was watching to see if it would make any sharp movement’s, when a tree branch and than a number of buildings obstructed my view for about 5 to 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the craft itself for about 10 to 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When that area of the sky came back into view there was a wide funnel/chimney cirrus type cloud extending vertical and angular to the left, in it’s place.  The disc was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped at the pizza shop, got out the car and went out across the street to get a wider view.  If it was a plane it would still be in view somewhere, I thought.  Nothing in sight except for this broad funnel/chimney type cirrus cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at my pocket watch and it was 12:30 pm Mountain Standard Time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the disc relative to the sun was very near one quarter to one fifth of the Sun.

It appeared to fly under the plane at approximately two to three hundred feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The skin of the object had a shiny brushed aluminum appearance, almost like a new un-painted airplane except it had no wings or port holes of any kind. It also had a rounded nose and back and the back of the craft was black in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After passing under the plane, it made a sudden jog (no curving or sweeping motion) to the left and shot off in a Northerly direction away from the plane.

I pointed to it and I had to ask my boyfriend again what it was and he said he didn’t know.  When he said he didn’t know what it was either the red sphere jet back and forth in a couple of different directions in a radical fashion and then it blinked out and disappeared.

This light was in the shape of a boomerang. It was not a cluster of lights, but one solid light in the shape of a boomerang. The light was a bright yellow. At the tail ends of the boomerang shape the light faded out. It was slowing moving south. The object was moving so slow and so smooth at first I could not tell if it was actually moving or not. However it kept on traveling and soon was crossing over the highway. Then the object changed shape into a small dot. It looked just like a star, yet kept on moving. Then the object changed back to the boomerang shaped and kept on moving south, very slowly and smoothly, unlike any plane or helicopter I have ever seen. The the object/light, still in direct line of sight slowly faded out. It was NOT as if the object got smaller and smaller until you could not see if because it was getting farther. It never changed size, but the light slowly faded out. There was another car in front of me on the freeway, and we were both originally doing about 80 mph, yet we both slowed down to about 50. I am certain the car in front of me saw it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We ran through the house to go out side and at first we did not see it because it was behind a tree but after passing the tree it became clearly visible. It appeared orange travelling at a very high speed thus confirming that it was not a usual aircraft seen in the sky. The craft travelled about five miles with in a minute to a minute and a half moving in sudden different directions. At one point it seemed as if it were moving towards us, soon after the light dissappeared. We did not take our attention off of the light at any moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looked like a yellowish star but more clear. Then two more showed up creating a triangle. It held there for a second then shot across east bound and disappeared. This was much higher then a plane, since we do have an airport near by and we see airplanes all the time. This was NOT a plane. It was dead silent, no other lights were blinking on it, and was much faster then a helicopter or airplane. It was amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was what I can estimate, 3 or 4 miles above the mountain range.  Believing it was landing lights on an airplane I focused back on the road. Several minutes later I looked back and the object was in the same place and I started to look for the nav lights on the wings. As the object pulsated I could clearly see a dark outlines of the object (round or oblong) and no red and green lights were seen. As I drove east on I-40 I observed the object for the next 8 minutes  (11 minutes in total) up till I saw the object quickly shot straight up, the light fading out at which time the object was out of sight.<n>

I looked out the window of the bus and seen a large cigar shape craft. It was above the hills next to the 5 Fwy. The object was hovering still for a minute, made no sound, then slowly flew at an angle. I looked behind me to see if anyone was watching and the man behind me gave me a strange look and turned to see again. Then this craft flew off very fast and vanished. I live in the area and the size of it was fare too big to be a plane, and I&#39;m sure other people driving on the freeway must have seen it also.<n>

Object appears to be cigar shaped with a cone on the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object in question appeared in one of the photos that were taken on July 19th at Dutch Wonderland Amusement Park in Lancaster PA.  The approximate time was 6:18pm and the sky was clear without cloud cover.  The camera was in the process of taking a series of photos in the sports mode (six pictures in three seconds) and the object being photographed was the top of the log flume ride. As you look at the photos, you can see that the log car is just approaching the top of the ride and makes very little progress through the duration of the six photos.  The first two photos appear normal, but in the third photo the object appears in the top left hand corner.  I am not making any claims about what it is; I just found the object to be unusual. As I tried to blow the picture up, the object appeared to be cigar shaped with a cone on the top.  The cone appears to be centered on the cigar and reflecting light, as if it was metallic. I would appreciate someone to look at the photo and give me an opinion as to what it may possibly be.  I am sure that you may have the capability to enhance the photo for more clarification.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got off of work around 11:30 PM on Wednesday, June 18th,|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64016.html|202|ndxe200806| I live on the southside of Chicago in a neighborhood called Mount Greenwood. I got off of work around 11:30 PM on Wednesday, June 18th, 2008.  I went home and everything seemed normal until i went outside for a cigarette around 12:30 AM Thursday, June 19th.  I noticed out of the corner of my eye a quick flash of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up, I saw an EXTREMELY faint light moving in very erratic patterns at an unbelievably fast speed.  Basically, it was zig-zagging in all different directions at a brightness and speed that made it hardly even noticeable. I went to go wake up my little brother and show him. He said he saw it too, but didn&#39;t give it much thought and went back to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat out there and watched for a bit longer until I noticed that the zooming, zig-zagging lights were EVERYWHERE. They weren&#39;t birds, nor shooting stars or airplanes or jets.  This is unlike anything I have ever seen before.  I went upstairs to film this happening on an old video camera that we have had since the 90&#39;s.  The camera did a very poor job picking up anything too strange because of how dark it was outside, the age of the camera, and the faintness of the lights. To make sure I wasn&#39;t going crazy, I called one of my friends to come over and watch the sky with me and he agreed. I got in my car to go pick him up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got back to my house about ten minutes later, and this is when the weird stuff started happening.  Instantly, I noticed that there were more stars out than there were before I left.  I looked up and I saw one of them hovering, moving in very small circles.  This was not some star obscured by clouds as skeptics may say.  This thing was moving.  THEN we noticed that the moving light began shooting out other lights.  When they would shoot out, a very small trail of vapour was seen behind them but only for a second.  After a while, we noticed some patterns.  The lights really only moved when they shot out other lights (except of course those faint &#34;zooming zig-zaggers&#34; which went on all night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, we noticed just how many lights formed triangle shapes in the sky.  Most noticeably were three very bright lights which seemed to be directly above my house which formed an almost perfect triangle.  We continued to watch this amazing display until about 2:30 AM until my friend wanted me to give him a ride home. I dropped him off and came back ten minutes later.  Well, I ended up staying awake and watching the sky until about 5:30 AM because i was so mesmerized and frankly, a little scared.  The same things happened until I went to bed. As a sidenote, I should aslo mention that police ad ambulance sirens could be hear literally ALL NIGHT LONG.  there were non-stop sirens going on for at least 4 hours straight. I don&#39;t know if this has to do with anything, though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up very tired and sore in the neck (probably from staring up all night) around 7:00 AM because I had class to go to at 8 AM.  As I was driving to school, I couldn&#39;t help but notice that the &#34;zoomers&#34; were still there!  Well I went on through the rest of the day until I had to go to work at 2:00 PM.  I had told only one specific co-worker about the whole situation last night because everyone else would just laugh at me.  We waited until it was dark (probably around 10 PM) when I dragged him out of the warehouse that we work at to come outside and see for himself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed out to him one of the clearly moving lights, but he just denied it.  He said it didn&#39;t look like it was moving at all. I got kind of upset, but he told me to just go home that night and film the sky because the camera wont play tricks on you like your eyes might.  So I did again, around 11:30 PM when I got off work.  I had a half an hours worth of tape but I only filmed maybe ten minutes of footage. The triangular star formations were still there, and I saw a very fast vapor streak in the sky which seemed to come down straight to Earth about 20 miles away.  After about five minutes (which seemed like an eternity) I started getting really nervous, paranoid, and itchy.  I felt like I was being watched. I couldn&#39;t do it any more. I was feeling so weird, I just ran inside and reluctantly went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up today (Friday, June 20th) feeling just fine.  I haven&#39;t even bothered to look up at the sky yet.  My friend is coming back in town from his school out in Dekalb, Illinois (NIU).  I plan on showing him tonight and telling him what I saw. We may or may not see something, and depending on how I&#39;m feeling, I may not even care. I have been worrying myself sick these past couple days and these strange lights have given me an unhealthy obsession with the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I really want to know is if anybody else from my area reported similar stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for reading.<n>
6/19/08 00:30|Ventura|CA|Changing|20 seconds|Bright orange object, incredible speed, diamond shaped and turning|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64013.html|203|ndxe200806| Bright orange object, incredible speed, diamond shaped and turning<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sitting on our patio, looking West, an solid, bright orange craft of unknown origin rose out from the western sky and flew East, directly toward us at a very high rate of speed.  The craft flew in our direction for about 7 or 8 seconds growing larger and then banked sharply to its right, bearing South.  As it turned, it gained altitude and speed.  Best guess of altitude was between 2,000 to 5,000 feet.  Speed at the turn was between 400 and 600 knots.  Speed as the craft rose out of the turn and disappeared increased to well over 1,500 knots and kept increasing as the craft disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in Ventura next to the Oxnard airport (very small, local airport) and are also in the flight path of LAX for large jets going to Europe.  We see many passenger planes at night at about 20,000 feet.  Being an avid sky-watcher and novice astronomer I am very well aware of altitude and speed of objects in the sky.  I feel VERY confident of my estimate of altitude and speed.  I have never seen anything in my life move this fast and accellerate so rapidly.  Utterly astonishing! The craft made absolutely no sound and was very low and very close.  It was bright orange with no blinking lights, only a very bright glow.  As it grew closer, before it turned it seemd to be a diamond shape.  Upon turning, the craft left a small aura behind it that dissipated almost instantly.  It was not a lingering contrail like an airplane would leave.  Instead, it looked like vapor coming off the object from such an immediate change in direction and speed (air compression leading to vapor).<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/18/08 23:15|Maryville|MO|Cigar|5-7 minutes|I observed a bright stationary object on the ground soon after leaving Maryville, MO (7 miles NE of the town), between 23:10 and 23:20.|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64176.html|204|ndxe200806| I observed a bright stationary object on the ground soon after leaving Maryville, MO (7 miles NE of the town), between 23:10 and 23:20. I first saw the object from a distance of about 3 ½ miles. At first I presumed it was a helicopter as there is a helicopter club within 12 miles of the area. It was a very bright white/pale blue light and stood out as there are no homes or other light sources for another 5 miles further down the road. When I got within 1 ½ miles of the object, I began to doubt if it was a helicopter as the entire body of the object seemed to be illuminated. Travelling at a constant speed of 45 mph towards the object, I slowed to 25 mph when I got within ½ mile of the object. The object was about 200 ft to the right of the road. I passed the object slowly at about 10 mph just to observe it. It stood completely still, and was completely covered in a bright pale blue light. My view of the object was obscured slightly by a 6 foot tall hedge, but I could still see it clearly. The object was a tube shape or ‘cigar’ shape and I would estimate it was almost 90 foot long and 10 foot high and wide. Although I am not absolutely positive about this, I recall it making a faint sizzling sound, but can’t be sure as at the time I was not concentrating on the sound. With my passengers side window open by two inches, the temperature in my trucks cabin increased by about 50 degrees, and I believe that this heat was produced by the object. It was a quiet night and for the entire 20 mile journey I took, I saw nobody on the road, nobody driving or anybody walking. I presume that the object was in the field before I left Maryville and it was still visible in my wing-mirror for another 2 miles after I passed it. I’ve known this stretch of road for more than 25 years and use it as many as 8 times a week and have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 19th I used the road again and stopped at the side of the field where the object was on the 18th. The object was not there, and there were al! so no si gns that it had been there either as none of the grass was scorched, which I had expected it to be. I am not sure if this object was manmade or not made by man, or simply a natural occurrence, but I am positive that it was not a helicopter, of any other vehicle either.<n>

I have perfect vision and i see what most people call stars are not actually stars. Stars are behind the clouds and therefore w can not see them most of the time, but flying saucers are those dots we see in the sky every night when we say &#34;look no aliens, just stars.&#34; The funny thing being that those &#34;stars&#34; are actually aliens in a flying saucer if you look at it with binoculars. I dare you to look at them with binoculars. You will be suprised or i am schizophrenic, but no one seems to see anything wrong with me besides that and having an open mind. I dare you to prove me wrong. Do it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light seemed to grow brighter and dimmer slightly and at a constant rate as we watched it. It also seemed to move slightly but I can’t be sure because it might have been my eyes. My sister says she saw it move side to side, back and forth slowly. After we watched it for about 3 minutes, it started to get dimmer and suddenly moved up and to the right quickly and faded out completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were walking home I called my friend who lives out of town to the south-east toward Cottage Grove lake. I described what we witnessed. He said he was looking out the window and could see it as well. I believe it was to the east when he saw it. I looked but could see nothing out of the ordinary in the sky. He watched it with me on the phone for at least a half an hour. He said he might have seen jets flying toward it at one point. He said he saw it disappear and reappear multiple times. He also saw it moving quickly in different directions. The entire time it was an orange light. No shape could be discerned and altitude determination was difficult due to it appearing similar to a star. I believe there was only one, but there could have been more since it disappeared several times.  I trust my friend completely and do not believe he would ever lie to me.<n>

As it moved a little closer I could just make out the shape of a triangle or possibly a diamond shaped object.  The object was solid black and about 100 feet long moving very slowly heading south towards downtown Jacksonville.  It was completly silent and I guess about 80 feet off of the ground.  It was probally a quarter mile from my location.  I could also make out a couple small dim white lights that seemed to be on the edges.  At one point it looked like it momentarily turned on some sort of spotlight for a few seconds and shined it on a large ship docked at the port.  It freaked me out and I could not believe what I was seeing.  I watched for about a minute then ran inside to get my wife.  When I came back outside it had started to rain and I could no longer see the object.  This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this.  I don&#39;t want to tell anyone because they might think I&#39;m a nut case.  My wife gave me this funny look.  All I could do was stand there with my knees shaking.  I actually had trouble sleeping thinking about what I had seen.

It was wobbling back and forth. Chrome color and reflecting light from the sun. It was gaining altitude. After looking at it I disappeared and our eyes were seeing spots every where. Our vision was restored with in seconds. The object was not seen then. And about 5 to 8 minutes another object passed by about 400 to 600 feet away and about 7 stories high. It was flying low and close that it shocked us. We were startled and confused. The object that was flying low and it was a donut/oval shape with a dent or a donut hole shape middle. It was wobbling  and flying in a straight line. The object was a satin silver metallic with a slight change in color at bottom. It was flying at around 15mph from south to north. And about a size of a SUV or bigger. It was 18:35 when that happened and then we could not find it in the sky. About 5 minutes later we both saw the same shining wobbling object in the sky again. The first one we&#39;ve seen wobbling and shining going east and gaining altitude. And again it disappeared. I got out of the pool and ran to see where it was and was not found. The low flying object was hovering in flight and wobbling . It was wobbling in a way like a top. But like if it was wobbling on an axis. My wife saw a red glow below the object. Nothing else happened that evening after that event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see updated version of report.  PD))<n>
6/18/08 18:20|Norwalk|CA|Disk|20 minutes|UPDATED REPORT- 3 different objects in the sky Norwalk,CA|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68842.html|211|ndxe200806| UPDATED REPORT- 3 different objects in the sky Norwalk, CA<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is my updated full report. By Witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 18:20, on June 18, 2008. While swimming in their above ground pool at 18:20 the first object seen was by Witness in the east direction of the sky. Object was shining like a chrome balloon. It was wobbling and seems to be going east from west and gaining altitude or getting smaller. Speed of object was slow in moving east. But in climbing altitude was moderate. After about 5 minutes the object could not be seen in the eastern sky. Witness and his wife reported having difficulties seeing well after that object left. They both saw white spots in their vision. And about a minute their vision was restored. The spots can be due to focusing on a small shinny object on a light blue background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now at about 18:30 they continue to look in the sky at an eastern direction and the first contact of the second object was his wife. His wife told him “what is that!” they both starred at the second object. The second object was moving in a straight line north and wobbling like a top making no sound what so ever. It passed through the neighborhood and that object was seen for about 2-4 seconds by Witness and his wife. They both looked at it when it went by. His wife moved up the pool stairs to see more of the object as it was moving out of sight. Witness stood there in shock and did not seen more of the second object as it moved out of his sight. The second object was seen by Witness for about 2-3 seconds. And his wife had seen the second object for 3-4 seconds. After it had passed by they did not move out of the pool. Then Witness yelled for his father-in-law but he was not home. His father in law is a UFO believer because he had a sighting in the 1950’s when he was a young boy. Of a flat black saucer shape with a top hat look, in the city of Norwalk as well. Witness yelled to his wife’s nephew in side the house for the time and it was about 18:34-35. Witness nephew is ^ years old. Witness and his wife were confused and startled. They both were confused and at first did not know what to make if it. Object 2, was flying at about 4-7 stories high. Speed is estimated at 5-25 miles per hour. The second object was about an estimate 200-700 feet away from their pool and house. Approximate size of object 2 was about 15-50 feet in diameter. The second object was traveling north from the south. The type of object was a Disc or Donut Disc Saucer shape. It looked to be round if not oval shape. The ends or corners of the Disc shape was rounded like a donut not thin like a common Saucer shape. The top was slightly rounded like a dome. The bottom was almost like a donut. With a dent or if not a hole in the middle bottom of the second object. The color was satin metallic dark silver. It had a type of shading to it lik! e if the color would get darker when it would turn or move direction. For example there is a cell phone by T-mobile that is called the Wing. It is blue metallic color but when you move the cell phone it makes its color darker. The second object was like that when it moved as it was wobbling, but a satin silver color not blue. There was no sound what so ever from object 2. The wife noticed a slight glow of red under the second object. Too ad there was no visible markings or windows on object. And I did not look like it was spinning but wobbling only.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 5-10 minutes after the second object was seen, another object in the sky was seen almost like the first object. A shinny chrome object in the sky wobbling. Going east from west and gaining altitude or getting smaller. And it was gone after 2- 5 minutes. Just like the first object seen at around 18:20. After that no other object was seen. Afterwards Witness father in law came home and went swimming with Witness and his wife. Witness explained to his father in law of what happened. At around 19:30 Witness and his wife got out for the pool and went inside the house and went to the second floor of their room and looked outside. And then ran outside a few minutes later in front of the house where the second object was seen. Nothing else was found that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All areas of measurements are estimates.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conclusions,   It was either a well advanced engineered aerospace/ U.S. spy aircraft or literally extraterrestrial ufo.<n>

I was standing in my driveway and looked at the sky as i often do. I saw an object, like an airliner without wings, sharply defined, of a pure white color, just like the color and texture of the edge of cumulus cloud. It moved from SSE to NNO silently in about 15-20 seconds, nearly overhead, passing over scattered cumulus clouds in an otherwise clear blue sky. It dissapeared behind clouds at about 10 deg. above the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate its angular size to be about half a degree, or the apparent size of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was receding in the distance, i noticed some &#34;turbulence&#34; of fusiness just behind the object, and something dark gray was visible at the back, like the tail of an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 61 and and a life long amateur astronomer. I consider myself a competent observer of the sky. This is my first sighting of something i can&#39;t explain easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I checked out the sky on my lunch today...June 18th at around 2:10 pm....I swear to God...I have never seen anything in my life...I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me...I saw...a boomerang....huge and low...it hovered, turned west and disappeared...Then about 15 minutes later...I saw a saucer shaped object head into a cloud formation at a high rate of speed.  I will take a drug test and a polygraph....I have been stone cold sober for almost six years.  I never saw ANYTHING until I wrote a screenplay based upon the cosmic Watergate conspiracies...called &#39;Nightmare Hall&#39;...then they started showing up....Man I wish I had a camera...out there today...but honestly...they were so quick....I never would have gotten a good photo...but I swear they are showing up here all the time now....and I will produce evidence and post to this site for sure...I am going to work on it....Check out the skies…experimental or alien…it sure is fun to wonder.  Once you see it…you will believe.  Just watch the skies....especially at night...I swear you will start to see something if you are in or near...Illinois....Most look like a star moving....but wait until it stops and hovers...and keep your eyes on it...and it will explode with a flash of light...and take off...It is totally amazing!!  Never seen ANYTHING BEFORE....and now it is about 2 or 3 per night...every single night since June 7th....I actually lost count.  Most of them are way up there...so binoculars will help if you don&#39;t have 20-10 vision like me...But today...it was lower...and you could see it for sure....most of these are a bright orb at night...and NOT Venus...which can be clearly viewed to the east right now....I want to tell my story...but I need evidence first...and I am not kidding....I am about to call UFO Hunters, the National UFO Reporting Center, or MUFON, as they will see something for sure...It happens nightly....But today was the first time I saw one during the day...You have to ! keep you r mind and eyes open....and you will see one for sure...No doubt about it...I want someone else to confirm it....please watch the skies...and comment if you see something...take an hour at night....when you see the orb start to move...you will believe me. I guess it took a UFO conspiracy screenplay...for them to finally show up in my life.  Today I jumped up out of my lawnchair when I saw the boomerang...it was huge...and black...fifteen minutes later was my first flying saucer too...what the hell is going on?  No way anyone would believe me...until you see it for yourself....I swear I saw what I saw...&amp; I cannot change that.  No one believes me...but you will when you see one. I know what I saw was either experimental or alien.  No craft I have ever seen looked like either of these two things...never seen anything move so fast in my life.  The disk was gray in color...and the boomerang was all black...very low, and very huge.  It didn&#39;t take off...it vanished.  The disk disappeared into a huge cloud. The disk was not bigger than a commercial plane...it was the size of a jet fighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from the same source.

Then we watched it moved toward the north and descending. We then noticed that it was rectangle in shape and greenish color as it moved toward the earth.  When it got near the top of the trees it stopped and faded out of sight.  We walked beyond the trees, and noticed high flying aircraft entering the area, then turning and going in the direction of were the craft was last seen. After just a few  minutes, there were no aircraft in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Triangle Hovers & Shoots Out A Beam Of Light & Follows A Commercial Flight.|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63962.html|219|ndxe200806| Triangle Hovers &amp; Shoots Out A Beam Of Light &amp; Follows A Commercial Flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ever since I was a little kid, I have watched the skies.  I love to star gaze, even if it makes my neck sore.  I have lived 5 minutes from O’Hare Airport for 32 years.   I know full well what a helicopter or plane look and sound like.   I have seen just about every aircraft the military displays at over 20 air shows in my lifetime.  I have seen tons of meteors when I lived Arizona for 8 years. On Saturday, June 07, 2008 at 9:22 p.m., I saw a huge white orb brighter than the moon head directly over my house in a southeastern direction.   The orb was silent, it moved slowly and smoothly.  It was at a pretty high altitude, so the size of this thing was astonishing.  I reported the sighting to MUFON and the National UFO Reporting Center.  Ever since that night, I watched the same areas of the sky…hoping I would see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did see it again tonight, June 17, 2008 at 10:15 p.m.  I saw what I thought was a star just light up so bright, and move slowly downward, it hovered for a couple of seconds, and I could see the shape of the craft this time.  It was definitely triangular.  The light that came off light up the sky all around it like an electrical charge, and the color of the light was a very bright bluish-white.  After it hovered, it turned and took off an absolutely incredible rate of speed, and followed a commercial flight that was heading due north.  It easily caught up to the flight, and passed it up as if it were standing still. I have seen some weird things up in the sky, but this was by far the most unexplainable thing I have ever seen.    Only the Joint Strike Fighter Lightening II, a helicopter, or a Harrier Jet can hover like that.  All I know is…both times I have seen this thing it was silent.  It is my theory the only HUMAN thing I know of that could fly like that is…the Air Force/NASA experimental TR3-A or TR3-B “Night-Walker”, which is part of the Aurora program.  Or it is an alien craft from another world.  A shooting star or meteor does NOT hover like that, and when I see them…they flash across the sky quickly.  I have never seen a meteor turn either.  I will be out there with a video camera from this night on.  I am located in Park Ridge, IL, but perhaps worldwide…if you want to see what I am seeing, check the skies at night…find the big dipper star formation.  I have seen other orbs fly either due north through the big dipper, or just east of the big dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You may dismiss it as a plane at a high altitude…until it stops up there.   They might deny it, but the O’Hare radar has to be picking these things up…unless they are cloaked or stealth.  I am located about 3 miles northeast of O’Hare. Check it out…experimental or alien…it sure is fun to wonder.  Once you see it…you will believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from the same source.

The lights were equally spaced, and were in a line formation.  The lights pulsed in sequence from right to left, then left to right.  Then after 4-5 seconds the lights disappeared.  Approximately 28 minutes later, a single orange light appeared in the same location, and disappeared after 2-3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was above these tall pine trees behind my neighbors house.  This sphere of light moved very quickly.  It moved left to right fast then it didn’t move for about 2 seconds then it moved very quickly to the side and was gone.  It was the size of a big beach ball only except it was a ball of light that was dark green and it was bright, but not to bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited and watched for it to happen again but it didn’t.

6/17/08 22:00|Dresden (Germany)||Light|2-3 minutes|Possible UFO´s seen over Dresden, Germany, no unusual flight paths or speed. Please suggest explanations.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64620.html|222|ndxe200806| Possible UFO´s seen over Dresden, Germany, no unusual flight paths or speed. Please suggest explanations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting in our local pub (about 50 people outside) when one of us pointed up to the sky, drawing our attention. A rather large orange-red, very vibrant pulsating light was visible moving straight across in an airplane-fashion, about the same speed. We had limited visibility through bushes and pub-inventory, when we noticed that there were additional objects with the same appearance that floated farther away from the one we just spotted. At first glance it seemed like a helicopter, however the number of objects and the rather intense light and color would not have justified that conclusion. I went on to a better spot to examine these objects and a friend followed me. Surprisingly no one else of the few people we had made aware of the objects followed, after the incident they explained it was due to disbelief. We´re not sure how many of the guests in the pub had noticed them as well. We gained full sight of the sky, about 2 objects were flying to our left, with the rest in no particular formation to our right, in front of them. They were flying level, apparently with considerable distance between them (the first one we noticed was just glowing so much, seemed much closer), and at normal, aircraft-comparable speed. After watching them for some time and taking a photo via a cellphone, one after another began to disappear. The size of the glowing balls began to shrink, until there was only a very small but shiny star-like glow visible, then they disappeared completely, one after another. It did, to me, not seem like they were speeding away as it is common in ufo reports, but rather that the light got smaller until invisible (it did not dim out).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are examining the possibility of these objects being candle-balloons, however from our observation that does not seem to be a possibility due to a) the extremely bright orange-red color of the objects and b) the straight level flight of all of the objects (horizontal, not upwards).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live in northern Indiana in a town between South Bend and Elkhart.  Although it is close to town we live in an area where there is not a lot of city light, or other things like that.  The night sky is very clear and visible every evening, obviously unless it is cloudy, but anyways.  My background is that I have a small computer business, married, have two little boys a degree in computer science and am an amateur pilot who flies a lot in a Cessna 172 that my father-in-law owns, so I’m not sure that I believe in UFO’s or anything like that, but I know I have never seen anything like what I saw last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside watering flower pots at approx. 22:00, so it was completely dark.  There wasn&#39;t anyone outside but me and it was completely quiet except for crickets and birds, etc.  I happened to just be looking over at my neighbor’s deck which was in a south-west direction from where I was standing.  I saw a reddish-orange oval float up over the top of the trees.  We have many very large old trees in our area, so I am guessing the oval was between 75-100 feet off the ground because of the distance it looked to be above the treetops.  It looked almost like there was a candle in the middle of it, but it did not flicker about 20-30 yards away.  It hovered for a few seconds then started moving slowly to the east.  It didn’t look to be that large, but I couldn’t really tell about the size of it because I wasn’t sure how close it was or its size because of the glowing kind of haze around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved very slowly but steadily for a little ways and I thought it might be a balloon, but there was some variable light winds and it was not bouncing around at all, so I kind of dismissed that.  It also seemed to be moving in too straight a direction to be a balloon, but I don’t know.  It was also strange and it might be paranoia, but I was sure that when it passed over the thick area of trees behind my neighbors home (that was only about 20 yards from where I was standing) that all of the noises of crickets and bugs and birds completely stopped.  You can always here the bugs and birds and other animals, day and night in our back yards because there are lots of trees and a large ravine behind our houses, so there are lots of animals, bugs, birds, etc.  The object then seemed to pick up speed as it moved to the east and I could see the light and shape very clearly for a another minute or so at least.  There was a full or mostly full moon in the background so the object stood out even more.  It then just disappeared from view completely after that and that was the end of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m kind of confused and not sure what it was, but maybe someone else saw something or knows what it was, but it wasn’t anything I have ever seen before.  Hopefully this report will help.<n>

This object wasn&#39;t floating trash (too high for that) and it wasn&#39;t following any wind patterns. No noise was involved from the object. Two other people witnessed this event with me.

I noticed the larger craft below was still there and kept looking for the smaller ones and looked back and the larger one was gone also. I watched the sky and surroundings all the way back to work to try and explain what I saw, but only blue sky and a few clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back to work and no one believed me and thought I was crazy!

I made a right hand turn onto Marilyn Parkway (east)from Kitty Hawk. I was in front of Marilyn Redd Park when I looked to the north and saw a gray disc shaped craft hovering about five hundred feet in the air. It was perfectly still and made no noise what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hovering just to the east of the Mesquite air port and remained in place for about two minutes. It then departed to the north and within one to two minutes was completely out of sight. It was the most incredible thing that I have ever seen. According to a map, it was about 2460 feet away. From my point of vision it was about two inches long and one-half inch high. There is no way in this world that I could have mistaken it for any thing else. The color was gray and reminded me of the color of a side walk. Note: I returned to the location and took a photo of the location and direction of the craft. I have superimposed a disc and it is exactly what I witnessed. (See attached)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/17/08 11:00|Colle D'Valle Delsa/ Scorgiono (Italy)||Other|1 minute|Dim light, like a faint star, moving in a zigzag, changing course abruptly, very, very high in the sky, at a very high speed.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65402.html|233|ndxe200806| Dim light, like a faint star, moving in a zigzag, changing course abruptly, very, very high in the sky, at a very high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were on vacation in Italy in July.  We rented a house in the country, in the Chianti region of Tuscany, and went out late to watch the sky — which was incredibly clear — and look for shooting stars and satellites.   We had gone out two consecutive nights before that to do the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night, we had already seen several shooting stars and two satellites when we spotted a third.  It was a very faint, distant white light, traveling south to west (I think) very high up in the sky — like a dim moving star.  At first, the light traveled at a steady straight pace, acting like a normal satellite.  Then suddenly, after about ten seconds, it veered north, traveling VERY fast (It just took off).  It traveled north for about five seconds, then veered west again and proceeded at its normal steady pace for about another ten seconds.  Afterwards, once again, it suddenly veered north, moving very fast, repeating the same pattern.  After about five seconds it veered west and then disappeared after a few seconds (or I lost track of it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While moving west, the light seemed to move like a typical satellite.  But twice it changed directions toward the north, extremely quickly, moving in a neat zigzag (though it was less of a Z formation and more like a step).  The first time it veered, I yelped and sat up (I was laying down flat on a lawn chair, looking straight up).  My husband, who has undergraduate and graduate degree in physics, agreed that it moved like a satellite at first, but then changed directions very quickly — too quickly in his opinion to be a satellite.  He’s a bit of a skeptic but he agreed that it was a rather weird sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We’re both certain it wasn’t a plane.  We’re not experts but love to watch the night sky, and often have contests to see who can spot the most satellites.  I also often check my sightings against the NOAA page to see if they match.  I didn’t in this case, because we were in Italy, in the middle of nowhere, with no Internet.  At any rate, it definitely looked like a satellite despite the fact that it changed trajectories fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not an expert but it certainly was an eye-popping site.  Looked like a satellite but moved like nothing I’ve seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was getting my luggage out of the car and he was smoking a cigarette when he called me by name and told me to &#34;look at that&#34;. I looked up towards the north and high up in the sky we observed what appeared to be a &#34;glowing&#34; orange-red-yellow ball. The hue changed between the three colors almost similar to a fire. As we watched the &#34;ball&#34; it remained stationary and something (?) appeared to fall straight down from it (also the same fire-like) color. It dissipated before it hit the ground. meanwhile the stationary fireball gradually faded over the course of about a minute until it was completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking out of the window from the second floor of my house.I was looking down at the pond when something caught my attention from the corner of my eye.It was a very large brilliant light.This light was moving slow then stopped .Three other lights appeared behind it out of nowhere they looked like they were in a line formation.The lights would then disappear and reappear scattered but close together.They would move all directions up down left and right, then hover but, not all together. They had no formation at this time.I then saw another light appear way up in the sky above the others,it then slowly moved down to the others.This maybe lasted a couple min.I then thought to get my video camera.I ran inside my house got my camcorder then started videotaping. I only got 20 seconds of video ,then they all vanished into thin air but I caught 3 on film just blinking out.Before I started videotaping i counted 5 of these things together .I dont know if you would call these things starlike or spheres.At times they looked like both. They seemed to be hovering and moving over a farm field area from what it looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend witnessed these too, he lives a half mile away from me.I don&#39;t know what these things are and I don&#39;t know whats going on around here in this greenwood area.This is the fifth strange sighting I have had since 2005.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sun was setting but the sky was still blue.  Coming into to Didcott Station (1st stop from Swindon to London) my attention was drawn to a bright light in the sky.  Initially, I believed it to be the sun reflecting off a plane but noticed that the object had a very short tail (diagonally down to the right-hand side).  The tail was not long enough to be a shooting star or a high flying jet plane and the object appeared to be motionless and not streaming across the sky.  I lost track of the object soon after spotting it under cloud cover over some large chimney stacks.  I tried to take a photo of the object using my phone (5mp - pretty good) but after clicking the button repeatedly the camera would not come on.  As soon as the cloud cover came over, one click and the camera switch on.  This spooked me a little bit!  Pulling out of Didcott Station I then saw a dark coloured helicopter (not a traffic or police helicopter) fly over the train from right to left and head in the direction that I spotted the bright object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Approximately one mile down from the dam. I observed two Greys standing in a clearing in the woods. One was facing away from me (West). The other Facing North. They were hudled together as if looking at something one of them were holding in hand. They were approximately 5&#39;6&#34; tall. They were a pastey light greyish white with a yellow hue to their skin. They were not wearing clothing of any kind. When I saw them I decided not to investigate as this is usually what gets people abducted. My wife asked me what I was looking at and why I looked so shocked. I didnt tell her anything. She is a loud mouth and would have drawn attention to us if Id let her see them. The greys had Very large heads. They had a crease that ran from the forhead all the way back down to the back of the neck. Like two lobes. They were frail and I could see their  &#34; Spinal column&#34; and ribs. The weather was clear and sunny. Excelent visability. It had rained the night before and earily that morning. I only wish Id had my gun with me. I would have shot the two of them and stole their spaceship. That is, If it was even on the ground. I dont know, I didnt see one from where I was. There was a neighborhood  just down river of the sighting area. Maybe a 1/4 mile.

I was driving to work on Hwy. M Monday when I noticed something in the sky @ approximately 8:25 a.m. At first I thought it was a large bird, but I quickly realized it was some type of aircraft. It was flying much lower than an airplane. I&#39;m not good with measurements, so I can&#39;t tell you how high it was flying, but it was close. It was disc-shaped and white or silver in color. There was no smoke trail or noise. It appeared to glide very smoothly at a medium pace. I viewed it for approximately 15 seconds, then looked away at the road. When I looked back up, I could no longer locate it. It was fairly cloudy that morning. I don&#39;t know if it disappeared behind the clouds or what, but it was gone. There is little traffic on that highway in the morning. There are a few houses scattered along the road.

I decided to take a look outside.  When I was looking down the street, something caught my eye.  In the corner of my eye, there was a white dot.  I looked up into the sky to see a figure floating above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought was a plane or blimp, but then I made out its shape.  It was very odd looking. It was in the shape of a mailbox.  Its main color was white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even though the figure was far away, it was pretty big.  From how far away it was, it was about the shape of a labrador retreiver.  But if it was close up, it would be bigger than that.two thin black lines went across it and made an X on the flying object.  The thin X overlapped a cross shape on the object with two thick red lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went at the same speed as a plane, but then it swerved sharply to the left.  It passed by my window after two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have read up about UFO sightings, but none of them described what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the object in the sky, I was astonished.<n>

It was what appeared to be a bright white ball of light roughly the size of the moon with dim edges, although there was some light cloud cover which may have caused this effect, since it appeared to be behind the clouds. It moved extremely fast across the sky in a roughly 10 degree arc moving in a straight line from east to west before disappearing as suddenly as it appeared. It left no streaks like a meteor would, and made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I’ve never had much cause to believe in them or disbelieve, but I’ve never personally witnessed anything that I couldn’t explain in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last few nights, my family and I have been watching something strange going on. I’ve tried finding cosmic explanations for it, but this doesn’t fit the pattern. I’m reporting it- feel free to use or discard the information as you see fit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We’re only able to see this at night. There’s something stationary in the sky with lights going in a circular pattern from right to left.. they then blink several times and start the pattern all over again. If the moon were a clock, it’d be sitting at the 8 o’clock position in relation to the moon.  It continues this pattern for several hours, then around 11:30pm, something shoots off from it.. it looks like a bright white light.. it goes much faster than any falling star we’ve seen, and it zips over into the big dipper and fades out. This is the fourth night we’ve watched this happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in northeastern Maryland. I called friends in Baltimore who also saw the same thing happen. There were 8 of us here and 10 more people in Baltimore who all saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said before, I’ve never seen anything like this, and I honestly don’t know if this is just some technology we haven’t seen before, or if this is something unusual. I just thought I’d pass this along on our behalf. Until this incident, I had no idea there actually was a place to report this kind of thing. I ran an internet search just to see if we might find some government agency to discuss this with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My bed and my sleeping side are right next to the window, which at the time was wide open. Out of the corner of my eye I could see lights moving. Just like the posting from Barberton, Ohio I also live very near an airport as well as several smaller airports, the blimp hanger and an army arsenal. At any given time there is something flying over our home and we’ve become quite immune to lights and loud jet engines. However what caught my eye was the erratic flight pattern. I immediately told my husband to turn off the T.V. so I could hear the plane. As stated before we have become immune to planes overhead but have also established a very discerning ear to plane types and sizes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband then looked out the window and was as startled by the lights as I was. They seem to be moving slowly back and forth in a weaving pattern and eventually moved in closer. I would say within a mile from us. His words word “what the @#%$ is that?”   The lights were in a cross pattern with several down the middle and two to three running left to right. I can only remember the lights being white and thought to myself this is unlike any landing lights I have ever seen. We both jumped out a bed and my husband ran out into the field which is behind our house. But within the 5-10 seconds it took us to get out of the house the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was ready to chalk this whole thing up to a strange plane from the recent air-show until my husband pointed out the one thing that didn’t add up, we heard nothing the entire time, just the crickets.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We live near a small airport (Cumberland Municipal) and my attention was drawn to the sky by a low flying two-engine aircraft. To my surprise, there was another object in the sky unlike any that I have ever seen. It was an almost transparent upside-down bowl-shaped craft. Underneath the craft was what appeared to be a thin solid &#39;line of light&#39; discharging from the bottom of the &#39;bowl&#39;. The light had the appearance of a fluorescent light (it could have been circular but from my point of view the light was a straight line). It should be noted that this object remained stationary in the sky. I thought it might be moving away from me, but it was not. It should also be noted that there was a full or ¾ full moon that evening, but this object was well away from the moon. I thought, &#39;Am I really seeing this?&#39;. However, as I passed the tennis courts - with object still in full view - I heard a lady speaking to her husband saying, &#39;...I don&#39;t know. I guess it&#39;s an alien invasion or something.&#39; I said to her, &#39;Do you see that?&#39; She stated, &#39;Yeah, it&#39;s really weird.&#39; I agreed and kept walking (with the stationary object now over my left shoulder). As I turned back to look at the object again, it was gone. I could hardly contain myself until I reached the tennis courts again. I stopped and asked the lady, ‘Did that thing ever show itself?’ She walked over to me and very excitedly said, ‘Oh my God. That thing just vanished! It didn’t fly away it just vanished!’<n>

I would say i was about 2 miles from this event when i notices a helicopter hovering above the convoy suddenly break away which i found very odd,so i kept this in view when from no where a matalic blue object appeared. At first i thought it to be a large bunch of ballons&#39; but on refocusing my binoculars i could make out a cone shaped matalic blue object. This object was in the flight path for heathrow which flys over the city of westminster! The object appeared to come from an easterly direction heading west, the speed i could not guess correctly. As i was observing this another helicopter flew accross my building heading for the object. The objeect was below cloud leve at the time, the sky had broken cloud but other than that it was clear with some sun shine. The object then begane to rise verticle in to the cloud i managed to take a couple of pictures but they are blured due to the distane i was observing from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing this i rang the mod and left a voice mail message after following the instructions given.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The rectangle was emitting two rather short jet trails which came from the rear two corners of the rectangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a soft jet exhaust sound.  The speed was comparable to that of a commercial jet- liner...and the shape was clearly rectangular with a L/W ratio of about 6 to 8.  There were no wings visible and there was no frontal streamlining.  The shape of the bottom was truly rectangular.  Its course was south by south-west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the shape cross the open sky for about 7 seconds until it passed behind the tree tops.  In doing so there were bright glints of sunlight bouncing off part of the surface.  It looked like there were only some small surfaces or points on the structure that reflected the light...as the entire shape was not reflecting light at that time.  I then lost sight of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 5 to 7 seconds after I lost visual with the craft...there appeared a military type jet which was following the rectangular craft.  This was a B52 type craft emitting four jet trails of more usual length.  The engines were mounted out on the wings as the jet trails did not come from the rear of the fuselage as in civilian craft.  The wings and horizontal tail surfaces were clearly visible and were of the standard rear sweeping design.  The wing span of the military jet was approximately three times the width of the rectangular craft...and I would estimate that they were at the same altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the observer...I am white male, age 55, a licensed private pilot, with current medical that does not require corrective lenses.  I am a mechanical engineer by profession.  I do not take any medications, and alcohol was not an issue.  I am in great health, have never had any mental issues...nor have I ever sighted/reported anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards.<n>

The time of day would have been mid-day in June or July of 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have been hesitant to report this “sighting” as we haven’t heard of any other instances where no actual craft was seen even though the sound and feel of the presence of a craft was unmistakable.  It was either close to noon, or possibly 1:00 PM and we were doing some clearing of our property in the eastern foothills of the Hualapai Mountains, approximately 16 miles east of Kingman, AZ.  Our exact location per GPS was 35 ((deleted))N , 113 ((deleted))W at an elevation of 4,125’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To explain the “sighting” is difficult, as it started out as a noise, which we were used to hearing in that area, as military helicopters, usually in threes, occasionally fly over our property, from west to east.  Having served in the Marine Corps, I am very familiar with this sound and usually stop what I’m doing and locate the choppers in the sky.  This was totally different.  The sound was of something absolutely huge.  We could hear it approaching and stopped what we were doing to locate the “object”.  As it neared, the sound became almost deafening until it became a feeling that literally shook the ground.  I was walking all over the area searching the skies for an object.  When the sound became directly over our heads, it remained for some time, as if hovering.  Our only guess was that whatever it was, it was somehow not visible to the naked eye, or as we assumed, “cloaked”.  At this time, there was no point in moving around, as I had searched every available spot in t! he sky for an object, to no avail.  After what seemed an eternity (actual time in the vicinity of three or four minutes) it seemed to move on, slowly, as it had arrived.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To date, we have not heard of any other instances of a “sighting” with no apparent craft observation.  We’d love to hear if anyone else has had this experience, but have no idea where to start.  I’m just very glad that my wife and I shared this experience, as I have not or would not share this experience with anyone else for fear of being considered “whacko”, or prone to over imaginative.  We just had to finally share the information with somebody.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It also seemed to respond to a led light i had<n> <n><n> <n><n> myself and a friend were on our way back to my house around 2 in the morning when the car we were in got a flat tire. From the spot of the car to the sighting is around 4 miles and we were walking. We have been walking for a little over a hour or so and decided to stop for a little bit to have a cigarette and look over a bridge. After standing for a while about 5-10 minutes looking over the right side of the bridge we decided to start walking home again, when we turned to keep going I looked over the tree line to our left and there was a strange looking light, almost like a star but slightly bigger and not one solid color. As we stood and observed this object it seemed to change colors, from red to purple to blue, and so on. It seemed to be getting closer and then started moving side to side and up and down. I took a chance and grabed a white led light i have on my keychain and flashed it at the object. When i did so it seemed to move more and the lights wer! e still changing. It moved up higher to the left, back down and then went right at the speed it was moving at then like a flash dissapeared to the right. We stood in the road and decided to get out of there and as we came off the bridge i got an erie feeling and before i could say anything my friend said he saw something in the road. I thought i saw something too but it was so dark i coulden&#39;t tell. We had stopped in our tracks from the first time we decided to stop for about a half an hour now and not one car or truck had gone passed us. We couldent turn around or go any other direction so we started to run towards what we thought we saw in the road. Either we scarred it or there was nothing in the road so we continued on our way home. The next day on our way to my house in my car this time there seemed to be the same light changing object over the lake now. When we got to my house it was still visible but by the time we got outside with a camera it was gone. At the north ! end of the lake there is an airforce base, and there is a nava! l statio n on the lake. Anything that has come from the airforce base is very loud, not as fast,and could never hover or move like the object we saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the source does not indicate that fact.

I was about a mile away from the object and the first thing I noticed were bright lights in the sky. My first reaction was wondering why an aircraft would be flying so low near a city, from the distance I was at I couldn&#39;t tell the colors of the lights but I was also confused about why the lights of this aircraft were so bright, much brighter than airplane lights would be. As I got closer I could see it more clearly, I could see that there were bright lights on either end of something, at that point I wasn&#39;t close enough to tell the body of the aircraft, and the lights had a large light pink color in the middle with green, blue, purple, and yellow lights on the side that were not as large as the pinkish light, both ends had identical lights of equal size and brightness. The lights were flashing in a strange pattern that made no sense to me. The lights seemed to flashing in a nonsensical way, the lights were also very bright with very rich hues. As we were coming up to it we were looking straight on at it so I couldn&#39;t see a third light from our first vantage point, but I could see faint light coming down from the middle of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got close to it we could see that it was hovering, not exactly over the freeway but to the left of it a little bit, since I was in the driver seat I got a better look at it than the passenger did. The craft was moving very slowly and was hovering effortlessly, it didn&#39;t seem to have a destination, and it was moving slightly higher in the sky and to the left, but more so it seemed that it was just surveying things. The way it moved seemed very effortless and moved in a diagonal motion while going up. It was about 30 stories high above us and had it been flying in a city it would have ran into buildings. We drove under the object and this is when I looked up at it and saw perfectly that it was a large triangle with a dark circle underneath it and the lights on every corner of it. The color of the entire craft was grayish and the black circle stood out in contrast to it. The lights were equally large and bright with the same colors on each corner. The music in the car was off and the windows were down and we listened to see if we could hear any sound coming from it, but there was nothing, had it been a plane or a helicopter flying that low it would have been very loud, but there was no sound radiating from this. Everything about it was unlike anything I had ever seen, and the colors were strange hues that they were very hard to define. At the point when we drove under it we were leaving Bellevue and entering Kirkland and as we drove past it and away from it, it was still flying in relatively the same spot, give or take a few yards.<n>

The lights were the color of laser pointers, twinkling from time to time, but mostly solid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved very little in relation to each other, and traveled from the point they were first observed about 1/3 of the way across the clear sky.  They were moving too slowly to be jet aircraft at normal altitudes.   Although it was quiet out, there was no noise at all.   We looked at them through binoculars, but this did not bring any additional resolution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quite suddenly, the southernmost light began to fade.  I watched it disappear through the binoculars.  My 10 year old son exclaimed, &#34;Dad, look at the other one!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I brought the binoculars down, the other one, blinking now, dove almost due south at a phenomenal rate of speed and disappeared over my roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 40 years old, and have observed satellites and aircraft over the clear Nevada skies all of my life.  I’ve also seen vapor trails from military rockets fired from southern California.   But what I saw tonight was completely out of my experience.<n>

At first, there was one object that was oblong in shape with a like fiery pale halo of yellow and an oblong center toward the “front” of the object that was more orange.  It seemed very large and low.  No blinking lights appeared and it vanished off into the distance after a few minutes.  It never paused.  About ten - fifteen minutes later, two more objects that seemed smaller (and maybe higher) but with the same description appeared.  They seemed to be together but did not always remain side by side.  There were more than 15 people that saw the same event, that I am aware of.  I believe the direction of travel was somewhat North to South. There was no apparent movement other than their direction of travel.  It was very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/14/08 23:00|Elko|NV|Light|16 minutes|2  large Red stationary lights , time span of 16 minutes, above Elko, Nv  on 06/14/08 at 23:00|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63914.html|269|ndxe200806| 2  large Red stationary lights , time span of 16 minutes, above Elko, Nv  on 06/14/08 at 23:00<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is Sunday,  June 15,2008.        Last night, June 14, 2008, My Husband and I saw two red “balls of light”.        I stepped outside at approximately 11:00 P.M. and immediately noticed two red lights in the sky where there aren’t usually any.        From where we are, they appeared to be over Elko, Nevada,  to the East and South of the Airport.    We have often watched incoming airplanes at night and they appear to stay in nearly the same place for long periods although they are coming closer.    Their white lights just seem to gradually get larger.    The red lights never seemed to get larger or smaller as we watched.       When I hold my hand sideways, they were about 3 fingers high “over” the town.     Size  close to my smallest fingernail with arm outstretched.      I hollered at my husband to come see,  and we watched for awhile. We each went back inside several times to get the binoculars and to locate the scope,  and to get the camcorder and such.     ( One of us watching the lights while the other was inside).      The camcorder’s battery was completely dead.     I tried to get a photo with the cell phone , but that didn’t work either.      The lights stayed stationary for probably 16 minutes or so.     We also turned on the C.B. radio to see if any  truckers traveling on Interstate 80 were talking about them.  (nothing).     The last time that I went inside, the lights left while my husband watched.      He said that they appeared to go slowly higher and then towards the South East and out of sight.     I was only inside about a minute,  so they were not moving real slow.   I have watched airplanes leaving that stayed in sight for an hour or more.     I looked at the clock  and wrote  down the time at that point.  It was 11:16 P.M. Pacific time.            We had seen flares on the night of February 21, 2008, about 90 miles North of Elko.   The flares were orange, and there were 8 or 9 sonic booms as some fighter jets shot something out of the sky.       Something lit up brigh! tly behi nd a cloud, and it was “daylight” momentarily.    (We were driving on the highway and had pulled over to watch).      There is an airbase close by that area of Idaho, so it could have been some sort of training drill.      Our faces, particularly our eyes, were puffy, red and sore the next day. (My eyes stayed swollen for over a month).   We looked as though we had a sunburn, but without the usual outline of our sunglasses.     That same day,  Feb. 21,  early in the morning,  Wells, Nevada (50 miles East of Elko) had a 6.0 Earthquake.     The flares on the  night of Feb. 21, drifted downwards and Westerly and they sort of glowingly flickered like flares do.     The red lights on June 14 were different than those. We can’t rule out some sort of celebration for flag day (however, NOT fireworks).    Maybe two VERY large, lighted, anchored balloons?      There is also a  NOAA station here.      Do the weather balloons have large red lights and get released at night?      Would they stay stationary for so long?       We don’t know.     We have watched weather balloons being released before,  but in the daytime,  and they moved off rather quickly.         I read where you mentioned the space shuttle and International Space Station.     Maybe that’s what it was.    Well, anyway, that’s it for now.      We wanted to report it so as to validate if someone else reports the same thing.                        Thank you so much for your service, and best wishes on your Washington State Legislature Candidacy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What made this really unusual was the flash prior to seeing the bright object. We were both sitting in my house at the time and observed this through my large floor to ceiling windows.  I am really curious to know if others witnessed it as well, since it was so obvious. My house is situated near the ocean between Santa Monica and Malibu California.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We counted 12 large orange lights spaced several miles apart moving at a high rate of speed all in the exact same flight path directly south of our house moving north northwest. They made no sound and disappeared behind the clouds. It was difficult to tell how large they were but I would guess they were anywhere between a mid size aircraft and a commercial jet. They appeared to be totally illuminated and the light was pulsating. There didn’t seem to a particular pattern but they were definitely on the exact same flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just east of Batesville, Indiana we saw something in the sky. From a distance it looked like a blimp. When we got closer, we saw a round object rimmed in black. The center was transparent with lines running through it. It was hovering west of the interstate, made no sound, and was at a height of where you would see a helicopter in flight. It appeared to be about 200 yards in diameter. All traffic, including semis, were pulled off the interstate in both directions and people were out of their vehicles looking at the object. We did not stop and we did not have a camera available. Since it was still light outside, the object had no lights. We checked the newspapers and TV news the next week, but nothing was reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I did not see the object with my naked eyes, I noticed the light in a picture that I transfered on my computer from my camera.  I took around 83 pictures, and there were no other lights on any of the other pictures, they are free of glares and other objects.  The picture is a little dirty because I took it through my windshield, but with all of the other pictures I took through my windshield again I see no glares whatsoever.  The picture looks like a light warping or zooming through space right above Bell Rock.  Bell Rock was also known as a vortex area, but I did not anticipate seeing anything on my pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had just gone outside for a walk (sometimes I do this but never ever had I seen something like this before). We live in a town house complex. I saw a disk shaped object black in color with 3 sets of lights, two on top, two on the bottom and two on the back or side. Lights were yellow and red and they were flickering. It was surprisingly very close to me and so it appeared to be humongous. It looked like it wanted to land and the entire object looked like it was coming down at an angle of approximately 45 degrees and it then would change its angle of dip until it was horizontal(in a very hi-tech manner). It then would wiz I.e. move fast and makes abrupt stops. I thought it was going to land somewhere near by and I continued to pursue it. I was very scared. I did see a few cars on the road. But I have no idea if they spotted the same thing. I also must mention that I saw an airplane above it and it was quite far away in the sky as opposed to this object I saw. I can say that this UFO I saw was approximately the length of maybe 3-4 airplanes (nose to tail) and maybe the height of 1(i.e. distance from nose to tail again).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At approximately 11:10 PM Pacific Daylight Time, I saw a sub-orbital object traveling in a south to north trajectory. I first saw the object as it came into my peripheral vision as I was looking at the moon which was quite bright. The object passed to what was the east of the moon from my point of view and traveled towards a bright star just to the north of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled towards a smaller, less brilliant star located just west of, and below the brighter star and continued on this course for a distance that put it in line with another dim star whereupon it began to accelerate very rapidly. It continued to accelerate, and passed between the inner star of the handle of the big dipper, and the bottom star that forms’ the corner star of the bottom of the cup of the big dipper. As it passed through the intersection of the stars in the big dipper it accelerated fast enough that I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was of a consistent size, speed and course trajectory before it accelerated and I lost sight of it. From the time I first saw it to the time I lost sight of it was approximately 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This witness is well known to NUFORC.  He has over four decades experience in aviation, and considerable experience in the military.  A highly qualified witness, in our opinion.  PD))<n>

We immediately saw a bright object in the northern sky. We watched the object for a little bit and my wife ran back to the house to get our binoculars. When she returned I looked at the object with the binoculars and clearly saw an oval shaped craft with 4 lights that were horizontal. The bright lights shadowed the craft so it was easy to see. The craft just hovered for about 10 minutes. Then the craft started backing away slowly and just disappeared.  My wife also saw the same because we were passing the binoculars back and forth. The is the second time that we saw something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Could have been the same object, but I never saw them both at the same time out of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So after about ten minutes of watching this I see a plane flying slowly from the east in the objects direction, as I’m watching that one another plane comes in really fast from the north I would imagine to intercept the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I look back to see the object it was gone just as the fast moving plane goes into the side of the storm cloud.   The lightning was really bright but it was further to the south of me, I didn’t see any lightning bolt just the flashes through the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think the edge of the storm is where I was and the object was going in and out through the side of the storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So that’s my account just thought id let you know.<n>

I kept watching it and it just hovered there for a long time, kind of changing shapes although it was so high it was really hard to tell.  It looked like it split into two and one moved over to the right of it and then went back and rejoined the first.  I got my camera and took photos, which I will email to you.  Please look at them and tell me what you think.  If you zoom in on the object you can tell it is clearly not a star, and it wasn&#39;t moving so it wasn&#39;t a plane or helicopter or balloon.  On the fourth picture I took you can see the object separating on the bottom.   After 15 minutes or so, hard to tell, I was so entranced, it just faded away and I could no longer see  anything in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The cameraman at the time didnt notice anything unusual but when it came to editing I noticed a blip that spoiled a rather nice zoom out from the horizon to the shore.  This blip appeared in just one frame, but when i slowed it down I realised that whatever it was, was moving so fast you could barely see it.  In slow motion you can see it progress (or possibly skip) across the horizon in three stages.

6/13/08 09:30|Rachel|NV|Unknown|30 minutes|UFO spotted over Area 51, apparent communication with base.|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63942.html|298|ndxe200806| UFO spotted over Area 51, apparent communication with base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of Friday June 13th, 2008 my wife, sister and I witnessed a UFO while driving east on Highway 375 (otherwise known as the Extraterrestrial Highway). Approximately 9:30 PM, after passing Groom Lake Road, my sister saw an object in the sky, south of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over the side of the highway and quickly exited the car. 20-25 miles south of us, over some mountains, we saw an unknown craft fluttering around with the dexterity of a moth. This craft was at least the size of a two-story house (maybe larger, it is hard to judge size in the desert), and had two strobing lights, one green, one red. It was not a jet, airplane, or helicopter, as it fluttered around the sky like a butterfly. It would alternate directions immediately, dropping and rising 50 feet instantaneously. We observed the UFO for about 2 minutes before it sank below the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three possibilities immediately entered my mind regarding the UFO: 1. It was an alien spacecraft piloted by aliens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. It was an alien spacecraft piloted by military personnel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. It was an experimental aircraft reverse engineered utilizing alien technology piloted by military personnel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five minutes later, the UFO appeared again. It hovered in the air, as if the pilots were skittish--somewhat afraid to be where they were. This sighting was even more exciting as we all were able to fully observe the UFO, its rapid movements making it impossible that this was a man-made craft. After another two minutes, the UFO sank below the mountains. Adrenaline pumping, we surveyed our surroundings, spotting stationary headlights behind us on the highway, about a mile or two away. This light did not move. After five minutes, we became nervous and decided to investigate. We drove back and saw a white SUV with government plates speed off. Relieved to not find Leatherface or any other deranged cannibal hillbillies in rusty pickup trucks, we decided to drive back to our observation point (approximately 26 miles southeast of the Lil Ale Inn).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5-10 minutes passed without any sign of the UFO. It was starting to get late, as I live 2 ½ hours away in Las Vegas, so I was ready to leave when the UFO hovered in the air once again. This time we all noticed an incredible sight: the mountain range to our left was being illuminated on the other side by a powerful light source intermittently, as if the Area 51 base was trying to communicate with the UFO with a sophisticated visual version of Morse code. The mountains were silhouetted in light. We were all silent, awestruck at the possibilities. This new sighting made me realize what was happening:  The Area 51 base was attempting to communicate with an alien spacecraft utilizing light signals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why else would they utilize an enormous light source in such a manner? Every time the craft came into view, the light source would illuminate the mountains in an intermittent fashion. When the craft lowered, the light source would stop. It almost seemed as if the lights somehow reassured the UFO to not fly away. We could not tell if the UFO ever landed or not, as the mountain range blocked our view of the ground and Area 51.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed another 15 minutes, observing the UFO twice more. The lights from the base strobed even more powerful as the UFO fluttered around. It was obvious that we were observing something important, beyond our understanding. Was this the first time that this communication has taken place, or has this been going on years or decades and they are trying to refine their methods of communication? So many questions swirled around my mind, though the overwhelming feeling was one of awe and excitement. There is not a doubt in my mind that I witnessed an alien spacecraft. I plan on going back and camping out on a mountain overlooking the restricted zone boundary, and packing a video camera, telescope, and binoculars!  Overall, we observed the UFO for over a half hour, 5 sightings in all, about 2 minutes at a time. I was not drunk or high, nor was my wife or sister. I have completed 190 credits hours in college courses, my wife has a Master’s degree, and my sister attends George Washington University.  We are all in agreement that we have witnessed a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I saw a bright flash of light and looked up to see a dull silvery metallic object in the sky about 10-15 miles away between 40-70 feet across in width and 10 -20 feet in height. I would place the object somewhere over the Blue Hills reservation. The object first caught my attention when I saw a flash of light in the sky. I then pointed it out to my sister who confirmed that something was there, she was driving so she didn&#39;t stay focused on it. I am more than familiar with commercial, military, and recreational vehicles. It was not a blimp, it was not anything that I have ever seen before. I looked at the object in the sky for approximately 6-8 seconds before it flashed again only brighter and longer it seemed. The glare coming from it didn&#39;t shine directly off the metallic surface of the craft, rather it appeared around the craft in an aura. The aura lasted 2-3 seconds, the craft then sat there hovering motionless for another 6-8 seconds, before it looked like another very short burst of light before the craft began to just fade from sight. It was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen the way the object just disappeared, as if it had a cloaking device that was turned on to make it slowly fade from sight in pieces. It was like someone was spraypainting the sky behind it onto what you were seeing. It disappeared in sections, bit by bit. And it was gone forever! I stared at the spot where it was until we got to the 93 merger and went all the way past Blue Hills but I saw no trace of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It stayed stationary for about five minutes, while my girlfriend and I observed it.  It didn&#39;t look like a star or a plane after about five minutes.  It then too the shape of a very long cigar shaped object.  I thought it might be a test missile or a test airplane because the surrounding area of Las Vegas has a lot of Testing Facilities; however, this now cigar looking object did not look like a jet stream or a plane or anything of that sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The tips of the cigar shape were very bright and the oject continued to remain stationary as it transformed from a large star looking object into a cigar shape;<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five minutes later it vanished, which led me to posting this report.  It seemed very clear that this was, certainly, an unidentified flying object and I hope people will find this interesting<n>

There was no  lights or a strobe that would associate it with being an airplane and the way it was moving, very erradic, slow then fast, up , down, this was just not the way any aircraft that I am aware of can or would fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brightness of these flashing lights would be comparable to what would be seen from arc welding at a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this for about 2 minutes and then it disappeared.  We were facing northwest which would have put whatever it was above the Hanford Nuclear Reservation or very close to it.

I reported that, too.  Anyways, I was watching the Tonight Show and across the lake from me there is a  marshy area and then a ranch-ish looking property w/ lots of acreage.  I saw  a blinking light in the sky first which looked like what I&#39;d seen the  previous night.  That light was way in the sky but it was across the  lake SE from me and then, and I couldn&#39;t see it very well, but I  definitely saw a low, closer hovering light fairly dim in the trees more to the  left next to the property and then what I thought might be people out  on the property with flashlights - there were lights as if from a  flashlight or helicopter surveying the ground and I couldn&#39;t tell what I saw  it wasn&#39;t very clear but it was a streak of some low to the ground  animal back and forth.  I thought maybe it was a dog at first, but it was  way too fast - maybe a mountain lion?  It caught my attention, but I  wasn&#39;t startled until the light in the trees dimmed and then flew across  several properties and was changing  color to red like a laser pointer  or something.  But then it would light up again in dim white and it  just floated around from place to place.  I got kind of nervous when a red  light got in front of my house, I woke my husband who was on the sofa  and he also saw the red light.  It didn&#39;t move, it just stayed still  from what I saw, but he&#39;d talked me into watching TV instead of freaking  myself out and later he said he&#39;d seen it move.  We went to bed after  him dismissing me and telling me it&#39;s some kid w/ a laser pointer.  I  read for a bit to calm my mind and when I turned the light off to go to  sleep - through the blinds in a room completely on the other side of the  house facing West there was a very, very bright light that was  hovering in the wooded area outside our house.  I woke my husband up again and  he agreed he could see it and although he&#39;ll never admit it could be  anything other than something explainable I could tell he got a little  spooked.  He kept whispering loud - &#34;ok, so what do you want me to do? I  see it, I see it&#34;.  The light would change from VERY bright white to  dimmer so you could barely see it and then brighten up again and as it  would brighten a bunch of tiny little colored lights would blink so fast - red blue green.   I saw this light at around 12:45 and it lasted a little over an hour.  It moved very slowly all around and lowered into  the trees and I heard noises like low whistles best way I can describe  it was a soft high pitched noise between flute and a whistle.  I had  trouble sleeping but nothing else happened after the thing left.  I didn&#39;t  move to another window - when it was out of my eyeshot, I just let it  go.  It was so bright the lights from it were coming in our window and  it was like a headlights that were moving around the room depending on  where this thing was positioned and how dim or bright it got. - This is a copy of my report to MUFON on 6/13/08.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??

Being far away from any major city, there are no nearby lights to brighten the sky, so I can usually see numerous aircraft pass above, mainly jets.  On this particular night, we had been sitting outside approximately 30 minutes, when we saw a light passing from south to north at a speed that I estimate 20 to 25 times faster than the airliners flying overhead.  I said to my wife and children that obviously this was a satellite because there were no jets that I knew of that could fly at this rate of speed.  Also, we heard no sound and didn’t see any navigation lights. Anyway,  as I was telling my family what I thought this light was, it came to a complete stop right above our heads for a split second, then  made a right angle turn to the east at a speed as great  or greater than we observed  before it stopped.  Then we observed the unidentified object disappear into the eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object we saw was a white light, not particularly bright or large. However, the rate of speed this object was traveling is what caught my attention initially.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a Georgia state trooper for over twenty years, and my last seven years on the patrol, I flew helicopters and airplanes.  I retired because of a physical disability with full benefits.

And I was in a hurry to get into my house because there was lightning just north of me in the next county.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But when I got out of my car.  I caught this glow from the corner of my eye. I turned south toward the glow. It’s color was unusual, like if it were white, red, yellow, and soft and bright all at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came closer, very eerily. At an unusual pace. I heard no sound coming from this aircraft.  Just gliding almost felt like it was rising and moving towards me at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And once it got right above my head, the glow disappeared, and all you saw were about 6 or 7 lights moving in a horizontal diamond shape.  I felt paralyzed with fear but pushed myself to get closer to my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The colors of the lights were different and I couldn’t tell what they were, just colors.  And it quietly moved pass with no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after it passed.  From the east a commercial plane passed quickly.  I could here the sound from its engine just fine.<n>

This thing walked up to the window I cracked for fresh air – chanted my name.  My hair stood up and I froze. I went to look but it dissapered. I had the feeling this being left I went out side , and over the bay I saw a flash of light, very big one- 5 minutes later a tiny plane went to where the light was and immediately turned around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The very next weekend it happened again. But this time I went to look it jumped on the roof , sounded like a squirel on steroids running across the roof. I froze up once again.  Then outside the glass sliding doors I saw a black being  approximately 3 feet tall being , which looked like the text book alien dolls but black and 3 feet tall. And it had white dots on its chest , seemed like it was a star constellation of some sort on its suit. Very nerve racking! I jumped and told my grandpop – who takes me fishin. Someone’s trying to break in the  house. He looked , I told him what I saw and heard. He said possums make that breathing sound, See the being talked like it was breathing talking.- All it said was Nick. Well the flash of light happened again, the little plane showed up to the light and turned around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next this thing followed me home, this is maple shade nj. This is where it really gets weird, I saw a odd sized and shaped ship over the trees,no sound couple of lights –all happens between 4-5am.  A fighter jet swooped the trees chasing one, I have been touched.  Still till this day it happens. There is a whole lot to talk about. It has been 4 years now. Every damn night something happens to me. These beings come up to my window, say my name. There is alot of things happening to me I am not comfortable talking about, but it’s is comforting for me to tell someone that may understand what I am going through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly not a serious report???

Up in the sky, very far away, was this twinkling light. It wasn&#39;t like a star, though. It flashed red and blue on the sides, and actually moved around slowly in the sky. After we started watching it move, we noticed another flying stationary across the other side of the sky. This second light was closer and you could see the colors more clearly. They weren&#39;t planes, because they moved whenever they felt like it at whatever speed they wanted. We actually got in the car and chased after the stationary flashing light, but we couldn&#39;t get any closer. It was very high and very far. It moved as we chased it though, so as far as I know it could have had a constant slow movement and I just couldn&#39;t tell because of the distance. But they did for sure move. They just now got so far that we can&#39;t see them anymore, so I came in here and typed this. It was CrAzY.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I usually see nothing in the sky  because we have a number of trees in the yard.  But tonight I couldn&#39;t  help but notice this bright star looking light.  It caught my attention  because I had never noticed it before.  I got up and went to the window  and looked closer and could swear it was getting bigger as if it were  coming my direction and it was pulsating.  I went outside for a better  look, but the trees were blocking my view.  I decided to just go back to  my show and take a gander every once in a while to see if I could tell  for sure it was moving.  I could.  So, to be sure my eyes were not  playing tricks on me, I laid my head against the back of the sofa in a  crack and placed one hand over one eye and used a point of reference  (shingles).  My eyes were not playing tricks on me, after a while that was  very apparent.  It is still out there but now it has moved up down and  left shining through 3 separate windows and once I knew for sure it was  not my eyes playing tricks I haven&#39;t moved until I got up to report  this.  I noticed it at 11:40 am and got up to report this at 12:45 am. - This was my initial report to MUFON, I ended up watching this until almost 3am.  As I watched closer I realized there were smaller dimmer lights - they seemed to be in tandem with the light flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My brother, who was a passenger in the car, was telling me a story as we turned off into my housing development. I reached a smooth bend in the road and happened to look up and saw lights behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Knowing that there is an airport nearby, I thought to myself ‘that plane is flying really low’. Continuing through the turn I kept my eyes on the lights slightly hidden behind the trees for about 6 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reaching the end of the turn I could see the lights a little bit clearer as there were fewer trees and noticed that the object appeared to be hovering but was clearly some kind of organized pattern of lights. I focused on them for about another 4-6 seconds trying to determine what it was because sometimes planes appear to be still even thought they are moving. I thought this was strange because it was really low and somewhat resembled a large TV antenna with lights on it. However, I take this route every day and have never noticed this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We finally reached the point where there are no trees and the object was in clear sight. Knowing that I have never seen anything like this before I abruptly shouted to my brother, ‘what the heck is that’? He looked up and was apparently as confused as I was. I got about 4-5 seconds of clear visual while my brother states he only got a glimpse but he too got a clear enough sight to confirm what I was seeing. We were both intrigued by how low and stagnant the object appeared to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 yards down the road was a side street with a cul-de-sac where I quickly went to get a better view. This only took 10 seconds or so to get turned around to get a better a look. However, by the time we pulled down the street the object was completely gone. We could not believe this. Judging by where the object was there is no way it could have completely disappeared. Even if it was a plane we should have had clear visual of it at the cul-de-sac.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object itself was clearly a cross shape. I saw a long series of lights, maybe 5-6, down the middle with two at the tips of the cross ends. They looked to be blue and white with a clearly larger blue light at the intersection. My brother only stated how strange it was that there were so many lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for me, the entire sighting was only for about 15 seconds with an unfortunate 4-5 seconds of clear visual. I am still trying to think of what it could be like a toy plane, an antenna, a plane, fireworks.  None of these seem to make sense.  I did have my window down and did not hear any noises like a gas powered engine or boom. Anyhow, it is really exciting because I have no clue what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I myself am an architect. I have two professional degrees, a master’s degree and work at an architecture firm. I have always had a fascination with the paranormal and U.F.O.s and, honestly, have always wanted to see one. Much of my education focused around forensic architecture and engineering so I find the whole debunking side of paranormal investigations interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother is a teacher at a Catholic school.  He has three degrees and master’s in philosophy.<n>

I looked out of the window, near the center of Houston, TX, looking to the east, and saw a light that looked somewhat like a blinking star. As I looked, it seemed to have different colors as it blinked. I also noticed that it didn&#39;t look hazy as if it were blinking from clouds passing by. My brother and my girlfriend came out, saw the same thing, but we all thought it could possibly be an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 min or so, the light was still in the same place in the sky, not seeming to get closer or further away. It looked extremely far away (remember, I compared it to a star at first, so I&#39;d say it was some miles away). We got some very cheap binoculars and looked at it again. At that point, all 4 of us that were there all saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was moving around very fast, not seeming to be traveling anywhere, but just dancing around all different patterns in the same vicinity. The light was also not just red and green, but all different colors, constantly changing. I noticed that while I was watching, 2 planes flew by, about 3 min apart from each other, but they didn&#39;t go anywhere near the object or even in its direction. It was still there when my girlfriend and I left, which was a few minutes after 11pm. I wish I could see that direction from my apartment, but I can&#39;t because of the buildings.<n>

Air craft contrails moderate to short with definite gaps in trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Narrative: I was sitting on a lounge chair located in the patio shade attempting to read a novel as I played with my granddaughter and a neighbor’s child.  They were interested in how the chair could change positions as I relaxed so they were tilting me to and fro.  My grandson was off exploring around the corner of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed a contrail passing from North to South as an aircraft flew along the usual flight path to the west of Washington.  This contrail was short to moderate in length as it evaporated into the dry upper-level air.  The next aircraft observed along that path did not pass until after 1700 hours.  Length of contrails depends upon humidity level of the surrounding air and there were definite long gaps in these contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked at the contrail and the aircraft started to disappear behind a nearby tree, my attention was drawn to a bright light very slightly above the contrail.  I assumed this light to be caused by the sun reflecting from another aircraft.  As I looked at the light source, its position in the sky relative to the contrail did not change.  Thus it could not have been caused by reflection from another aircraft. Nor could it have been caused by reflection from a satellite.  Both sources would have moved relative to the contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly the apparent position relative to the still existing contrail changed from above to below the contrail.  Time for this change from the initial was estimated in the neighborhood of 30 to 60 seconds.  I noted that the light was now an object that appeared to be similar to a high flying balloon such as those used for upper air studies.  So my next guess at the cause of the bright light that I first noticed was a reflection from the instrument package.  Thus I arose from my lounge chair to call my grandchildren so that I could show them the balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object now appeared against the blue sky background as a white/blue-gray annulus with a darker blue-gray center. It was much larger than the original light source.  Relative size can be compared to that of a pea (3-5 mm) held at arms’ length.  From my viewing angle I assumed that it was a round object with a flat bottom since it appeared elliptical.  Color and shading was consistent with light shining through, not reflecting from, a high flying polyethylene balloon.  Brightness was similar to that of the moon which was in the eastern sky on that day.  The moon in the southern sky was hidden from my view by the roof of the home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to view the object as it moved quite quickly for a short (relative) distance and stopped.  Upon this movement, I started to think that perhaps the object was much closer to me and that it could be some type of air borne seed (such as cottonwood) or debris moved about by low level winds swirling around the house.  Second thoughts occurred as I changed my position relative to nearby houses and trees.  This object had moved too fast for wind born insects, seeds or debris.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to observe the object, it very suddenly accelerated and sped off eastward passing across my field of view from west to east behind the nearby rooftop in well under one second.  Total subtended angle of movement before moving out of my sight was in the 20 degree range.  No contrail or other evidence of its passing remained except the image in my minds eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Altitude of this object cannot be estimated from this single observation since the size of this object is unknown.  Estimated angle above the horizon at first sighting is around 40 degrees.  The apparent standing still with respect to the contrail can be explained by the initial movement of the object directly toward me.  The object would have moved closer to me and toward the north as it descended below my reference contrail and become a recognizable shape.  From my viewing angle, the object was probably circular giving it somewhat of an elliptical &#34;cigar&#34; shape popularized by other UFO reports.  It moved too fast across my field of view to describe it better.  Total viewing time was 1.5 to 3 minutes.   This is estimated from my first sighting to my subsequent moving about to locate my grandchildren.  I certainly did not look at my watch during this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer Background: Meteorology (retired)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness appears to us to be an exceedingly qualified observer.

The saucer shape object appeared in the sky near a cloud and was still.  It was pretty high and I would estimate it was at least the size of a commercial plane.  The object was the brightest metal I ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed motionless for about five seconds and simply vanished, as if it popped into the atmosphere and then popped out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called a local radio station and they told me that several other people did claim to have witnessed  this.<n>

It wasn’t, It was the size and brightness of a star, but moved erratically. It appeared to be writing in the sky.  It had a faint aura, and seemed to turn blue with a red light that looked to be rotating from time to time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed this for about 15 min.  At that time I saw what looked to be 5 smaller lights.  Blue in color, but very small compared to the main light.  The smaller lights looked to be discharged from the main light, 3 from the left side, 2 from the right.  I had my children come and witness this, we continued to watch it for another 15-20 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 3:30 I went back outside and at this time there where more.  All the same size, 2 in the east and 3 in the southeast.  All making the same movements of the above mentioned.   I’m not sure how to describe this movement except to say, it looked like it was making a symbol or writing, it reminded me of a bee going from flower to flower.<n>

I know it wasn&#39;t an aircraft because it was moving too fast and there were no blinking lights. I could tell this object was out in space because it was difficult to see.

I could hear people screaming and then it went very bright and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day three military helicopters were flying above mingus mountain in formation.  I have been witnessing an increase in these crafts over the years since I have moved to this area back in 2005.  It&#39;s getting a bit annoying to be honest.

What caught my attention was a bright light up and southward, I said “wow that sure is a big bright star” after looking at it about 2-3 seconds it started moving south for about 3-4 seconds then it stopped for 1-2 seconds then started moving again for about 2-3 seconds then stopped again for 1-2 seconds,  at that time I was right outside the door so I rushed in to grab my binoculars, because that was just weird, which took about 3 seconds, when I came back out and looked at it was still moving south for about 4-5 seconds then got dim real quick and disappeared.  I’m not sure what it was; while looking through my weak binoculars I couldn’t really make anything out, I couldn’t get them to focus in time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6-11-08 As usual I was out on the back porch smoking, not sure probably around 9 or 10pm, and of course I looked up at the sky and I can usually see satellites often, well I spotted one heading north as I watched it for about 8 seconds, it got real bright for about 4-5 seconds still moving then got dim quickly as I followed it with my eyes until I couldn’t see it anymore lasting about 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6-12-08 Weird enough, it was about 10:30-11pm at the time, and I was talking to my mom over the phone out on the back porch; as I was talking to her I was looking up at the sky, and saw a satellite directly overhead heading north so I followed it with my eyes for about 8 seconds while still talking on the phone and I started laughing at mom and looked down from the sky about 3 seconds then looked back up again and saw the same satellite going the opposite way southward, I am just freaked out a little from the past 3 days of weird stuff in the sky, I don’t know if this means anything , but I’ve been trying to see online if anyone has seen any of these for the past 3 days and so far I have nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This object did not display ANY sort of a tell-tale sign of any know aircraft to our American skies (i.e. no blinking lights, no red or green lights, nothing). The object was not moving very quickly, but at a steady pace across the night sky  I quickly ran inside to get my wife to witness this event. She in turn came out to the yard and also observed the light as I have described. The object took about a minute to cross the sky above us, so it was not even moving as fast as the planes that do cross our skies daily. As we both watched, hoping that this object would display SOMETHING to let us know that it was man made, we observed the object become a bit brighter in the sky, and then with the blink of an eye, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both turned and looked at each other in disbelief, and both of us said almost simultaneously, “It made no sound.” As we were watching the object go across the sky, I even made a small comment out loud: “I don’t hear any engines. If it’s a plane, we should be able to hear the sound of the engines.” There was NO SOUND.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was a bit shocked and perplexed, as she has not had any “encounters” that she has ever told me of. For me, this was one of many “sightings” that I have witnessed above the Houston skies. Nothing that truly warranted a report…until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft was moving really slow, it was a whitish haze color(Probably haze cause of the visibility), long cigar shape, huge!!! Probably a quarter of a mile away, thats how big this cigar shape ufo was. I kept looking at the ufo losing it on some of the trees that were in the way and these trees were not big at all it took probably 15 secs. to find it on the other side of each tree I lost it in, after about 3 trees the object disappered!! I was like &#34;What the hell!?!?!?&#34; but I did see some flashing of quick lights after in the other side of the tree. There is a airport right next to this Wal-Mart but I really think it wasn&#39;t an airplane. It was a cigar shape object! This is my 6th time in my life I seen a ufo, I seen a V-shaped, a disk, and a couple triangle shaped ufos, its so weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went to the open garage which faces east. and started searching the sky for what I thought was a jet plane.  after maybe about 30 seconds, I saw 2 objects in the sky heading east over the south end of the city.  still no sound.  the 2 objects were like football shape and I could see they were metallic, and looked to have scorching on them.  as I watched in disbelief, the forward of the 2, without stopping forward motion, dropped below and came up behind the one it was leading.   then after a couple of seconds the rear one went over the top and came back directly in front again.  completing a perfect circle.  and they both continued east, again no sound.  now I understand why some witnesses wait so long before going public.  I am along time coast listener, going back to the art bell days.  I always look forward to your reports<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter, keep up the good work.  people need to know, that we are being visited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

Two objects in first sighting, three in the second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred on June 10th, 2008 from 09:57-10:01am  I was on my way home from college at Salt Lake Community College, and I was looking up in the sky at the incoming northbound air traffic to the Salt Lake International airport, when I noticed two silver circular objects spaced about an inch apart from each other from my point of view. They were over a building to my left, and they moved in and out closer to each other then farther apart so I at first just thought they were escaped helium balloons. But every time they moved apart, they never split apart past the distance I first viewed them at. An airplane came into view beneath the objects from the left, and I realized they were very high up in the sky and had to be very big, and couldn&#39;t be balloons. When I looked back after glancing at the airplane they had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This puzzled me, because if they really were balloons they would have gotten smaller or drifted to a location near where I first saw them. I was walking for the most part of watching the objects; 30 seconds later two incoming airplanes are headed to the airport at the same time, about two inches apart from my point of view, as I watched them go left to right, I saw the objects again, this time over a field to my right, but there were three objects this time. They were still in one spot not moving across the sky, but they were in a triangular formation, and they rotated in place as though they were on a wheel. The three silver objects were again the same distance away from each other as they rotated, like a perfect triangle, before coming in together and they got into a formation where they looked like they were stacked one on top of the other with no space in between; like toy blocks stacked on top of each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suddenly got the chills while I watched them, they started to move apart again, I decided I had to call someone when I reached for my cell phone, however, I must have moved my eye sight a bight because all of a sudden they were gone, completely vanished. I scanned the sky all over in case they appeared again but they never did. Weather conditions were completely clear, the sky was completely blue, and had no clouds in it at the time of the sightings. The only objects in the sky were the airplanes which were much bigger and closer than the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each sighting lasted about one minute, and the time between the two sightings was about 30 seconds to one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was clear sky&#39;s and visibility was probably 20 miles. It was moving about as fast as a jet would in the sky, but the fact that it had no blinking lights and was just one bright object moving across the sky made me think more that it was a Ufo. I know it wasn&#39;t a comet, shooting star, or a meteor because the object was to big to be a shooting star, and was going way to slow. It couldn&#39;t be a comet because it would have had a trail of debree. Definetly no meteor just by observation. It was about the size of a quarter if you held it in your hand. So I assume this object was in outer space. The object&#39;s direction was from northwest to south east. I lost track of it because it went out of my viewing range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

My rushed to wake his dad up, by the time he made it outside it was half-way to looking like a star over the horizon, however he stared in awe, stating that it was the 3rd he had seen.

I shall be sure to photograph if there is a next time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible blimp??  PD))<n>

Sorry I don’t have the exact time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend witnessed it with me.  It was going across the sky NE to SW; a torpedo shape; white/silver and red, although the red may have been from the setting sun.  It was travelling at a similar speed to an aircraft, but definitely had no wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I regularly observe aircraft, hang gliders, hot air balloons etc  in the area and it was nothing like anything I have seen before.  There was no noise either which was strange. The sky was clear and cloudfree.  There was no trail.<n>

The spherical object was clearly visible and if estimating the size based on distance would have appeared to be the size of a quarter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object began to move slowly south, doubled in size, and a golden constant glow began to intensify around the object. The object did not have flashing lights like other aircraft.  At first the object’s movement can be characterized as a slow pendulum swinging from side to side.  The circumference of golden light appeared to increase and decrease much like a pupil of one’s eye. Finally from a static position the object began to quickly move due east into the distance retracting immediately into a small pin point of bright light and then disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event lasted for approximately two minutes. Note: The weather was clear with good visibility; thunderstorms were developing with lighting present 30 miles southeast of the sighting location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, except for e-address.

6/9/08 20:00|Tucson|AZ|Fireball|>10 min|Burning Embers Sighted in Sky Near Tucson|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63990.html|352|ndxe200806| Burning Embers Sighted in Sky Near Tucson<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on my front porch facing South on Monday June 9, around 8:00PM, gazing out to the West at the remnants of the sunset against the Tucson mountains. An orange light in the sky appeared against the red-orange-green of the fading daylight. The light was relatively stationary over the West part of the city (about 20 miles away from me) at about 3,000 ft in the air. And so I assumed that it was an airliner on it&#39;s landing approach to Tucson International. A few things about the light, however, caught my interest. It appeared to be too orange to be an aircraft landing light and it seemed to be positioned too far to the North of TIA&#39;s runways 11L/11R to be on the final approach leg to one of those runways (the lines of descending lights on Tucson&#39;s Western horizon at night are airliners landing on these runways).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 2 minutes a smaller orange light broke away from the original light and after a few seconds the two lights casually faded out . The manner in which this happened made me think of a small plane on fire and a part breaking away from it before falling out of the sky, yet I heard no explosions or saw no burning embers fall to earth. Still, the novelty of this event inspired me to wait around a while to see if I could hear any police sirens or breaking news reports about a small plane crash over Tucson. As I was doing this I kept my eyes on the Western sky to see if anything else appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15-20 minutes I became bored and went into the house to get something. About 5 minutes later I returned to the porch and resumed my scanning of the Western sky. The sky was now a bluish-green horizon turning to the blackness of night as I spied another similar orange light to the South of the original one, this one farther away and appearing to be at a much higher altitude . This light only appeared for half a second before falling fast like a tear drop and disappearing. I stayed outside for about 30 minutes after that and did not see any other similar events. When I finally went inside, it was night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder if anyone else in the city saw this?  A few things to think about: Davis-Monthan Air Force Base is situated in between my house and the airport. I am a former pilot and have never seen this type of thing before. It could have been a flare drop at the Barry-Goldwater range in the desert to the West of the city, yet it seemed too close for this; it appeared to be in front of the Tucson mountains from my frame of reference. It could have been space phenomena, i.e. meteorite activity, yet all of the meteroite entries into the atmosphere I have seen have been very fast an angular.<n>

I kept looking the sound went away and I saw a cigar shaped aircraft with NO WINGS fly from  Northeast direction toward the Southeast.  The craft was very high but I could clearly see separation between the front half and a dark band and it looked as if the back half was separate but attached sort of like two short cigar shapes made of what I would think of a dull aluminum.  There was a large dark band at the rear of the first part.  It was really high and I could see it clearly.  No wings and it was going what I would think of as slow and I kept the object in my view  thinking I could get my cell phone and have enough time to get a picture.  I looked down and looked up it was gone it should have been in my view at least 30 seconds more the way it was moving.  If it was a plane it wouldn&#39;t have been gone that fast.  It just didn&#39;t seem to move across the sky that fast it was a clear sky.  I put my head down and looked back up in a spit second and it was gone.  The change in speed was not something a regular plane could have accomplished.   Which brings me back to it had no wings! This is the second time I have seen something in the sky from my back yard.  I saw a sphere a few years ago around this time of year.  Crazy isn&#39;t it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am just a regular person that believes in God and as God is my witness I saw what doesn&#39;t seem to be anything I have ever seen on TV before.  I really don&#39;t like star wars type of stuff so I don&#39;t know if it is something that the movies has copied.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got my two brothers to look and they saw it to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all amazed at what we were seeing. I was so excited,that I went to a neighbor&#39;s house to get  someone I knew to come see it. She lived about 15 yards right beside of where our clubhouse was at. My brother said that the object stopped when I was knocking on her door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When she walked outside my next to oldet brother said it shot off so fast that he only caught a glimpse of it. My neighbor was saying &#34;where at, where at!&#34; I told her that she just missed it. I didn&#39;t see the object stop when I knocked on the door, because I was to focused on trying to get my neighbor to come see it. Although I did see the object move so fast that I barely seen a glimpse of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To end with, I don&#39;t know what we saw that night, but the fact that my brother said it stopped made it seem to be a Ufo much more. But believing my brother I don&#39;t know so I wished I would have stayed and saw it too. I think this was a Ufo though.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He said he noticed it about half a month ago, in the same spot in the sky.  He also said several people in the city have been talking about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking toward the sky, I saw a faint star that became brighter until it was a very bright white light above the horizon, but not as high to be a plane. The size seemed to increase, but that may only be because the brightest increased.  The the light disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within the half hour, the light continued to appear and disappear several times. On its reappearance, it was accompanied by a red light that appeared to be revolving around the white light. And there also appeared to be a purple-ish light. It was like stobe lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we went outside again for break, two hour later, the lights could be seen again, white bright and reddish and purple, appearing and disappearing.  The location of the lights moved slightly more north in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later this date at 23:30 est, I checked the sky and saw only the bright white light.  It appeared in the same location of the sky, west/north.  This time it was only the bright white light, faint at first sight, and increasing in brightness, and then disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife her friend and I were in the back yard.  We were just sitting around and looking at the sky.  I noticed first what looked like two stars that stayed equally apart in the south western part of the sky.  It looked as if two stars simply had been sitting in the sky and suddenly drifted toward the north.  Both stars stayed the exact same length from each other even when they turned in the drift toward the north.  The &#34;stars&#34; seemed to dim a little as they drifted.  I know for a fact it was not an airplane.  It was too far up and it would have been huge.  It was as if a baton was floating in space.  A big baton with no center just the two bright ends.   *       *(1)  * *(2)   *(3)    *<n>

This was approx. 21:30, and there was no sunshine in my eye&#39;s for the building my friend lives in was blocking it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself how unusual and how beautiful they were, when all of a sudden, an object came in from the S.W. at an incredible speed, the total sighting lasted only a few sec&#39;s, approx. 3-5 secs. and it disappeard from sight, but the profile of it is fresh in my mind.I mentioned to my friend when he answered the door, but he wasn&#39;t at my vantage point and was inside the building when this took place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have called a local news station here and inquired about possible reports from other community sightings, but there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have a thing called &#34;Sky Cam&#34; capabilities in my town so I asked if they were 24/7 activation, or if they are manually turned on and off, they informed me it was the latter to operate them, was hoping they were always running, they might of caught the object on tape/harddrive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I called the local airport and talked to the control tower, they had seen nothing on radar/Doppler from the night in question and that is when they directed me to you for reporting a possible UFO sighting, which is exactly what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a brilliant glowing orangish/yellowish color, it had what seemed to be a golden hue all around it, there was what appeared to be a propulsion system to the rear that took up the entire distance of the area of the back of it and it also was emitting a cross between a flame and a vapor that was only apparent at the very end of the craft, it left no trails that I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s a rendition of what I seen: [IMG]http://i74.photobucket.com/albums/i246/Allred5923/possiblealien-1.jpg[/IMG] From the begining to the end of the visual sighting, it took approx. 7-10 secs to cover the plain from West horizon to East horizon.

It was followed by an aircraft at distance of 1 mile behind the object. The aircraft was flying lower and to the north of the object. I watched for about 4 minutes and it continued east out of my sight. I then observed a fast traveling aircraft that appeared to be trying to intercept the other aircraft and object but at a much increased speed like it was in pursuit from 5107B which is the restricted airspace at Holloman AFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a airport manager in Ruidoso for 10 years and a certafied weather observer with the National Weather Service.

All my windows were down and so I know it made no sound.  It was dull dark gray and black, shaped like a triangle, much thicker in the center, even though the wing was also thick, with 2 or 3 dim colored lights along the edge (that I was able to see) and appeared very large as it was so close to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It probably was at least 20 to 30 feet across. I saw it, from the right-hand upper corner of my windshield, just as it was passing me so I only saw it for a few seconds.  I was unable to pull off the road for about 1/3 mile and when I did it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my first sighting and I am educator with a Masters in Education.<n>
6/8/08 19:30|Albuquerque|NM|Other|approx 10 min|Bright stationary circular object in high atmosphere in broad daylight gives way to five smaller moving crescents|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63774.html|372|ndxe200806| Bright stationary circular object in high atmosphere in broad daylight gives way to five smaller moving crescents<n> <n><n> <n><n> June 8, 2008. Approximately 7:30 PM -- While playing in the backyard with my children, my daughter called my attention to what she called the first star tonight -- she was excited because at this time of year it is still very light, with the sun well above the horizon -- essentially still daytime. I initially took it to be a star, located about 2 degrees NE of a crescent-shaped moon. The size seemed about right for a star, but I quickly realized that it was WAY too bright to be a star, as it was still daylight and no other stars were even faintly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look. It appeared to be a circular object in the high atmosphere, with a dark spot in the center -- exactly what one might expect from a weather balloon with something suspended below it, such as a basket with equipment. And the brightness of the object seemed consistent with a balloon reflecting the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was strange was that the object maintained it&#39;s position relative to the moon for about five minutes, which is not the behavior one would expect of a high-altitude weather balloon that is subject to strong air currents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes of observation, the object simply disappeared in a blink. For a good minute I thought it was gone, but with more scoping with binoculars I saw five smaller points of light in the same vicinity. These were too small to be seen with the naked eye, and they were barely visible with binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mind tries to make sense of things. I speculated that a weather balloon could have exploded into smaller pieces. This time, unlike the initial round &#34;star&#34; object, these smaller points were crescent-shaped, and they drifted SW until they moved past the moon, growing more faint as they traveled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It occurred to me that a spherical object in the sky would reflect sunlight in the same way the moon did and assume a crescent shape. This suggests the smaller objects were spherical. This does not explain, however, why the initial &#34;star&#34; appeared perfectly round. Forgive me for a flight of fancy, but a flat, round shaped object -- such as a pie tin -- situated at just the right angle would reflect light across it&#39;s entire surface and appear round to an observer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t come up with an obvious explanation for what I observed. What I saw was certainly not an airplane. Very unlikely it was an exploding weather balloon (how could the intact balloon remain stationary while it&#39;s exploded parts drifted in the wind?). Puzzling indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One final observation. Seems like an odd coincidence. While observing the crescents in binoculars, a Southwest airline flying at what appeared to be a MUCH lower altitude passed right in between two of the crescent shapes. What are the odds that a commercial airline passes through the tiny window of observation -- relative to the rest of the sky -- visible through one&#39;s binoculars at just the right moment under any circumstances? Quite a coincidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sequence took roughly 10 minutes. Crescents faded from view within 10 seconds of the airline passing through my field of vision. Again, Helluva coincidence. Nevertheless, I really don&#39;t think the airline was related to the objects. Airline was low altitude (either landing or taking off from local airport), and the objects were really high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous;  provides only e-address.

I was flying North to Portland, Oregon in commercial aircraft.  It was perfectly clear outside, sunshine, and not a cloud in the sky.  As I was looking down outside at the beautiful mountains and green forest below I saw what appeared to be 3 circular white objects flying very close together in a perfect formation below the aircraft traveling very fast in the opposite direction.  They must have been 10,000 to 20,000 feet below the aircraft so they looked very small.  Each object was positioned a little ahead of the other in a perfect formation flying at the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found her to be an exceptionally capable witness.

Bay in high atmosphere, momentarily stationary|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63788.html|376|ndxe200806| solid, white object seen over S. F. Bay in high atmosphere, momentarily stationary<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday June 8, 2008 my friend and I had just gotten out of a local museum, and were lying in the grass in Union Square (downtown San Francisco) from about 4-5:15 pm soaking up some sun. As we were lying there chatting, I noticed what I first thought were balloons (or a balloon) directly up into the sky close to the position of the moon.  After watching it for about five minutes wondering what it was, I determined that it wasn’t moving around like balloons might on a windy day at high altitude (it’s been fairly windy in S.F. these past few weeks), and it was also too close to be a star or planet.   I finally pointed it out to my friend, and he also suggested it was a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued chatting, the object slowly began to pick up slight velocity drifting towards the horizon (towards the south), away from the position of the moon.  After about 10 minutes of drifting, the object appeared to look like a hyphen (it looked like a ball before), and I pointed this out to my friend.  Eventually we lost track of the object, and kept on with our conversation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, I again looked back up towards the moon, and the object (or another object) reappeared to the location where we saw the first object.  I again pointed it out to my friend, and we both thought it was odd that earlier it had slowly drifted towards the south, and was now instantly right back where it started.  We left shortly after, not thinking too much about the whole thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason why I am posting this is because this morning on the news there was a short segment on an object that was observed (by whom I don’t know) Sunday afternoon over San Francisco Bay, and the news clip featured a video of the same object that we had seen.  The segment didn’t say much about what the object was, just that the F.A.A. had taken notice.  I am assuming many people had seen it if it had been featured on the Monday morning news, and was described on the news to have moved from above one city to another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my own observations, I can describe the object as white (non-metallic), not emitting light, larger than the size of Jupiter or Venus in the night sky, and fairly circular (upon our first observation).  The object appeared stationary at first (the object did NOT get smaller as a balloon would upon rising), but later drifted across the sky (faster than planets and stars appear to move at night, but much slower than man-made satellites move).  The object did not appear to change change size as it moved away, but did appear to look more liner as it drifted away.  It was definitely not an airplane (it was close enough so that we could resolve its outlines and determine a circular shape from our perspective), and looked very solid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole experience did not seem very normal, and I am greatly wondering how many other people saw it, and what it may have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was quite windy with large clouds, and the sky was becoming pretty dark quickly. I was the first one to look Northwest when I saw a perfectly circular yellow object, with bright white light surrounding itself heading east. I pointed it out to my sister and husband. We observed the object moving perfectly straight through the air. I thought it may be a balloon but it would have been moving sporadically, and this was not. We watched as the object continued to head east and then  all of a sudden it turned to head south, the only direction that still looked clear and unaffected by the coming storm. I&#39;ll never forget the event, we live right next to an airport and I love watching the different planes and jets come and go, and this was nothing like anything I had ever seen.<n>

I was stargazing as I like to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a red flashing light in a clearing above the mountains. We frequently see high, transatlantic air traffic. And being an Air Force brat I always enjoy the &#34;light speed is faster than sound speed&#34; phenomena. So when I see a high aircraft I like to watch it before I hear the sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although, this was different. I could hear something. It was familiar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And as I was looking up to see if I had missed an aircraft passing over (because of the sound I was hearing), I saw the red light. I looked like it was heading in the direction (although very high) of where I was observing it. But each time it blinked it seemed to be getting much closer very quickly. Faster than even some of the military jets we see up here that do exercises.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, after about 3 or 4 blinks it veered 90 degrees to the east and went so fast that it literally appeared to be just a streak in the sky. It was nearly like a shooting star. I&#39;ve seen plenty of shooting stars and satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat still for about 10 minutes trying to digest what I had just seen. Came in, drew a picture. And after talking to some people at work yesterday who have seen similar things, I found this web site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I suppose this is a report. I&#39;m still in awe of what I saw. I was afraid to outside last night though for a second look. :-)<n>

Then we saw three objects moving in formation. It was a perfect triangle in space all moving together.  I could not see anything behind the object so I dont know if it was one huge object or 3 seperate objects however they dissapeared and by that time my son and my brother were eager to get off the lake and on to shore.

It was a fairly warm night with a few scattered clouds in the sky.  The moon seemed to be very bright and since we live way out in the country no traffic was on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were discussing one of the movies when my wife said, &#34;Look at that, what in the world is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should add at this time that I am a licensed Pilot with both fixed and rotor wing tickets along with an A &amp; P Mechanics License.  I have worked in the aviation field since my 2nd tour of Vietnam in 1969 where I was a Door Gunner and later promoted to Crew Chief on UH-1H Huey Helicopters.  My wife has worked at the airport for over 25 years in the main terminal.  We both have 4 year degrees and very good vision.  We are not quick to jump to conclusions about things we see or hear but this did catch our attention pretty fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In answer to her question I had no idea at all of what the aircraft could be.  It was dull black with lights in several places around the aircraft that seemed to be windows.  There was a purple beacon in the center of the bottom but no position lights or anti collision lights anywhere at all that we could see.  I thought for a moment that it might be a B-2 Bomber but then I realized that the aircraft was making no noise at all and after &#34;zooming&#34; up to us it stopped right over our vehicle.  Our windows were rolled down and the moon roof was open as the night felt so good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About this time we turned into our private drive and made it up to our house which is about ¼ mile from the main road.  This was around 23:20 or so as I remember, my wife agrees with the times that I am putting into this report.  The next thing that either of us remembers was being in the car, it was running but my wife was in the driver’s seat and I was in the passengers!  Since I am 6’5” and she is 5’7” this posed a problem for me in that my knees were killing me from being forced into the dash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We closed the windows, the moon roof and turned off all the lights and the radio.  After shutting down the car and going into the house we noticed the time, according to our atomic clock, (which is supposedly in tune with the big clock in Colorado), that it was now 02:24 hours????  Where did the time go??  Neither my wife nor I remember anything what so ever after parking the car at our house.  We drove straight home from our friends who live about a mile away from us.  As I stated before we were not drinking nor were we under any influence that would make us see things that weren’t there and we certainly were not in bad enough shape to spend that long in her car with my knees pushed through the dash board!  From what my wife and I remember the aircraft was totally silent, no noise or sound what so ever.  It was triangular in shape, very dull black in color from what we could see, with a purple colored beacon type light at the bottom center with lights in various places around it as if they were cabin windows.  We never saw anyone, we never heard any sounds, we do not remember what happened to the time that we lost, why we were in different positions in the car and why we were sitting outside our house with all of the windows to include the moon roof open?  I did wake up with a headache and my wife felt bad enough to stay in bed for most of the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We hope that this report helps you in some way.  We would like to find out what happened to us, why it happened and what we can do about it.  Please don’t ask us to go to the Government, any branch of the Government, as we trust the drunks that hang out in the alleys of Gaffney more than anyone from the government!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time and please do not hesitate to get in touch if you need more information.<n>

We left the restaurant about 23:00.  It was a clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming out of the restaurant, to the SE we saw about 10 to 15 slightly orangish lights just above the horizon.  For a second we thought it was a star formation, but they were moving and there were too many and they were too low and too close to the ground.   And they had a slightly orangish color.  Then for a second I thought fireworks.  But there was no noise and some of them stood still in the sky and others moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving on their own individually.  They were not in any tight unified formation, but rather in a cluster, but moving independently one from the other. Some would stand still for a while.  Others would move, some up, some gradually disappeared off to the right.  Those to the left stayed longer, but eventually they too moved away and disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing lasted about 10-20 minutes.  They were not aircraft, not helicopters, not fireworks.  They behaved differently than all of these.  They behaved differently than anything else we had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are German Army barracks in that area so we stopped by there the next day to see  if they had night operations that night.  They said no, it had nothing to do with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The source of this report telephoned our Center on Sunday morning, June 08th, and left a detailed oral report about the sighting.  We returned the call, and are satisfied that both witnesses to the event are sober-minded individuals, and that they probably are quite credible sources of information about the sighting.  PD))<n>

We noticed a bright white light in the sky to the south of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We first thought the craft to be an airplane or helicopter but then realized that it didn&#39;t have blinking warning lights as most aircraft do. We looked through a pair of binoculars I has in my car and confirmed it did not have warning lights. It was also moving way too fast to be either of those aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a blinding white sphere shaped object. It was moving from south to north at a very high rate of speed. It went from horizon to horizon in a matter of seconds and then started going back south again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jokingly we said it must be a UFO. Again, jokingly I tried to signal it with the light from my cellphone (it is very dark at night where he lives). I opened and closed my phone a few times and when I was done the light vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reappeared almost all the across the horizon to the north of us and stopped for about 30 seconds or so and then flew back to the south faster than anything I have ever seen. I have seen many different aircraft in my lifetime, from cargo planes to jet fighters to helicopters, and NONE of the are capable of moving that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is hard to guess how big it was as there was nothing else to compare it to at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Could not have been ISS.

We drove out to an area south of Joplin Missouri to observe a phenomenon know as the &#34;spook light&#34; that is legendary in our part of the country.  This area is out in the country and is good and dark, which is why we noticed the number of stars in the sky.  I couldn&#39;t help but to look at the stars rather than watch for the spook light.  I noticed a very bright light in the tree line moving north, as it approached I noticed that there were actually two of the lights.  At first I thought it was perhaps a couple of satellites, but they stayed at the exact same distance from each other for the duration of the flight over us and did seem to dim the more overhead they got.  Now don&#39;t think that it was just above us, it appeared to me to be in orbit...thus making me think it was satellites.  I&#39;m not sure when the shutle docked with the space station...but that is what I ruled it to be and dismissed it.  The observers backgrounds were a science teacher, an attorney, a truck driver (myself) two teenagers and one 10 year old.  It would be great to think that it was something special, but I think it was just the shuttle...you tell me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were on our way back down foothill after getting the yogurt and I looked up at Bishop&#39;s Peak mountain.  It was approximately ten p.m. and a quarter the way up from the top was a round formation of bluish white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of these lights were very dim and some got brighter and dimmer and dissapeared.  It looked as though they were all connected somehow, and I freaked out and told my friend to pull over somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got into a parking lot and parked under a tree, and then both got out of the car.  We walked up to a fence and stood there looking very carefully at these lights and we noticed the lights had moved to the top of the mountain.  I believe it was aware we had our eyes on it, and my legs started shaking uncontrollably, and my eyes watered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were gripping eachothers arm asking if what we were seeing was a ufo.  I waved at the lights, and two lights got very bright, within the string of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend didn&#39;t want to stay very long, and he was having a hard time believing what he was seeing. I threw down my yogurt and we ran into his car, and drove back to our friends house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed my cell phone died, even though it was fully charged.  So I called my best friend, who has seen a ufo in los osos with me before, and I picked her up from her house, about 5 minutes away and drove back to the mountain, and parked in the same place my other friend and I were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not on the top any more, but it was more to the right of the mountain, again, a quarter the way down from the top.  This mountain has lots of big boulders on the top, so I dont know if it was hovering or if it was landed somehow, the darkness made it only possible for us to see anywhere between 3-10 or so lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said, the lights continually changed their brightness, and this object moved VERY very different to anything I&#39;ve seen.  It seemed like it was a row! of lights at some times, and other times it was round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it moved it spread the lights out and then they got closer together as it slowed.  Almost snake-like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t post the sighting right after it happened because I myself, never ever expected to see anything of this nature so close to home, let alone right in front of me and two other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m going to find a picture of Bishops peak and use my paint program to illustrate what i saw.<n>

My Dad pointed out a solid white light moving across the sky. My Uncle and I saw the figure too. We thought it was a satellite but then it came across the opposite way and we thought it was weird a satellite would do that. So we keep looking on for about an hour and we see approximately 13 or 14 more of these objects. We were looking in the sky, my dad bent over to get a drink and two extremely bright lights sucked out of the moving object and were, from my estimate, about 75 to a hundred feet away. The lights were blinding and eerie looking it gave me chills. Just when we thought we had seen it all another object moved across the night sky. And coming the opposite way was three of the solid white lights moving in a triangular formation, distorting the stars behind the U F O. We watched that for about 2 and half to 3 minutes and all of the sudden the front light of the object disappeared then the back left then the back right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never believed in U F O’s or extra terrestrials until I saw this. I was stunned and caught speechless. My dad, my uncle, and I always are logical people and try to find a reason or what it could be but we could not explain this.<n>

Two occurances each lasting 3-5 minutes each.  The first occurance consisted of one craft flying from south to north.  There were no discernable sounds coming from the craft.  The craft looked like a very large fighter jet from behind as it had a large triangular shaped ball of flame that seemed to pulse and change in volume and color from orange to red.  The second occurance consisted of two of these objects flying side by side.  The first object was further north in the sky but all three were on the same trejectory.  The two objects side by side, did not change their positions, even minutely, as they crossed the sky.  The second occurance was, at most, 1/2 hour after the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This object traveled MUCH slower than any aircraft I have ever seen.  So slow in fact that I had figured if it were one of ours, it would have stalled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object passed over head without a sound.

PD))|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63920.html|399|ndxe200806| 6/7/2008 mysterious light sighting in St. Joseph, MO<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left my home at about 9:45 PM to work my night shift job when I happened to see a quite bright yellowish-white light cross the sky. It didn&#39;t move incredibly slowly, but it wasn&#39;t going super-fast, either. I would guess that from horizon to horizon it could&#39;ve spanned the sky within 3-4 minutes, maybe 5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could tell that the object/light was very high in altitude and had no flashing lights (as a plane or helicopter would) or have a trail (as a meteor would) but slowly moved across the sky in a straight line. It made no sound I could hear, though I live in the city and street noise might possibly drown out any sound it could have made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend was with me, and we stood outside and watched the object until it was out of sight, for approximately 2-3 minutes. The object moved from slightly SW to the NE -- as I watched it, I was facing south, and my job is east of where I live so I was able to try to triangulate a little bit of its direction. When we got into the car and headed east to my job, the object had already left our visibility, and looking for it in the sky over the +/-2 miles to work neither me nor my girlfriend were able to spot it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not, like some other reports of this particular sighting on this date, see said object fly off at a high rate of speed. However, if it did so that would explain why I couldn&#39;t see it while driving to work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Internation Space Station confirmed.

Because the stars are so bright, and because sometimes you can see a satellite, I always glance up at the sky when I am out at night.   What I saw tonight was the first time I have seen something I could not explain.  It was a large, bright, white light, flying from West to East in a somewhat wavy pattern. (Not a ruler-straight line)  There were no flashing lights to the side as you would see with an aircraft, nor was there ANY SOUND even though it was flying about the same height or a little lower as a small plane would fly. My sisters-in-law were getting into there car. I called out to have them look at the odd light too.  We watched it for about 45 seconds trying to figure out what we were observing, before one of my sister-in-laws ran inside to get my husband. My  daughter went in at that time also.  My other sister-in-law reached into her purse to get out her digital camera.  As she turned it on, and pointed it towards the sky, the light hesitated, and seemed to hover. Before she could focus and take a picture, it shot off directly towards the South/East, straight up, and disappeared within 3-4 seconds.  My husband made it outside to find me shaken up and nothing to see.  It was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported the incident to our local police, who directed me to the county police. They took a phone report, and offered to send a car out.  Since there was absolutely nothing for them to see, I didn’t think that was truly necessary. They called St. Louis Lambert airport, but was told they don’t track radar this far from the airport routinely.  I was directed to call our small, local airport tomorrow morning to see if anything was indicated on radar.  The sergeant I spoke to also mentioned it may have been a stealth fighter. I don&#39;t know if I buy that, because at the low altitude, it really seems like we would have heard or saw something besides the bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more unusual occurrence was with our dog.  Anytime we are outside, he is right by us, trying to get us to pet him or play with him. Usually he is jumping up at us. During this time, he ran into our garage and was acting skittish, and trying to get inside our house.  Really strange behavior!  I have lived in this area basically my whole life, and have NEVER seen anything I couldn’t explain. I even have laughed at people who mentioned they’ve seen something odd.  Now, I’m not laughing anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be quite serious-minded.  She is going to attempt to find other witnesses in her area, and have them submit reports, as well.  PD))<n>

It was a round object of amber color.  It was hovering over some houses to the east of my home.  It slowly progressed in horizontal fashion, and then stopped.  It again started moving, slowly, then again it stopped.  Suddenly, when an airplane was approaching, it shot straight up and out of sight.  This occurrence has happened before.  Over the last month, I have seen many of these objects.  During the day, there are silverfish orbs hovering in daylight.  Sometimes there are three or four at most moving together, other times they are spread apart in the sky and then come together and move in unison with one another.  The groups move forward and backward, then suddenly disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a circular non blinking light traveling from the northwest to the southeast about as high as a piper cub would normally fly.  We all saw it both with the naked eye and using 10-50 binoculars.  Even after dark (this sighting was at dusk) airplanes are distinguishable through binoculars and this remained a circular bright light.  It was traveling at approximately half the speed of a piper cub and there was no sound.  It wasn&#39;t a helicopter because they can be heard even from within the house.  Just before it went too low on the horizon to see anymore a small plane passed it.  The plane was obviously a plane.<n>

However, I began to notice that the “star” was hovering/vibrating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With binoculars, I observed two white-lighted objects, one above the other, shaped in opposite fan-shapes.  The two lights would work together, one above the other, and, at times, go back together as one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two &#34;lights&#34; would hover and vibrate for a moment in an area, swirl a flash of blue light or send a white streak out or flash a white or red dot somewhere on the perimeter.  It was as if the two “white lights” were in the center of a larger object.  As it would hover, vibrate; send flashes or dots and then move slowly to the next area.  The object was always &#34;moving&#34;- meaning vibrating/hovering/flashing. It worked westward. There was no sound.  The evening was clear- minimal cloud cover and approx. 75 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent from 3:30 a.m. to 4:30 a.m. watching from my balcony with small binoculars.  I sent a text message to a friend of mine and described it.  I attempted to get pictures and video, but the object was too far away and the sky too dark for my camera to be able to record.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this period, a small plane approached from the north, in a, what seemed, direct path with the object.  I observed the plane continue on its flight path, without changing direction, and fly directly &#34;below&#34; the object. (I am a poor judge of distance).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After an hour, the &#34;lights&#34; had moved far enough west that I was unable to see them longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a similar object in May.  At that time it appeared that the &#34;star&#34; was &#34;hovering and moving&#34; and then suddenly and slowly, the star split into two perpendicular objects.  They began to flash a white light  independently- first the right, then the left.  There was no distinct pattern. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights then stayed lit together and the object traveled slowly above the house and away to the east.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a single mother of two, have my MBA, and do not drink or do drugs.  Having very little time to myself, I enjoy a few quiet moments looking at the stars when I occasionally awaken during the night.  I have never seen objects look or behave in this manner previously.<n>

This was a huge string of balloons; however as I watched I noticed it had the ability to fly in formation, so I thought maybe it was a flock of birds, but then I realized that it was to late and no birds fly this late. I started watching more closely trying to figure out what I thought I was seeing. Whatever this was it had the ability to fade in and out of sight meaning one second I could see pieces and the next second it was as if it had totally disappeared and then the next second it was visible again. It started off as a straight line then as it moved east to west it changed to a semicircle with the open end facing east. It disappeared the reappeared in a v shape I noticed it was banking to the south. Thats when I could see what looked like a dome shape within the v shape I could only see part of it. The other strange part we live close to an air force base, so I am familiar with different types of aircraft as well as the landing patterns whatever this was it was actually flying lower than the standard helicopter pattern also no engine noise. I have no idea what this actually was, but I can tell you that it was not technology that we are aware of. In truth I have no clue as to what this was in the end I got scared and went inside my home. I checked the wind direction for that night it was out of the wsw 5 to 8 knts.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sighting began approx. 11PM, and lasted a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was talking with my brother on my back deck (his girlfriend was talking on a cell, but witnessed the event as well) and we were also looking at the western sky, enjoying the stars, when I noticed a exceptionally bright, white, stationary star just under the spoon of the big dipper. I thought it a little strange because I didn&#39;t remember there was a large star near the big dipper, and from what I know most air traffic is in the north and eastern part of the sky in my immediate area, I do commonly see air traffic there, and there was a few passing around at that time in the east (air traffic headed towards RDU airport I would imagine).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked down briefly, and my brother said, &#34;I think it&#39;s moving...that&#39;s not a star&#34;, sure enough it did, and it traveled in an easterly direction at a smooth, quick pace. Whatever it was seemed to me to be at relatively high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed It didn&#39;t have a trail like a meteor/meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was also looking to see if it had tail lights or blinking lights, and I saw none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled for a distance, and it seemed to shrink into a red light about half as bright and size... it strangely turned at an abrupt angle in the opposite direction, traveled again, then remained stationary for a few seconds, then seemed to zip out of sight like it was traveling upwards at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened so quickly I didn&#39;t have time to retrieve my cameras.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I took five pictures on the last day I saw it.  The last day it was visible, there was definitely something different about the object or phenomenon in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I later looked at the pictures, I was stunned, there was a box shape in the sun and a huge diamond formation above it, then a bright light shining above that.  I couldn&#39;t believe what the picture looked like, versus what the naked eye saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took the pictures with my cell phone and I still have the phone with pics.  I have the pictures on my current phone as well because I&#39;m still amazed at what I saw and why no neighbors or news organizations where reporting anything.  The diamond shaped one is perfect shaped of many diamonds put together, kind of like seeing an H bomb explode. The smaller square shape looked like something manned to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder if I have the only pictures?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

6/6/08 23:00|Winchester|KY|Light|2 Hours|Objects in the sky and planes flying around them.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63740.html|412|ndxe200806| Objects in the sky and planes flying around them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 6, 2008 I was walking home around 11:00pm. I noticed several airplanes flying around. Airplanes are very common in this area but what caught my attention was the number of them. You usually see only one or two but  never in the same area. What made me curious was particular groups of these aircraft with red and green flashing lights appearing to be flying in formation in groups of threes. I also noticed Several larger aircraft with the same red and green lights and two larger white lights in the back as they flew over me at very high speeds. These planes were obviously not UFO’s but while I was observing these planes I noticed a star like object hovering much lower than the other planes and traveling at a  faster speed. Occasionally the object would slow down a bit and appeared to wobble in a short circle and speed back up again. I observed this object for about ten minutes until it disappeared behind some trees. I then made several phone calls to friends in the area telling them what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded to walk home when I noticed several more star like objects move higher in the sky. I then noticed one of the larger planes flying towards one of them at a high speed. The object then appeared to fly much higher in the sky until I couldn’t see it. I then saw a short white streak across the sky moving extremely fast and disappeared. I continued to observe several more of these objects and more airplanes  circling in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got home and woke up my father who came outside and witnessed the same events. I also contacted a neighbor who also witnessed several of the objects streaking across the sky. Several of my friends saw the planes flying around in the circular pattern but did not see the star like objects. Everyone who witnessed where kind of concerned and frightened at the events taking place. After a while I couldn’t see any more objects but the planes continued to circle the area. I hope that this small group of people were not the only ones to witness these events. We tried to film the objects and planes on a cell phone camera but couldn’t see them in the night sky.<n>

I ran and got my boyfriend. As we observed it we took notice that there was a silouate of an oval shape under the light. After 20 mins of looking at it it all of a sudden turned of as if a tv shut off. We didn&#39;t know if it shut off or flew away. I got my camera a took some pictures they are not very good on the camera but you can see the lights reflecting. I also took a video. When I put it on my computer and seen it in a bigger screen it looks like it is covered in tiny lights.. Tomarrow Im going out to the feild to look at where it was (6/7/08).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We noticed the light near the moon and decending across the sky and completing its jouney on the opposite end of the sky in a matter of 2 mins. When it acended out of sight it faded and turned a reddish color then dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was one solid blue light, and made no sound.   It travelled East South East , following 33.   I asked the wife to come out quickly and she saw it as well.  There was no blinking at all and it moved slowly away and then faded rapidly before it left our line of sight.       It was definitely within the atmosphere, below the cloud cover and it was no airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Did not seem to be normal debris entering the atmosphere.  We did not notice it until it was straight above us.  We had no doubt about the significance of this sighting.  It was very unusual because of the slower speed, how bright it was and the absence of a trail.  The light source was so bright,looking up at it, it cast a &#34;four point star shape&#34; straight down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observed it for 20 to 30 seconds before the light faded to nothing.  It faded out like a high power search light turned off.  When the light faded, no object could be seen in the clear sky.  No sound at all noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were at our home in the country side, with no lights on to hinder our sight.  No clouds present,star lit night and crescent moon.  Actually, we observed a satellite high in the sky above the path of the light after it extinguished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I flew aircraft for years in the USAF and I strongly believe it was no manmade object.  I’m 40 years old and have seen many things in the night sky and this will be remembered as the most unusual.<n>

There was no sound or any blinking lights. It moved from west to east in the night sky at approximatly 10:00 p.m. As it moved farther away from our location, it diminished to a smaller &#34;dot&#34; and disappeared. As bright as it was, it did not cast any light on the ground. It was somewhat high in the sky, but was several sizes larger than any of the planes that were flying overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The first object was shaped like an old fashioned UFO seen in movies. It was glowing green and white. It moved very strangely. It seemed to be spinning at about 60 mph and moved up and down in an irregular wave-like pattern. The second UFO I sighted was glowing white and was shaped as if a bulging pan. It also appeared out of thin air with a dim flash and shot like a bullet. It disappeared fast and also disappeared with a flash, but, this time the flash was brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/6/08 17:25|Mukwonago|WI|Circle|two or three seconds|I saw a helicopter watching a flying marshmallow.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63786.html|424|ndxe200806| I saw a helicopter watching a flying marshmallow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Sir or Ms,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last Friday, which was June 6th, 2008, I saw an UFO.  This is surprising to me as I usually consider myself a reasonable person.  I am scientifically literate and was completely sober.  I also have 20/20 vision and don’t wear glasses or contact lenses.  It was broad daylight and I was driving in commuter traffic westbound on I43 around 5:24 pm.  I didn’t feel any “creepy feelings” or strange compulsions to make mountains out of mashed potatoes.  This is how it happened:  I saw a helicopter hovering in the air over the town of Mukwonago, Wisconsin.  It looked strange because the helicopter was similar to a traffic helicopter, but had no logos or markings on it.  As this area is quasi-rural, this was out of place and I was curious.  I looked farther into the sky in the direction the helicopter was pointed and saw what looked like the round end of a marshmallow in the sky.  It was white and seemed to have a dimple in the middle of it.  After about two seconds it left, shooting directly out into the atmosphere.  I saw no fire, lights, trails or colors and heard no sounds.  The strange flying marshmallow was just gone.  After it left, the helicopter stopped hovering and flew away in a southwesterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any questions, feel free to call me at 262-((number deleted)) after 3pm CST.  I don’t know how you could investigate this or what good it would do, which is one reason why I didn’t report it earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Good luck! Sincerely, ((name deleted))<n>

I&#39;ve always heard stories and seen video&#39;s but seeing it for myself was an entirely different experience. We were driving to San Francisco and we had just passed a power plant and looking over rolling hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was a clear blue, no clouds on a bright afternoon. I was looking out the window and into the sky, I saw something shinny which I thought might be the sun reflecting on it, but it was far too bright and then I thought it was a plane because of the shape but it had no wings, so I was confused, before I could say anything, and in the blink of an eye it disappeared. Again I stared in shock and searched the sky, knowing a plane couldn&#39;t move that fast to get out of my line of sight in the blink of an eye. So then I realized what I had just seen. A friend of mine took my description and searched, finding this video for me to see and it&#39;s Exactly what I had seen. Whether it was the same craft?

We had been outside a few times tonight smoking a cigarette. While he had gone outside on my deck to smoke another cigarette. I had gone outside to join him as he was sitting outside on a chair I sat down in a chair next to him and lit up my cigarette. I always look up into the stars at night and never in my life have seen anything stranger than a shooting star or northern lights. Once a rare solar storm! But as I gazed into the western sky looking at about a 15 degree angle view off into the sky. I seen 3 stars that I most likely see alot staring off into the sky. But as I kept my focus one of them moved to the right moving north. Not far or not fast it didn&#39;t move very far and stopped and became bright and about 3x its previous size. Then it was moving away from our direction to the east but at a fast rate to where we could not see it anymore! It definitely went out of the atmosphere. As I was looking at it when I thought it was a star as it moved I told my friend do you see that. But I did not take my eyes off it. As I said that it had moved to the right in the northern direction. Stopped became brighter then took off to the east away from us into the sky and disappeared. I was thinking omg as it was over and glad my friend saw it too. We both have never seen anything like this ever before. As it was gone we notice planes heading in the general direction it was at in the sky. We never saw it appear I just noticed it looking at the stars thinking it was a star.

At the cornors, the smalliest white light came on. A question was asked of me. I answered.

((Star??))|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63849.html|431|ndxe200806| Strange blinking lights that hover appearing in the sky several nights in a row, all at the same time each night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in Watertown, TN. For the past 8 nights in a row we have observed on each night several unidentified objects in the sky. Each night they are in the same areas and positions numbering around a dozen or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There seems to one in particular that is always in the same area of the sdy. When viewed with the naked eye, it appears to be one light that moves. When viewed through binoculars, it is actually two close together in proximity. These objects &#34;hover&#34; with no noise audible. They move in strange patterns. If one looks at the sky briefly, they appear to be star-like. Looking at them for a few seconds and longer you see that they are definitely NOT stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects appear around the same time each night and stay for several hours. We watch them appear each night between 10:30 - 11:00 PM CST. They leave around 2:00 - 3:00 AM CST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also an interesting detail: we live in a rural area and the television viewing we have is via satellite. Our satellite signal is blocked on almost all channels while the objects are near. We usually have about 3 or 4 of our channels that will acually come in while the rest of the channels say there is a signal error. Coincidence? Maybe or maybe not, we are not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights formed what I consider an isosceles triangle.  They disappeared in opposite order in which they appeared, within about 3 seconds.  This was neat, odd, but conclusive for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We traveled another 4 or 5 miles and again, 8-10 more orange lights appeared randomly spaced to the right side of the highway, this time appearing closer to the tree line.  After about 4 seconds they disappear.  By this time, we are consumed with speculation as to what could be making these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We traveled less than 2 miles further, and again 8-10 orange lights appeared randomly spaced, and within less than a second they literally moved into a formation of two parallel, perpendicular rows.  I was driving, and could not witness as much as my son, who said it/they, moved into a triangular formation and disappeared again in about 4 seconds.  This is when it became apparent to me, this was real.  We are nervous and anxious to get home, since we are alone in the middle of nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We traveled another 3-4 miles, when the lights appeared again, but this time below the tree line, literally hovering about 20-30 feet above an open field.  This thing is less than 50 yards away from my car, and we can now see it. The very bright orange lights encompass the perimeter of the vessel that is hovering at an angle and slowly rotating counter-clockwise, illuminating the undercarriage which was a dark gray metallic.  My son witnessed a second vessel hovering above the one described, but said that one did not have lights. We did not stop or even slow down, but we continued to see it until we had driven out of viewing range. This last sighting lasted for about 12 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not report this to local authorizes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Think that’s odd? It pales in comparison to what we seen the other night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Naturally I was looking in the night sky on 6-5-08 enjoying a smoke when I noticed a plain in the sky right over head.I gazed amongst it and thought it was odd when all the animals started going crazy,I could not here the plain which I thought was odd being how close it was approx.200 yds away.Out from the top side off the tree shot out a white spherical shaped object really white but didn’t light up the area ,it was strange.It was only about 50 yds  in the air and about 50 -80 yds away. It traveld north to south vertically across the sky and it was huge. The size could be compares to a marker from where I was and it also left a sort off streek behind it.Whoever was in this plain had to off seen this  also.The light or object seemed to disapear when it started traveling under the area of the plain.I would love to know if anyone else seen this in or near Orangevale Ca,.If I see anything else odd I will post it on this site.<n>

It looked like a shooting star but it was a lot larger and moved a lot slower than one. It was bright white, moving down vertically towards the ground.  It vanished behind some trees. I didn&#39;t hear any noise and could not tell how far away it was but it left me in complete shock. It was the wierdest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.

6/5/08 00:30|Olive Branch|MS|Flash|45 minutes|Strange sightings over north Mississippi|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63833.html|444|ndxe200806| Strange sightings over north Mississippi<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside my back door, practically inside the door frame.  It was a very clear night, and I was just stargazing while I smoked a cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a bright light streak across the sky directly above me.  My first thoughts of the white streak was it might be a missile.  But then I realized it had no sound, and only lasted at most, 2 seconds.  The missile thoughts came to mind because over the past year, and more so in recent months, we have had numerous fly overs at EXTREMELY low altitudes of fighter jets, blackhawk helicopters, and cargo planes.  I actually have a photo of a fighter jet flying over, and as recently as June 1st, a formation fly over occured.  I ran inside and got my 12 year old brother, hoping maybe he could catch a glimpse of something to prove I wasn&#39;t going crazy at 23 years old!  Of course, my younger brother mocked me because of what I had seen.  Within 20 minutes of being outside again, we both saw a streak of light go across the sky.  From our vantage point, it moved east to west.  It was green in color, and seemed to skip over parts of the sky, as if it disappeared and reappeared right in front of us!  It covered a large distance in a matter of 6 seconds, at most.  My brother was amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to stay outside and try to see even more.  Ten minutes went by, and then we both noticed another streak go overhead.  It was white in color and gone within a second.  We both rushed inside and were a little shaken by the sights we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I coaxed my girlfriend outside late June 7th because she thought I was going insane.  It was a clear night once again.  We watched the stars slowly appear as the sun went down.  We noticed the moon to the west and saw saturn and venus closely next to the moon.  As we panned across the sky, going west to east we noticed what we thought was a star... Moving!  We could barely see it, but could easily see the movement.  It moved very subtle, very slow, and within about 6 seconds it was completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, June 10th, I decided to go outside and sit on our back porch.  It was around 1:15 a.m.  I noticed the green streak again!  It appeared to be moving towards the ground, in intervals like the previous sightings.  It was farther east, in the direction of Holly Springs, MS.  I went back inside, and that&#39;s where I stayed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve gotten curious whether or not anyone else around the Memphis, TN area or northwest Mississippi area has seen the things I have witnessed within the last week or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more note: The green streaks I saw also seemed to change towards a blue then an orange.<n>

My immediate answer to her was, &#34;yeah, it is an airplane.&#34;, especially considering the airport is in the same direction.   Although answering her this away I still was keeping an eye on it because it didn&#39;t appear to be moving and we had such a clear view of this as well.  I pulled over into a parking lot to get a better look and NO where could you locate this object.   We both looked every where in the sky and could not locate the object again.  We both know that on some days if an airplane is way way in the sky it can appear to come in and out, this was not way in the sky.  It was high enough to be an airplane but it was low enough to have a great view, especially on a sunny day and no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife does believe in these type things.  I myself am an IT professional and have been brought up in a manner not to believe in these sorts of things.

Earlier in the evening, we had discussed what took place at the Surry powerplant just a week or two ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the early morning of June 3rd, 2008, My friend and I were out in the street observing what we believed to be either Venus or Jupiter (I can&#39;t remember which) in the South-Western sky through my telescope.  After observing for a short while, we began to joke around and just look at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later my friend alerted me to the sky directly overhead, where there was a faint moving object.  Upon inspection with my 10x50 binoculars, I was able to observe the object move smoothly across the sky, and then fade away.  It appeared to be very high, and shone like a dim star.  We have witnessed these objects in the past.  We decided to lay on the ground and look at the sky to see if anything else happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both looking at the same area in the sky when a bright, but focused flash of light occurred, which we both observed.  I quickly inspected the area with my binoculars just in time to observe another object, this one a little brighter than the last.  It also faded away after a short period of around 20 seconds.  A few minutes later there was another flash in the same area of the sky (to the North East), but this time I was not able to observe an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A short time later, we witnessed what I can only describe as a &#34;skipping&#34; bright light flashing across the sky.  The light flashed brightly for a moment while moving extremely fast across the sky.  It was not a meteorite, as the object flashed, and then flashed again further along its path, and then flashed 3 more times as it flew further away (from the southwest to the northeast).  It was at this point that my friend&#39;s brother (just inside the house nearby) called to see what we were doing outside.  We told him of the situation, and he came out quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No activity was present for a while, so we again observed Venus/Jupiter.  After a few minutes, I had a very strange urge to look at the sky.  I looked up to the north almost directly overhead and witnessed a bright spherical object, as bright as the brighter stars in the sky, moving to the south.  I observed it in the binoculars.  All 3 of us observed it as it crossed overhead.  At the moment it was nearly above us, the object&#39;s light increased greatly in intensity, at least 2 or 3 fold, until it was the brightest star in the sky, and then dimmed back out.  It was around for the longest duration of all of the objects, 30 seconds or more.  My friend and I were almost ecstatic at the sighting, as we had been waiting for something like this for quite a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends and I are active observers of the sky.  We often sit out at night and watch for phenomena like these.  We have never witnessed anything like what we saw this evening.  We have witnessed a few faint objects before, but nothing conclusive.  These objects were unlike any others that we have seen in the night sky.  Interestingly enough, we often go out to the Colonial Parkway across from the Surry Powerplant to lay on the grass and observe the sky (we have witnessed objects in the sky there, but nothing like what was reported recently).  After the events of late, the sky is sure to get more attention around here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this report proves interesting.  I will be keeping my eyes out for any new developments.  It seems that things are increasing in intensity here.  I appreciate this site greatly.  Thank you for maintaining it.<n>

This object had no colored lights as might be observed on a helicopter.  It moved back and forth to the  the opposite side of the W-F building at a very high rate of speed then disappeared behind the building.  I was observing this from the City Center Marriott.  A few minutes later the object reappeared above the south corner, rapidly moved to the north corner then disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this same object again on June 4 during the approximate same time frame and it did much that same as it had on Monday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The v shape was tight and a bit irregular, the orbs seemed to jostle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could only think of a group of geese or ducks being lit by cars and street lights, but have never seen that before with bright red/amber.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not much else can add, my friend isn&#39;t sure what it was as only glimpsed while driving after i noticed it. It was at times briefly obscured while driving and was gone by the time we got up on the bridge with a good view north up the valley. Could be similar to the well known here Kaikoura lights in 1977. Also foo fighters are described like theses looked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please move my original post to right date and add any info form here that helps, thanks. x NZ<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

As I was approaching Lodi, I saw what I thought was a small jet.  It was shiney like a plane. I watched it for a bit and it was flying from east to west. The more I looked at it the more I was trying to make out what exactly it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 20 seconds and then it disappeared.  Now it did&#39;nt fly away where I couldnt see it.  There were no clouds out that day.  It got to the point where it looked like it was going to go off into the distance where you normally cant see anymore, but it never hit that point.  It disappeared too early. The light, or glare became really small like it was shrinking rather than leaving the area.  It was weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen another sighting in 1997.

6/1/08 23:15|Thunder Bay (Canada)|ON|Teardrop|2 minutes|2 white glowing metallic tear drop shaped objects over Thunder Bay|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63658.html|465|ndxe200806| 2 white glowing metallic tear drop shaped objects over Thunder Bay<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were driving west on the dirt road protion Paquette road when we noticed a bright white light travelling at a high rate of speed coming from the west heading east.  Its speed was equal to a jet fighter.  It was sort of circular when heading towards us.  We stopped the van and got out to watch.  As it passed over us a second one follwing a same parallel path about 40 meters difference approached and passed over us.  Unlike the first object that went over our heads, the second one was more off of the road so we got to see it more from the side.  It seemed to have a slight more of a rounding at the front and tapered slightly like a tear drop point at the rear.  I estimate that it was roughly 1 kilometer in the air. And was a small craft that could possibly hold 1-3 people if possible, or possibly its automated.  The entire object was illuminated, there was no single point of light or flashing lights, it was fairly bright and consistent all around the object making it seemingly glow.  Inside the glow it was a perfect metallic object, as if it were one complete piece, with no visible wings, tail fin, etc.  There was also about a 10-20 meter tail trailing behind the object, like a jet stream about less than half the size of the object, which re-assured my guesstimate about the object&#39;s size and distance and that it must be travelling through the atmosphere.  There was no noise from the object as it approached, went past us and beyond our visiblilty.  They were heading east directly over Thunder Bay and in the direction of Lake Superior, possibly travelling between 140 to 180 kilometers per hour.  I keep going outside to see if I can see them again.  During the time we were pulled over I kept flickering my headlights to get its attention, but it didn&#39;t work.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/1/08 23:00|Lemont|PA|Flash|about 1 minute|Flashing light over lime quary|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63656.html|466|ndxe200806| Flashing light over lime quary<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 11 p.m. I was in my back yard looking at the stars.  It was a clear, dark night and visibility was excellent.  I noticed a flash of white light, similar in size, and duration to that of an airplane landing light.  Unlike landing lights, however, there was only one light flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A second or two later there was another flash of the white light and I saw that it had traveled further than a conventional aircraft could have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light continued to travel West to East for a few more seconds, with the flash of light remaining consistent.  Then, whatever it was turned in what must have been an incredibly small radius (between flashes)and began to travel in the opposite direction. I watched it as it now moved silently from East to West until I lost sight of it beyond a ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire event took place in about one minute but I continued to watch for another half an hour, hoping (big time) that it would change directions and come back again.  Unfortunately it didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For what it&#39;s worth, the &#34;flight path&#34; of the flashing light/object would have taken it over an active lime quary located between Lemont, and Boasburg PA.<n>

While star gazing and looking for satellites, we witnessed a bright solid light open up to around the diameter of the moon. It was a perfect sphere formation and seemed to be far out in the night sky about the distance of a satellite.  It lasted for about 2 or 3 seconds then quickly appeared to shrink in diameter until it disappeared,  as if it where some type of controlled technology similar to a wormhole. Six of us witnessed this phenomenon and will never forget it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was sleeping over a friends house and the next morning we were going to center city Philadelphia to go skate.  I live about 40 miles from Philly in Doylestown, so we would usually take the train.  But, the night before we had gone I was to be sleeping in his basement (he had a rancher house so there was no upstairs, only first floor and basement) while he was in his bed upstairs.  It was a boring night just watching tv on his pull out couch, I was alone because my friend was talking to his mom in his room. I was swiftly greeted by my friends weiner dog Barney.  He then darted over to the wide open screen door (Basement had a door which lead to a patio) .  A little odd I thought at first considering he wasn&#39;t much of a guard dog and usuall! y wouldn&#39;t just start tearing ass around the house just to look out a window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So as I&#39;m sitting there just watching tv when the dog starts barking. I was curious so I decided to see what was going on. I do a quick visual sweep of the patio, and saw nothing.  But then, I looked up and shit got full on crazy. I saw this MASSIVE huge glowing ball of blue, it was a really deep cool looking color.  It rose from behind the tree line in the distance and was dead silent. It cut left quickly for a little bit, then veered back and up then shot off quicker than anything I have ever seen before. I instantly freaked out and ran upstairs.  I started yelling if anybody saw what I just did and my friend and his Mom just replied &#34;no.&#34;  I tried to debunk what I saw but it wasn&#39;t any holiday with fireworks, the airport was across the other side of town, and not to mention that a bright blue orb of glowing light doesn&#39;t really remind of a plane.  No explanation was ever found, still confu! sed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It caught my eye and when I really focused on it I noticed that there were 13 to 15 of them scattered about in no particular formation.   Went to room to drop off luggage and when I looked again they were gone.  Objects were very high; saw airliner flying at similar altitude and believe the objects were a little larger than the passenger plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It sounded very loud and low.  I went out my front door and looked up…and I saw a silver saucer like craft.  Behind the craft was a big black helicopter.  It was going very, very slow.  I couldn’t believe my eyes.  I jumped into my car…and followed it.  I live in Bee Cave…was traveling on Bee Cave Road near 71 and I cut through the Galleria parkway.  The craft was still going slow and low.  I managed to get onto 620 and went to Home Depot parking lot.  I stopped and got out of my car…….I watched and the helicopter kept following it….then all the sudden, the craft went at what I consider warp speed and you could tell the helicopter was confused….it kept looking this way and that way..and it finally took off in the direction of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stunned.  I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.  The strange thing is….as excited as I was…when I got home… I didn’t tell my husband or anyone else.  Not until a few months later.  I can’t tell you why this happened.  But, I was so compelled to find out if anyone else had seen this, I called the Bee Cave Police Department in November and reported it.  They said they had no sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was coming home today and I was listening to a program on Sirius radio.  This exact subject had come up.  A woman had been walking her dog in the park and then came upon a UFO about 250 feet above her head.  She explained what she saw it in vivid detail.  She, too, didn’t tell anyone for months..but then finally did call the police department to tell them about it.  It was so close to what I went through, I couldn’t believe it.  She said that it was so strange how no one was around at the time..and that very thing happened to me…..there was no one around at the time…yes there were parked cars..but I didn’t notice anyone else around.  How strange is that?  But, according to this woman, she encountered the same thing.  The response from the commentator was that it was probably about space and time travel, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Listen, I am just an ordinary mom living in Bee Cave, TX.  I am not into UFOs, but I KNOW what I saw.. I saw it, I followed it.<n>

My fiance was in the back yard playing with the dog. I noticed what looked like two airline planes heading right towards eachother. The suspected UFO coming from the East and the plane coming from the West. I called for my finace and told him these two planes look like they are heading right towards eachother. Right when it looked fatal the one coming from the East made a ninty degree shift to the north then proceeded just that quick in the direction it was going previously to the left hand side of the plane.

It moved right alomg with me on 89 the whole way to flagstff 45 mn.?but had deceptive speed and stable movement, not fast, but way to smooth for a ballon or plane for that matter , thats the best way i can descibe its movement. at times when looking at the object,a different more distant, smaller faster moving light was present behind it. much of the time my radio station was changing stations but that does happen on the road with a shitty i pod connector but i thought i would at least mention it.I watch it as i pull into flagstaff and park and watch  stay completly still for more than 30 min.im guessing 5000 ft above ground very clearly visable above sunset crater area. im looking around at peaple to see if they see it , nobody.i still dont know why i didnit ask anybody if they see that to but i did not.it was reflecting sunlight of it silver sides, shaded underneath perfect sphere.this basically freaked me out . after 30 min. of watching this parked at dennys i went inside to eat, kind of hoping that when i came out it was gone and it was.later that day drove to havasupi indian reservation to meet friends that were 6 hours behind, sat to wait for them and begin seeing the smaller more erratic moving further distant object that was behind the sphere before . realy quick moving daytime star looking thing.that only lasted for 20 sec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was unbelievably clear.  It was a bright, rich golden color.  It was very large, and swift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed by my window with no noise, as i was star-watching.  It had a bright, gold circular light system that wrapped around the whole aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was leaving, I noticed that on the bottom of the aircraft, there was a circular concave formation.  The top was smooth. It was a disk shape.<n>

6/1/08 02:30|Arlington|MO|Oval|2-3 minutes|School bus size UFO hovering over river.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65187.html|477|ndxe200806| School bus size UFO hovering over river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Jun 1, 2008, an older woman and her son were camped in a tent on a slight rise overlooking the Gasconade River at the Arlington Campground.  A thunderstorm had just moved throught the area and as they exited their tent to check for storm damage between 02:30-3:00 A, they noticed an object suddenly appear over the river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was 125-150 yards from them and hovering about 20 feet over the water.  It looked like a flatened football. It was a beautyful metalic blue with a series of dull red, green and pretty blue lights around the edge.  The whole thing was enveloped in aqua blue fog which  also lit up the water beneath it. It was &#34;bigger than a school bus&#34;and was 5 inches long at arms length.  They watched it for 2-3 minutes when it raised up an additional 30 feet, hovered monentarily then departed to the northwest at a 45 degree angle at fantastic speed.<n>

6/1/08 00:00|Glenwood|MN|Formation|60 seconds|Three seperate, individual brite lights move in VERY fast, stop instantly, hover and then individually speed off at increadible speeds|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79149.html|479|ndxe200806| Three seperate, individual brite lights move in VERY fast, stop instantly, hover and then individually speed off at increadible speeds<n> <n><n> <n><n> I like to fish on night on Lake Minnewaska for walleyes.  This evening was a very clear night with no clouds...the stars were out and I also like to look for constellations, aircraft and satellites.  I only know the basic constellations but always look for them.  Aircraft are very obvious &#34;blinking&#34; lights flying at consistent slow speeds across the sky.  Satallites are difficult to locate but when one is found, it is a single consistent light that moves across the sky at a consistent speed within the earth&#39;s orbit.  We also have emergency helicopters that occassionally come to town...these also have blinking lights, land at the hospital in town and then leave.  These are all &#34;identified&#34; flying objects and I am familiar with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was trolling for walleyes from west to east along the south shore of the lake, I was looking up into the sky.  I noticed a very bright light moving at a very high speed.  It was traveling west as well as an angle toward the ground...but still very high in the sky.  I was amazed at how fast it was going...20 to 30 times faster than anything else I had seen including aircraft or satallites.  It then came to a sudden and abrupt stop in the sky and stayed in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time another very bright light zoomed in even faster and stopped by the other lights top right.  Then another bright light zoomed in just as fast as the second light and stopped at the first lights top left.  This was all in the east sky just to the south side of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three lights stayed in that same position without moving for about 10 or 15 seconds.  Then, the first light bolted to the north and out of sight at an increadible speed...just as fast as you could point your finger and swing your arm...increadible speed!  The other two lights remainined for about a couple more seconds...and then the second light shot off towards the direction of the first light at the same high speed.  The third light quickly followed after the second light in the same direction and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat there amazed with what I had just seen.  None of the lights returned that night and I have not seen anything like it since.  The ability for those lights to come in individually at those high speeds, stop instantly, hover and then dart off at even greater high speeds was definately not any aircraft mankind has or that I am aware off.  It was litterally like the speed of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I did not report this earlier was because, even though I strongly believe these objects were not from this planet, I didn&#39;t have any other evidence except for my observation.  I also did not know were something like this could be reported...knowing my local police station would just smile when I told them what I had seen.  But when I came across your website, I felt I should provide my observation to get it on record.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
