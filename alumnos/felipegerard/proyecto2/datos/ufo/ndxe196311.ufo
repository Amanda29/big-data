We were a|6/2/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02906.html|1|ndxe196311| Summary : Observed 5 lights in a inverted &#34;V&#34; rise from the horizon, hover for a few minutes and then sink back down below the horizon. We were at sea on our way back to the U.S. from Japan. Lights were simular to the Phoenix &#34;V&#34; lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my friend M. B. were walking accross the flight deck, I don&#39;t remember why anymore. It was at dusk but not dark yet. We first saw a bright light on the horizon directly behind the ship. It rose up and then there were 3 which continued to rise to 5 lights. They stayed there for awhile not moving or anything. I told my friend I should go get my camera but he said the lights would be gone by then. Shortly after that the lights descended to below the horizon. We went the the CIC room and asked the radar operator if there was anything behind us, he said no. We never said why we were asking or said anything about what we had saw. I can&#39;t remember that we ever talked about it after that because M. said no one would believe us anyway and I agreed. Until I heard about  the Phoenix lights on 3-13-97 I haven&#39;t mentioned this to a whole lot of people. As to when this happened I am thinking it was 3 days out of Japan and the ship was traveling about 30 knots. It was a warm night as I remember. I don&#39;t remember that the lights flickered but do remember that they were white.<n>
11/23/63 10:00|Thunder Bay (Canada)|ON|Disk|1 minute|This was not a UFO|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42257.html|2|ndxe196311| This was not a UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the day after President Kennedy was assassinated and the school was closed in his honor . This sighting happened at the confluence of the Moose and Mattagimi rivers , 80 miles south of James Bay where 3 hydroelectric dams were being built . Myself and R.P. were sitting on his back steps facing west at 10:00 a.m. and the sky was clear and it was cold .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Behind R.P.s place was a single lane road , then a ditch , a two lane road , another ditch and then 100 feet to the treeline . 75 yards in total and i looked up to see a saucer sitting over the trees and pointed it out to R.P. The saucer tilted up on it&#39;s side as if to get a better look at us . It was approximately 30 yards in diameter and 5 yard in thickness . Although saucer shaped the edges were not sharp as it appeared to have square windows around it&#39;s circumfrence . We watched for about 1 minute and then it drifted west and out of sight . There was no sound .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dimmension of the saucer should be very accurate as i know the exact distance to the first grove of trees and it was sitting just above them . Myself and R.P. did not see a UFO , we saw a flying saucer from very close range . It appeared to be constructed of dull aluminum . It was as clear as if someone parked a school bus 75 yards away and asked for a description .<n>
11/1/63 00:00|Engelwood Cliffs|NJ|Unknown|3 min|A row of bright rectangular windows with no visable exterior shape seen on 9W in Englewood Cliffs, NJ|10/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46981.html|3|ndxe196311| A row of bright rectangular windows with no visable exterior shape seen on 9W in Englewood Cliffs, NJ<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were leaving the 9W bolling ally on rute 9W it is set below the highway on the west side.  So when pulling out onto 9W the car is inclined up so you are looking straight out the front windshild over the building on the other side of the road, The Prentice Hall building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a row of bright large rectangular windows with about a 2:1 hight to width ratio.  At this time I was finishing my studies in Aircraft Design, so I tried to think of what it was that I saw.  The only thing that came into mind was the gondola of a blimp.  I don&#39;t recal why we couldn&#39;t see the shape but I couldn&#39;t, and was most fixed on the windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lowered the windows to see if we could here the engins, but it was dead silent.  We also could not determine as how far it was from us, so I drove the car across the highway to the left side of the Prentice Hall building while sticking our heads out and looking up to see if it would pass over us.  It had been moving to the north an a crawling speed.  We didn&#39;t see it pass over us and when we got into the Prentice Hall parking lot we got out of the car and looked in every direction and there was no sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went to school I asked a professor if blimps fly at night and he said, &#34; No!&#34;  When I got home I called Langly Field in NJ were the blimps are and they also told me the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always wondered what we saw that night and when I came across this web site I started checking it out and found several similar reports in this area over the last 30+ years and one only a few blocks away on the same highway, and one a few miles away near the GW Bridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Some blimps do fly at night, but they must have standard lighting, in order to do so.  PD))<n>
