My wife and one year old daughter were with me at the time.  As we approached the harbor drive, I noticed a large silver ship hovering above the trees.  We stopped and watched if for a few moments until it followed the tree line down to the Harbor and headed off across Puget Sound towards Mt. Rainier.  This was the subject of a regression done in Kennewick, WA. in 2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were red/browns that pulled us into the craft.  They stated that they were in the neighborhood and just stopped by to say hello. They expressed pleasure at the fact that I had settled down and started a family.  Amazing.  There were two in sight.  The smaller one that held me as a child and a larger entity that was more fully developed and seemed to be in charge.  They also stated that there was something out there in our future coming our way.  This was the first sighting that I remembered and when I underwent regression, the hypnotist instructed me to go to the first sighting that I have ever had.  That abduction occurred when I was eleven years old while living in Westmont, N.J.   I was being shadowed by a Silvery craft while walking in a park near where we lived.  It was silvery with brassy portholes and about 25 feet in diameter.  It was hovering over the trees.  I suddenly felt myself being sucked up a hose type device and landing near a wall/shelf in a corner of the craft.  Something was off to my left rear.  I was afraid and turned my head down and away.  It took my left wrist in its hand and attempted to see into my face.  It was a red/brown entity that was about an inch taller than me.  It was very nurturing and concerned that I had been interfered with.  I have never felt threatened by these entities.  Angry, yes, but not threatening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Dad wanted to go and I went since I was done with my college studies.  We were sitting up by the press box on the south side of the college stadium. There was the last color from the setting sun.  The game was not that interesting so I sat back and enjoyed all the stars and as I looked at about 11 o&#39;clock angle I saw this one &#34;falling&#34; star only it didn&#39;t fall, more like floated down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, it reminded me more of a spark from a professional fireworks display.  The color was a blue white, much like an LED flashlight.  I kept my eye on it as it floated down.  I tried to gage it&#39;s size but there was nothing to compare it with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped about the height of field lights that were on.  I realized it was over the field and it wasn&#39;t very big. I heard no sound. It was like it was watching the game.  As I kept my eyes on it, I heard a small plane coming across the lake and flying to the airport west of town and close enough to view the game going on.  The light was not bothered by the plane and continued to hover above the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20 min or so it was attracted to one of the trains that haul pulp wood to a plant in another town.  As I watched, it floated at a good clip across the lake, about 1/2 a mile across at that point, reflecting on the water.  It dropped down a little, maybe about 50 or 60 ft above the water and though for the distance, it kept it&#39;s brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It easily caught up with the train, staying one car back from the engine, floating about 6 to 10 ft. above the front of the second car.  I watched it as long as I could, until the train and light disappeared behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There may have been maybe 3 or 400 people on each side of the stadium so I don&#39;t really know if anyone else saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I started to hear this very strange humming sound hovering over me it sounded very close maybe 75 feet directly over head I could see all above me but their was nothing their.  It left and came back 10 min later for less then a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when I had an inner fear I cannot describe I don&#34;t scare easy. Then it went away.I climbed down out of my tree stand and started down through the field at a fast pace something was telling me to get out of their and scrap the hunt I made it about 100 yards down through the field when I heard the strange humming again their was a wash out from rain erosion in the field about 3 feet deep so I got down in it and stooped down low to try to hide my self.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time it was starting to get dark It was then I saw a beam of light come out of the sky maybe 75 feet above the tree tops where I had just been hunting right above my tree stand and lit up the whole area from the  point source in the sky to the ground scanning back and forth 3 or 4 times then all of a sudden the light vanished the humming stopped and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back to my truck and never went back till this day.  This is what it looked like take a giant flashlight about 20 feet long with a lens about 3 feet round cover it with thin red transparent plastic hold it about 75 feet above the tree tops and and scan the woods back and forth when its almost dark it was a perfect cone shaped beam with every thing  else around it dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#34;t know what happened that evening but their was something their and what ever it was it knew I was their and came back at dark to find me that all I can say except this is a true story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was looking up in the night sky, when I saw 5 very vivid and quizzical lights in a triangler formation. The odd thing was that it was stationed perfectly above or in the middle of the sky. The night sky was filled with stars that night as well. I noticed points of light that were steady in speed, which I quickly realized were orbitting satelights. However that formation was completely different and stood out. As I watched it, it turned half way one way then made another turn half way in the oppisite direction. Then the object turn 3/4s around and clearly sped to the left turned and sped back to its original position, then sped straight off the axis or curviture of the earth. Then I knew what I saw in fact was something not of this earths technology or design. I know that we are being watched. I know that we are being visited. I know that higher governments are fictionalizing and adding conjecture to these occurences. What really upsets me, is that when todays reporting of those and these sighting the REPORTERS themseleves are covering their tracks, so that the viewers get a vague sense of reality or an very incomplete picture, which leads to speculation. Please stop and realize that far too many people know what&#39;s going on. Even now our governments are realizing this. However, if REPORTERS continue to be vague then of course our governments have nothing to worry about because their secerts will continue to be safe for now. Do more raddling of the cage, keep barking up that tree, and for all our sakes BE CONSISTANT &amp; RELENTLESS! E-mail for any further questions or concerns.

I was visiting the home of a friend, about a mile from where I used to live-- my parents&#39; house.  My friend and I were sitting on the driveway, leaning against the garage door talking, and I happened to look up at the sky, when something unusual caught my attention, and we&#39;re talking about WAY up in the sky. This huge, I mean really HUGE object was moving across the sky at a very slow speed.  The object was not only enormous in size, but it was white, very bright, and shaped like a dome.  It reminded me of the Captiol dome, yet lying on it&#39;s side, with this white foggy type of mist trailing out of it. My friend both sat quietly and stared at this object moving across the sky, and then it disappeared.  Afterward, my friend and I turned to one another in amazement and that was that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  We believe the second Monday in October 1979 may have been the 8th or 9th of October, but we will try to check.  PD))<n>
10/10/79 00:00|Poughkeepsie|NY|Chevron|15 minutes|1/4 moon-like,  its 'chord' or flat side parallel to horizon,  bright orange-red glow,  completely silent, no features.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42482.html|9|ndxe197910| 1/4 moon-like,  its &#39;chord&#39; or flat side parallel to horizon,  bright orange-red glow,  completely silent, no features.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife &amp; I were returning home from a late Sunday doubles tennis match at our local indoor club (Cross-Court Inc) near midnight on New Hackensack Road in the town of Poughkeepsie, NY, proceeding W,  with no other cars on the road at that time since on a Sunday night almost everything is closed in the town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed in the SW direction that a fairly bright and large &#39;1/4 moon&#39; was visible, but was kind of &#39;odd-looking&#39; in that it was featureless and had a bright orange-red &#39;glow&#39; in a very overcast sky with no stars visible at all that night.   It just didn&#39;t look right at all;   so I pulled my car off the road along the road&#39;s shoulder to look at the object further.  We even got out of the car and crossed the road near a field to look at it further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of a sudden, the &#39;1/4 moon&#39; began to rotate itself slowly so that its flat part was then completely aligned up with the horizon.   The object then started to move slowly across the sky from the SW to SE, and in complete silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my wife and I truly began to feel scared and at risk and decided that we ought to return to our car.  Furthermore we agreed that if it looked like the object was about to head in our direction, that we would quickly get out of there and make a run for it!!!   However, the object completely stopped in the sky and then began to retreat from us, faster, and faster and faster, until it reduced its size to a pinpoint of light and then eventually disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted the local police, the state police, and the local airport to report the incident but they had no corroborating evidence.  Finally I contacted Mr. Hyneck (who was the Air Force Blue Book director at that time) who gave us forms to fill out and mail in to him.   My wife and I indepedently filled out the forms and then compared our observations.  We both,  as common eye-witnesses of this same event, described the event independently and found that our descriptions, regarding the facts and details,  were also in perfect agreement with each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly enough, a check on the position of the moon on the next night showed that the moon was located in the NW,  NOT in the original SW location of the object when first observed.  And this time also the moon looked its normal self.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never again ever saw such a sighting as the above.  In the past, as a Ph.D. scientist, I had always treated news on UFO sightings as mere illusions, mistakened observations, overly eager people, or plain hysteria, or combination of all of the above.   After this eye-witness sighting above, seen together with my wife right by my side (which also remains fresh in our memories after all of these years),  I am now NOT so skeptical or cynical about ufos&#39;s;  and also have no logical explanation whatsoever regarding the event .....  other then that it occurred exactly as related above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I was 7 years old, my brother was 6 and my baby brother was 9 months old. My 14 year old cousin was babysitting us while my mother was out for the evening.  We lived off the lake in Wabasca, AB, Canada.  It was dark outside and I recall seeing many colorful lights hitting the inside of the trailer walls. I found that quite odd because from the direction of the lights, there was no street lights--just the lake and part of my grandmother&#39;s property.  This was a very secluded town, no street lights or airport.  I remember walking over to the window, at the same time I can hear a strange high/low noise.  It was getting louder and louder.  As I looked outside I couldn&#39;t see the stars. I saw a huge black circular craft hovering right above us, approximately 30 feet off the ground--tree top level.  The size of the craft covered my granmother&#39;s house and our trailer--and most of her land. As I looked up and saw the underside of the craft, I recall it being black on the under side--and the colors shining outward were coming from the edges of the craft.  My cousin screamed.  We all panicked and screamed and cried.  I recall the intense noise, it was ear piercing..nothing I did would block the sound that was hurting my ears.  My brother recalls vividly the trailer shaking violently.  He said that this is what scared him the most.  He recalls things falling off the table and shelves.  I recall my cousin running back and forth, and hearing my baby brother crying hard in his walker. I tried to block the sound with a pillow from the couch.  The next thing I recall is my cousin screaming for my brother.  I looked around for him and he was gone.  The trailer door was open.  I looked outside again and saw him standing right under it--in between my grandmother&#39;s home and our trailer.  He looked frozen.  My cousin was screaming his name--he didn&#39;t hear her.  The next thing I remember is sitting on the couch looking out the window--! this time the craft was hoving above the lake about 100 feet in front of my grandmothers property.  I can see it clearly.  It was saucer shaped with a belt of colored lights/rays circling the mid-section of the craft.  The lights were a rectangular shape and they circled in a slow/fast motion.  At the same time there were 3 white beams shining from the underside of the craft.  (at the age of 7 I thought it was landing on the lake).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments later, my mother walked in.  I thought she saw the UFO and came home early--it was too early for her to be home, but it was the scheduled time she was to be home--approx. 10:30.  (I remember being confused because I thought time had sped up---for many years I thought this, until I learned about missing time.)  My cousin was curled up in a ball at the corner of the trailer and my mom was angry and said &#39;whats going on here?  Why is your baby brother crying so hard?&#39;.  She picked him up to console him, but as his scared cries started to slow down, he started to gasp for breathe.  My mom said &#39;whats wrong?, whats going on here?&#39;  We were all still crying and my baby brother&#39;s eyes rolled up and he had a major convultion.  He shook violently and his eyes were white, and we all screamed again.  We scared my mom and she kept calling out my baby brother&#39;s name.  Then he stopped breathing.  My mom cryed and I covered my head with my pillow.  She tried CPR and nothing happened and then my grandmother came over and she couldn&#39;t do anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all ran to my grandmother&#39;s house and they layed my baby brother on the kitchen table.  My aunt entered the room and she managed to revive him, but, she said that she first had to scoop out a thick white foam from his mouth.  Being a nurse, she said &#39;it wasn&#39;t the usual or typical foam that people have when they have convultions or seizures.&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After nearly 5 minutes he was fine.  However he did suffer some minor brain damage due to the lack of oxygen to his brain. That night, he was admitted to the Slave Lake Hospital and the admission date was Oct. 7, 1979.  The explaination the doctor gave to my aunt was &#39;maybe he had a bad reaction to asprin&#39;.  Yet he was not sick and didn&#39;t have asprin that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin has no memory of the encounter, but remembers vividly the events of my brother&#39;s near death.  My brother recalls a few chopped things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After doing interviews with people from the area, I found out that there were over 50 people who witnessed this event--and the hundreds of other sightings and ufo landing spots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The RCMP were called out to my grandma&#39;s house and a train of vehicles followed. I tried to contact the RCMP and get information about this but no one responded to my call and email request.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the interviews I found there are hundreds of unreported sightings, experiences with other paranormal events (related and unrelated to UFO&#39;s and abductions), ufo landing spots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In fact, when I was 9 or 10 years old I remember walking through a field of high grass close the the edge of the lake.  I remember coming to a clearing of burned grass--in a perfect circle.  I remember saying &#39;wow, who did this? how did they burn it in a perfect circle?&#39;  I was told that a UFO landed there as well as dozens of other spots in the community--one being my great aunt&#39;s property.  A year later, I walked over the same spot and found the large dead area.  Nothing grew in that spot again. It was a dead area.  The other landing spots had the same dead spot.  There are still some of these landing spots today.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My girlfriend and I were sitting on the balcony of her second-floor garden apartment in Cranbury, NJ, which overlooked a large open field, at the far edge of which was a wooded area, perhaps 150 yards or so away.  It was late in the evening; perhaps around midnight or shortly thereafter.  We were just hanging out, doing some stargazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I noticed something “funny” – something odd going on in my peripheral vision that drew me to look over to the left portion of my field of vision.  Some of the “stars” were moving. Perhaps 25-30 degrees above the horizon, above the wooded area at the far left end of the field, was a loose cluster of perhaps 6 to 8 lights that were meandering about in the sky, randomly, aimlessly, independently of each other – moving in something approximating “Brownian motion.”  They were a tad larger than the stars – around the size of planets, and like the planets, they didn’t twinkle; they shone with a bright, even, constant white light.  But unlike planets, they were moving about – meandering about, actually.  I pointed this out to my girlfriend, and we both sat there watching this phenomenon for maybe 2 minutes, dumbfounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, something even more curious happened.  All of a sudden, the lights stopped meandering around, and collectively began migrating toward a central point.  They settled into a perfectly circular formation, and remained motionless in this configuration for perhaps a minute.  I counted 8 lights, and they were located at the 8 points of a compass in this motionless circular formation.  Again, the circular formation of lights was around 25 – 30 degrees above the horizon, at the left side of the wooded area at the far end of the field.  My girlfriend and I just sat there, awestruck at what we were looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, something stunning happened.  Suddenly, in an instant, all 8 of these lights suddenly took off radially, away from the center, away from each other, like spokes of a wheel, and shot over the entire distance from the original formation to the distant horizons in probably one second or less, and disappeared from view.  They didn’t accelerate – they went from 0 to probably thousands of miles per hour instantaneously.  This terrified both my girlfriend and me.  We jumped up, said something like “Oh, shit!” or “Oh, my God!” and ran into the apartment and locked the patio door.  For maybe a half an hour, all we could do was jump around and yell, “Oh my God, what the hell was that??!!!”   That is when I knew – absolutely – that we are not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We noticed a saucer shaped craft over a tree and commented on it and watched it. It is imposdsbile to say how large the craft was since the distance was unclear but it appeard to be maybe 50 feet across 25 feet high. IT was hovering and very still. I heard no sound. It had three lights in a triangle formation. The lights would switched places and I could actually see them move as if to occupy the place where the other light had been. We both stared at the object without saynig anything. After what seemed to be a minute or so it shot up at about a 2:00 position very quickly and went out of sight. I thiknk we said, what was that? and we both didn&#39;t know. We had expected to get to the party at right about 9 pm to help set it up. When we got there the party was in full swing and it was 11 pm. We were very surpried and I said to my friend, &#34;do you know it&#39;s 11&#34; or something to that effect and he confused by this as well. Niether of us spoke about it but it (now) seems clear we &#34;lost time.&#34; I have not memory of anything further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

10/1/79 21:00|Buffalo|NY|Light|5-10 sec|Two bright fast-moving star-like objects with one traveling in a zig-zag motion.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42657.html|13|ndxe197910| Two bright fast-moving star-like objects with one traveling in a zig-zag motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed two bright star-like objects (about as bright as the star Sirius) moving from the eastern sky in a west-north-west direction almost directly overhead. These two objects were moving very fast. They were fairly close to each other and traveling at the same speed.  One was moving in a linear path and the other was traveling in a zig-zagging motion (Now what on earth can move like that?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’d say that they covered about 90 degrees of sky in approximately 5 seconds. Seeing this literally sent shivers down my spine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

10/1/79 19:00|Columbia|MD|Rectangle|2 minutes|Large, low-flying, slow moving, silent black rectangle with no lights|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95718.html|15|ndxe197910| Large, low-flying, slow moving, silent black rectangle with no lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has stuck with me for years.  I have always attributed the sighting to the prolific amount of DOD and NSA activities in the immediate area, but its still weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking to my friend&#39;s house after dark, and was rounding the NW end of Wilde Lake, where there&#39;s a walking path.  While walking up a slight incline behind some houses, I had an odd feeling of being watched, and instinctively looked up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was a blank space in the sky. The night was crisp and clear, and many stars were visible.  There was a solid rectangle shape, black, with no lights, and completely silent, blocking everything behind it.  It was way too large to be an aircraft.  I stared at it for 30 seconds or so, it seemed to be almost imperceptibly drifting to the north.  I looked down to get my bearings, and when I looked back up, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/1/79 16:00|Lomita|CA|Disk|20 minutes|Silent disk in afternoon daylight with over twenty witnesses|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64276.html|16|ndxe197910| Silent disk in afternoon daylight with over twenty witnesses<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about 15 at the time, it was in the early afternoon and alot of teenagers and other adults used to hang out on the our street after school. We were all talking when someone shouted &#34;What is that? We all looked towards the west. The major streets were Pacific Coast Highway and Cypress in Southwestern Lomita. To the west is PCH and Crenshaw Blvd in Torrance. The craft was a disk about fifty feet across and was traveling from west to east towards Los Angeles harbor. It made no sound and had no lights. It was traveling very slow, maybe 10 mph. it was approxiamately 500 feet away at an altitude of 100 feet. Everyone started running up the street and watched it cross over the small foothills of Palos Verdes and continue traveling east. It was an incredible sighting with alot of witnesses. A few days later at the store i overheard other local residences talking about it.Torrance airport is less than a mile away and very busy. The tower had to have seen this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/1/79 12:00|Morden, Surrey (UK/England)||Circle|momentary|Spinning metallic object.|5/28/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44118.html|17|ndxe197910| Spinning metallic object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note the date is approximate.  i recall it being autumn as i was wearing my coat whilst in the playground.  i even remember it being my new mauve winter coat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was lunch time which was between 12 and 1pm (so ive put 12.30 as a guestimate).  I was at primary school, first year aged 5, in the playground playing on the slide and remember hearing a low humming sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and high in the air was a ball shaped metallic grey object spinning in the sky.  I don&#39;t remember if i said to other kids to look at the object so i dont know if anyone else saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i told my parents that evening at home and they laughed and put it down to &#34;overactive kiddies imagination&#34; but i stand by what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> someone contacted me through friends reunited where i posted about it to say they had seen a ufo near the school years ago too and my middle nephews dad saw two cigar shaped objects (one blue and one red) over the school as well.  he lived in a house that backed onto the school.  he took a photo but nothing came out when it was developed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ther have been other sightings reported in my local paper over the years of strange things in the skies around here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this is my third submission to this site.  i stand by what i saw and am a completely sane person who works in local government and am about to have my first child.<n>
