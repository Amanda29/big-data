JUST ABOUT DARK WHEN THIS BEAUTIFUL SAUCER SHAPED OBJECT APPEARED OUT OVER THE WATER, WHICH SEEMED SO CLOSE TO US. IT MADE A HUMMING SOUND AND HAD BEAUTIFUL LIGHTS ALL AROUND IT. IT SEEMED SO LONG IT STAYED THERE, BUT I DO BELIEVE IT WAS MAYBE 10 MIN. MY FATHER WAS ALARMED AND GRABBED MY SISTER AND I AND WE WENT UP TO THE ROAD ABOVE THE WATER AND GOT INTO OUR CAR AND AS MY FATHER WAS LEAVING HE WENT UP PAST A PAPER MILL AND PRETTY DESERTED ROAD, AND IT FOLLOWED US UP THE ROAD AND AS MY FR KEPT DRIVING IT FOLLOWED US FOR SOMETIME.  BEING YOUNG I CANT REMEMBER EXACT TIME THAT FOLLOWED. I DO KNOW THAT I WAS NOT SCARED AND KNEW IT WAS NOTHING TO BE SCARED OF. ITS BEAUTY WITH THE LIGHTS HOVERING OVER US MADE ME FEEL WARM INSIDE LIKE A SAFE THING. SO MANY MANY YEARS AGO AND YET I DO WONDER WHY NOTHING MORE HAS BEEN DONE ABOUT ALL OF THE SIGHTINGS. I FELT SO GOOD TO BEABLE TO HAVE BEEN A WITNESS TO THIS. OF COURSE AS A CHILD IT APPEARED VERY LARGE AND BEAUTIFUL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It moved slowly around a small area for about ten minutes, and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were terrified, but we didn’t tell anyone what we’d seen, because we weren’t supposed to be alone in the ball field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course over the years, we shared the story, but I decided it’s time to make an official report.<n>

They moved in formations which regularly changed, though they were clearly together.  They were first observed by this writer; I was 19 at the time, working full time while living at my parents&#39; home.  Observing the phenomena with me that night was my girlfriend, age 20, and a family friend, a man in his late 20&#39;s. I have reported this information by e-mail to your director&#39;s office.  I can be contacted by e-mail or regular postal mail.<n>
