I know it was a Sunday evening as the rest of our family were inside watching Ed Sullivan at the time and mom wanted us to get in the habit of coming in early as school was starting soon. In the duration of playing I noticed a funny orange star right beside the full moon. When I looked up again there appeared to be two moons except one was very blood orange in colour. When I caught my brother&#39;s attention to look at the other moon this object (within fractions of a second) was hovering over us the size two foot ball feilds. The ground and everything was illuminating an orange colour. My brother said quick go get mom, and within a fraction of a second it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

8/20/65 22:00|Rutland|MA|Cigar|5 minutes|No longer a bright white, but had turned to a radiant pulsating red hue.|7/26/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23555.html|2|ndxe196508| No longer a bright white, but had turned to a radiant pulsating red hue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event happened when I was 20 years old, around 10 pm, it was late summer or early fall 1965.  I have only told a few people about this incident.  The eyewitness who was with me would not talk to anyone about this, not even to me the day after the occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiancés cousin and I were driving home from Holden.  Instead of taking me home the usual way, we drove north down Route 68 towards Hubbardston.  I remember this night clearly, ----- was driving his mothers 1962 Thunderbird, we were just gabbing, laughing and having a good time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Route 68 was not heavily populated then, as it is now.  The road was and is a very long, straight and wide paved two-lane highway.  There were not very many houses back then, just a few scattered here and there.  It was about five or six miles until we would arrive at the junction of Route 56 and Route 68.  My house was located on Route 56 in Rutland and we would have to back track south on 56 for a mile to reach my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having driven roughly 3 miles down Route 68 past the Rutland town line, heading towards the town of Hubbardston, while I was looking at the clear night sky through the passenger side windshield, I noticed a very bright star; only this star was getting larger with every passing second.    I yelled at ----- to look up, quick!  By that time it was huge and very bright.  He said, &#34;What the H--- is it?&#34;  I couldn’t even speak at this point and just kept watching the object, until it was huge and hovering over the treetops approximately 3 tenths of a mile away in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was no longer a bright white, but had turned to a radiant pulsating red.  I am sure that it was saucer in shape, but looked much like a huge cigar, floating in a falling leaf like movement, gliding from left to right, then up and down and side to side again and so on, altering from red to a blazing blue hue.  This went on for about 5 minutes.  From our perspective the size of the object appeared to be the size of a large Greyhound bus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were maybe three or four cars behind us that slowed down when we did.  We pulled over and stopped on the soft shoulder, then got out of the car, as a couple of other cars passed us.  But two or three vehicles stopped in back of us and were watching, also, no one said a word, we all just watched.  So there were other observers, but I don’t know who they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it finally stopped hovering the object turned intense white again and flew off at an incredible speed into the night sky, until it was only a speck as when I had first noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is one thing that I took note of; the place where the object was hovering was directly over the power lines that cross Route 68.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so odd, no one that I can remember said anything, and everybody just got back into his or her cars and drove off, slowly.  ----- and I talked about it a little, but when I saw him the next day, he did not want to talk about it at all.  A few years later when he came to visit my husband and me, I brought our unidentified flying object experience up to him and he almost denied ever seeing such a thing.  I know I will never forget, not ever! In case you are wondering, there was no alcohol, or drugs of any kind involved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for this Web Site, I sort of feel relieved after telling my story.  I don’t fell so crazy after reading some other peoples experiences.  This is the first time that I have ever reported this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate.

We let the dog off|10/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25728.html|3|ndxe196508| I was 10 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I walked the dog to the Parade Ground, an annex of Prospect Park, Brooklyn, NY. We let the dog off the leash in the NW baseball field, and proceeded to muse the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To our left, I saw what first looked like a submarine in the sky, not a whole lot higher than six storeys. I asked my mother if she was seeing what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this huge dark grey cylinder, as close as grey can be to black, float silently over us, proceeding west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it close enough to emphatically state that if there was any semblance of  markings, or the fusilage beneath a blimp-type airship, I would have seen it. There were no windows, gondola beneath, no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the length of it finally passed, I got up and ran to see the back and other side of it. At the back, there was an aperture - memory dosen&#39;t serve whether it was an arch or square or circular. But the other side of the cylinder&#39;s length was as unremarkable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived at at least 1200 feet in length from looking at maps of Brooklyn. In its entirety, the cylinder from my point of view stretched from Buckinham Road to Stratford Road - 1200 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I compared our obsevation many times over the years. She says she saw a bulge in the center, thus in her eyes a cigar-shaped ufo. I saw a perfect cylinder, with a round nose and tail, the aperature issue kind of fuzzy to be sure enough to report upon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only time I felt apprehension was when I saw the opening at the end of the cylinder. I thought I might be discovered seeing something I wasn&#39;t meant to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one thing we agree on is the hardest to describe. We both saw a dark, dark grey cylinder. We saw dark, looking at the side that floated past us, yet something told us there was light behind it, as if backlit. When I peered at the aperature, it was stone black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is years later, and thanks to the internet, I searched for accounts of cylinder sightings, and it brought me here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

8/20/65 20:30|New York City (Brooklyn)|NY|Cylinder|minutes|1965 Dark Grey Cylinder UFO Updated Statement|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49816.html|4|ndxe196508| 1965 Dark Grey Cylinder UFO Updated Statement<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wanted to offer an updated version, the original being:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25728.html  &#34;Every now and then, my mother and I would take our dog on his night walk to the Parade Ground, a flat park of baseball and football fields.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went there because at the time it was being renovated, and the fields were being partitioned and fenced. This gave us some confidence to allow the dog off the leash to run free for a change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Parade Ground is just across Parkside Avenue from Prospect Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is August, 1965. I am ten years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dog was having a good run, and once we saw that he wasn&#39;t about to run off completely, we relaxed and gazed upwards to view the night sky, trying to find various constellations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In those days, the street lights in Brooklyn emitted a white light, and not the beige-looking type now in use. If you went to a park, you could get a decent view of the stars, but of course not anywhere near the view if you were upstate in deep woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, as I looked to the left of me, I saw what I first mentally equated as a submarine perhaps two storeys off the ground higher than the six storey buildings beneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Hey Mom, do you see what I see?&#34; She did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here comes this thing, slow and steady and silent. It is huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is dark grey - not &#34;battleship grey,&#34; but as grey as can be before you rule it black. There is no shine to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The front of it was round; I&#39;d seen pictures of submarines, and that is what came to mind. It is actually shaped more like a very long medicine capsule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it  proceeded to float past us, we observed its right side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is solid. It is a perfect and very long dark grey cylinder, and it just keeps coming very slowly and steadily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously, we can&#39;t see the top of it, but so far, we see that even though it is almost black, we sense a light behind the darkness. This does not make sense, as my mother and I later reckoned. The best I can come up with is that my eyes saw dark grey, but my mind knew the cylinder was emitting light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dark light!  This was no blimp. No lights. No sound. No windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No gondola beneath. No visible markings. No nothing! It is just a cylinder 300 feet longer than the Intrepid aircraft carrier now docked in the Hudson River going by!  This thing was so huge, that even from the height above me, (200 Feet?) it was clearly visible; visible enough to see even the slightest imperfection clearly, if it had any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time, we are not in any panic. We are unusually serene. As if it&#39;s no big deal somehow. Maybe we were in a stupor beyond awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, the end of the ship passes. I ran to see the back of it. I see it is as round as the front with an opening in the center. To this day, I&#39;m not sure if it was square or arch-like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am convinced that at least the bottom of the opening in the back of it was flat, so it was square or arched. I remember thinking that 3 buses could easily drive inside at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the other hand, I&#39;ve seen jets low to the ground on approach to JFK Airport, and thought that &#34;my&#34; cylinder was at least 3 times wider at the same height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the only time I experience apprehension. I worry for a moment that whoever is flying this cylinder might see me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to a to where I could see the other side of the cylinder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is exactly as perfect and unremarkable as the other side and the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been struggling with my memories for years as to whether there was a single tiny light, blue or red atop the opening in the back. I add this item, but I am not sure. Inside the opening it is absolutely pitch black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cylinder was in the order of 1200 feet long. I did not know this at the time. When I saw the cylinder completely, it was &#34;crossing&#34; Stratford Road, and the back of it was at Buckinham Road. The distance between these streets on Caton Avenue according to street maps is about 1200 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rejoined my mother in the original field, and we watched this thing float over the Prospect Park POLICE STATION, heading west until it faded from sight about half a mile west of the Parade Ground. No newspaper, radio, or TV station mentioned it. For that matter, we didn&#39;t even tell my father!  As I first accessed the Internet, I ran a search for &#34;cylinder ufo,&#34; and plenty of links came up. Even pictures! I wasn&#39;t too surprised, because I know damn well what I saw was real, and other people MUST have seen something as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told some close friends. They gave me the jaundiced eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could hardly blame them. I guess its just one of those things one must see to believe.&#34;  Notes:  The Cylinder crossed over Parade Place, and was equidistant between Woodruff and Crooke Avenues.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Cylinder was about 1/4 the width of the Parade Ground, and travelling in a straight line over the road that runs nearly the length of the park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why these single lane streets are designated Avenues is a mystery to me, especially Crooke Avenue, which runs only two blocks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Modern street maps have re-named Buckingham Road as East 16th street. The equivalent for Stratford Road would be East 11th Street, so by my point of view the cylinder was at least five blocks in length. I need to remark that some internet-based street maps would put the length of the cylinder at 1500-1700 feet. I really should go back there and take measurements myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/20/65 19:00|Charleston|SC|Sphere|30 seconds|Sphere of fire with multiple course changes of 15 degrees in ZERO TIME.  6 course changes, 30 seconds.|1/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106480.html|5|ndxe196508| Sphere of fire with multiple course changes of 15 degrees in ZERO TIME.  6 course changes, 30 seconds<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was coming home from  a cub scouts den meeting, alone…so was about 9 yrs old.  On bicycle. Location:  just outside of Charleston AFB, housing dev.  Called Hunly Park (all gone now).  State road (think SR 626) was edge of houses, then pine forest,  Then AFB.  Never allowed into that forest, was scared, could hear shooting of hunters, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened either in the spring, or the late summer after the heat, was very temperate climate.  At dusk.  Sky to east was indigo blue, sky to west was tangerine orange.  NO CLOUDS.  And no stars yet.  Maybe one or two, but no stars for the most part.  Wasn’t that dark yet.  For some reason, 50 yrs ago everyone came home at same time, went in to dinner same time, did homework, took bath, went to bed same time.  I was OUT when everyone else was “in”, so totally alone.  No cars in the development, don’t remember any cars on the state road that I could see from my stopping point on the bike.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I passed a “ditch” that I liked to play in (young boy) I looked to the left (east, darkest part of sky) so I think that’s how I saw this thing in the sky that was actually a little BEHIND my casual forward facing field of view for riding a bike.  Road was empty, safety not top of mind, so glancing around, saw this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stopped the bike, put feet on ground, watched it.  This thing was literally a FIRE BALL.  I mean it was close, (estimate 1,000 to 5,000 ft up).  I went back as an adult 35 yrs later, everything looked SMALLER, so, trying to correct for youthful “point of view” perceptions.  If I extended my hand, and placed the object between my thumb and forefinger, it would have been a little smaller than a dime held at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving from EAST to WEST, heading directly towards the Air Force Base air space.   There was NO SMOKE.  I could see the actual DEFINITION of flames covering this ROUND, GLOBULAR object….like a rubber ball on fire…so it wasn’t MILES high.  Another thing that makes me feel it was fairly low was that as it CHANGED COURSE, very abruptly, multiple times, with NO curvature or deceleration; those changes were immediately reflected in my perception of the “ground” it covered between changes in direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say that the changes by degrees were about10-15 degrees, in opposing directions, from left to right.  It made about 6 course changes in the 30 seconds it was visible to me, as it passed almost directly overhead.  Another way to say how I calculate that course deviation, is that as it was directly overhead, and it zigged and zagged band and forth, if it had STAYED on one of those new headings, it would have passed out of sight on the horizon about 10 to 15 degrees DIFFERENCE from the FIRST HEADING of my 360 circular view of the horizon all around me, so I think that means a 10 to 15 degree change in course heading?  As I got older and studied, I learned about INERTIA, and how something of mass CAN’T INSTANTLY change direction without the expenditure of enormous amounts of energy to overcome inertia.  The changes in direction, the zig and zag back and forth of its’ direction of travel, was INSTANT. Imagine the old original video game PONG.  Like ping pong. Remember how you could play with TWO paddles, hit the white dot on the screen with your back paddle, and as the white dot proceeded towards the other side of the screen, you could place your FRONT paddle in the path of the dot and it would INSTANTLY continue forward on a different “heading”?  So, imagine an INVISIBLE pong paddle that this fireball passed through, about 6 times in 30 seconds, covering a little more than 60% of my overhead view (I saw it when it was about 40% already traversed the airspace of the Eastern horizon, heading to the Western Horizon), each time it passes through this point, it changes heading by 15 degrees with ! no “curving”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is another reason I felt it was fairly low.  If it had covered 60% of the sky from east to west, almost directly overhead, in 30 seconds, and been WAY HIGH, I would not have been able to see FLAMES well defined, licking along the surface of this globe.  The “speed” and distance would have smeared my perception of flames into a single color, and I’m sure a much higher speed needed to travel the “distance’ to the horizon in 30 seconds or less would have produced some kind of trail of debris and a visual TAIL of fire……this was not the case. I could SEE this thing was a GLOBE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made NO SOUND.  There was no smoke trail.  The flames were “licking” to the rear of the direction of travel, as though the air itself was sweeping the flames to the rear, but the “rear” of the ball, as it travelled, was not distorted into a TAIL of fire….it was ROUND, it was completely covered in flames (red, yellow, orange).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel it was fairly low because the forward momentum of an object traveling VERY HIGH and there fore VERY FAST to cover the sky so quickly would have taken an IMPOSSIBLE amount of energy to change direction almost INSTANTANEOUSLY 5 to 6 times in 30 seconds, and that also the PERCIEVED changes in direction and the DEGREES of travel between changes in direction would have been MUCH MORE, and therefore even less possible to be happening.  Very hard to put into words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it “descend” over the pine forest to the WEST, heading into the sunset, directly towards Charleston AFB air space, it seemed to be descending, not just moving beyond my view of horizon. Imagine a small plane, only 5,000 feet up, flying almost directly overhead, and heading to the next nearby town.  As it got farther away, it would LOOK like it was descending, when it might only be flying LOW and at a constant altitude.  It’s just YOUR POINT OF VIEW from the ground that makes it look like it’s getting “lower” as it passes over trees that are 100 feet away from you across a road you are on, and the highway adjacent to it (that’s why the tree tops of these pine trees (less than 20 feet tall) were 100 feet from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I figured, “this thing is going to HIT THE GROUND!”.  So I literally braced my feet on the ground, waiting for the inevitable FLASH in the sky, rumble in the air, earthquake, whatever a 9 yr old would think of as a BIG CRASH result……and I waited, and waited, and it NEVER came.  No flash, no sound, no vibration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around (now the sighting was 3 minutes old, what I saw, and the wait for a crash). NOT A SOUL to be seen.  Everybody had their lights on, just finishing up dinner, watching the evening news, whatever.  No kids out, since they had no business outside. All the people in this housing development were YOUNG military, with YOUNG kids.  Most kids were under 10 yrs old, so no playing outside after dinner.  There was no high school (was K-5th grade school nearby I attended).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself “Nobody will believe what I just saw”.  I went home, didn’t tell my mom, or either of my brothers what I saw.  I developed an INTENSE interest in UFO’s after this, driven by my sighting and what happened about 18 months later… there was a ruckus on my street with dogs barking, pounding footsteps and shouting outside, our walls literally SHOOK as several people STAMPEDED by our front yard.  They were young military men (neighbors in their early 20’s) who claimed to see 3 UFO’s just 200 feet from our house, zipping ALONG that state highway next to the development.  They said there were two balls of light coming from one direction, one ball of light from the opposite direction (they said one was red, one was white, one was blue).  They said the single ball of light passed between the other two lights, they all then swooped up into the sky, turned white, and remained stationary pretending to be stars.  I must say, as a child, this seemed exciting, but differed A LOT from what I experienced, but I do remember these guys being REALLY SINCERELY excited, and that the man with the yard that abutted the state highway had hunting hounds in his yard, and they were going CRAZY!  He came out with his gun, thinking somebody was harassing his dogs, or an animal (possibly rabid) had come near them…..just as these 3 young adults came thundering onto his property (small yards, really) yelling LOOK UP LOOK UP!  At which point he did and I recall him saying he thought he saw “some lights moving” that he agreed “got lost” in the stars.  I had run out and followed whoever had thundered past our house, not knowing what was going on, and seeing a man with a gun confronting other men who were panting and excited and pointing at the sky made me afraid, so I saw this, heard their comments and sincerity, and went right back home.  It was unsettling, and I had nothing to add, since I saw NOTHING.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I find it hard to believe that Charleston AFB has no knowledge of this incredible, fiery ball of matter that changed direction with no “curving”…simply immediately changed course.  Also no sound, no smoke, and no GIANT CRASH I was expecting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We saw a light coming down a farmers gravel road (we were concerned because we thought it might be the police ~ we had alcohol in the car) and watched it closely. It seemed strange, one white ,bright light hovering above the road.  It was extremely dark (no moon that night) and it was unnervingly quiet.  It continued to move forward towards us (we were off the road) still 25 feet away.  It was the size of a beachball (est.) and had no sound, moving slowly (est 20 mph).  We became curious and jumped into the car and drove out to it.  As soon as we got close it moved backwards, without turning, very quickly, too quickly for any object what we were aware of.  It was not a motorcycle (no sound), it was not a car (no taillights, ability to turn 180 immediately) and it certainly wasn&#39;t any vehicle in production in 1965 or now that could have manevoured like that. The driver of the car became really worried and frightened, he immediately turn the car around and took off.  It started to follow us, he sped up 110+ mph on the straight road and it was able to keep up with us for some time before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

We had been partying with loud rock and roll music with our car doors open, when someone yelled &#34;look!&#34;, pointing up in the sky.   We looked up and there in the sky was this huge red orb.  It was hard to tell how close.  I thought it actually looked like a planet ~ I quickly sought out the moon.  The moon was clearly visible a great distance from the object.  The reason the orb looked planetlike was because it was fiery red, glowing, opaque and had something around it, like a grey cloud or through it. Fortunately or unfortunately it just hung there.  It made no sound, it didn&#39;t move.  We watched for maybe 1/2 hour, then people got worried, jumped in their cars and we all drove off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

At first we thought it was a helicopter until it started maneuvering unlike anything we had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a light in the sky.  The light was an orange/red color.  I always thought the color looked like a window that had an oil lantern burning inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could fly very slow and even stop and hover.  It could take off at high speed and then stop immediately.  It could go straight up to very high altitude and then stop or make 90 degree turns at speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It mostly just went very slow at low attitude like it was searching for something.  It would sometimes blink off and immediately back on somewhere far away.  We could see for miles and miles from where we were as we watched it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had stopped on the country road and were just watching it for maybe an hour when it came to a stop down the road we were on.  The driver then said I am going to catch it and took off as fast as the car would go toward it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light just blinked off and then back on right in front of us.  The light just filled up the windshield and car and surrounding area with its bright illumination and scared all of us greatly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The driver put the car in reverse well before we stopped and floored it to try and get away from it and we finally started going backward at high speed.  The light blinked off and back on in another location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all decided that the device was just warning us off and we took the hint.  We watched a little longer than went home.  I need to mention that the device made no noise at all and of course could defy our laws of physics as it flew around the county side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not tell anyone about this for a couple of reasons.  People that reported UFO’s were nuts and made fun of back in those days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked in the newspaper the next day to see if anyone had reported anything but there was no news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later in the day, the Wichita Falls, TX, rRadio station reported on the news that a truck driver reported a UFO in the Red River area.  This was maybe 40 miles from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The saucer had about 5 random blinking red lights around the perimeter and there were portals that you could almost imagine objects in back of (not operators).  The craft was a metallic look to it and definitely solid.  The only thing &#34;non-solid&#34; about it was that on the bottom it had a luminous surface that looked like dense fog of a whitish nature.  I estimate it to be 200 ft high and of 75 ft diameter.  It made absolutely no noise and was slowly rotating (at least the top half).

8/15/65 22:00|Roseville|MI|Disk|5-10 minutes|Mother and daughter have a close encounter with a slow, low classic saucer.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55899.html|11|ndxe196508| Mother and daughter have a close encounter with a slow, low classic saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is an incident that happened to my mother and sister around August 1965. I&#39;m guessing at the date, but my mom was teaching my sister to drive so I believe it was the autumn before my sister turned 16.  I would be able to ask my sister to verify the year and month if the researchers here would like me to.  Neither my sister nor my mother ever officially reported this sighting to anyone, (outside of family and friends) at any time, but, even after all these years, I&#39;ve decided it should be on the record.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Roseville, Michigan, near Detroit. It was late evening, maybe 10 or 11pm. Because there was very little traffic my mother thought it would be a good time to have my sister practice her driving. My sister drove around on some side streets near our home then drove toward a near-by school, Eastland Jr. High, to practice parking in their lot. As they approached, my mother suddenly noticed a large, metallic &#34;saucer&#34;, with rectangular windows hovering very low over the school and parking lot. It was lit up inside. My mother yelled to my sister to stop the car. My sister hadn&#39;t yet seen the UFO and assumed she was about to hit an animal or something so she slammed on the brakes. My mother jumped out of the car and walked toward the craft. When my sister got out of the car she spied it and grabbed my mother&#39;s arm trying to stop her from getting closer. My sister kept saying, &#34;what is it?&#34;, my mom kept saying, &#34;You can see it, you tell me.&#34; My mom then told my sister to go knock on the door of a near-by house to try to get another witness but my sister refused to leave her side. My mother said it made no noise, my sister says she heard a low hum. My sister says she saw a &#34;shadowy&#34; figure in one of the windows as it slowly rotated, my mother insists there was no figure. After hovering there for several minutes, it started to slowly move away.  My mother told my sister to get back in the car, and with my mother now at the wheel they tried to follow the UFO. It finally disappeared behind some trees. My mother said that was the last time they saw it, my sister said she actually saw it zoom up into the sky and disappear into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think they also reported an antenna with a light on it attached between a couple of the windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They both repeated this story to me and others many times over the years. They always completely agreed about all the main parts of the story. They always disagreed about only these three things; the figure, the hum and the zooming away. Their stories never wavered dispite a falling out that had them not speaking for years. My mother passed away in 1995 but my sister still tells the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other thing to note about this. One day in 1979 I brought my mother her mail. It included the April edition of OMNI magazine which my mother subscribed to. There was a drawing of UFO&#39;s on the cover. As my mother flipped through the magazine she suddenly said &#34;Oh my God, that&#39;s it!&#34;. She showed me a picture then called my sister&#39;s husband (they weren&#39;t speaking during this time) and told him to go buy the magazine and give it to my sister. An hour or so later my sister called and actually talked to my mother about the photo. They both agree this was what they saw. I have my mom&#39;s copy of the magazine still but it&#39;s packed away somewhere. I can find it and pinpoint the exact page and picture if asked or scan and email it. If I remember correctly, that photo was said to have been taken around the same year and maybe in the same area that they saw the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

8/15/65 20:45|Oneonta|NY|Oval|10 minutes|Large Illuminated Oval Disk -  Oneonta NY - 1965|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87909.html|13|ndxe196508| Large Illuminated Oval Disk -  Oneonta NY - 1965<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of respect for Peter Davenport and for posterity, I am now recording my sighting of an extraterrestrial craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event happened in the late summer of 1965 just prior to returning to high school, I am fairly confident the month was August, however I do not remember the day, I suspect the it was a Friday.  I was 15 years old at the time, I am now 61 years of age.  This event was later confirmed by hypnosis as a contact event and certain details of this event which I did not consciously remember were uncovered and many years later corroborated by my friend L.V. who accompanied me the evening of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend L.V. and myself had spent the evening at the movie theater.  The show lasted approximately 1 1/2-2 hours and started at around 7pm.  It was around 9pm when the movie got out and we walked home up Main Street. The walking trip home was approximately 30 minutes.  I remember that I didn&#39;t want to go to the movie that evening but my friend insisted and afterward I was very anxious to get home.  I remember I had a sense of dread walking home, I was on edge.  As we approached the street where my friend was to turn down in order to go home, leaving me alone to walk the rest of the way to my house, something happened which caused an argument between my friend and myself.  I consciously could not remember what it was (explained below).  The argument caused us to not speak to each other for several weeks.  What I consciously remember is I angrily walked off leaving her on her way as I proceeded home.  As I approached the turn off to my street approximately 2 blocks away, I b! egan to hear a very peculiar noise which grew louder and louder the further I walked.  The sound was akin to something metallic revolving very fast which I attributed to the axle of a tractor trailer in the distance.  I kept expecting to see traffic on the street but oddly there was none -- not one car passed the entire time, yet the sound continued increasing in volume.  I realized I couldn&#39;t determine which direction the sound was coming from -- it sounded as if it was coming from all directions. The sound took on the tone of what is described as &#39;metallic bees&#39; but what was remarkable is there were no other sounds -- nothing -- no crickets, no traffic -- just the noise.  It frightened me a great deal as I picked up my pace anxious to get home.  When I reached the corner of my street, the sound became intense and I realized it was coming from directly behind me.  I swung around and there in the air just above house top level was an oval-shaped brightly glowing disk hoveri! ng above Main Street.  It was arc welder white with swirls of ! various scintillating colors and almost hurt the eyes to look at it.    It was approximately 40 degrees above the horizon and above house top level.  At arms distance the craft was approximately 32&#34;.  It was as wide as a Victorian house.  It was approximately 6 times wider than it was thick.  When I first saw the craft it has been moving very slowly in a southward direction and gave the impression that it was following behind me as I walked up the street.  Immediately after I turned around and saw it, the sound became extremely intense and it sped up, I could see it go behind a stand of tall spruce trees traveling parallel to the ground, I lost sight of it behind the houses for a few seconds, to see it emerge at the end of the street where there was a large drop off.  It arched skyward and I watched it until it disappeared among the stars.  The sound I had heard dissipated the further the craft went away from me.   Afterward, I ran directly to my house screaming to my mother that th! ere was something strange in the sky.  I noted the time to be 10 minutes to eleven p.m. after my mother commented that I was late returning home -- which was more than an hour later than it should have been. I had no explanation for the time lapse other than my friend and I spent some time talking before she went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later I had a reoccurring dream where my friend L.V. and I had an argument about a UFO we both had seen which first appeared as a &#34;shooting star&#34; that approached us from behind.  It stopped dead in the air and dropped at a right angle to the ground behind some trees in a near by park.  In my dream my friend insisted it was a UFO and I vehemently denied it and we argued about it.  She walked off in a huff.  I never attributed this dream as relative to the conscious sighting described above.  In 1995 under hypnosis, 30 years after the conscious event described above,  I recalled the conscious sighting event to be the end of a contact experience where &#39;shooting star&#39; dream was the beginning of the contact event.  The unremembered contact event happened in the park where L.V. and I had seen the &#39;shooting star&#39;  drop to the ground. Under hypnosis, I witnessed a large oval craft on the ground and its occupants.  I&#39;m not going to go into all the details of this hypnosis sessi! on here, except to say that there was one 5&#39; tall grey being with large black eyes which politely led me to the sitting craft where I met many other beings which appeared as extremely thin bug-like mantis creatures with whitish skin and very large black eyes.  They were non hostile and the event seemed to be some sort of meeting which I was not able to recall the details of under hypnosis.  I did recall under hypnosis that the beings were very amused that I couldn&#39;t figure out what they were and they had been given me information which was extremely important that I would remember later. It is notable that this hypnosis session was more than 20 years after I&#39;d lost contact  with my friend L. V. However ironically a few years after the hypnosis session I accidentally met her again.  When we saw each other at a distance, we nearly ran to each other saying we had to talk -- and we both knew what we had to talk about.  L.V. confirmed that she consciously remembered the &#39;shooting star&#39; and that was the source of the argument the night of the sighting.  L.V. also disclosed that a few days after this event she and another friend mutually had another sighting of their! own of a large glowing craft where there was about 10 minutes missing time experience and she and the other girl found themselves in a different location several blocks away from the location of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for allowing me to record my sighting.  Hopefully it will be of benefit to others.  After a life time of pondering various unusual events in my life, I have come to the conclusion that we are definitely not alone in the Universe and the entities which have made contact with human beings are benign, highly advanced and represent civilizations billion of years older and wiser than human beings.  I am no longer fearful of these events or the unknown in the Universe.  My only wish is that humanity will be able to some day achieve the technological expertise to peacefully traverse the stars and in turn welcome meeting other sentient extraterrestrial races rather than spend their time and resources killing life here on Earth.  Life is precious in the Universe, and that is a lesson human beings have yet to learn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

My father and I (about 12 yrs old at the time) went out to get into the car. We were waiting for my mother to come out of the house. We had not yet got into the car when a huge round white light swooped down and stopped about 30ft in the air for a short time, then, with lightening speed, flew off. It didn&#39;t have a straight line exit, and the light, though very bright white, did not omit surrounding light from it&#39;s source.  My father said &#34;what was that?  I stated I did not know.  Only my father and I observed to unknown light. Even though it has been many years since then, we still talk about it and wonder if we wittnessed the sighting of a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object lit up the area as if it were early dawn, tree frogs became earily silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object was directly in front of my tent opening, it stopped for perhaps 4 or 5 seconds and then decended steadily in at a 45 degree angle behind the shale bluff. The light then suddenly went out at about the time one might have expected it to have &#34;landed&#34; on the other side of the bluff. The light did not fade out, but went off as if someone had flipped a switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the object is difficult to determine, but gauging from the the size of the trees in the area and the short distance to the bluff, I would estimate it as being somewhere between 50 to 75 feet across.

The cadre got us ready to go and yelling gung-ho style, then surprised us recruits with a sudden firing of 3, 30-caliber machine guns.  The tracers flew from right-to-left over the range where we were shortly to crawl over.  During that live fire, I noticed the track of the tracer rounds as they hit into the rocks to our left.  Some of the rounds richocheted up and away from our location where I could discern what appeared to be the ridge line, estimating 60-100 feet up and 1000 yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the machine-gun fire stopped, and each of us recruits became silent in awe of what we had seen, and extremely scared at what we knew were to undergo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lecture, to a now quiet audience, continued.  A few minutes, later, my eyes returned back to where the tracer rounds had been landing.  I noticed the stars over and behind what I thought was the ridge of a hill no higher than 100 feet, but still about a thousand yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when I noticed the first light come over the ridge; no noise, nothing to overcome the voice of the person presenting instruction.  I had expected to hear a helicopter but heard no noise.  The light slowly drifted above the ridge line, I believe amber in color.  When the second light appeared, I still expected to hear a helicopter but there was no noise but the voice of the lecture.  If was about the time that the final light of the triangle made it over the ridge.  It should have been a helicopter!  But no, it began to &#34;turn&#34;, more of a slow rotation, as it might have been &#34;peeking&#34; over the ridge.  The &#34;craft&#34; was at an estimated &#34;pitch&#34; of 40-50 degrees as if it had followed some contour up to and over the ridge.  If I was to estimate its size based on its distance from me, I would say 60 feet on a side, and not quite equilateral; The angle between the two &#34;forward wing edges&#34; might have been about 50-60 degrees. I do not know what was over, or what it looked like over the ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the entire &#34;craft&#34; broke the ridge line, was when I noticed its triangurlar shape as a black triangle blocking of the stars in the background.  It continued to quietly rotate/turn back and down behind the ridge.  None of the approximately 100 recruits I was with made any sign of having seen the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was eighteen years old at the time, fresh out of high school, no job, just entering the military so that they would not draft me.  Following my basic training, I went to work as a radio-specialist in the Army Security Agency and finished my military career three years and 11 months later.  No more UFOs after that....<n> <n><n> <n><n> This inforamtion was provided to support, and possbily time, a previously posted witnessing of a &#34;round&#34; object between 1965 and 1967 in the same area.

It shot past us and we felt no air current off it and we saw no ripple on the ocean from it&#39;s passing.As it was climbing away from us,no noise at all.Nothing, like we were deaf.How&#39;s this possible? We stared up for lights,propulsion,anything.We saw no more,heard no more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can only say it was like we were seeing it in a dream but we were wide awake and backed each other up what we had just seen only feet away lit up.In my mind I can see it as clear as the night we saw it.My father is now 79 years old and we talk about it every once in a while.We were very lucky to be standing at the right place at the right time.We eventually moved down the beach to the north into darkness and watched the comet&#39;s crash into the horizon of the ocean as the sun rose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an eventful night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

At intermission time a huge disk with lights around the edge suddenly appeared to hover above the screen.  It was fairly low, but high enough that we had to bend our heads down to see it through our front windshield.  My husband and were pointing and wondering when I looked around and saw others in cars nearby also looking and pointing.  It stayed there for about 2 minutes and then banked off for about 2 or 3 seconds before just disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always wondered about it and tell the story once in a while. I recently told it to my 8 year old grandson. When he asked me what it was doing there, I said, &#34;Good question, I&#39;ve always wondered that.&#34;  Then I added that I thought it might have beamed something into my stomach, as I was about 6 months pregnant at the time, and after his mother was born her skin &#34;buzzed.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired school teacher.  I decided to do a search for sightings in Culver City around this date to see if anyone else saw this and wrote about it.  I found nothing but did find several stories about drive-in theatres.  Thought I&#39;d tell you.  Have you ever heard of buzzing skin?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The date,as best as I can remember was early Aug. of 1975. I was 10 years old. This sighting occurred in my home town Hollis New Hampshire, which bordered the #1 city in the country to live in at the time, Nashaua N.H. Hollis sits a little higher in elevation than Nashaua which gave us a clear shot of the whole city of Nashaua including the municipal airport, and it was common to see planes take off and land at night. We must have been 4 miles away, I would quite frequently watch the planes as they made there approach to land, but this evening and the next several nights to follow changed me and are etched in my memory FOREVER...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nashaua sat southeast of our yard and at night the lights from the city cast a glow over it, above which was the glow from the setting sun and above that the dark of space. The planes were never very high, hardly ever over the glow of the city. And you could easily make out the strobe on them, they had a predictable path and were easy to identify. The objects we saw were coming in at a very high speed from the black of space, from out of the star field. They were circular luminescent spheres and seamed to arrive in two&#39;s or three&#39;s or more. They chased each other performing remarkable maneuvers, reversing direction at speeds that would have turned any human being into a puddle. Then all of a sudden they would take off in different directions at such a speed you could not track them with your eye. I ran inside and got my parents out to look, they were speechless. After a wile the neighbor kids saw us looking and came over, we all stood there staring not saying a word. Soon after the two younger neighbor boys arrived they bolted home and returned with there brother and parents in tow. Now there were 8 of us all looking at the same objects. To this day I have never seen anything like them. This continued for about a week, it eventually became almost normal to see them each night, and soon my interest waned and when I remembered to look again they were gone. I did watch them for at least 5 or 6 nights in a row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for all the excellent work you do Mr. Davenport I always look forward to hearing you on C2C &amp; Rense. And thanks to your WebMaster as well Mr. Stepien great site easy to nav. and well laid out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates both 1965 and 1975 as the year of the sighting.  We have written her, requesting the correct date.  Many UFO sightings occurred in New Hampshire during the spring and summer of 1965.  The event is still unexplained.  PD))<n>

It was several miles to the north so we had a side view as it leveled off and slowed way down. It was moving in a westerly direction at approximately two or three thousand feet. It made no sound and the sky was clear and very dark. It got smaller as it flew to- ward the west at several hundred miles per hour. We lost sight after two minutes when it was hidden by the trees on the horizon.<n>

When I got out of bed and went to the window I saw a saucer hovering about fifty feet off the ground, and about a eighty yards away. It had lights around its center and several portholes.  I could see the interior of the craft but with no real detail. My sister said she saw a man, but I never saw anything in the windows. The craft was smooth, with no visible breaks in its surface, it had no antenna, no landing gear, no intakes, or exhaust ports.  The only activity was in the lights around the center of the craft.  After a while the craft moved off to the north west at about a forty five degree angle.  As for how fast it was moving I am not sure.  When it first started to move it seemed slow, but then picked up speed quickly.  I would like to give more information, but after all this time I guess anything else would be speculation on my part. I would like to hear from anyone else that saw anything or remembers anything during that time frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We heard branches break or a crackling sound as if some were being burned up on contact. When it landed about 60 yards or so from us, the light or  glow ceased. However, we heard an earthly sound that shook the ground and vibrated the concrete patio we were standing on. The noise got louder and the thumping vibrations more intense. By coincidence, another 16 year old who was asleep inside the house, woke up, came out to the porch, and said that we all looked as though we had seen a ghost.

After it passed I yelled back into the kitchen where my father was and told him that I had just seen a UFO. He hesitated for a second and said that it was probably a helicopter.

In less than one second there was an F-4 fighter plane chasing a glowing orange ball about 20 feet in diameter, 75 to 80 feet in front of the F-4. They flew almost directly over our head at less than 200 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The F-4 and the glowing orange object continued out over the adjacent interstate highway for a mile or so, toward the River de Peres. Before they got to the river, still at just above treetop height, the orange ball abruptly changed direction by approximately 90-degrees, and increased speed to the point that it was able to cross half the sky (60 degrees of angle) from left to right and achieve an altitude of 10 miles or more, in less a quarter second. The object then, just as abruptly, stopped dead in the sky, and it appeared to be taking a position so as to better observe the F-4 as it banked around looking for it. Or so it seemed to a 13-year-old’s imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the glowing orange object abruptly changed course, the F-4’s engines--previously very loud--suddenly became almost silent, and he banked right and left a couple of times as if he were looking for the object. He then continued for a couple of seconds, and made a wide sweeping turn over the River de Peres, and doubled-back over his previous path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds, the glowing orange spherical object sitting still in the sky shot away at incredible speed and was completely out of sight within an eighth of a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been many years since this occurred, and I just want to make sure that it gets reported. Back then it never occurred to me to report it; much less did I know whom I would report it to. I have discussed this with the other witness as recently as 14 years ago, and our recollections were very similar, but not in the level of detail as I have included, herein.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, I believe there may be good explanations behind such phenomena, which go beyond ascribing them to alien intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyoming 90 miles west of our sighting just west of Souix Army Depot, ===================================================================================== ** Begin Excerpt **  The popular impression through the years was that Blue Book was a full-fledged, serious operation. The public perhaps envisioned a spacious, well-staffed office with rows of file cabinets, a computer terminal for querying the UFO data bank, and groups of scientists quietly studying reports, attended by a staff of assistants.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The actual situation was unfortunately the opposite. The operation was generally headed by an officer of lesser rank. In the military the importance attached to a mission is usually in direct proportion to the rank of the commanding officer. The relatively low-ranking officers in charge of Blue Book were usually assisted by a lieutenant and sometimes only by a sergeant. For one long period of time a sergeant with little technical training was given the chore of evaluating most of the incoming reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not exactly a first-line, high priority operation. Blue Book had much too small a staff to do justice to a phenomenon that so often greatly concerned the public. Compounding the problem, the staff was able to devote only part of its time to the technical problem at hand. During my regular visits to Blue Book across the years I observed that much of the work in the office was devoted to peripheral matters all done at a leisurely pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Further, Blue Book&#39;s low-ranking officers had no leverage to initiate the type of investigations that were needed and for which I frequently asked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The military is entirely hierarchical; a captain cannot command a colonel or a major at another base to obtain information for him. He can only request. As long as Blue Book did not have at least a full colonel in command, it was impossible to execute its assigned task properly. In reviewing cases that had come in during the previous month, I often asked that additional, often crucial information on a case be obtained. The results were at best minimal; officers at other bases were generally too busy to bother to investigate further. Why should they? They all knew it was a finger exercise anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Blue Book was a &#34;cover-up&#34; to the extent that the assigned problem was glossed over for one reason or another. In my many years association with Blue Book, I do not recall ever one serious discussion of methodology, of improving the process of data gathering or of techniques of comprehensive interrogation of witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reader may well ask at this point why I did not either lay siege to the Pentagon, demanding action, or simply resign in disgust. Temperamentally, I am one who can easily bide his time. I also dislike a fight, especially with the military. But most importantly, Blue Book had the store of data (as poor as they were), and my association with it gave me access to those data. In a sense I played Kepler to Blue Book&#39;s Tycho Brahe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as demanding action from the Pentagon, I knew only too well the prevailing climate and recognized that had I been too outspoken, I would have quickly been discredited, labeled a UFO nut, lost access to data, and certainly would have lost all further effectiveness. I have always been of the turn of mind that &#34;truth will out&#34; if given time; if there was indeed scientific &#34;paydirt&#34; in the UFO phenomenon, as time went on and the gathering of data improved, even the most hostile skeptics would be powerless to sweep it under the carpet. The astronomer traditionally adopts a very long time scale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By and large, however, Blue Book data were poor in content, and even worse, they were maintained in virtually unusable form. With access to modern electronic data processing techniques, Blue Book maintained its data entirely unprocessed. Cases were filed by date alone, and not even a rudimentary cross-indexing was attempted. Had the data been put in line readable form, the computer could have been used to seek patterns in the reports, to compare the elements of one report with those of another, and to delineate, for instance the six basic categories of sightings used in this book. Since all the thousands of cases were recorded only chronologically, even so simple a matter as tabulating sightings from different geographical locations, from different types of witnesses etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> was impossible except by going through, manually, each and every report. A proposal for elementary computerization of the data in the Blue Book files, devised by Jacques Vallee and myself and submitted by me directly to Major Quintanilla at Blue Book, was summarily turned down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In view of the above and of the frequently contradictory and inane public relations statements concerning UFO reports, which even the man on the street found unconvincing, it is hardly a wonder that the charge was frequently made that the publicly visible air force &#34;investigation&#34; of UFOs was merely a front for a real investigation being carried on somewhere &#34;higher up.&#34;  Were I the captain of a debating team whose job it is, of course, to marshall the facts favorable to his side and studiously to avoid the other&#39;s, I could defend either side of the argument. At no time, however did I encounter any evidence that could be presented as valid proof that Blue Book was indeed a cover-up operation. However, many indications, bits of information, and scraps of conversation could be force-fitted into a yes for the cover-up thesis. Thus, for instance, one time when I inquired into the specifics of a certain case, I was told by the Pentagon&#39;s chief scientist that he had been advised by those at a much higher level to tell me &#34;not to pursue the matter further.&#34; One can make of that what one will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a country as security conscious as is ours where central intelligence is a fine art, it frequently seemed to me that very provocative UFO reports were dismissed without any seeming follow-up - certainly an illogical if not dangerous procedure unless one knew a priori that the report really was of no potential information value to the security of the country (or that it was but was being taken care of elsewhere). As an example, the report of five rapidly moving discs, made by a member in good standing of the 524th Intelligence Squadron stationed in Saigon and observed by him from the roof of the squadron&#39;s headquarters, went untouched by Major Quintanilla and Blue Book on the grounds that &#34;the sighting was not within the continental limits of the United States.&#34; It would seem almost inconceivable that the intelligence officer in question would not have been further interrogated by some agency; certainly in an active battle area his sighting might have presaged a new military device of the enemy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another example, one of many, was this, on the first day of August, 1965, and on the following two days there occurred the &#34;Midwest flap.&#34; From several states strange Nocturnal Lights were reported by ostensibly reliable police officers on patrol at various places over an area of several hundred square miles. Blue Book dismissed this event as &#34;stars seen through inversion layers,&#34; although I know of no astronomer who has ever witnessed inversion effects that produced these reported effects. Both past experience and calculations show that such illusory effects, in which stars move over at a considerable arc of the sky, simply cannot be produced by thermal inversions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, police officers weren&#39;t the only ones to report. The following is a direct transcript of a Blue Book memo: In the early morning hours of August 1, 1965, the following calls were received at the Blue Book oifices by Lieutenant Anspaugh, who was on duty that night:  1:30 A.M. - Captain Snelling, of the U.S. Air Force command post near Cheyenne, Wyoming, called to say that 15 to 20 phone calls had been received at the local radio station about a large circular object emitting several colors but no sound, sighted over the city. Two officers and one airman controller at the base reported that after being sighted directly over base operations, the object had begun to move rapidly to the northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2:20 A.M. - Colonel Johnson, base commander of Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, near Cheyenne, Wyoming, called Dayton to say that the commanding officer of the Sioux Army Depot saw five objects at 1:45 A.M. and reported an alleged configuration of two UFOs previously reported over E Site. At 1:49 A.M. members of E flight reportedly saw what appeared to be the same uniform reported at 1:48 A.M. by G flight. Two security teams were dispatched from E flight to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2:50 A.M. - Nine more UFOs were sighted, and at 3:35 A.M. Colonel Williams,commanding officer of the Sioux Army Depot, at Sidney, Nebraska, reported five UFOs going east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4:05 A.M. - Colonel Johnson made another phone call to Dayton to say that at 4:00 A.M., Q flight reported nine UFOs in sight; four to the northwest, three to the northeast, and two over Cheyenne.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4:40 A.M.. - Captain Howell, Air Force Command Post, called Dayton and Defense Intelligence Agency to report that a Strategic Air Command Team at Site H-2 at 3:00 A.M. reported a white oval UFO directly overhead. Later Strategic Air Command Post passed the following: Francis E. Warren Air Force Base reports (Site B-4 3:17 A.M.) - A UFO 90 miles east of Cheyenne at a high rate of speed and descending - oval and white with white lines on its sides and a flashing red light in its center moving east; reported to have landed 10 miles east of the site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3:20 A.M. - Seven UFOs reported east of the site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3:25 A.M. - E Site reported six UFOs stacked vertically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3:27 A.M. - G-1 reported one ascending and at the same time, E-2 reported two additional UFOs had joined the seven for a total of nine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3:28 A.M. - G-1 reported a UFO descending further, going east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3:32 A.M. - The same site has a UFO climbing and leveling off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3:40 A.M. - G Site reported one UFO at 70&#39; azimuth and one at 120&#39; . Three now came from the east, stacked vertically, passed through the other two, with all five heading west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I asked Major Quintanilla what was being done about investigating these reports, he said that the sightings were nothing but stars! This is certainly tantamount to saying that our Strategic Air Command responsible for the defense of the country against major attacks from the air, was staffed by a notable set of incompetents who mistook twinkling stars for strange craft. These are the people who someday might have the responsibility for waging a nuclear war.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some, incidents such as the above would be prima facie and conclusive evidence that the cover-up hypothesis was the correct one, on the grounds that no group charged with serious defense responsibilities for the country could have been so stupid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the other hand, our hypothetical debating team captain could amass an even more impressive cache of evidence to conclude quite the opposite: that the entire Blue Book operation was a foul-up based on the categorical premise that the incredible things reported could not possibly have any basis in fact. After all, science pretty well understands the physical world and knows what&#39;s possible and what is not. Since the reported actions of UFOs clearly didn&#39;t fit this world picture, they simply _had to be_ figments of the imagination produced in one way or another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All my association with Blue Book showed clearly that the project rarely exhibited any scientific interest in the UFO problem. They certainly did not address themselves to what should have been considered the central problem of the UFO phenomenon: is there an as yet unknown physical or psychological or even paranormal process that gives rise to those UFO reports that survive severe screening and still remain truly puzzling?  Such lack of interest belies any charge of &#34;cover-up&#34;; they just didn&#39;t care. There is another argument for the &#34;noncover- up&#34; viewpoint: the underlings in the military hierarchy (and all Blue Book officers were such - generally captains or majors, two of which finally made lieutenant colonel but never full colonel) looked mainly toward two things, promotion and early retirement. Therefore, in controversial issues it was always considered far wiser not to &#34;rock the boat,&#34; to please the superior officer rather than to make waves. Thus, when the superior officers, who did not know the facts but were wedded to a rigid framework of military thinking handed down from above, let it be known in any controversial issue (whether UFOs or not) what the &#34;right way&#34; of thinking is, no underling officer was going to oppose or even question it unless, of course he was 99 percent certain that he could prove himself correct in the controversy - and quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the Pentagon had spoken in no uncertain terms about UFOs, no Blue Book officer in his right promotion-conscious military mind was going to buck that, even if he had private opinions on the matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another factor added to the noncover-up theory. Turnover in the Blue Book office was rather high. Sooner or later the officer in charge would be out of it, just that much closer to promotion and retirement, if he just sat tight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt;From 1952 to 1969 the office was headed in turn by Captain Ruppelt (who did not make his own views known until he was out of the air force), Captain Hardin (who had ambitions to be a stock broker), Captain Gregory (to whom promotion was the be-all and end-all of existence), Major Friend, and finally Major Quintanilla, who had the longest term of office. Of all the officers I served with in Blue Book, Colonel Friend earned my respect. Whatever private views he might have held he was a total and practical realist, and sitting where he could see the scoreboard, he recognized the limitations of his office but conducted himself with dignity and a total lack of the bombast that characterized several of the other Blue Book heads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thus one can have one&#39;s choice of whether Blue Book was a front or merely a foul-up. But that there was certainly foul-up and complete divorce from the scientific community within Blue Book was apparent. The members of the scientific fraternity were, of course, wedded to the misperception-delusion hypothesis (there was no need for interchange of ideas with Blue Book, which held the same views), and some members rose to heights of vitriolic verbiage in denouncing reporters of UFOs. This phase of the total phenomenon had many of the aspects of a modern witchhunt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ** End excerpt **<n>
