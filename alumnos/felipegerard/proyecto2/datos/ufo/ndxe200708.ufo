One appeared for a about 5 seconds and then disappeared.  Then another one appeared about 30 seconds later in a different location - same general position over the treetops but to the right of the last one.  That lasted about 5 seconds and then disapppeared and then immediately another one appeared at a distance of several miles from the last one to the left.  This went on for about 10 minutes and we saw a total of approximately 8 altogether.  The light did not fade in anyway.  It just appeared and then disappeared.  It did not move whatsoever.  There was no arcing or pulsating.  We saw a falling star to the east of us during this time, also.  We also saw a white light similar to a plane to our north moving westward about 9:15 p.m. that appeared to bounce along and did not pulsate or flash like other planes did in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/31/07 19:45|Little Rock|AR|Circle|5 minutes|I saw a bright light in  the evening sky that emitted approximately 6 other smaller lights and they all left at high speed.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58508.html|4|ndxe200708| I saw a bright light in  the evening sky that emitted approximately 6 other smaller lights and they all left at high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 7:45 PM (19:45 hrs.) on the afternoon of August 31st, 2007 my wife and I walked out into our back yard.  As we were standing there I looked up into the sky and saw a rather bright glowing object in the sky.  I at first thought it was one of the planets, but realized it was still too early and not yet dark enough to see any stars.  I told my wife I thought it was something reflecting light from the sun but it was stationary and rather large.  I told her I thought maybe it might be the International Space station but I frankly do not know if that is ever visible to the naked eye.  I just sensed it was unusual so I went into the house to retrieve a pair of binoculars. I returned to the backyard and looked up at the object and could see then what looked like red glowing lights around the bright center circular object.  We could also see a jetliner moving through the sky and it too was reflecting some light.   My wife looked at the object through the binoculars also but did not try to adjust the lenses to her eyes and did not see the detail I did.  She said she could only see that it was a bright object.  This is when it got very interesting.  I got the binoculars back from her and as I was looking at object I saw approximately six smaller bright looking circular lights move away from  the brighter object we had first seen.  They moved away slowly from the center object at first and paused in a pattern around it.  They then suddenly took off at high speed and simply disappeared from view.  The center glowing object disappeared also.  As I was telling my wife what I was seeing she looked back only to see the original object was gone and the sky was now empty in the area.  I can’t say these objects were craft but I saw what I just described and have no logical explanation for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One of the fellow asked --where do you see it ? I ran over to them and pointed to the west.Their place of work wall blocked the direct sun rays.The of the fellow said it&#39;s a plane.I said it&#39;s not a plane--it&#39;s sitting stationary.As the three of us watched for about 30 seconds.The other fellow ran into his workplace and within seconds came out with another co-worker.The third person said &#34;not another ufo up there&#34; ! As now the four of us watched,it was moving slowly ,directly above of position.One of the guys said&#34; maybe they are coming to give us a anal probe.Just then the three of them run back through their workplace door-frightened.I stood outside and continued to watch this object and take pictures.I noticed once over directly above,it picked up speed at about 30-50mph would be a guess. As it moved east of my position,you could clearly see another one much higher up in unison moving slightnorth to the east.I looked back at the first one seen,,, gone ! In description of the craft--it was long and hanging vertical.It appeared to be in a tumbling motion,and as if the object was morphing in it&#39;s contained shape.The color was whitish and had a flickering flash coming off it every other second.Kind of like when the sun hits a mirror or metal.Real strange in behaviour and appearance.I remember seeing these types of crafts back-March 29,2006 after 10:10am.They were witnessed over the Don Valley Parkway.Pictures revealed a pea of white dot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports submitted by same source.

I noticed it while watching aircraft using the 4R approach to Midway airport.  Aircraft at that point in their approach are flying at about 2500 feet and the object appeared to be at twice that altitude.  It was, like the airport itself, directly north of my position and about 60 degrees above the horizon line.  The object maintained its exact position in the sky for 10 minutes, though, as its coloring shifted from white to gray, it may have been rotating.  The object then proceeded south and flew directly over my position.  As it did so its coloring shifted from bright white to black and then back again.  It continued to fly off to the south and I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hold an aircraft mechanic&#39;s license and served in the USAF as a jet engine mechanic from 1972-1976.  I am certain that the object was neither a fixed nor rotary winged aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The time was 2:24 PM CDT, the sky was unusually clear, and the wind was from the NNE. I had an unobstructed view of the sky. Looking to the NNE, I saw something approaching in the sky, about 20 degrees above the horizon, that I thought was a piece of paper blowing in the wind. It was bright white. I noticed what I thought was a jet and contrail behind it in the far distance when I first saw it, but could not resolve it.  It did not tumble, except once or twice it dimmed as if it might be tumbling. I thought it might be a bird, but it was clearly not acting like a bird, in that it was not dimming and brightening regularly like a bird would do flapping its wings. It seemed to be simply blowing in the wind. Fortunately, I had a camera, and took some pictures of it. The photos do not clear up what it is, however. It moved overhead and I lost it in the sun. I only saw it for a couple of minutes. It appeared to be far up, at least 2000 feet. I also took a photo of a jet with the same camera settings for comparison.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was the size of the first joint of my index-finger at arms-length and remained motionless.  I couldn&#39;t judge its distance away from me but it looked to be at cloud-height.  The sighting lasted only 5-seconds as the car I was being driven in stopped at a red-light that had a small-building blocking its view (it was gone when the car started moving again).  It was very similar to the one I saw last year in nearby Westwood but only smaller (which was probably due to distance); the weather was even the same (i.e., clear, sunny and blue-skies).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While simply looking around, a triangular craft flew from the north west to the south east, about 150 degrees heading south-south east, EXTREMLY fast. Two lights on each side and one on the center making a flat triangular shape.  I first thought it was 5 craft flying in formation, but the lights never moved relative to each other, so logic tells me it had to be one craft.  If so, it was HUGE and faster than any craft I&#39;ve ever seen or heard of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No clouds in the sky, clear night, moon shining very brightly off to my east.  This was not a meteor.  If it were a military jet, there would have been sound associated with it, NO sound and must have been doing 4,000 to 6,000 miles per hour and the altitude must have been 30 to 40 thousand feet or possibly much higher.  Very large, fast and high.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It is almost as large as a full moon, but not as bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is cloud cover and it seems that the light is behind the clouds as opposed to in front of it. During its rotation it seems to be fainter (less bright) on the lower/bottom part of its rotation. There is no beam extending to or from this light. The area of the sky it is happening is over what is typically more remote or desert and not an area where there are car dealers that usually have those very large advertising lights. The clouds in the sky over the past hr are not really moving across the sky, so the light continues to move behind the same cloud formation. It is 11:31 now and this light and its movement is still continuing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

That was very interesting and unexplainable. After about 1/2 hour or so it split into 2 different individual pieces, it seemed to have fallen towards earth. This piece was different it hovered down then faded from a light bluish color to a white then it faded to black like it was concealing itself or burning out.

It was 75 degrees outside, clear, and no wind.  At the same time, we saw two objects pass together moving in a straight path from NNW to SSE. They were easy to see as they passed overhead. They were not points of light, but rather two round &#39;balls&#39; about 1/4 the apparent diameter of the moon, they were bright, but not as bright as the moon.  No lights were visible on these objects, yet they were bright and easy to see.  Anyone looking up at the sky at that time couldn&#39;t have missed this.  It was really spectacular.  They were visible until they faded from view as they approached the southern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects appeared to quickly move back and forth very close to each other every second or so in near synchrony during the two minutes it took for them to cross the sky. Two of us thought they may have been quickly circling each other as they passed over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very, very strange. It was impossible to determine their altitude or speed, but together they passed over us at about the same speed as a passing satellite.<n>

The disc was east of Mt. Cucamonga and was above the Cajon mountain pass.  When I first noticed the disc, it was stationary.  It then descended from its position high above the mountain range moving diagonally from right to left at an angle of about 45 degrees.  It covered that entire distance in less than three seconds.  I see many commercial planes in the valley flying into and out of Ontario International Airport, which is in the valley below the sighting.  I would judge the object to have been three or four times larger than a large airliner.  The object could have been larger as I have no way of knowing its distance from my location.  It descended at a steady pace and disappeared from view behind the mountain range, so I feel certain it was not over the valley as its size remained constant.  There was no tail, no glow, no pulsating. no other lights.  Just a blue circle that moved at incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

At that point our daughter drove up and asked what we were staring at and I pointed to where we were looking to show her and she saw them as well (even yet farther away) which @ that point I&#39;m pretty sure they were just white but the thing just kept moving away.  I didn&#39;t notice any sound or wind but there was a dog (not sure if it was the neighbors across the street or where) but it was making a weird noise kind of like(hard to describe)a whimper but a growl when I first was out with my dog honestly didnt notice if he stopped or not toward the end becasue I was just concentrating on the lights.  Didn&#39;t think to get my camera because we were just so shocked and dumbfounded to see what we were seeing.  I did call my police department just to see if anyone else had seen anything weird and they told me they hadn&#39;t heard anything yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From our location in Toms River, NJ, the objects passed just to our West while traveling from the Southwest towards the Northeast. There were four peach/orange colored object and two smaller white objects. They held a general formation but the distance between the objects varied as they moved along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound coming from the objects at all. We live under a busy airspace serving the New York metropolitan airports as well as the McGuire Air Force Base and can always hear the sound of a passing aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Altitude was hard to verify since the size of the objects was unknown. If they were the size of a small aircraft like the Cessna 175 (Which I flown in many times) then I would estimate their altitude at 5,000 feet and their ground speed to be 200 MPH. Altitude and speed remained constant while I observed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of us agreed that their shape was circular. My wife commented later was that she thought of jellyfish as she watched them. They looked to me as thought they were self illuminated globes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen or reported anything like this before and have no opinion as to what they were. More than anything, I wanted to know if anyone else saw the same thing.<n>

The plan was to take a couple of pictures every 15 minutes or so.  I went to my backyard prior to the start of the eclipse to take the first pictures.  A beautiful full moon on a clear night.  After the first shot I noticed a blue spehere directly below the moon in the camera screen.  (Looking at a clock, it would have been at the six).  Thinking that is was from the camera, I changed the setting and took another picture.  It seemed ok.  Last night I developed the pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first picture had the sphere at six, to the left of the  moon (at the 9 postion) is what appears to be a chain of gold/metallic spheres linked together and curved.  There are what appear to be additional gold/metallic spheres on the roof the house behind mine.  To the right at roof line is a very large bright light in what appears to be a street light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the second picture the blue sphere is at the 5 position.  The chain of spheres is below and behind the blue sphere, again at the 5 position.  It now looks straight.  The spheres on  the roof have moved to the right.  The street light has moved from the right of a tree or roof  toward the left so that it is now in the middle of that.  It looks more like street light in this second picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I took the second picture I went into the house and fell asleep. I have seen some strange things in the past in the sky in Petaluma and San Rafael, but this is first time I have photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then as we headed onto Jericho Turnpike we saw it hovering over us. It was standing still in the sky at one point.

It appeared to have no wings and was cigar shaped, silvery white in color, and moved slowly across the sky.  This was not a narrow cigar shape, but more like a blimp. We watched it for several minutes as it moved on a westward heading (towards Spokane Washington).  It traveled at a speed close to that of a small single engine airplane, maybe a bit slower.  I cannot be certain that it had no wings, but that is how it appeared to both my wife and I.  It definitely made no sound, and that’s why I am reporting it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m skeptical of alien spaceships, but I cannot explain this craft’s silence.  Visibility was perfect, as the sun was high and the air clear, and we were hiking in the hills above the valley.  If it had an engine, we should have heard it clearly.  There was no con-trail or visible markings or lights of any sort.<n>

When I first saw it, I thought it was fireworks in the distance.  After watching for a while, I noticed that the red light would only stay on for about 3-5 seconds or so and they would all be at about the same altitude.  They would appear 1 to 3 at a time and the interval of occurrence would be every 2-4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights started to appear somewhat more to west and closer in our direction.  This went on for about 20 minutes and then I noticed a horizontal line of lights appearing to the southwest of our location.  They started appearing at about 1-2 second intervals going from left to right.  After 4 or 5 lights appeared, a new light to the right of then line would appear as the one to the far left would disappear.  This continued for a total of 16 lights.  No other lights appeared after that occurrence.  The sky was clear and the moon was almost full.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a very windy morning, so thoughts of skydivers or weather balloons wern&#39;t likley.

When I focused in on the source, I saw seven to eight white lights in the shape of a chevron, moving fairly quickly in the direction of south-west, in front of and below the moon.  Considering the direction that they were traveling, they must have been much closer to me while my vision was obscurred with the camera lens, but I never heard a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

One was white, the other blueish. At first I thought it was just an airplane and then the white light seemed to shine a spotlight up into the sky (at the moon). It was during a lunar eclipse. I pulled over to the side of the road and proceeded to watch it for a while. The aircraft appeared triangular, but I am basing this on the positioning of the lights. The aircraft would continue to do the same pattern over and over. It is somewhat hard to explain, but the two lights would seem to disappear and three lights (much like headlights of a car) would come on. The aircraft would come towards the edge of the freeway, and spotlight the moon, flip over upside down, and then turn away. It would then turn around, turn on the three bright lights as it came back towards the freeway. It would again spotlight the moon, flip upside down ( which would now be right side up) again and head away. It made very little noise but I could faintly hear it. It was in the vicinity of a small airport and may have just been a small airplane, but I have never seen an airplane stay upside down for as long as this one was. I also haven&#39;t seen an airplane with lights such as this, which gave it a triangular appearance. If anyone knows what this was please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was moving at a remarkably fast rate going back and forth from east to west then north to south; it would stop and almost jiggle at a point that was straight up.  No apparent pattern was noted.  There were some clouds in the sky, we could see the light whether it was under the clouds or in a clear section of the sky.  We do know that others down a few acres saw this also, we could hear them saying “Oh my god do you see that?  What is it?”  We have not confirmed this, as we live in an area with large acreage and lots of it is jungle and forested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted for approximately 5 minutes, it went down slowly behind the trees, about 6 blocks away, there are no houses where it went down.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked south east of the moon and thought I saw a shooting star.  It flew up over the hight of the moon around 9:45 pm with a white trail behind it, not unlike when a plane is very high and you see that white trail,  but it was much shorter.  I could only see flicking colored lights in the front of the trail.  It shot over the moon and was traveling north east more east towards the beach. It flew very high in the sky but you could see the colored lights then it disapeared.  I watched other planes in the area for the next 1/2 hour and the lights were different and the regular planes moved much slower then the thing I observed  The whole thing lasted less then 60 seconds.  It really freaked me out.  Did anyone else see what I saw in Broward County, Florida<n>

I live to the north of uptown Sedona, Arizona and my house sits on the edge of the Coconino national forest with only dwarf juniper and pinion forest behind my home.  I am just south by about half a mile from the base of mount Wilson in an ever rolling series of elevations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched this object there were long trailing flames coming from each end of the unidentified thing.  I was paniced by the sight of this as it looked possibly like a plane in that it was somewhat chevon in shape with the flames coming from each of the tip points and the apex was pointed in the direction of the fall. It took about 2 seconds to fall out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed the object at about mid point on the horizon and watched it fall directly behind Brins Mesa which is about a mile to the northwest of our home.  There was no noise or blast from an impact.  However, in the area of the trajectory there were pluming clouds that seem to come from the point were the object would have made contact with the ground.  There were no other clouds in the sky.  At an arms distance it was about the size of a nickel to a quarter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived here for about 5 years and been witness to many meteor showers but none have ever looked as strange as this object.  It obviously had a span between the flaming ends just as an airplane would have from wing tip to wing tip.  I did not see a fuselage or tail section.  It was more like a flying wing.  I did not call the police.  The flames and total comprized color of said object was bright white.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It look as if it were off in the distance a few miles (could have been more since there&#39;s no comparison to the size). You could see through the oval, and as it laterally transversed in the sky across long distances, it would change angle so you could see through the cirlce of lights (just looked black inside). It would shoot down as if to dart down to the earth sometimes spinning around and around. It went away for 15 minutes and then returned again for maybe 5 minutes to the same place, this time higher up in the sky as it swooshed down out of sight again. It would hover in one space and then travel laterally, as the angle changed quite frequently. No doubt in my mind, this was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very large and moving at great speed.  It seemed to loop around quickly to change directions, then accelerated at a sharp angle as if trying to land quickly.  It disappeared.  The area in which it seemed to go down was too far from Fort Campbell to be near that airfield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a V shape of bright white lights that seemed to be in a straight line sometimes depending on the angle.  At first I could only see the three lights at the outside angles forming a triangle.  I only saw white lights, no color.  The lights were equally spaced apart at least 6 or 7 in number.  I did not hear any sound of a helicopter or plane.  I’m guessing the distance to be less than a football field away from my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were plenty of vehicles on the interstate including truck drivers.  No one even slowed down.  My daughter and I saw it simultaneously.  It seemed obvious that it wasn’t an ordinary airplane.  I wonder if it is some fancy military craft. Why would they fly it so low over civilian areas when there is miles and miles of government land at Fort Campbell?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicated a date in 2008.

As I was setting up my tripod in my solarium which faces southeast over Lake Ontario in Etobicoke, I looked up at the moon which was very “yellow” and noticed something “black” on the face of the moon. I asked my husband if he could see it from the livingroom where he was sitting and he said yes he could. I reached for his camera which was closest to me and had a 100-400mm lens on it to get a good look. I was amazed at what I saw! At the top of the moon but closer to the right side rather than the middle, there appeared to be a black pitchfork shaped object shooting downward toward the bottom of the moon leaving two stream vapour barrier in its trail. I was able to get about 5 shots in before the object reached the bottom of the moon and once leaving the light background of the moon it appears to be nothing more than a puff of black smoke. Upon reviewing the images I shot I realized that in one of the early shots I took of the moon the “pitchfork shape” was at the very edge of the moon prior to me being aware that it was there. At first I thought maybe this image was of a satellight that was set to record the eclipse but I have spoken to a few amature starwatchers and they agree that they have never seen anything like this. I would really appreciate learning what this object might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had a slight glow. I tried looking at it without my sun glasses and had a very difficult time seeing it. With my sun glasses I could see it rather well.  It moved many times faster than anything I have ever seen before.  It would move then stop and hover. At one point it dropped and went into a spiral maneuver. At the end of the spiral it stopped, hovered for a few seconds, shot directly up, stopped and hovered, and then disappeared into the clouds with a tremendous speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was watching the red moon, and at 4:34am I saw an object moving from the north-west toward the east. It traveled in an arcing motion across the sky.  The object had no lights, and from the bottom it reflected light from the city.  It was a light grey or white in color.  It looked to be round in shape, though hard to tell from the distance and limited light.  The object created no sound what so ever, and it was very quite at this time of the morning.  The sighting only lasted for about 4 to 5 seconds, until it traveled out of view.  In my best estimation, the craft was 2000-5000 feet above, and was traveling, i would say approximatly 200-300mph. I dont know how large it was but i estimated it would be larger than the largest aircraft made. Did anyone else see this object?<n>

When I first noticed it I just kept looking it getting closer as it was obvious it was something unusual. When it came closer it just stopped and stayed still on the air almost above us, it must have been very high because there was no noise. It was me and my wife who were watching. It stayed on the air with no movement for around a minute and a half and then changed direction and went North, it went behind the building so I couldn’t see it any more so I went outside the building on the other side to continue seeing it but it just wasn’t there any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am attaching a photo which I took from my mobile phone camera, it doesn’t say much but please note that the night was very clear with lots of stars, on the photo you will notice a very small red dot which is the object and the stars do not appear on the photo.

We were on Hwy. 375 Westbound approximately 3 miles beyond Nye/Lincoln Co. border, about 20 miles from Rachel.  My husband first spotted the UFO from the driver’s side window and told me to look.  It was glowing orange, resembling the color of rocket flame exhaust or jet engine under thrust propulsion.  It appeared to be cigar shaped, but from our vantage seemed to be a disk shaped object seen from the side.   It initially appeared to be about  ½ mi. away from us and from that distance probably 25 feet thick, (top to bottom) and 250-300 feet in diameter. These are very rough guesses from night time viewing.  It was a clear and bright night, the moon full.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There appeared a series of 6-8 ‘boxes’ on what we believe to be the side of the craft.  The boxes lit up sequentially from right to left, remaining aglow for 10-15 seconds before reversing the process and slowly extinguishing.  It then reappeared some distance to the right (E) and farther away.  At the end of each sequence, only the forward most orange light remained visible.  We maintained visual contact until it crested the range of mountains due NE of Rachel and SW of Caliente.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next visual contact was at mile marker 73 on US Hwy. 93N, 20 miles outside of Caliente.  We were E bound coming out of an area known as Delamar Flats and entering the local mountain range known as the Caliente Summit (Oak Springs Summit).  We saw one flash appearing much further in the distance, due E of our location and repeated its sequence twice.  At the end of the second sequence the front glowing light remained constant, visible until it became so distant in the horizon it disappeared.   It maintained its single glowing orange light and looked almost like an orange star in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time summary of the entire viewing event from start to finish was about a half hour.  I was unable to photograph object because of my autofocus camera not cooperating.  We do not believe to have had any loss of time or do not suspect abduction.  We wonder if anyone else has seen anything similar to this?<n>

It was contained to about the six inches of the windshield.  It was visible at the upper, center part of the windshield but I could not tell you how far away it was.  I seemed to be close and low.  There were no clouds in the sky and no storms nearby.  It was dark but not extremely dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband yelled, “What the hell was that?”  I told him it looked like the Star Ship Enterprise taking off at warp speed.  We did not see anymore flashes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I did see three points of light about fifteen minutes later from my porch.  They were extremely high and looked at first glance to be stars or satellites in orbit.  The peculiar feature about them was that they were triangular in form.  The three points of light moved in unison. Possibly, they were military.  I don’t know of anything else that could travel in that manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted a local news station to see if anyone else had reported strange lights in the sky, but they basically treated me as if I were a nut.  I don’t watch them anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is a business owner and I am a stay-at-home mom.  We live in a respectable, wealthy suburb of Rochester, NY.  I am open minded and my husband is a true skeptic<n>

There were some odd cloud formations that I thought would be cool to post as stock on my Deviant Art account. I got a few pictures of some planes with their vapor trails from the cooling weather and when I looked over into the eastern part of the southern sky, I saw something odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a very bright object in the sky, about the size of a large blimp, moving slowly through the sky. I say it was odd because not only was it so bright compared to the planes I had been photographing, but it also had no vapor trail. None of the other planes were without one. So I took a few pictures of it. I should have clicked my camera, a Nikon Coolpix 4200 to video, but I wasn&#39;t sure what I was seeing. I watched it for about 2 minutes, then went inside to tell my wife and mother about it. I was only inside maybe 15-20 seconds. When I stepped back out it had gone. At the original rate it was moving, had it held constant, it shouldn&#39;t have gone very far in that time. And if it was a plane, it should still have been in view in the areaI was looking in. But there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back inside and began looking at the pictures. The first one I looked at had everyone blinking in shock. As I zoomed in you could see the object, no vapor trail visible, and you could see from the light reflecting on it that it was ROUND! It looked like a big, silvery inner tube. I checked the other pictures out and all but one was too fuzzy to make out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I went to crop one of the other pictures so you could get a better view of it, my hand slid wrong and enlarge the picture in a space above the UFO I was trying to crop. And I froze. My heart actually skipped a beat. In the sky above the bright UFO were 3 more dark objects. One was larger than the other and at an angle, with two smaller ones below it. I have cropped these with the bright UFO, and then separately so you can have an understanding of the perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The photos were taken in Cadillac, Michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:<n>

They were directly above our housing estate, so wheh we pulled up on the driveway about 20 seconds later, they had moved a considerable distance southwards (i know this as our front door faces north) as we got out the car we all walked up the road a bit to watch and discovered that they moved in to the shape of an equalteral triangle, which is when one of our neighbours said &#39;you spotted it too then?&#39; as we watched the lights moved from the equalateral triangle shape they had formed, to a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like they had gained speed as the light&#39;s became more distant, and one by one they dissappeared from sight, although the last one took longer to dissappear than the first two, there was a sort of disruption in the clouds i had noticed where they had dissappeard, as it was becoming late, and the sky was settled, but had a stirred up area in the clouds, but barely visable to the human eye<n>

As we talked I was glancing down the alley and up into the sky and thinking about what a nice day it was when I noticed object in the sky about 45 degrees up from the horizon. It was something I have never seen before or since with my own eyes. I mentioned to my friend the object and he saw it and then noticed a second similar object almost directly above us. The one above us appeared to be closer so we focused on that. I immediately got my binoculars out to have a closer look. The object was metallic and appeared to be circular, or an orb. I would have to say the object was a bit larger than a BB if you held one an arms length away. The objects did not drift or move. They were stationary in their positions for at least two minutes then they just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was wearing polarized sunglasses and this object was not visible to the naked eye. There were several jet aircraft in the sky at the same time, but this object was much higher up, I thought it might have been the international space station or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went and grabbed my binoculars and I was astounded to see a greenish glowing diamond shaped object, which had five orbs in a formation heading from the north to the southeast. For a second I thought it was a balloon or something, but this object was diamond shaped and had a glowing greenish hue, and had to be near sub orbital, and left no contrails to be a jet plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed these objects for about ten to fifteen minutes, I showed my wife and her mom and a family friend and they were astounded. The five orbs seemed to be out in front of the greenish diamond object in a perfect formation pattern; their size was much more diminished compared to the greenish object. I didn&#39;t even notice them at first and spotted them after watching the Diamond shaped object. I must emphasize that these objects could not be seen with the naked eye, and if I did not have my sunglasses on, I would not have even seen the intial object. I searched the sky to make sure I was not in fact seeing stars, but no other objects similar to it could be seen in the crystal blue sky’s background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After sometime of viewing them, about only fifteen minutes the objects I was observing simply vanished.  I live on the North side of Chicago and see Aircraft on approach to O’Hare international every day, but these objects had to be 50’000 feet or so, and the greenish Diamond object had to be quite large as it appeared to me to be a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP FROM SAME WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> follow up<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted the flight service station and for my report they told me the following  45 thousand feet winds were at 290@33 53 thousand feet winds were at 300@16<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the formation moving from the North to the Southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

But it slowly descended down below the tree level which took about 30 minutes to accomplish it. This would put this object at about 40 degrees to the horizon. I gave up watching but it never reappeared. I came out about an hour later and it still wasn&#39;t there. This object made no noise but it was quite distant. It also did not travel parallel across the sky at all. It just dropped straight down very very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It didnt change in size as if going away or towards me, thats how I knew it was falling straight down. Again, I was driving south and observed the object to my W.S.W.

We were on our way home when I saw a bright light that, to me, looked like a street light.  But as we drove along the turn, I noticed that it was not a street light.  The light appeared to be going higher then when I first saw it.  The light looked like a triangle with three glowing orange lights.  The object did not have any strobes and did not move in a consistent pattern.  It was approximately 100 feet in the air when I first saw it, and then rose about another 200 or so feet up.  By this time, everyone else in the car saw it as well and we all got out of the car.  Then light then appeared to hover still for a few seconds and then started moving south-east.  We then decided to follow it and it seemed to be moving in circles until we came to a parking lot on top of a hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got out of the car again we watched it continue south-east and for about ten minuets.

I noticed a bright object moving from north of us to the south, which I initially took to be the ISS (space station).  The first glimpse put this object at the 1100 position (assuming the hood of our car is the 1200 position, and it was to the west of us about 35 degrees off the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I am a former member of the military (16 Tango - ADA) I was extensively trained in visual identification of both man made and naturally occuring atmospheric phenomena.  I quickly deduced that this was in fact not the ISS due to its increasingly fast speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object did not have any visible navigational lighting, nor strobes.  I watched the object traverse the entire expanse of sky from the 1100 position to our front, to about the 630 position behind us all in about 10 seconds before it disappeared into nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few minutes I contacted the Columbia County Sheriff to describe the incident, and left my name and number.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very interested in knowing what this object was, and if anyone else sighted this very fast thing near Madison last night.<n>

8/25/07 05:45|Waterloo|IA|Light|15 Minutes|White light, moving in different directions/speeds and stopped in the night/morning sky.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58385.html|94|ndxe200708| White light, moving in different directions/speeds and stopped in the night/morning sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from work traveling North-West.  The road is full of curves, so my direction would change a bit, but my house is North-West of my employer.  I got off work at 05:30 AM.  As I was driving home, I noticed 3 lights, that looked just like stars all in a strait line at an angle.  I never saw this before in this part of the sky.  I was trying to look as I was driving, but it was difficult.  I only live 5 minutes from work.  When I arrived home, I went to my back yard and looked for the three stars.  They had moved to a triangle formation, but were in about the same location in the sky.  I did not see them move.  They were very tiny, and looked as if they were small stars.  The light from them was bright white.  Then as I was watching them, just sitting still, to my right was one that was traveling towards the others.  It looked exactly like the other three, except that this one was moving and I didn&#39;t whiteness the others moving except that I noticed that they had changed formation from the last time I seen them.  This one continued to move until it was close to the others, then stopped.  I tripped my motion halogen light on the side of my house by accident, and it lit up so bright that it was difficult to see, so I walked further out back.  It was also early in the morning, so the sky had lightened some.  I could still see the lights, but they were not as bright.  Then the one that was moving before, began to move again.  There was no sound.  It was as if it were very far above me.  It would move steady, then shoot at a small angle, then slow back down and move steady, then shoot at a small angle as if it were trying to zig zag, but continued to travel in the same direction that it was when it would slow a bit and travel steady.  In a matter of about 5 minutes, it traveled from my right hand side, all the way to my left hand side to where I couldn&#39;t see it anymore as it moved with the curvature of the atmosphere and disappeared.  It had no blinking lights like an airplane, ! but was bright white, like a small star.  I was facing south when I saw the lights.  It traveled from the South-West to the South-East.  The others just stayed in position.  After about another 5 minutes watching them not do anything and turning my head to try and find the one that had moved and disappeared, I went in the house and woke my wife to tell her what had happened.  I then went back outside to see if they were still there, but the sun had come up and it was too light out.  I couldn&#39;t see them anymore.  I do not drink, nor do I do any drugs.  I am mentally sane.  I am not into comic books, or a star wars/star trek fan.  I have never seen anything like this before.  I have seen shooting stars before many times, and this was not one of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was far in the distance and hovering so I naturally assumed it was a tower.  As I drove further about a mile and approached the local high school a craft came hovering above me close to the ground but still very far in the sky.  I stopped my car and rolled the window down to have an unobstructed view, it was triangle in shape which I could tell even in the night sky and had large white lights lining each side, something I have never seen in a normal aircraft, there was also a red and blue blinking light, something I have seen in an aircraft which led me to question whether it were really a ufo or not.  However it was moving slowly and making no noise, and definetly triangular in shape.  It went across the sky and dissapeared behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We didn’t think much about it, just noticed that it was the brightest star. It caught my eye again  and I noticed it was moving directly toward us. I had time to say “should we run“ twice before this light was traveling directly over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It  wasn’t extremely bright or large…..It hovered past us at a very decent speed…. I couldn’t see any shape really, but as this white light past and I was looking at what could be called the back of the object/light. I saw red white and blue lights flash repeatedly in a horizontal line. But still no shape. This lasted maybe 20 sec as the object flew into the SW sky. We just stood there...very confused  Within 5-10 min. We saw another white light that appeared in the distant NW sky. This light was flashing red white and blue as well. I think it was the same one… It was moving in short and very fast spurts in all directions/diagonally. When it would move, only the white light was visible. We watched this flashing and moving for about 30-45min.  I then saw two more lights, basically appear close to the first light forming a triangle. These never flashed or moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While observing this……I saw something out of the corner of my eye…..I turned my head “WHAT THE HELL?”  Luckily my brother saw this too…It saw a cylinder shaped object ..it was transparent… energy, about 20 feet in the air, with a sphere like “head“.  That’s the only way to describe it..this was the weirdest part of the sighting..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t believe what I was seeing …I’m so glad my brother saw the same things….. I don’t think I would be sane today  THEN two more extremely bright lights appeared to the right of the already present 3 light. These light had slight up/down movements.  The light would dim so much it was barely visible, when this happened I saw sphere shaped outlines behind the lights.. my brother did not see these sphere outlines. As the light would get bright again the shape could not be seen…If the one on the right  moved up then the one the left would move down, simultaneously. These were very short and barely noticeable. I cant determine the distance of the two. But they appeared to be closer than the  first 3...we watched this for like 2 hrs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this, we saw 4 shooting star. Orange in color…another weird thing is that at the hotel 3 stray cats were all over us. I mean friendly like we had had them for ten years..<n> <n><n> <n><n> very strange...but i loved it!!!!  FYI: Ft. Sill is less than 20 miles from this location<n>

I was laying down on the porch relaxing and she was sitting on the steps.  She suddenly says, “Oh My God!”  I sat up asking what she had seen.  She stated that she had never seen anything like what she had just witnessed.  I asked her what she saw and she stated she witnessed a steady glowing ball of light moving away from the tree line across from our property and it suddenly disappeared.  I asked her if it was a plane and she said she had never witnessed a plane disappear like that in a cloudless sky and that most planes have blinking lights.  The night was very clear with visible stars. To my dismay, I did not witness it and am only reporting what she saw.  Background on my wife is that she is an intelligent individual with no claims of witnessing a UFO before, but believes they are a possibility.  She is not claiming this was an Alien craft, but she was dumbfounded as to what it could have been.  Thank you!<n>

It was moving in a straight but sort of up and down in a sloppy motion. So I started to record it with my phone and after ten seconds of recording the bright light dicipated and did not return.I have been living by a small airport for years, and I have never seen something like this and there are no hills in the direction of the bright light. So I found it very suspicious. And also after recording my phone was turning on and off for about a week. And still does it occasionally.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was moving slowly enough to allow me to get my binoculars to view the object.  In the binoculars the light appeared as two distinct round orbs.  The orb on the left appeared to be lime/pale/green in color and the ord on the right appeared to be deep orange.  The lights moved west, over the span of approximately 10 minutes before disappearing from field of view.  The lights appeared to slowly fade out.  The orbs faded  while being observed with the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was overcast and no stars were observed.  No other air traffic was observed.  No aircraft collision lights were observed around the orbs.  The light did not vary their color and only varied their brightness when fading away.    I have observed this type of sighting several times prior to this event.  Without the use of binoculars the object appeared as a single bright light to the naked eye.  The object did not descend or ascend, over the 10 minutes being observed, and appeared to maintain a level altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sun was at out backs to the West. I was looking up at the sky and clouds to the South East. Their were high whispy clouds and probably left over vapor trails from passing jets. The object that caught my attention looked odd and not moving in a perceptable way. It was obvious the sun was bouncing off the object and the i would have to estimate the altitude to be between 10- 20 thousand feet but I cannot say for sure. The object seemed to be drifting East to West very slowly over the observation time. In fact the object was at time obscured by the clouds passing by as it was above the clouds. I used a small pair of binoculars to see it better and when I got it focused it took on a spherical shape about the size of a BB at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing the object wit the binoculars for ~ 45 seconds I looked away to address one of the other whitneses and when I looked up to see it again it was gone and no clouds were in the vicinity at that time just blue shy. We theorized that it was a silver mylar balloon but at that altitude we felt it would have been too small to see with the unaided eye. We then agreed that it may have been a weather balloon that had ascended high enough for us to loose site of it or if it was a baloon it may have popped? At any rate I have never seen anything like it before in the sky and I am 56 years old. Their were a couple small aircraft that passed in front of and below the object moving from reughly South to North and may have see it as well??<n>

It was about 430-5 pm and awlays around that time in Rhode Island the sun sets very brigh and spectaculator. This gave the disc a shimmer with the sun which made it easy to see. It was about 5 miels away low in the sky. The object went from a hover to VERY fast jump to the east then to the west. Eash jump was about the lenght of a football feild in 1 seccond. Then the object started to plain up twoards the sky and started off to move slow and with in one sec of launched up and disapeard.

It was nice out and the sky was sunny and clear.  After a few minutes I noticed something in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be a group of white birds at first glance.  But as I watched I noticed that they were moving in ways that was very &#34;unbirdlike.&#34;  They stayed in a pretty tight cluster, with none straying away from the group.  After watching for a bit, a worker brought a finished car out and I asked him what he thought it was.  He looked for a bit and said that it was messing with his head and he didn&#39;t want to think about it.  He quickly went back to work!  I continued watching and I showed another customer that had come outside.  He quickly dismissed it as a flock of birds.  But he continued watching very intently for several minutes, not very sure of himself.  The group was moving southbound above Sparks.  As they neared, I noticed that it was a group of 20 or so lights....definitely not birds.  It was hard to tell how big they were, but they seemed small.  Some would seem to dim and then get brighter.  It was very peculiar.  I tried to take a picture with my cell phone, but the resolution is too poor to really see anything.  After about 10 minutes in total the cluster moved out of view to the Southeast of my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen plenty of bird flocks flying south for winter, or just flying around outside.  But birds have wings...and these were lights.  Lights that were dimming, and then coming back.  I was amazed at how hard it was to see them even though it was nice and clear outside.  You really had to look closely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was approximately 1:30am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We first thought that it might be an airplane however after closely watching we noticed that it did not move.  We were facing N / NW and the lights were at approximately 11 o’clock in the sky.  We watched for about 1.5 hours and during that time the light streak not move at all it stayed stationary.  The light streak was about 5-10 miles long and at quite a height.  The sky was partly cloudy and the light streak appeared to get longer, shorter, dimmer and brighter as the clouds passed over.  The lights looked not unlike long green glow sticks in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light did not move like a satellite, falling star, meteorite or plane, it had to be something well above the cloud cover moving in sync with the rotational spin of the earth.  Comparing it to a jet plane con trail, it would have had to be much higher than a commercial jet, and unlike a jet con trail it did not deteriorate at all over the 1.5 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end it was covered by cloud cover for about 5 minutes and when the cloud cover cleared it was gone and wasn’t seen again<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??

I heard a rumble in the sky.  When I looked up, I saw what looked like a long, skinny rectangle slowly moving overhead.  Little Valley, NY doesn&#39;t have airline traffic which is why I was curious when I heard the noise.  There were two white lights on the front and the back, and the white lights had a flickering red light.  It moved south towards Pennsylvania very slowly.  I followed it for several minutes until it disappeared into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m familiar with how airliners looks a night.  There were no lights on the wings of this craft.  There was no visual evidence that there were wings.  There was no audible evidence of jet engines, just the low rumble.  I couldn&#39;t really judge how high the craft was in the sky, but it looked quite low for an aircraft.  Given how far away the front and back lights were from each other, the craft looked very long, but since there were no lights on the sides I couldn&#39;t really judge how wide it is.

In the center of this light was a multicolored tubular beam of light coming down to the ground. I stepped out my door to see it better and heard a car in the distance approching this area. As soon as the approching cars lights came over the hill, the big lights I had been watching instantly disappeared. I then watched the car drive down the road and realized how big the light I saw were compared to this cars lights. I told my husband about it and he said I may have seen an abduction.  There are no cows in this feild this time of year. The next morning I looked at the spot where I saw the light and noticed a power pole that could of been in line with the beam. Almost like it could of been accessing the electricity. I have seen many UFO&#39;s but always somehow knew they were aware of me. This time I wondered why I was able to observe it and the car coming down the road was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicated a date in 2008.  We have amended the date above.

8/23/07 21:20|Overlea|MD|Flash|5-10 seconds|Quick moving rapidly flashing light at night|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58354.html|114|ndxe200708| Quick moving rapidly flashing light at night<n> <n><n> <n><n> Greetings:  At roughly 9:25 pm (+/- 5 minutes) this evening, August 23, 2007 I was driving alone on Kenwood Ave. a two lane road through a residential neighborhood.  Sun has totally set for about one hour. Traffic was of moderate density.  My speed was roughly 25 mph.  I was heading in a north easterly direction.  My attention was drawn to a rapidly flashing light (15 - 30 flashes per second) moving quickly from left to right.  The object was approximately 20 degrees above my apparent horizon  As I tried to track the flashes while still watching traffic it appeared to be farther to the right than I had anticipated every time I looked back up. It also passed behind trees which were between the object and myself and just became lost in the trees and buildings.  I did not have a wide horizon at this time but the speed at which the object traversed it was impressive.  About a quarter mile after the sighting Kenwood Ave. makes a 90 degree right hand turn.  About another quarter mile past the turn I momentarily caught another glimpse of the object as it disappeared over the horizon, heading directly away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time could I detect anything other than the flashing light.  The light was very small.  Not much bigger than a BB held at arms length.  The flashes were primarily white  but I think I may have detected intermittent red flashes.  The part of this episode which has me baffled is the speed of the flashes.  It was actually almost a solid light.  Not at all a standard nav light.  And, the speed at which it traveled.  I also had the impression that the object was spinning, but I can&#39;t really say that for sure.  That may have been an illusion caused by the flashes.  My driver window was down but I heard no sounds other than traffic.  As it disappeared the second time it was heading roughly toward Martin State Airport from which both Baltimore City and Maryland State Police operate their helicopters.  I see both helicopters daily and I don&#39;t believe that this object was either one of them.  I probably would have heard either helo and I can&#39;t picture them making that kind of speed even if they had a malfunctioning strobe light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After the sighting lastnight we decided to do some research to see if there have been anymore sightings in our area. Well what we found was a surprise. It came out to be over 50 sightings in our same area since 1985. First sighted in 1940. All the records reported back then describes exactly what we saw the past two nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Walking down from the same house, we looked in between the two houses where the first sighting was. This light stayed for quite a few minutes, then it slowly began to move left. While it was moving it dropped out another light.. like fire. Then the light that was dropped faded. The orignial light continues to flow left and then it slowly fades away itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due ot the fading away we believed it was a flare. Expecailly since we live next to the military base (fort hood). Thinking it was training of the soldiers we called the MP&#39;s and they told us that there was no trainging happening at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Making us more curious we stayed outside to watch for the lights. Eventually we saw the sky light up red. After afew flashes of red came the original objects appeard in the original spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only this time around it was 4 in one place at one time. Each time one light would fade another object would appear... but yet in the exact same location as the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each time one would fade, another one would drop out fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not knowing what this was we dug out the binoculars. To our surprise it came out that the objects were NOT flares and yet the stuff that was being dropped was fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After awhile the objects themselves exploded. We decided to chase after the lights to get our answer on what it was. As we got closer and closer we noticed that the fire would just drop behind the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got to the point where we were too close, and being alone at night in one car we decided to go home. When we got home we looked up videos online of UFO&#39;s and came upon videos of exactly what we have recorded... Now you tell me what it is?  Yet when the police here says its flares. We want an answer. And yet until we find it we will sit out everynight and get this on camera.<n>

There is a tree in the neighbors yard that I can see from my backyard. I suddenly saw a glowing light come from behind the tree (no bigger than the north star) in a straight line heading west and then it stopped gave two flashes of light simultaneously and all of a sudden shot straight in the air at such a speed it was unbelieveable and as it went higher it gave one last flash and completely went black. The whole experience lasted 4 seconds. No longer. I know what I saw was real it was so silent and so fast there is no way it was anything human.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

8/23/07 00:30|San Ysidro|CA|Light|2 minutes|Four white lights horizontal with ground and moving higher into sky, pivot into vertical position, begin twisting and then vanish|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58357.html|122|ndxe200708| Four white lights horizontal with ground and moving higher into sky, pivot into vertical position, begin twisting and then vanish<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today, Thursday August 23rd 2007 my coworker told me that last night (early in the morning of the 23rd) he had a UFO sighting while out on a joy ride with his cousins.  There were four individuals in the car at the time of the sighting and I interviewed each of them separately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They went on a late night drive to Border Field State Park (this park is located in the extreme SW corner of the continental United States, on the border with Mexico).  After a run-in with a Border Patrol officer they drove east on Monument Road, which turns into Dairy Mart Rd as the road turns to the north.  It was along that road that they noticed a building with a sign that read “Area 50” and another with a sign that read “Area 51”.  Some references to the real Area 51 were made as they continued north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they reached Camino de la Plaza road they turned right, and began to head slightly southeast.  It was my coworker (a passenger in the car) who noticed lights to the northeast.  Later holding his hand out at arms length, he guessed that it would’ve taken four fingers to block out the lights.  He thought that there were five yellowish white lights, but all the other eyewitnesses believed there to be only four white lights.  My coworker at first jokingly shouted to the others that there were the aliens.  The lights were positioned in the sky horizontally and parallel to the ground.  They were equidistance from one another.  The lights then moved in unison higher into the sky, keeping parallel with the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was what the lights did next that surprised everyone and made them take what they were viewing more serious. From one end of this chain of lights, they pivoted like the hand of a clock and moved into a vertical position, now perpendicular to the ground.  The lights continued to go straight up.  They all got the impression that the lights began to twist once in this vertical position.  As it began to twist, the lights completely vanished.  My coworker was so amazed by this display that he called his aunt at 12:30 in the middle of the night to tell her what they just saw.  One eyewitness believes he could see the outline of a craft behind the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They also told me that the area near the border is a no fly zone, so this was indeed strange to see something like this.  My coworker said the lights were over a residential area and from looking at a map, he believes it was north of Route 5.  It was this vertical trajectory that defied any logical explanation for the eyewitnesses.  They are completely baffled by what they saw and plan to go back and see if they are able to see it again.  They did drive down Camino de la Plaza road to see if they could see it again, but they had no further sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They move very slowly and then it dropped a sec. one from it and they both hoover for a moment and burn out.

I was sitting on my patio watching the night sky around 9pm.  I looked up to see a very bright light slowly moving across the sky.  As it approached me I could see that it was an extremely bright diamond-shaped light. I quickly noticed that it didn&#39;t have the typical green and red navigation lights of an airplane.  It certainly wasn&#39;t a helicopter.  It wasn&#39;t a tea lantern (as if somebody would be crazy enough to send one up during this summer drought).  It made no sound and flew slowly from west to east and disappeared behind the tree line.  There were airplanes with typical navigation lights flying in the distance as this object flew over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The extreme brightness of the object is what caught my eye.  It was similar to the brightest lightbulb light you could ever imagine.  It was more clear white than blue-white or yellow-white.  At arm&#39;s length and holding my thumb up for comparison, it was about the size of an pencil eraser and was diamond shaped. What could it be?  It was not anything man-made that I&#39;ve ever heard of.  I&#39;m reporting this in hope that if other people saw this object, they will do the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were in a beach front room, so our balcony was overlooking the ocean. We were out on our balcony (on the 18th floor) because we were smoking a cigarette and we were trying to see lightning as it hit the ocean. It was a stormy night but we could see some stars still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So my friend looked off to the left of our balcony, so he was looking north, and he spotted these 2 red-orange ovals in the sky. Then he pointed them out to me. They were fairly small just a little bigger than the stars, we couldn&#39;t hear any noise from them. They were traveling from North to South (from the left to the right of our balcony). It was hazy out, so they were not bright at all. Kind of a dim red orange glow. At first I thought they were just airplanes, but they moved in an irregular way. They moved very slowly, and the did not stay the same distance from each other. They did somewhat of a dance around each other, getting closer and further from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them do this slow dance all the way across our view of the sky, but as they moved south they also moved out over the ocean further (east). Eventually, about 10 or 15 minutes after we first spotted them, they faded too far into the horizon to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

It was “cigar” shaped (thin rectangle with rounded edges). Its speed and angle seemed comparable to an airliner at first, but there was no con trail anywhere in behind it. No sound was heard even after taking into account the time delay in hearing a jet flying over. I pointed it out to a friend. We both considered that it might be a normal aircraft, but out here, if you can see it you will here it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and checked a web site that displays aircraft flights and the only flight near our area was going south, not west.

Okay I know I’m not crazy but what I saw tonight at 8:08 PM is pretty scary if you think about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside looking to the SW sky hoping to catch a glimpse of the Space Station. Time for this was supposed to be around 9:00 PM CST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this light moving in the sky and then it made a very sharp right turn and headed straight over the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’d like to know if any air traffic controller at Lebanon’s airport noticed this anomaly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sounds astounding huh?  But I swear on mom and dad’s grave that what I saw was very real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I drew in 2 dimension what this all looked like and it is still in my journal. It was of a teardrop shape with the lights (bluish in color) along the lower body panel and were all the way around it. From the point where the light was moving from my left to right was maybe a distance of around 2 miles away from me. When that light turned at the very sharp right angle it came over my home as silent as if it had no engines at all but took less than 10 seconds to reach my home.  No sound at all!!  The lights I did see when it went over my head were very florescent blue.<n>

Velson noord, Netherlands.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59018.html|134|ndxe200708| 2 bright orange lights followed by a 3rd, heading south to north then disappearing into the sky. Velson noord, Netherlands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw 2 bright orange lights (followed a minute later by a 3rd) coming from an approximate south, heading north along the same route as the airplanes landing at Schipol airport.  Once they had just passed overhead they seemed to stop moving in that direction and slowly started to fade, so I assumed that they were going straight up into the sky.  The 3rd one did exactly the same.  Whilst they were still clearly visable at least 2 airplanes came within quite a close range.  They were all a bright orange colour with no other lights that I could see.  The time of the event that night is an approximate estimation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The night was mostly clear with scattered clouds.  Around approximately 23:30, my associates and I were astonished to observe a dim, brief, yet prominent flash of light which illuminated the entire sky. The flash of light was accompanied by what appeared to be a spherical, orange to red explosion at high altitude, directly above us. The entire incident lasted not more than 2 seconds and was not accompanied by any audible sound such as a sonic boom or a pressure wave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The phenomena appeared to be very similar in appearance to explosions I have seen in documentary videos of high altitude / low-earth orbit thermonuclear detonations, except the flash and fireball which my associates and I observed on the night of August 21st was particularly small.  There were no perceivable electromagnetic interruptions or interference to electronic devices around us such as my cell phone or nearby streetlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In terms of our backgrounds and personal profile, I am 27 years old, and I possess a master of arts in political science and humanities, as well as a bachelor of arts in political science and public administration. I work in local government.  My associates are also my co-workers, and are currently undergraduate students at a local university.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have seen a few weird things in the sky in the past few years but mostly just solid white lights that move quickly from east to west when the normal air traffic flow is north and south in this area. Last night I looked up to the sky to the north/east and immediately saw three very bright red strobes in the shape of a triangle. I noticed that the stars were blocked out in the middle and it was just black. The strobes were constant with no black out at all. The object was slowly moving from east to west/northwest. There was no sound at all. This object had to have been either very large or extremely close. I tend to believe that it was a combination of both. I opened my front door and called to my wife who was inside the house. She came out but the lights were to distant and she could not see them. She then called to me and stated &#34;did it look like that?&#34; I looked to the north east sky and saw a second group of lights that was exactly like the first and following the same path. It was once again three very bright red strobes in the shape of a triangle. We watched this set of lights pass overhead the same as the first until they went out of site to the north west. I would beleive that they were military related only because I witnessed a similar type incident in the 80&#39;s late at night when a very strange shaped craft passed overhead in plain view of at least two witnesses. Both were full time law enforcement officers same as I. The next morning there was breaking news announcing the brand new B-2 stealth Bomber. My wife and I are now both real estate professionals and non drinkers for the most part.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a green and a red light hovering above the highway.  They did not move at all.  I first saw them from probably 0.5 miles away.  It caught me as being very strange that there would be some craft hovering above the highway.  There was no white light or spotlight - just the green and red lights.  As I approached it, I turned off my radio and opened my window - wondering if it was a helicopter.  However I did not hear any noise other than the usual highway traffic noise.  I would estimate it was about 150 - 200 feet above the highway.  As I passed under it, I could not make out any detail other than the lights.  I drive this route 4 days per week and have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

This craft hovered for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing below the tree line.  We were both stunned that the object was in full view and seemed to be right in the landing path of incoming flights; several planes came in over the craft while it was present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These three (or maybe it was just one on the move?) had red and white blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Boyfriend looked directly up from our vantage point and pointed out what he described as a bar-of-soap shaped object with a satellite that looked like a glowing white orb.  I did not witness this particular object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am located just south of center-city with a direct view of the Charlotte city skyline and often sit on my deck at night.  I have witnessed these things for months (and often grab the binoculars and my boyfriend to witness - if nothing more than for confirmation that I’m not seeing things), most of the time over the airport or in the northeastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects have appeared nightly for months until about the second week of July, and were gone completely until this week when they reappeared.  They are most often saucer or disk shaped with blinking lights or steadily but dimly glowing orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was yellow lighted with an orange dot in the middle. Then it changed to a very bright purple with red dots at each corner. It was a large triangler shaped object then all of a sudden it emitted pink beams of light. This was on August 21, 2008 on a Thursday night at about 7.45 P.M. I saw the object and then it was going west and then disappeared. I went in the Indian Restaurant to eat dinner and when I came out it was gone it made no sound it was a very clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It might have been an airplane, but I could not discern any wings, as I was amazed at how it resembled a saucer as seen from it&#39;s side. It was about 2 oclock high from where I was, and was angling upwards and away from me at about a ten oclock trajectory, perhaps five miles away. I was driving Southbound on I-25 North of the I-70 intersection, and just north of the 58th avenue overpass. I had just gotten onto I-25 from I-76 when I saw it. It was traveling toward the East (perhaps directly in line with, and above I-70), but then started traveling South East, till it diminished out of my sight. I saw it for about a full minute, as it was in constant motion. I have been very skeptical of saucer sightings till now. That was a very eery sight. I just wonder if anyone else had seen it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a large white rectangular object about 5 degrees higher than the highest buildings of downtown.  It looked like a large playing card.  At first I thought it might be a large banner being pulled behind a plane.  But the object was immense, at least 300 feet by 200 feet.  I looked for a tow plane but could see none.  Plus such a large object could not be towed behind a prop plane.  As I watched it slowly moved in an arc.  It seemed to be turning to the left from my perspective.  As it travelled in the arc, it seems to shrink in size, as if you were to take a playing card and slowly turn the flat edge perpendicular to youself.  As it reached the edge, it simply disappeared.  I kept watching for it to turn again but it never did.  It was simply gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was one other car in the vicinity traveling in the same direction. That car had 2 occupants (male and female, I believe).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Off to the right ride of the Interstate, there were some hills a few hundred meters away. A bright white-yellow light became apparent over the hills in my peripheral vision. I turned to watch the light, moving much faster than my car (70mph) and at least 200 meters away. It was traveling in a mostly S direction (the same as my car), streaking down in a 30-40 degree angle, and fast approaching the hills. At first I thought it was a crashing plane, but the speed and the angle of the motion resembled no plane that I have ever seen. The trajectory was completely smooth. The size of the light was far too big to be a shooting star. As it approached the hills, the light&#39;s speed slowed dramatically. Then the light disappeared completely, perhaps falling below the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the light disappeared, I slowed my car down considerably to study the hills. There was no smoke, no sound, nothing. The other car traveling near me slowed down as well. We were both going between 30 and 40 mph. I looked into the front of the other car and the two occupants were both looking towards the hills as well. I felt that they had seen the light as well and were also trying to make sense of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (The reason I am posting this now is that I just read about this site).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was about centered between Megrez and Phad, the two stars on the side of the Dipper near the &#34;handle&#34; and slightly out of line with them to the west. There was no star or planet there the night before and the sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it looked too bright and too twinkly. I thought it may be an airplane with its landing lights on but as I stared at it it did not move. It did appear &#34;twinkle&#34; a lot more than any of the other stars. I moved back and forth west to east and back a 100ft or so,  to try and get a feeling of how close it was. It did not appear to change its position relative to the nearby stars. It must have been very high up, possibly not even in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I was about to say &#34;Hmm&#34; and go inside, it changed from its bright white twinkly color to yellow and through to red and made a clockwise spiral that decreased in radius as it moved toward the SSW (toward the star Mizar in the middle of the &#34;handle&#34;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movement was so rapid it appeared to leave a trail to my eyes. The yellow to red color got dimmer as it spiraled off to the southwest. It disappeared in only a second after it moved, so the spiral was visible for a short time, but it was not very long.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58304.html|153|ndxe200708| 2 very bright oval objects viewed in the sky over Lafayette Oregon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to start by saying that I have never seen an unidentified flying object before that I could not quickly explain away as something explainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August 20th, 2007 at 9:50 p.m. I stepped out on my deck to have a cigarette. We just had our first real rainy day of the summer and the evening sky was mostly cloudy, but clearing up. I noticed the moon partially obscured through the clouds to the southwest looking from Lafayette Oregon south-southwest towards but between if you will, McMinnville and Salem Oregon. The moon was not a full moon, but a quarter moon and it was low in the sky. Directly to the west-northwest of the moon in the sky there was a large break “Spot or Hole” in the clouds where I could clearly make out or see the stars. I would say that this break in the sky was approximately 3 to 4 miles long by 2 to 3 miles across. I was just about to light my cigarette while looking at the stars through the break in the clouds when I saw a large Oval shaped object move very fast from west to east across the break in the clouds. The oval object was a solid white to aqua blue in color. Not transparent. No flashing lights could be seen associated with this oval object. This object moved very quickly across the break in the clouds. I quickly tried to explain it away when, a second large oval object of the same description moved very quickly across the break in the clouds in the same direction. I do not feel that what I saw was something normally seen in the night sky. I.E. a satellite or commercial jet aircraft. These object were moving way to fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Closing notes: Each object was seen for about 8 to 10 seconds.  In my opinion I feel that these objects were Not personal aircraft, military aircraft, commercial aircraft, shooting stars, or satellites. These oval objects were larger then commercial aircraft by a least two fold. No sounds could be heard I.E. engine sounds. There were no “Flashing Lights” associated to these objects. There were no “Streaks” of light trailing these objects. I would place these oval objects at 5 to 10 thousand feet in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and STS??  PD))<n>

8/20/07 21:00|Arivaca|AZ|Light|1 hour|On the 20th we observed three objects enter the atmosphere headed in a northerly direction.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58378.html|155|ndxe200708| We are seeing increasing mumbers of these occurences. On the 20th we observed three objects enter the atmosphere headed in a northerly direction. We could clearly see thenm  leave the sunlight as they dropped, one flashed when it entered. About 30 min. later we watched two rise out of the atmosphere in a southerly direction and accelerate until no longer visible, about 10 seconds. On a moonless night or when the moon is low, you can sit and watch about 30 degrees from straight up and start observing these objects almost any night you want feel you have a bit of patience. We have watched them change directions, move up and dowm. follow each other, skip off the atmosphere and leave a &#34;smoke?&#34; trail, etc. We have even witnessed one being chased by two F-16s under full afterburner in a circle around the valley which is about 8-10 miles wide. You want to see UFos just send someone with a camera down around Arivace and look to the skies on a dark night. It is amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way. The entire area is known for it&#39;s wierd ability to drain cell phones that have a full charge in just a few hours or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He no sooner left than I spotted this perfectly spherical (with just a hint of wings, like the rings of Saturn) object.  It was fuzzy looking like a tennis ball, medium dark grey in color.  There were no lights of any kind, and no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came from the West, just passing over the Oquirrh Mountains, and headed straight east over the Wasatch Mountains. It travelled the 25-35 miles from the tops of one mountain range to the other in about 30 seconds, in a perfectly straight line, like it was on rails.  It was about 1000 feet in the air by my best estimate.  At that altitude it would probably be 50 to a hundred feet across. There were no contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no wind and it did not behave like a balloon.  The air was calm and warm, no storms around.  It travelled at the same constant, fast speed.  30 miles in 30 seconds is a mile a second or 600 miles per hour.  I watched it until it started to disappear behind trees, then I ran to the street out front and continued to watch it disappear over the Wasatch Mountains.  I called the local newspaper the next day to see if anyone else had reported this UFO.  No one had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The significant thing was that it crossed perpendicular to the airlines landing pattern, which was very near to my location, and at the same general altitude, making it very dangerous to air traffic. To me that indicates something very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired Marine Corps Officer, 69 years old, physically fit and have 20/20 and 20/10 eyesight, and a Masters of Business degree.  This was my first UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

8/20/07 04:30|Middleton|WI|Other|10 minutes|Column of flashing white lights|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58674.html|165|ndxe200708| Column of flashing white lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never seen a UFO before but I’ve always wanted too.  I’m a skeptic but a believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident occurred on my way to work at 0430 between Waunakee, Wi. 53597 and Middleton, Wi. 53562.  As I was driving on county hwy K and heading west between county hwy Q and US hwy 12, I saw a column of lights that resemble the broadcast towers that dot the west side of Madison, Wi. which is adjacent to Middleton.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, I instinctively interpreted this column of flashing lights as one of the broadcast towers off in the distance.  This thought did not follow through in my mind though.  As soon as I focused on the road ahead again I immediately returned my gaze to the lights again.  This was not hard to do for the traffic at 0430 is nonexistent.  I was able to slow my car speed and observe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I observed was a tower of flashing white lights not far off in the countryside.  My calculated guess would be about ¼ - ½ mile.  The countryside here is farmland – dark as night can be.  I always enjoy viewing the stars at this time of morning on my way to work. There are few things that I enjoy better than the night sky.  I must say that after I concluded that what I was seeing was a possible UFO mimicking a TV tower, I burst into laughter at the thought of concealment by looking like a tower of lights.  Beautiful!!  This column continued to move in a westerly direction as I turned toward Middleton on to US hwy 12 heading south.  I didn’t stop to view it any longer as I continued on into work.  Sooo….it was observed by me for approximately 10 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just recently decided to report this observation because I believe that what I saw was not part of the normal fauna of my path to work.  I also continued to look each morning thereafter at the towers that do exist there and the distance and size they actually are.  They are extremely further away to my sighting and observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t count the number of flashing lights but they were all flashing white.  The height of the light tower I find difficult to estimate but will guess at between 100 -200 yds.  As for closeness to the ground;  It was definitely off the ground.  I will not try to guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The light was very bright white not blinking and it was not a plane, as i was laying there it flew directly over me and i could see the outline.  It had all white lights and looked like a diamond made no noise but maybe a little hum.  As i was watching it move erratically in the sky very slow moving side to side as it was  moving straight.   The weird thing is i had my cell phone on my chest and my phone started making a noise kinda screechy like noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got kinda spooked and left, as i was driving home on the highway i seen it again and it was lower in the sky and brighter.  There is a lot of air traffic around here as Stewart airport is about 45 min across the river from here and is used by the military also for cargo planes.  This was not a military plane or a commercial airliner.  I have been told that this area the Hudson valley has had a lot of ufo sightings. i have heard friends stories of things they have seen, I did not know what to believe until i seen this !  i told my friend about it and he told me to report it. he said he seen something last April of 2010 around the same area on Skidmore rd.<n>

It was surrounded by a light orange glow and it made no sound.  I was watching it fly for about 5 or 6 seconds and then all of a sudden, I could hear like the sound of a electrical short circuit and a buzzing sound and then I saw white sparks fly and then the craft was just gone. no trace of it.

One was following the other one and they were maintaining a very even distance. At first we thought that they were planes, but we noticed that they weren&#39;t blinking like planes usually blink. So we kept watching them, and all of a sudden, the one in the back appeared to divide into 2, and the second light separated from it very quickly and appeared to go towards the ground. We lost the third light in the trees, then very soon after the original two that we were watching disappeared behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS in formation with Space Shuttle??

They were silent unblinking lights and appeared to be at a very high altitude.  1 light followed the other (maybe several hundred feet apart), one behind the other.  The distance between them or speed never varied...they were perfectly aligned and travelling in a West to East direction.  After watching them travel across the sky for approximately 1 to 2 minutes, the first light dimmed and disappeared and a moment later the second light completely vanished.  It was a clear night with very little cloud cover.  It was a little unsettling because neither of us could think of a rational explanation for what it could have been.

They did not have any blinking lights, rather bright white objects following each othe very quickly.  As I watched, I got up from my chair and noticed the objects getting dimmer as the appeared to travel away.  Airplanes would have remained visible, these two just vanished.

Planes?” I looked to where he was pointing. It was to the two bottom stars of the big dipper. There were 2 bright lights traveling across the sky from west northwest to the east southeast. They were not flashing. They did not have any color like an aircraft light. These were single lights. The distance apart was approximately 3 inches at an arms length. They did not change direction nor did the space between them change from what I could see. They were traveling much faster then any aircraft that I have ever seen and the lights were much brighter. The total time they were in my view until out of view was no more then 90 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they passed overhead I did not here any engine noise as from an aircraft. I told my son that it is probably the ISS or possibly the shuttle but today I looked up their orbit at the time and they were nowhere near the west coast of California last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not identify them as any kind of craft.

We saw an unusual amount of activity 3 shooting stars. Then we saw one bright light slowing moving across the sky. It was a bright circular light obviously not a plane then it disappeared in the distance.  Then about 5 minutes later two similar circular lights appears over the west sky traveling eastbound above us in perfect formation. It could not have been planes or they would have hit each other. These were two circular bright lights traveling one after the other in perfect formation.  They traveled over us going eastbound and then disappeared around the same area the first light disappeared. We called our daughter out to see and we all agree that these lights were not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But something was strange with this plane, It was traveling extremely high up in the sky, and at first I thought it was a plane, but what plane could travel that high in the sky and that fast?  Then, after i saw the initial light, a second just as bright light was following maybe 10 kilometers away from the first...Moving at the same speed! I ran inside to get the camera, and by that time the two lights which were traveling North to South had passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone I was with were in shock, and we have no idea what to think about this. Stars would not be flying so close to each other at the same speed and the chances of seeing 2 shooting stars following each other could be hardly possible. There were no tails on these lights, and they did not lose brightness intensity at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please if you could email me back it would be greatly appreciated.<n>

The road is Old Springville Road in Birmingham, Alabama, in a part of town called Clay, in Jefferson County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were about driving down Old springville road, and were about to pass a townhome community named Sommersby. When turning the curve right in front of Sommersby my wife ectstatically yelled, &#34;Look, Look right there.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we both saw was very surreal and chilling.  Off in the distance some 100 yards away, and about 50 ft above this particular grouping of town homes a multileveled, disc-like, object hovered.  It had rectangular lights solidly lit around the perimeter of the disc. It was saucer shaped, and appeared to have four banded levels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately drove into the neighboorhood to get a closer look, but upon doing this the craft must have been aware and either manuvered away to fast to observe, or cloaked itself.  The real scary thing about this event is that we have seen a disc hovering above this same group of houses before several months ago. It was a nearly identical disc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am afraid for the people of this neighborhood, and can only wander have they seen this too being in such closer proximity than myself on the road?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot certify that this is a serious report.

We both noticed an object slowly rising over a ridge of foothills between Vacaville and Fairfield, CA.  The object was a bright white-yellowish light and its shape changed as it changed direction.  As the traffic was heavy it took us about 90 seconds to travel the distance between the two roads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially it had a diamond like polygon shape and I thought it was a cloud.  My son said it was moving too quickly to be a cloud, but not quickly enough to be a plane.  It was an extremely bright light.  As it rose vertically, the leading edge lost its rectangular shape and became rounded.  It was trailing a bright jet trail.  Then it turned to the south (left) and became sickle-shaped, still trailing a jet trail.  As it completed the turn, it flattened and narrowed and became straight in shape, still trailing a jet trail.  At that point it picked up speed, and was on a slightly angled upward path.  By this time I was at Alamo Drive and we lost view of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son is 12 and fascinated with airplanes.  His grandfather was a pilot who flew for the military and World Airways.  My son just had his eyes tested at 20/20.  I am 51 years old and a volunteer at the Vacaville Police Department.  Neither of us has ever reported a UFO before and we don’t know anyone who has ever claimed to see one.<n>

Then lost sight for about one minute. Object suddenly reappears seemingly much lower, flying at very high speed towards E-SE, completely noiseless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on frequent airplane sightings in the area (nearby Trudeau airport is quite busy) this object flew at least twice as fast as other commercial airplanes - if at the similar altitude.

There was a loud propeller airplane, a unique design that had wings in the rear of the fuselage, probably flying out of San Carlos airport.  I looked at the plane and noticed a stationary flickering speck in the sky.  Foster City is the approach to SFO, and there is no way what I saw was a commercial aircraft.  It was a stationary flickering.  The weather condition was brilliant sunlight facing the object, a quarter moon visible, clear blue sky.  I pointed to the object and mentioned to an elderly male and female couple with a small white leashed dog to look, and had a line of sight to the object, they mentioned it must be the plane that flew overhead seconds earlier, they made no effort to locate the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We parked on the top of the garage...the very top level.  We were about to get out of the car when we  looked up in the sky and at first I saw a light.  It was a clear night.  We noticed it was not a plane and it was not a star.  At first it was hovering in the air, then it became clear to see it was an object and it had a shape. It started to move left to right and back and forth for a few seconds...then it disappeared behind a cloud.  Then it came from behind the clound.  It was dark ...its shape was like a saucer.  I tried to reach in the back seat of the car to get the video camera, but as soon as I was about to press the record button...the object started to leave.  It was very visable until we got the camera out.  It seemed to fade away after I was about to get it on video.  Then it took off at an unblievable speed.  At that exact moment, it started to thunder and rain.  From the same cloud it disappeared behind, came a lightening.  It only rained for only about one minute.  Its rare for it to rain in Florida at that time of day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I watched it for the two seconds that I saw it. When I saw it, it was not something that I have seen before. That was why it captured my attention. It was a triangle shape, but it was dark so the triangle shape was configured by conecting the red lights produced by the object. If I knew how to draw this shape I would but I can&#39;t on the computer so just know that it looked almost like the publicised &#34;Arizona Lights&#34;, only it looked farther away. It looked liked it was at the same altitude as a passenger jet. But it was moving much faster. It didn&#39;t leave a trail like meteor, and it didn&#39;t look like it was on fire. What could it be? The red lights where in configuration of, five lights coming to a vee and two lights occupying the wide space of the vee.<n>

I have seen tonight NINE, repeat NINE, of these objects in my immediate vicinity. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE WITNESSED THIS MANY OBJECTS [AS DESCRIBED ABOVE] IN ONE EVENING. These are NOT any known aircraft. These are totally stationary objects.  There is a nuclear power plant within 7 direct miles of my residence.

As I face due north in my backyard, FIVE objects are dispersed in the east and northeast quadrants.  A SIXTH is to my northwest (near the power plant), a SEVENTH AND EIGHTH are due west and the NINTH is to my southwest.  I live under the &#39;southern air traffic turn around&#39; for Charlotte-Douglas Airport. To-date, not a single commercial aircraft has appeared to deviate away from the objects, even though most of the objects appear to be in or very near to the air traffic pattern. Also to-date, there has not been a single military aircraft come into this area to &#39;inspect or challenge&#39; these objects.  My guess is that the presence of these objects is known to ATC and the government and these objects are being allowed to remain &#39;on station and unchallenged.&#39;  What other rationale could there be?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a hoax.

I observed an object that looked like a two rounded cubes connected and slowly rotating while rising very slowly. I could only see it with binoculars. There was a second object farther away at 11 o&#39;clock to the closest object. Definitely not kids balloons. The reason my friend called was that he saw 3 jets from the Portland airbase flying around a couple of dots in the sky. I didn&#39;t see the planes but I heard them. At the distance I saw the closest object, I would say it was about the size of helicopter, but I have no reference point to be certain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I spotted a silver object hovering in the sky. Taking it for a plane, I returned my focus to the road. But within a few seconds, I glanced up again to see where the plane had moved to and it was still in the same spot. I watched it with full concentration, thinking perhaps it was a plane flying toward me, so it would soon get bigger as it approached. But it didn&#39;t. It stayed in the same exact spot. As I observed it longer, I noticed it was round in shape, not long and thin like an airplane and bright silver against the sky. I had to return my attention to driving again but when I returned my gaze, thinking the unidentified object was probably gone, it was still there. This charade lasted about five minutes. I literally blinked and it had vanished. I searched around the sky as thoroughly I could but it was nowhere to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was headed in the direction of Mather Air Field, so I assumed it was a large military plane. As I continued to look at it I noticed that it was not moving fast enough to be an airplane. It was so low in the sky that it should have been moving very fast. I could not make out any wings or tail, just a defined object, white in color, not glowing in any way, with a silver/metallic edge around the bottom and sides. It was shaped like a flattened (or squared) cigar, not completely tubular, and I could see the details of the shape in good detail. It was definitely a technological object—not cloudlike or organic in any way. It appeared to be hovering, possibly moving very slowly to the east. I was looking at the object through my front windshield for probably 30 seconds, as I was driving in slow traffic. I had to brake for traffic in front of me, and lost site of the object for a few moments, then found I saw it again through my driver side window.  I continued to look at the object hovering for another 20 seconds or so until traffic forced me to go forward, at which point I lost site of the object completely. It was as if it just disappeared—but I had to concentrate on the road so I can not say I saw it vanish—I just could not find it again. I thought it could have been a reflection in my window, but since I saw the same defined object from two different windows while craning my head around in the car, and since it was noon on a sunny day, it could not have been a reflection.  I can’t say how high it the sky it was, but I can say that I had the impression that it was the size of a school bus based on the detail that I could make out. No wings, no tail, no markings other than white on the top, silver/metallic on the bottom, with some contours and angular reflections on the bottom and sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have always been fascinated with the stars and take every available opportunity to look up at them while working.  So was the case today, August 18, 2007, like around 4:40am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and saw what I thought was a shooting star but immediately decided that it could not be one because it continued moving and was very bright.  I told my husband who immediately saw it.  We decided that it was impossible for it to be an airplane because it was moving very fast.  My husband looked down for a second and lost track of it, but I didn’t.  The light continued moving and suddenly began to turn, up and down and left and right, as if it was trying to avoid hitting something up there.  Eventually, I too lost track of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards my husband and I were talking about what we had seen and realized that we were looking at two different objects going on two different directions; his was going north and mine south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Baldy. It looked like pieces from the light were falling off or it might have been smaller, separate lit up objects that were dropping from it.  The falling objects disappeared quickly. The light at first appeared to be moving at a steady pace towards the North and upward but then suddenly started going South and coming down pretty low.  Then suddenly it disappeared.  I have witnessed the same orange light on at least 5 other occasions in the past 3 months.  The shape has always been the same but it has been much higher and moved in a diagonal zigzag much quicker then an air plane would be moving.  One time it was dropping something from it but it didn’t look as if the objects being dropped were lit up because I only saw the light from the main glowing light reflecting off what was being dropped.  I have no idea what this light could have been and other then these occasions I have never seen anything like it in the sky. If there is some explanation for it please let me know. Thank you<n>

That is when I saw the bright orange thing in the sky. It was closer than I had ever seen it before. It stayed in the same spot for probably about 3-4, doing absolutely nothing. Then it began to flicker and it seemed to be swinging something around itself that had 3 smaller bright orange things attached to it. That lasted about a minute and then it began to quickly move south. All of a sudden it stopped moving again and started to flicker once more. This time it began dropping what looked like little orange lights for about 5 seconds and then grew dim. It flickered again and got brighter and then began dropping little orange lights once more, but this time it began falling rapidly too. After about 10-15 seconds later it flickered and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I first saw the object, which was larger than all the stars, it was about 40 degrees above the horizon.  Within a few seconds I could tell that it was moving eastward, toward the area where my cottage is.  It did not move in a straight line the entire time that it moved eastward; it strayed a little several times from the course that it was on.  It was completely silent, and the intensity of the light, which was radiant, never noticeably varied.  After a minute or two the object was almost directly above my land; and when it was nearly overhead, it did not look far away: it did not look as high in the sky as commercial planes do when at cruising speed.  It seemed to me to be at an altitude of about 15,000 feet.  It looked about five times larger than all the orbiting satellites that I have seen, and I have seen many satellites.   In fact, at no time did it look like it was in outer-space.  (The only planet visible that night at the time when I saw the object was in the southern part of the sky, and it was probably about 30 degrees above the horizon.  I do not know what planet it was, but I do know from the white color of it that it was not Mars.) When the object was between 40 and 30 degrees above the eastern horizon, it grew invisible in a matter of seconds.  That it was not a blimp is certain.  ...To get an idea of the size of this sphere of light that I saw, get out a Q-Tip and hold it so that only the top half of the head of one of the tips is visible above your thumb and index finger, and then go outside and fully extend your arm up toward the sky.  (By the head of the Q-Tip I mean not just the soft part extending beyond the stem but also the part of the stem that has cotton wrapped around it—the “neck”.)   The object looked just a little smaller! than th at. ...By the way, I do not drink alcohol and I do not use drugs of any kind, prescription or illegal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It did this for about a minute and then slowly moved off in a straight line.  It was very cloudy that night so I knew it was flying low for us to be able to see it.   We think it may have been attracted by the big baseball field lighting.  My mother is 78 and I am the 9th of her 14 children and I am 46.  We are white, middleclass.

When she looked to her left, which was a westerly direction, she said, &#34;Boy, that balloon is really low.&#34; When I was finally clear of the barn doors I turned to my right to see this black sphere shape that was crossing the sky. I was trying to determine if it was a balloon as she said but due to the speed and the direction in which it was flying I thought that it can’t be a balloon. The sun was still up and had not yet set as I watched the object move across the horizon. The object maintained its shape and altitude the entire time and did not change from its black color. As I started to turn to the southeast direction I watched the object move.  You could see that the object was shiny as it caught the setting sun. The object crossed over the roof top of my neighbor’s house and then over a group of trees in the field across from our house. This gave me an idea of how high the object was. I would guess that it was between 800 feet to 1000 feet high. As it traveled northwest to southeast the object did not change from this altitude. The distance traveled was very quick.  Once it was over the field, which would have put the object directly in front of our house, it disappeared in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my husband and I were walking towards the house I noticed something in the sky above us. I couldn’t tell what it was so I asked him if he saw it, too. Together we watched it cross the sky right above us.  What we saw is best described as a black sphere. It was very visible to us; there was nothing else in the sky. It was clear in our field of view. At the same time we noticed it so did our dog as she began barking. There were no lights – no sound as it traveled – just a black sphere that traveled across the sky. It was flying north to south and at a fast speed. It flew horizontal, it didn’t move up or down in the sky just straight across in a direct path. Then it just disappeared – it didn’t go up into the clouds or disappear into the horizon - it was just gone. We saw it at around 8:45 pm - the sun was just beginning to set. We watched it for several seconds as we discussed what it could be. The height it flew was similar to the height of a low flying aircraft. The actual size of the sphere was hard to judge but it seemed smaller than any aircraft we see flying at that height.<n>

We were in Sweetwater (Hammonton), NJ.  The time was about 10:00 PM.  The sky was mostly clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being a city dweller, I am intrigued by all the stars that can be seen when in a rural area.  I was on a boat dock, looking approximately NE, at about 70-80 degrees from the horizon.  There was a fairly bright star that was sort of yellow in color.  Slightly below and to the left was a dimmer “star.”  The “star” moved in an erratic manner over a very small area.  Sometimes it would stand still.  Sometimes it would zig-zag and even reverse direction.  Brightness of the light changed as it moved.  All of the stars around it were stationary.  I pointed it out to someone who was with me and they confirmed my sighting.  We watched it for about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around a bit and spotted a second moving light while looking in a south-easterly direction, a little to the right of the glow from Atlantic City, and about 60-70 degrees from the horizon.  This moving “star” was also confirmed by the person with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the house and brought two other people outside.  They were unable to spot the lights.  We continued to watch the lights for several minutes.  Total time of the sighting was about 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After going home, I contacted an amateur astronomer.  He knew of no natural phenomenon that could cause what we saw.  Another person I discussed this with suggested search lights or a laser pointer he saw used in Australia to point out the constellations.  Both search lights and the laser pointers create a visible beam pointing to the sky.  The lights we saw had no &#34;beams&#34; leading to or from them.  Also, search lights cause a wide beam and a spot if they hit a cloud.  Air craft cannot move in this manner.  Any idea what we witnessed?<n>

At approx. 11:08 PM, I was in the outdoor pool floating on my back looking up at the sky. Near the constellation of Cygnus and Lyra, I saw a faint light (much like a faint star) moving south. There was no way for me to tell it&#39;s altitude nor it&#39;s speed, however, it&#39;s actual movement was puzzling. At first it was travelling south and passed by just west of Vega; it&#39;s speed was constant. Suddenly it stopped instantly for a short moment (maybe for 1/2 of a second), then instantly returned to its original speed in an easterly direction. When I saw it do this, the first thought that came to my mind was, &#34;am I really seeing this? Is this my imagination?&#34; Yet still, I was able to continue following the object through the sky. And for a second time, it stopped instantly without any negative acceleration for about 1/2 second. The object then resumed it&#39;s speed instantly without any acceleration almost due south before dissapearing out of sight still high up degree-wise in the sky. I spent another 10 mins looking up but did not see anything more after my first sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we were about to say goodbye and he was about to turn around and walk home, we saw a bright neon blue/green fireball like image in the sky that lasted for 2-3 seconds. It shot very fast and if it was orange or fire color, I&#39;d say we witnessed a meteorite. But because it was neon bright blue/green, it kinda spooked me. Figured I&#39;d write this and send it in. Upon checking online for a good place to document my sighting, I noticed that another person this month saw something very similar out in California. I drew a picture when I got back upstairs. It&#39;s too large to fit on my scanner but I could make a reduced copy on a color copier and then scan it to send in to you guys as a follow-up. Never saw a &#34;UFO&#34; before. And I&#39;m not saying this was an alien sighting or anything like that. Just that I did see something. My friend saw it and so did like 10 or so other people that were hanging around their front stoops on the block. That&#39;s Brooklyn.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/16/07 22:30|Plano|TX|Unknown|unknown|Multiple strange hovering lights seen in the night sky over Plano and Allen, Tx.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58226.html|221|ndxe200708| Multiple strange hovering lights seen in the night sky over Plano and Allen, Tx.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I were driving home from a local eatery at approximately 10:30 PM on August 16th 2007. The eatery is located on Preston Rd just south of George Bush Tollway. The route we took was to head north on Preston Rd and enter onto George Bush Tollway heading east. As we continued this way and reached the vicinity of Coit Rd to Custer Rd we witnessed three strange looking lights in the sky northeast of our location. We first thought maybe they are lights attached to a pole for construction work purposes, but as we approached closer we realized they were higher in the air, but not as high as you might expect a plane to be travelling. We then thought they were low flying planes, but the lights appeared to be brighter than what i&#39;m used to seeing and they did not appear to be moving. We continued to monitor the crafts as we transitioned from George Bush Tollway onto I75 heading north and noticed that there were more than just the original three crafts. As we made the change to I75 there were now 3 to the west, 3 to the east, 3-4 to the north, and 3 to the south as we traveled through Plano. On approach to the city of Allen, Texas we then observed 3 more in the distance to the north and 1 to the northeast. They all appeared to have lights like a plane would have ( red, blue flashing lights with a headlight), but the light seemed to always be facing us even as we changed directions and as mentioned before, they did not appear to be moving. Shortly after we arrived at our home in Allen, Texas I proceeded outside with my binoculars, but was unable to observe anything unusual within the airspace I was able to capture. My viewing space was limited due to homes and trees blocking most of my view. Was there some military action or police action? If so, then why was it not aired on the news? Was there excessive air traffic because of the Erin storm front? Again, why was it not on the news? I was not under the influence of any alcohol or mind altering drugs. I have no history of psychologica! l proble ms and was not excessively tired or drowsy. I have never seen anything like this in my life and have lived in the Dallas area for the large majority of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It flew across the sky then went down somewhere near sunrise highway. I feel it must of went down near Jones Beach. Then a bright light appear in a circle shape that was hovering in the same area where the greenish blue object fell. We followed the light to a open field and stood there watching what it was going to do. The circle shape started to rotate and around it, other lights in circular patterns appeared. A small circle came off of it and shot away fast. Two other small circular objects appeared near the big one, it stayed there for one hour, then vanished. During the whole event, the sky was different the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/16/07 01:00|Pensacola Beach|FL|Sphere|3-5 miunets|Bright orange balls of light flying in formation fading and reapearing over the water.  ((NUFORC Note:|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58358.html|229|ndxe200708| Bright orange balls of light flying in formation fading and reapearing over the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other night me and some guys from my church decided that we were going to ride out bikes out to  the old fort Pickens camp grounds on the island of Pensacola Fl.  It was very late around 12:45am to 1:00am and their were no lights.  Me and my friends had run out of navigate able road(the road was ruined in hurricane Ivan a few years ago.).  We had stopped for a break to drink a little water and rest for a few minuets, &#34;just enjoy the wind.&#34;  My two friends were facing to the west towards the fort and the darkness and I was a little ahead of them; only by a few feet.  I was facing to the east  in the direction of the part of the beach that has the tall buildings and bright lights.  We were taking and suddenly my breath was taken away by  8 to 12 bright orange lights maybe 7-10 miles (truly guessing) away.  I can say in all confidence that they were off over the water away from the resorts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at them as they shifted and danced in the sky.  They were perfectly spherical.  They started to dim and I realized that they were going to fade completely so I yelled.  I mean I just yelled and pointed.  By the time that my two friends had turned around the last two faded out and they did not see them.  I tried to explain it to them and when they turned around to ask if I was high(Iv never done any drugs I am completely clean).  I was trying to explain what I had seen when the lights reappeared and I pointed again they seemed closer and one more time they disappeared from sight just as they turned to see them.  And then a third time they appeared in the same place as the first time just as intense and in the same nature they shifted their formation. This time one of my friends turn and saw them and he too was dumb struck.  They all shifted north together and two by two faded while moving north(with the wind).<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the last we saw of them only two of the three of saw them and we didn’t see them or anything else strange.  We made it to the end of the island and then turned back because there was no where to spend the night. We saw nothing else out of the ordinary.  Oh and it seems important to let you know that the lights were completely silent.  Or rather we heard nothing at all when they were in the sky.  In retrospect I remember complete silence, but I was shell shock… well anyway thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pensacola, FL Sighting on Pensacola Beach<n>
8/16/07 00:10|Whitefield|NH|Disk|10 minutes|Saucer stopped and appeared to search for something before flying behind Mount Washington.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58395.html|230|ndxe200708| Saucer stopped and appeared to search for something before flying behind Mount Washington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after midnight, my teenage son was sitting alone on the veranda of the inn where we were staying while talking on his cell phone.  He noticed a dome-topped saucer-shaped object with three lights circling underneath fly silently over the valley just in front of him.  He tried to take a picture of the object with his phone, but, unfortunately, the picture didn’t come out.  The saucer came to a stop over a stand of trees and search lights illuminated the trees below as if the unseen occupants were looking for something.  The search lights ended abruptly and the object immediately flew off at a high speed and disappeared behind Mount Washington.  The object then reappeared next to the mountain a minute or so later.  My terrified son (who is quite skeptical about UFOs) came up to our room to wake us and get a camera.  My husband, daughter, and I followed him down to the veranda for a look.  The object still appeared next to the mountain. I stepped into the lobby to see if anyone else had seen the object.  Another hotel guest, who is a pilot, happened to be looking out the window a few minutes earlier and noticed a plane flying over the valley.  The pilot joked that the guy flying the “plane” must have been on a suicide mission as no pilot would fly so low through a valley surrounded by mountains in the pitch black of night.  I told him about the object my son had seen and he and his family came to watch it with us as it hovered by Mount Washington.  As we watched, it appeared that two small jets approached the object and disappeared behind the mountain.  The UFO disappeared shortly after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We spent some time with the other family speculating about what we had seen.  Because the UFO was absolutely silent, we eliminated many known aircraft.   We weren’t able to get a clear photo of the object as it was so dark and a good distance from us.  We didn’t see the UFO again.  Our kids were freaked out and insisted on leaving the next morning.  My son was left quite shaken by the incident and refuses to talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Within one second, it appeared further to the left, then disappeared. Within another second, it appeared further right, then disappeared. It did this for about 45 seconds. It looked almost as if it was blinking, but from one point in the sky to another. It was close enough to think it could have been one object, but then it disappeared. My friend noticed and we stood in awe and fear. The light was similar to that of a star, airplane, or satellite; but there is no way an airplane or satellite could move that far within the seconds of which we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I work a lot in the area and airplanes and helicopters never fly in that northeast to southwest direction, so I watched it. As it got overhead, the bright &#34;headlights&#34; turned out to be six white lights in a triangle shape on the underside. As it passed overhead, I also saw that the back two white lights, and also a red light in the rear middle, were blinking on and off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about the length and width of two fingers at arms reach and took about eight minutes to cover a distance of maybe five to seven miles. It seemed to move slowly, meandering in an S pattern, south, then west, then south again before I lost sight of it behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved almost out of sight to the southwest I then noticed airplane &#34;headlights&#34; moving underneith it by about a distance of seven times the size of the object flying northward in a strait and normal direction of flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a California licensed private investigator and was on a surveillance at the time.<n>

I have recounted the event to several people in casual setting without any sufficient explanation. I was unaware of such a place that I could record what I saw, that’s why I have never formally submitted what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 2007 I lived in Southern California in a town called Irvine. It’s a crowded city with lots of modern city development and is a “well off” expensive place to live. I was separated from my significant other and spent a lot of time waiting to pick up my daughter from her mother’s house so I would hang around different places until we could meet for me to pick her up. It was while waiting for my daughter one evening at a local park that I saw this UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Irvine has a park called “Colonel Bill Barber” park that is very well kept and has beautiful walking paths, tennis courts, and softball fields and playgrounds. I was walking between 9:00 and 10: PM at night in the summer time at a location on the walking path that was elevated 30 feet above the rest of the park. The walking path comes to a memorial on a hill where commemorative placards and a U.S. flag are displayed. From this point you can look out over the north side of the park with tennis courts to the right. The hill was not so high as to be able to see over the privacy netting of the tennis courts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While standing on this hill and facing north my attention was drawn to something out of the corner of my right eye. This area is well lit with amber colored lights on the parking lot and bright lights on the tennis courts. Some distance south of the tennis courts but within the boundary of the park two yellow orbs rotating in a counter clock wise rotation (as on the face of a clock) caught my eye. I stared at them in amazement and disbelief. They rotated keeping seemingly equal spacing from each other and constant rotational speed as these two yellow orbs moved from my right to left across in front and just above where I was standing. They gradually accelerated from the point where I first noticed them to the point just in front and to the left of me where they began to climb in altitude and vanish. The total distance the orbs traveled while I could see them was around 300ft and less than 100ft off the ground. I was feeling like I had just witnessed two spirits at play maybe! fascinated with the movements of the tennis ball at night? The orbs were moving with machine like precision so I also wondered if I had witnessed some type of energy from an engine source on some type of space craft. I also tried to reason if I was hallucinating?  There was no sound that I could remember other than the sound of tennis racquets striking tennis balls and the noise of cars and traffic on the nearby roads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe in extra terrestrial life. What I saw was unlike anything I have ever heard anyone describe except for sightings of colored orbs that have random movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I keep a trash can outside vehind the house to keep our plastic bottles. The boys were jumping around the house so i gave them each a plastric bottle to bring out back. As soon as i opened the door they both boleted out twords the back, I on the other hand stood in the door way looking up at the sky. We lived in the middle of a huge apple orcherd way out in the middle of no were so the stars are extremely visible at night. As i was looked up in front of me i see three orange glowing like fireballs traveling west they were pretty low just above the top of a pine tree that is in the yard. I noticed that there was no sound what so ever. In that instence i remembered my boys were out back so i ran back and told them to hurry and get inside, i have to say i was scared i then locked the doors and closed all the windows and shades and waited for my hus! bend to get home . The boys were confused at why i was closeing all the window but i didnt want to scare them so i tryed to stay calm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband at that time had taken a friend of ours to town wich was about 8 minutes away.  When he got home i told hin what i saw and he told me that on his way back from town he seen the same fireballs in the sky and he watched them until they disapeared. I dont know what it was that we both saw but i know it was something. I have had several experians sinse i was little and strange things have happend to me but this is still fresh in my mind and its amazing.<n>

Observing a thunderstorm over Chicago/Lake Michigan, with a lot of lightning. Saw a bright star like object directly over head (maybe 90 degrees from horizon) in a break in the clouds.  Object became brighter as if it were approaching the Earth, stopped and then rapidly became smaller as if it were moving away from the Earth. Finally it disappeared. this entire show lasted no more than 3 seconds.  At first I thought it was part of the meteor shower. But I have observed meteor in the past and this did not move like a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

BUT!!  As far as I know, the aircraft warning lights on all aircraft thoughout the world are consistant.  One bright white light in the front, lights on the wing tips, a blinking red light on the tail, and every jet that I&#39;ve seen takes several minutes to cross the sky.  I witnessed an object cross the sky in less than a minute without a single sound.  In addition, the warning lights were in the wrong place, the red light was in the front, plus the craft appeared to travel at angle inconsistant with normal aircraft.  It looked as if it were flying backwards at an angle.  The only aircraft that I know that can cross the sky in less than a minute is a satilite, and it&#39;s only a pinpoint of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The other maintainer that accompanied me on the trip had never been to Germany before and wanted to do a little sightseeing.  I have been to Germany several times and had never done any real sightseeing myself, so we decided to go for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, Germany has many castles and after doing some research, we discovered that there was a castle close by in the town of Landstuhl.  So we got a cab and took the 15 minute ride to Landstuhl Castle.  Well, unfortunately, we got there a little late and the casle had already closed for the day.  Since the castle was at a higher elevation, it provided some nice views for picture taking.  So I started snapping away.  We were offered a great view of the town of Landstuhl below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was taking pictures, a 747 aircraft was on final approach into Ramstein AB.  Of course, I didn&#39;t want the plane in some of the pictures, I waited for it to get out of the frame.  Digital cameras offer the option of taking pictures using the LCD screens rather than the view finders.  So I always use the LCD screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So once the airplace was out of sight, I snapped my picture.  Once a picture is taken, I have my camera set up to show the picture on the LCD screen for 5 second.  Then it goes back to live picture mode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was taking the picture, I didn&#39;t notice anything on the screen.  When I looked at the screen after I took the picture, I noticed a dark shadow, which had the appearance of a flying saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked up into the sky to see if I could see what had showed up in the picture.  Whatever it was, wasn&#39;t there anymore.  So I looked back at my camera, which had already gone into live picture mode again.  I then switched the camera into picture viewing mode to further exam the photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time, I showed to picture to my companion.  We were both in awe at the sight.  When I zoomed in on the shadow, it truly made me believe that I had gotten a rare photo of a UFO.  I checked the lens on my camera and there was nothing on it.  I did not wipe it down for fear of scratching it.  It did not show up in any other pictures that I took.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We have requested a copy of the photo, but have not received it.  PD))<n>

The ball was moving in a weird fashion. It would stand still, then quickly move straight up, then cut at an angle and move in a circular form. It then stood still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An airliner passed under it and passed pretty close. The airliner was coming from Philadelphia international and was heading east towards the NJ coast. I noted it to my girlfriend and she saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the airliner passed under it, it rose quickly, came to a complete stop, then shot downward very fast and disappeared below the treeline in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this sounds crazy, but i am an active duty Air Force Enlisted Aviator. I have 12 years flying experience, and I never saw anything like this.  I was blatantly unidentified and it was clearly seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was a beautiful blue and approximately 20 mile visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that the airliner was close enough to see it on radar or at least McGuire RAPCON as well as Atlantic City.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved down below the tree line in the location of southern Burlington County, NJ.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Something about the way they were moving, the way they looked like a match-head flame (but in a perfect ball) caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled into the Copper Hills Car Wash parking lot (which was empty).  I got out of my car and watched as they first turned in a direction heading toward Phoenix (I-17), weaving in and out of each others&#39; path, then (as if they knew I was watching them) they started heading toward me- toward the direction of downtown Prescott.  This was about 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, the sun was still out, the sky was bright and completely cloudless, so I could see them perfectly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were nothing but balls of orange light, flickering and roiling in hue, two or three times bigger than a plane.  They moved at a moderate pace, weaving (when I say that I mean, they weren&#39;t flying in a straight line), and as they passed overhead, one vanished completely (like a flame going out), then the other did, then one reappeared, then the other reappeared, then they each vanished completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared hard at them, but there wasn&#39;t even an outline of them- completely vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shaking, in complete disbelief at what I&#39;d just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was August, I know, but the exact day I can&#39;t be sure of, but 2007.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t do drugs, have no mental illness, and was completely sober.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It levelled off at about 100 feet from the ground and seemed to be picking up speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It banked suddenly away from us, then banked again to a straighter course, then gained more height and speed very rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;re both experienced observers of aircraft and the forward speed and altitude gain far surpassed any light, small vehicle we&#39;ve ever seen or heard of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within seconds the object was moving at well over 100 MPH (gauging by our own speed on the road).  We observed it while it travelled away from us at great speed, then disappeared from view several miles to the north and at least a mile above us, gauging by its visual size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very hard to tell how large the object was and whether it was &#34;manned&#34; due to its speed.  The closest description we can give is of some kind of very small ultralight flying machine that seemed to be constructed of just very thin metal bars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was of a completely stripped down vertical metal piece with one cross piece.  The ends of the cross piece seemed to have flanges, but it was hard to tell as it was banking, rising, and gaining speed very rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It couldn&#39;t possibly have been a radio-controlled toy and there didn&#39;t seem to be anywhere for a person to be sitting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could this be a small military drone?<n>

I was travelling south east of Drumheller on a not frequently travelled road.  I stopped to take a picture of a seam of coal in an embankment.  There was an odd looking cloud in the sky, kind of triangular shape.  I also noticed there was a craft within the cloud, it was not a typical air craft.  It was rectangular in shape, long, and higher than it was wide, and it was actually producing the substance that was forming the cloud, some of it which was falling to the ground somewhat like soap suds.  That is all I remember, but it did show up in the picture that I took.  This has been bothering me for years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second incident took place about five years ago in Ontario.  About 6:30 AM I was travelling to visit my daughter in the Listowell area, at trip that I have often made.  I was travelling west on highway 7A, I turned north onto highway 35 for about a mile and then west on Highway 7A again.  I remember going past the Yelverton side road, I always notice that sign just because of the name,  The next place I should have come to was Nestleton, but it didn&#39;t happen.  The next thing I remember, I was parked facing south on a side road east of Lindsay, about 30 miles NE of where I last remember being.  It was 8AM..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not asking you to do any investigating, I just want you to believe me.<n>

At 12:44 am on Wednesday, I head a loud noise that seemed to be overhead of my house. At first I thought nothing of this sound since I thought it might have been an airplane that low but that changed when I heard what appeared to be the engine sound vanished. I assumed that the plane had left but then I heard it the sound again so I rush to my bed to see what is going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I open the blind on my window to look outside to see what is going on. In the distance not that high up in the horizon slightly above the trees in my neighborhood were four round flashing white lights that were stationary objects at the time. They were flashing every second at the same time. There are no towers in this area I was looking at so I assumed it was some type of aircraft in the air not moving. But then one of the flashing lights on the west side started to move alarming fast toward the west. Did a quick reverse like slamming on the brakes. Then shot out of my line of sight. The other objects remained still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the other three objects began moving. These three objects were in the formation of a triangle and by moving increased the size of the triangle but seemed to keep the same angel on the shape. Then the objects left the area, it appeared as though they had turned off the lights. With this all of a sudden the sound I had heard had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/15/07 00:30|Glasgow (UK/Scotland)||Fireball|20 seconds|Witnessed an orange orb of light that appeared within a few feet of me in my house around 2007.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100888.html|254|ndxe200708| Witnessed an orange orb of light that appeared within a few feet of me in my house around 2007.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recently heard about the clusters of orange and red &#39;fire balls&#39; being witnessed all over America and that people were invited to contact yourselves regarding these strange orbs of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am from Scotland and myself came into close contact with one of these orbs of light around 5 or 6 years ago.  I will go into as much detail as I can as I feel it is better that I tell the entire story of what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me just first say that these orbs of light are NOT Chinese lanterns which many people claim them to be.  And I will now go on to tell you how I know this as a fact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was night time and I was alone in my bedroom one night around 5 to 6 years ago now, and I was listening to music on my computer.  At this time I was becoming a more spiritual person and was trying to listen to the music in a more spiritual, prayer type of way.  The best way for me to describe this was that I was focussing on my own internal energy, or soul, whatever you want to call it.  After a while of doing this type of meditation I crossed my room to turn my light out.  I then turned around and began walking to my bed but was stopped in my tracks by an orange ball of light that suddenly just appeared in front of me just a few feet above my own height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was terrified and couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it.  It was about the size of a tennis ball. It was such a brilliant orange glow, but the glow wasn&#39;t emitting like it would from a light bulb, but it was completely within itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure how else to say this, but I knew it was looking at me.  I just felt it in my being that whatever this thing was, it was alive and watching me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After around maybe 15 to 20 seconds it just shot down past me at an incredible speed and went straight through my floor. For it to be perfectly still for that small period of time then fly down straight through my floor to  me means it had to make that decision to move from being still to flying at an amazing speed.  So if it made that decision then it had to be alive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I promise this story is real and that I didn&#39;t just imagine or dream it.  Ever since I have been fascinated by them and would love to know what they are and where they came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again I would just like to emphasise that these lights are not lanterns or even part of a bigger craft like structure, although some sightings at night may very well be, but for the majority of the light orbs being seen in the  sky I believe to be independent balls of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, and I hope my experience in some way helps bring a little more clarity as to what these things might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We prolly laid there for about 2 hours just watching whatever these dots were, they were everywhere across the sky.

Only visible for a short duration.  Craft at 45 degree angle to my line of sight.  No clouds, low wind, good visibility except for leaves, branches, and trees around area.  Craft disappeared behind leaves, branches and was lost to sight.  Got up and moved to get a clearer view, but it was as if it became invisible or diapeared.  I have seen other phenomena in this area several times in the past few years, but didn&#39;t report them!  Location near Air National Guard base and not to far from WPAFB either.

It then moved again in a lateral move toward the west. (stopped) moved back.  The movements were obvious, deliberate and seemed to have moved in several directions as discribed above at least ten times.  I am not a mathematician and cannot tell you how many degrees it moved.  I can only say, that if one were looking up at the stars above it would move what seemed to be a foot or two from its posistion.  We watched until my teenage grandaughter becames so afraid She ran into the cabin.  I went in to comfort her.  Do satellites move like this.  Just curious.  What I saw was not a star. Looking to the sky on that very clear night it just looked like a star brighter than the others. It seemed to be the same plane as the other stars.  Just thought I would report.  More for the reason that I would like to know if we can see satellites with the naked eye in the night sky and do they move like the above described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> please any correspondence to ((e-address deleted))<n>

I stopped to look at it ,it did not move like for 4 mins and then i suddenly saw it moving from north east direction to south west .When it flew over me , there was no noise at all , I looked up saw a diamond shape more like rhombus with bright lights at each end and in the center. i am reporting it late after seeing o many videos on youtube which I happened to see accidentally .Now I can say it was an UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We live in a small town and our backyard is very dark.   I enjoy going out to the hammock and just relaxing for a while before going to bed.  But on this night I looked up and saw a sky full of stars so I grabbed a patio chair and decided to recline in it and just stargaze for a while.  The hammock is under trees and I’m unable to see the stars from there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One very bright start caught my attention and I had been focused on it for a while when my partner came out to join me a few minutes before 10:00 p.m. EST.  He reclined in another chair and we talked about how clear the sky was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a couple of shooting stars and made remarks about them but I kept going back to this very bright star.  As I lay back focused on this one particular star it just vanished right before my eyes.  I didn’t say anything at first thinking a cloud may have covered it but then I noticed a very faint light, possibly a satellite, moving across the sky from south to north.  As I continued watching this faint light it intersected exactly where I had seen the star.  At this point I commented to my partner that the star I’d pointed out earlier had just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to look in that area of the sky I noticed another faint light moving, this time from north to south and again it intersected the point where the star had been located and continued to move across the sky till it was out of sight.  My partner noticed this moving object and we wondered if it was a satellite.  There were no strobe lights, nothing bright about it.  It resembled a very faint star moving pretty fast across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 2 minutes of the star vanishing before my eyes and seeing the two faint objects moving across the sky we both saw a crescent shaped object moving from northwest to southeast at a very high rate of speed.  We both pointed at the same time and said, &#34;Do you see that?&#34;  It seemed to be an amber color, very dimly lit and no running lights or strobes, it just seemed to glow.  My partner wondered if the light was reflection of the towns light on the underside but as I mentioned earlier, this is a small town and it’s pretty dark.  I couldn’t estimate the altitude although my partner said it appeared to him about the height of an incoming passenger plane.  It was so fast as it flew above and completely silent.  I was still curious about the disappearing star and the other two objects that when I saw this object it was a complete surprise.  From our view point it we were able to clearly see it for about 5 seconds before it was beyond our viewing range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept putting off this report but the sighting is something I think about everyday.  It’s still very clear in my mind.  I still go out almost every night before bedtime and I spend my time looking to the sky.<n>

We noted a small pinpoint of light traveling quickly from the flash’s point of origin. The object was too high to be a plane and silent. It traveled in an arc overhead at a steady rate of speed from South to North until we lost sight of it over the mountains into Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We originally thought that it might be the space shuttle, but after checking the NASA channel realized the shuttle was still docked at the space station and not orbiting. We are first time posters and have never seen anything prior to last night to warrant a report. Interested to know if other people witnessed anything similar in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took the picture with a cell phone camera as I was driving and I took three pictures and the &#34;octagonal&#34; object in question was in the 2nd picture I took and was not present in the 1st picture. I could not see this object with my naked eye as I tried too locate it after seeing it in my focus before I took the 2nd picture. I could only see it through the display screen of my cell phone camera. It seemed to be far away but it appeared to be a huge object somewhat &#34;octagonal&#34; in shape so that&#39;s why I chose &#34;spherical&#34; on your report site. I travel this road daily to and from work in Louisville, Ky. This is my first time experiencing something unusual like this so I thought I would share it with you. Maybe it&#39;s explainable but I cannot explain why it appeared and dissapeared so quickly in my camera view but yet I could not see it with my naked eye!<n>

I sat there looking not believing what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at my daughter and asked her what the heck is that in the sky.  She looked up from her laptop and saw the same thing and looked at me and said, &#34;Oh, my god!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both jumped up ran out to the deck and couldn’t believe what we were seeing.  A very round sphere that was very metallic and so shiny.  By the way this is at 4:00  in the afternoon with no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the sudden it just went straight up in the sky and disappeared.   We were very scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter ran inside to grab a camera.  A minute later it appeared again but this time it was going in the opposite direction and again went straight up in the sky and disappeared.  We never got a picture because we were in such shock of what were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never experienced anything like this and I am scared to death.  I feel like I have witnessed something very amazing and very unexplained.  My daughter and I will never ever forget this experience.  Where we live you just don’t here about these kind of things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never been on a website to even see what or who to contact with this information.  I found your website and I hope someone else might have seen what we have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You!<n>

The reporting of this event is late yes, however.  As the years go by I feel compelled to report what I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just got home from work, sitting on the rear porch waiting for my girlfriend to get home.  I know the date was the 14th, of August 2007 as this day lands between my girlfriends and my sisters/niece birthdays’.  The day was clear, warm with no clouds in site, the time was about 14:00.  The following events only lasted about 45sec-1min, quickly, I realized what I was looking at  something that has not been seen, nor described to me in any way before.  I got a really good look at the object, I knew that taking note of the fine details would help me remember.  Trust me; this is something that I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat there looking to the NW direction.  Moving slowly from North to South, I saw, what I can only describe as a “flying brain”.  This may sound funny, however the first thing that came to my mind is that the object was in the shape of a brain (kidney type shape).  The shape of the object did change though.  As it was moving, it would seem to take shape to the wind.  I would not call it round, square, saucer, ball..etc… the color was similar to fire; reddish, orange and yellow.  I was not a ball of fire..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had time to look at this, the following description is “exactly” what I saw.  I will use products to assist with my descriptions, again, I have never seen, nor even been described anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Altitude:  about 300’ off the ground Size:  about 30-50yards long x 10-15yards total (it was flexing, in the shape of a brain, but moving as it moved) Speed:  about 60km/h  Distinctive features: •	it was stringy.  You could call it a mass of string (like that under a baseball), but the strings was very defined, defined enough that it still strikes me to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Colors were vibrant and defined.  You could see the yellow, red, orange.  They were separate from each other and I could tell by looking at it.  This, along with the string was the most amazing part and the part that I cannot explain the best.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strings would move, like tentacles kind of.  They were not all pointing in the same direction, they were moving in different directions while the object moved to the South.  Each string was a defined color, and the color was it’s own.  There was no common pattern of the colors of the strings.  The strings seemed to be different lengths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw no lights, no doors/windows (points of access), no writings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved in the same direction, did not climb, did not descend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was silent to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching this, there was one of the neighbours kids playing in our backyard.  I told him to look up at the object.  The child does not speak English, other than a few words.  When he looked up he said “the sun”.  I said to him that yes, it does look like the sun, however it was not.  He did not seem much more interested in the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch it move across the sky.  Within the 45-1 minute time frame, I was able to get a really good look, I wanted to remember this for the rest of my life.  When it went out of view it just went out of view, I cannot say if it sped away or disappeared, it was just out of my view behind buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching what it was, I looked around to see if anyone else was out side, there was no one.  I looked at the sun myself (maybe the child was right and I am crazy), the sun was not even close, and, did not look like this.  You cannot stare at the sun for 1 minute and expect to see normal again, this was not the sun.  I thought of what the kid said, and yes.  It would resemble the sun in a way.  If you see photos of the sun (close up telescope type), you see the fire leaping from the sun’s surface.  This fire leaping would somewhat resemble the strings that I spoke of earlier, as the color as well.  I know what fire looks like, this was just not fire..<n> <n><n> <n><n> A lot of people laugh when I say it was a flying brain.  I use this description only to describe the shape, and, it was the first thing that came to mind when I saw it.  It was like an orb.  The orb was what appeared to be the main body, strings came off of and all around it.  The orb, when the object moved, would move into a brain shape.  I do laugh at my brain description myself, but, it is what it is..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do believe in UFO’s, I have seen a lot of unexplained lights and stuff, but, never anything like this, and never anything that I would report as it could be too many other things.  This object is not nothing that I have ever seen.  After seeing this, I am sold that there is something else out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyone that thinks I am full of it, or crazy.  You have your belief and that is just fine.  I am not interested in anything other than trying to find out what this was.  I am not saying that it was visitors from outer space, paranormal or anything else.  I don’t know what to call it, I have never seen anything like it, except on that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please, I ask that if you have seen something that resembles this I would love to hear about it.<n>

I compared their speed to obvious planes moving in other areas of the sky. They were not flashing, but rather constant. All three lights were traveling from north to south about four feet off the horizon moving into the horizon more than across it. The peculiar thing is that the lights seemed to be kind of weaving instead of moving in a straight line-very odd movement. I have never seen anything like it. After about 30 seconds and grabbing my brother from inside to take a look, they disappeared. My guess was that they were too high and as they got closer to the horizon we lost them in the light, but it seemed really abrupt. As we stood there dumbfounded, there appeared another light with a smaller, fainter red light traveling right next to it. These two traveled along the same line as the first three and at the same speed. They also moved in the same strange way-not in a straight line, but more like in a wave. I have to say that it gave me chills!<n>

An object was seen hovering about 2000 feet in the air from a distance.  The object was shaped as a &#34;saucer&#34; and was metallic looking. The saucer was on a tilt and moved around a little for about 10-15 seconds and then it suddenly jerked west and disappeared.  About 3 seconds later a rapidly blinking light appeared and started to move around.  It then started to depict a pattern and change it every 2 seconds as it moved at an extraordinary speed across the sky. The object moved in a non-uniform line and covered a large area in 15 seconds. I lost visibility as the object flew past trees that obstructed my view.  The night before at 2:00am there was also activity in the same area in the sky; however, it was much more distant than this occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We live in an apartment complex, and the surrounding lights in the complex were too overbearing to view the meteor shower.  We then walked to the street where there is no ambient light.  I was looking North-East in the direction that the meteor shower was supposed to appear.  Suddenly I saw a meteor.  My son did not see the meteor.  I directed my son in the direction that the meteor was in.  Almost immediately, we both saw this set of orange lights fly over head from North-East to South-West.  It sort of resembled 7 orange birds flying in a “V” formation.  The object made absolutely no sound!  We didn’t see it coming over the horizon, it just appeared.  Almost like the lights just came on.  We tried to follow it, but it disappeared over the South-West horizon.  But it was again almost like the lights just turned off.  Maybe you have to be directly under the object to see the lights.  I’ve seen many pictures of this type of craft before, but never in my life did I think I would actually see it myself.  It scared my son pretty bad, so we went inside and did not watch any more of the meteor shower.  I&#39;m sure that if someone else was watching the shower that they too would have seen this craft.  Having my son with me confirmed that I was not out of my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The friend &amp; I were sitting facing east to northeast &amp; I witnessed a large triangular shaped object with three orbs located in each of the corners silently fly across the sky, traveling in a south to north direction. The object appeared to have a soft orange glow about its perimeter as well as around the orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event only took about 5-8 seconds to occur &amp; what we found most stunning was the fact that it was absolutely silent as it traveled. We live somewhat near the airport &amp; hear a lot of air traffic. This object however was perfectly silent &amp; given the late hour, there wasn’t a lot of ambient noise in the neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the time it took the two of us who witnessed the event to simultaneously say, “what was that!?!?” the object disappeared behind a large tree in our yard &amp; was gone. Needless to say, it rattled both of us &amp; we proceeded to describe it to my husband. Our descriptions were identical. We then went inside the house where we both independently drew what we saw. The pictures are eerily similar (drawings submitted separately).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We hope that, due to the meteor shower activity over the past few days, other people may have been looking into the sky that evening &amp; can substantiate what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she seemed to us to be exceptionally credible.

My family and I were spending a few days away at a golf resort in Moses Lake. It was a clear and warm star-filled evening, so I decided to enjoy a few minutes of start gazing on our back deck before turning in for the night.  Living in the city, I don&#39;t get to see the stars much. After being out there for 3 or 4 minutes, I noticed a solid, circular, glowing white light moving through the sky at about my 10 o’clock just a little left of the Grant County Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it was an airplane; but as I watched it I realized that it was moving at an incredible rate of speed, and changed directions quickly and smooth.  It was about the size of a bright star, and had a large glow to it.  It did not have a blinking light like an airplane, and again, it was moving incredibly fast!  There was no sound as if from a plane, and it was not accompanied by a tail as if it were a meteorite (shooting star).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, it was near the Grant County Airport, but that may have just been a coincidence because the object looked too far away to have originated from there.  I was staying only about 20 minutes from that airport, and anything that close and &#34;normal&#34;  would have been larger and loud.  I watched it as it moved around across the sky until it began to fade at about my 2 o’clock.  As it began to fade, the color changed to a fainted red just before it disappeared; almost as if that was the color of the underside.  From there, it slowly faded away like it was getting farther and farther away from my direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is by far the strangest thing I’ve ever seen.  If it were some sort of airplane, it’s definitely nothing that I’ve ever seen before in my entire life.  Circular, super fast, solid bright white and silent.<n>

As soon as I got outside something seemed off about this &#34;star&#34;. Unfortunetly I did not see any meteors, my dad saw one and my friends saw none as well. But I just could not get my attention off this hovering object. At first glanceit appeared to be a star, but the more I looked at this object the more it became clear to me that it was not a metoer, a comet, a star or a planet. This object was rotating in full circles while simultaneously appearing to hover all over the place(left to right, up &amp; down). It had flashing lights...at one point I thought I saw red lights. I have always been into stars and planets and meteors, but not once have i seen anything quite like this. In the back of my head I thought it could have been a satellite...but I;ve seen those before, and it appeared nothing like that. The shape is difficult to answer,..at one moment it appeared so clear and visible and at another moment it appeared so distant and vague. I just cant pit it into words what I truly saw...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

This is the time that the photo in question was taken, however I did not take the photo knowing there was an unidentifiable object in the frame. This discovery was made hours later while reviewing the photos I took earlier today with a friend. My friend noticed the strange object in the corner of the photograph. The picture captured an airplane flying below and to the left of the UFO. The photograph is from an angle directed at the sky (I was taking pictures of clouds). In the photo there is a clearly identifiable airplane in the lower left hand corner of the picture. In the top right of the photo is the UFO in question. I would like to submit this photo to you for your own inspection. I do not know what this object is, but given the distance of the identifiable airplane I feel an approximate size and distance comparison can be concluded provided your expertise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it is important to mention that this surrounding area is nearby Boeing Field, in Everett, Washington and many planes fly over this area. Despite this fact, the unidentifiable object in question poses a significant enough impression that my friend and I feel this should be handed over to you for further review.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I happened to notice something moving across the cloudless blue ski in the North east direction roughly 2000 to 3000 feet. I observed a silver sphere with a dark or shadow line down the center of the long slender shape object,as it flew across and just disapeared into the ski. I had mention to crew members what I was seeing but they couldn&#39;t find it. Then again a few seconds later another one flew acrossed in the same place and matter. Again just disappeared into the ski. Both of them looked the same long and skinny and blended into the ski. I have flown on commerical airliners and many times in smaller single engine airplanes. These 2 objects I believe were not anything we fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I also got a picture of a stelth plane in the distance that seemed to be chasing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pink glow you see was only in two frames. I do not know what caused that.

Warm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duration:	1am - 6am  Country:	United Kingdom  Region:	Telscombe Cliffs Brighton Sussex U.K.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Orientation:	Facing directly west, most of the objects tended to travel from the south directly north. Sometimes they just sit or hover directly north or directly south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Number of UFOs:	7  Height:	variable  Size:	half thumb  Number of Witnesses:	1  Details:	The weird thing was the lamp / lights. I have never seen them this bright. Instead of looking like street lights they looked like mini stars, flaring sort of. And I missed at least 3 other flyby. As soon as I put the camera down they flew past again. The orbs were huge at least 3 of them. The triangles were amazing really low. I got two filmed but typically the lowest &amp; best I didn&#39;t get to in time as the battery was on charge. Also as I said before there was some kind on membrane either side of the street I can see it but I&#39;m not sure if it will be on the video. The only analogy I can think of is the look of the liquid you blow bubbles with combined with T.V.Static. This membrane sort of vibrates and runs the length of the street both sides behind the neighbors house. I&#39;m thinking this could be some sort of shield so that other people in the town can&#39;t see the vehicles or it could be an opening into another dimension or even a shield from the prying eyes of military satellites. Now I think it was all of the above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As you will hear from the tape there is little sound.Only a few slowed jets noises.The birds are silent and here seagulls are never silent. The neighbors behind were in the garden drinking and chatting. They were oblivious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The noise of the coast road which normally has taxis on sounded literally like out of a sci-fi movie. The sound of a space ship. These sounds precede the filming. In fact that is how I know they are coming. I always here these very very slowed down jet noises. But they are not jets more just like a slowed down video tape or sci-fi effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not used to the camera so I zoomed in and out a bit to start with. But there is over 13 minutes so far. I could have got at least a couple of hours but my camera is 7 years old and the battery needs charging often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway here is the link for the full 13 minutes of video footage. The best part is after 6 minutes, however I would suggest watching the whole thing first time.You can watch or download the footage here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.archive.org/details/E.T.V.U.F.O.August13th2007   As an intelligent person I can assure you these are not commercial or private Aircraft or Helicopters. The U.K. has very strict rules regarding flights over urban &amp; suburban areas. The speed of these vehicles is very slow only as long as I am observing them. The seem to continue to the horizon where they vanish. They vehicles always appear in an instant. The triangular ships also have morphing or cloaking capabilities. I have not been able to confirm whether they are the same as the Orbs or whether they are the same. Perhaps there is another larger mother ship nearby disguised as blue sky I would never know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The police helicopter is possible at the end although I didn&#39;t hear it. Often when these sightings occur the police helicopter or the Coast Guard Helicopter turn up. Living on the coast I hear &amp; see these all the time. I didn&#39;t hear them or see them. The footage is of the UFOs . The first piece of footage could have been two hours long. I observed it for more than two hours. I didn&#39;t film it because I just didn&#39;t have the battery&#39;s charged. There&#39;s no way a helicopter is going to sit above my neighbours house hovering for two hours or more in silence !!! However sometimes these E.T.V.s turn on their sides flip over charge shape completely &amp; even morph. So I&#39;m not sure. All I know is that since I reported this incident the sky has been sprayed very heavily with chemtrails up to 8 aircraft just last night. Now we have gone from warm 80 degree heat to winter weather in less than 24 hours. Its raining / flooding again and very windy. Of course this also means no one is going to look at the sky and watch UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Neither of us cared to see anything out of the ordinary, in fact this object kind of ruined my date I had planned out.  We were 15 miles Northwest of a very small community(Hazelton ND) laying out on the bed of my truck out in the hills on a prairie trail, when my girlfriend pointed out a small object a little larger than a majority of the stars around us soaring through the night sky.  I explained that it was just a satellite no big deal, she insisted that it was going to fast, but I stuck by my satellite explanation.  10 mins. later she started talking about this object she had been keeping tabs on, for a moment I couldn&#39;t see what she was pointing at, she said the object turned, I didn&#39;t see it because I didn&#39;t realize how dramatic it&#39;s course change was, once I had spotted it, I knew it wasn&#39;t a normal sighting.  The object had moved almost directly in front of our field of view and was moving from side to side, and then it would stop hover and begin to move diagonally across the sky, and than in an obscure figure eight pattern, then stop again and hover, it was very bizarre.  We watched it for 15 mins. or so, and decide to head back to the ranch, by the time we reached the farmstead, stopped, and got back out on the bed of the truck the object was gone, we watched for over a half an hour before my girlfriend was to creeped out to stick around out there anymore.  I don&#39;t know what that object was, but it gave the feeling that it was almost watching us, the way it would stop and hover out amongst the stars, and then to disappear like that within a 5 min. drive back to the house.  It creeped us out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/13/07 00:25|Dallas|TX|Unknown|10-15 seconds|Its bottom appeared as three dimly illuminated elongated octagons, one in front of two in tandem.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58194.html|288|ndxe200708| Its bottom appeared as three dimly illuminated elongated octagons, one in front of two in tandem.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8/13/07 UFO Sighting, Dallas, Texas  On Monday morning, August thirteenth of 2007, I was lying on my back on a lawn lounger cushion up on top of my carport about midnight, prepared to spend the next five hours watching the second night of the meteorite shower.  I had a cut-out cardboard box around my head to block out the street &amp; residential security lights in the neighborhood, making my view of the clear but hazey sky quite clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had laid there admiring shooting stars when at about 12:25 AM a small airplane flew North over me in Oak Cliff, a suburb of Dallas, Texas.  Its North-South trajectory was about a few blocks to the West of my position.  I imagine it to have been following the path of Westmoreland Boulevard.  Before I could see it, I remembered the noisey little airplane by its distinctive sound, since it flies North and/or South over our house frequently at night, always disturbing my sleep.  It triggered the usual question: why aren&#39;t such airplanes required to muffle their noise, especially at night?  As it passed over my line of sight, I noticed something following it.  I first thought the plane was towing something behind it, because the object behind the airplane was traveling the same speed and at approximately the same altitude.  It was so dimly illuminated it was hard to see.  It&#39;s image area was about six to eight times larger than the small airplane&#39;s image area.  All I could see of it was three elongated octagons (rectangles with the corners cut off).  Their lengths ran the direction the craft traveled.  The octagons were in a common plane, two in the back and one in center front, evenly spaced apart in a triangular formation.  It was about one to two hundred yards behind the small airplane and slightly to the West of the airplane&#39;s trajectory.  It flew in a straight, level line without deviations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Either the small airplane was making so much noise that I couldn&#39;t discerne the object&#39;s sound.  Or, the object was making no noise at all.  The object&#39;s three elongated octagonal panels were either very dimly: but evenly illuminated, or they were finished with a non-reflective or ultra-flat coating that evenly diffused their reflection of the city&#39;s ground lights over their surfaces.  No sharp ground lights were reflected off of them as it passed over.  And, I don&#39;t know if it was a single craft or three individual aircrafts flying in continuous and perfect formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood and turned around to continue watching it and the airplane as they flew away from me, to the North toward Love Field.  As they dissappeared in the misty distance I couldn&#39;t descerne anything about the object&#39;s shape.  As the three panels became flat in the distance, the whole thing seemed to dissappear.  But, I could still see the airplane&#39;s blinking lights and barely still hear the airplane&#39;s noisey exhaust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately went downstairs to write down and sketch what I&#39;d seen.  Just after one o&#39;clock I called Love Field Tower.  A recording gave me a night phone number.  I called that number at 1:10 AM.  Someone named Gary answered the phone.  I briefly described what I&#39;d seen.  He said he was on the field and to call him back in twenty minutes when he&#39;d be back in his office.  I called him again at 1:30 AM and again told him what I&#39;d seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said he&#39;d talked to the tower and they&#39;d heard nothing from anyone else about it.  I reminded him that the tower&#39;s nightn phone number isn&#39;t even listed, so the public couldn&#39;t have called the tower unless it was a relative or other airport official who already knew the tower&#39;s night number, deducing that HE would be the only one to have recieved any calls about it.  He completely ignored that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed as though he was partonizing or attempting to placate me.  He didn&#39;t seem genuinely interested, failing to ask for my name, phone number or any information about the sighting that I hadn&#39;t volunteered.  I asked him if there is an official phone number where such sightings are supposed to be reported.  He said, &#34;No,&#34; that I&#39;d &#34;called the right number.&#34;  So, I appologized for bothering him with such ridiculous nonsense and hung up.  I was left feeling disgruntled, unsatisfied and embarrassed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, that I know the National UFO Reporting Center is listed in the FAA Manual as the correct place to report unusual sky sightings, I&#39;ll call ole &#34;doubting Gary&#34; back tonight to provide him with the NUFOREC&#39;s phone number, remind him to read his manual and give him a free piece of my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a similarly unusual flying object many years ago (I&#39;m bad with past chronology) several miles East of Tyler, Texas.  It was deep in the dark piney East Texas forrest.  The night was clear and the stars were amazingly bright.  The thing appeared to be a sharp triangle, only distinguished by it&#39;s blocking out the star&#39;s light behind it as it passed over me heading East.  It was moving too slowly, in my opinion, to be an airplane.  It didn&#39;t exhibit the three elongated octagonal shapes on the bottom.  If it was the same type craft, I suppose this was because there was no ground light to illuminate them.  It was exactly the same color and intensity of the background night sky.  It, too, made absolutely no sound.  And, I was alone then, too.   I seriously doubt these craft were man-made.  And, I no longer have any doubts that we are NOT alone on our God-forsaken, bloodthursty, demockery-cursed, predatory little planet.  So, perhaps there is hope for Us good Earthlings, afterall!<n>

They looked large -- apparently at least ten times the size of stars *in terms of perception* -- although they weren&#39;t terribly bright. They formed the three points of an equilateral triangle, and they moved quickly -- over the space of about five seconds -- away over the horizon and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was nothing visible between the dots, although background stars were blocked out, according to my friend. I myself was less aware of this observation at the time, so I&#39;m not sure whether I&#39;ve unfairly re-evaluated what I thought I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today I have looked to the internet in an effort to see if such a sight is usual. I came across descriptions of BBDs, which appear to match what my friend and I saw. I should stress that I had never been aware of these before (unless, perhaps from films, of course).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thousands of Brits will have been looking up at the skies that night because of the meteor shower that received a huge amount of press attention in its run-up.

I was lying down next to my pool which is screened in but I still could see the stars easy enough.  I am an amateur astronomer and I specialize in imaging so I know the night sky well.  It was 11:45  and I was laying down and watching the stars when I saw it. It was a perfect V shaped set of red lights going right overhead. I believe there were 6 lights on each of the two sides. There was no noise and no strobes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights did not change position to each other and the object went across the sky at a moderate speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was quite large, about the size of two full moons. So either it was a very large object at a very high altitude or still a large object at a lower altitude. Either way I did not see any strobes or hear any noise. I have jets fly over my house all the time and it’s quite easy to tell them apart even at night time and this did not look nothing like one. In fact I watch a jet fly over about 10 minutes later and not only could I hear it and see its strobe lights, it was much, much smaller is size. I have seen blimps to and it did not look like them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wondering if anyone else noticed this object that night at that time frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would find it hard to believe that no one else saw it.<n>

It kept flashing red and a little bit of green.  The reason why I do not believe it was a plane, is that: 1. there was an actual plane in the sky and the UFO was much higher and faster than the plane, and 2. the UFO wasn&#39;t moving in a straight line (planes cannot change their direction that quickly).  This morning (Tuesday, August 14) I was reading a local newspaper and I read about a doctor who had seen the same this as me, but in a different region in maine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as I know, there was only one spacecraft.  I do not know the shape of the craft, because it was so high up, but I did see the red flashing lights and occasional green ones.  I was on the beach next to Mooselookmeguntic when it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/12/07 23:10|San Rafael|CA|Triangle|10 seconds|Triangular craft seen over San Rafael, CA around 11pm Sunday night|8/14/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58134.html|294|ndxe200708| Triangular craft seen over San Rafael, CA around 11pm Sunday night<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend &#34;J&#34; and I were watching the meteor shower tonight on our rooftop patio in downtown San Rafael.  We&#39;re about 20 miles north of San Francisco and it&#39;s a fairly urban area, so light pollution is fairly high.  There was no moon tonight, however, so we had a better view of the stars than usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were stretched out on two lounge chairs, with a blanket over us.  We weren&#39;t under the influence of any drugs, though I had finished about half a pint of Guinness.  I had a mini mag lite flashlight with me, and my binoculars.  We weren&#39;t seeing many meteorites, so out of boredom I had been swinging the flashlight beam around into the sky in big sweeps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up to take a leak, and I got a few steps away when J started yelling &#34;UFO!  UFO!&#34;  I started looking up and around and a couple seconds later I spotted a dark triangular shape with rounded corners moving quickly across the sky, from approximately North to South, more or less right above us.  It had a small red circle in each corner, and was completely silent.  I said &#34;hand me the binoculars!  hand me the binoculars!&#34; but was too dumbstruck to look away to grab them, even though J was holding them out to me (her eyes also locked on the triangle).  I watched it for about 4 or 5 seconds until it disappeared in the haze of light pollution to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as our backgrounds, we are both in our early thirties, I work at a video game studio and she is an independent web designer.  I&#39;m pretty agnostic when it comes to inexplicable phenomena, but pretty much rule out interstellar travel, aliens walking among us, etc etc.  But this crazy thing tonight was definitely, definitely, definitely nothing like anything I&#39;ve ever seen before.  We are both pretty stunned right now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Not too sure if I was too sleepy because of the trip and saw headlamps in a dark mountain road going back and forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A road that cuts our small town in half.  Only about 7 houses on each side.  (Middle of nowhere town)  WE are all about the same age, middle teens.  We were just standing there when we looked towards the end of town directly over the road there was this brilliant flash of blue/whitish light, only a few meters above ground.  About 5 seconds after the light presented itself, there was a shake in the air, a boom, but it wasnt loud, but it was strong.  I felt it hit my chest like a box of rocks it was so strong.  The power went out in the entire town.  A few car alarms sounded and were going off.  One of the street lights exploded and the light ambers floated to the ground.  For about 10 seconds the blue/whitish light was the only light we could see.  It didnt illuminate the entire town.  But it was sorta outside of town, but still directly over the road.  The power then returned and the light disappeared as teh street were lit up by street lights again.  My name is Alex Nadelhoffer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;am 17 years old.  My number is 1 262 ((number deleted)).  I&#39;am interested to hear someone elses view point on what I might have experienced.  It wasnt rained or storming out either that night So it wasnt lightning.  I was wondering if you could relate this to any other recent reports and if my details are similar to theirs.  You can email me back at ((e-address deleted)).<n>

The object got bigger and brighter as it come from space. The object made several VERY fast moves heading west, then east, north and south with out changing course, just direction, it did impossible moves in the sky. After what seemed to be about a half an hour the object shot straight up into the sky until it dissapeared from our sight. We both looked at each other and said &#34;what was that&#34;? We both couldn&#39;t believe what we witnessed, it couldn&#39;t have been anything man made doing what we witnessed. The object traveled impossible distances and directions in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have seen objects do some very strange things in the sky from our cabin, mostly during early morning hours. Some objects appear with smaller objects, all different shapes and sizes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/12/07 22:20|Saginaw|MI|Triangle|45 seconds|Triangle shaped object, flying very low with bright white litghts|8/14/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58127.html|299|ndxe200708| Triangle shaped object, flying very low with bright white litghts<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching TV in my living room when a bright light caught my eye coming from outside the window in an adjacent bedroom. It was as if something flashed across the sky. I quickly got up and ran over to the window to investigate. Initially when I looked out I couldn&#39;t see anything, but it was when I looked straight up that I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object that I saw was a triangular shape with several white lights on it, 4-7 I&#39;d say. It was extremely low moving at a steady but slow pace; I was able to track it from one end of the house to looking out the window on the other end of the house for about 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say it was flying about as low as a crop duster plane would, if not lower. I heard absolutely no sound from the object. There is a small airport nearby and I often here planes fly over that are much higher than this object. It was heading North East and the airport is North West. To recap, very low, triangle shape, many bright white lights on craft, and no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This took about 4 seconds. There were no lights, sound, or trail. I lost sight of the object and my friend claims it just disappeared as she was focused on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So I immediately thought there must&#39;ve been a new light installed on a phone tower or something in that area. Only this white light had two smaller lights, one red, one blue, rotating around it in a circle, alternating lights. I just began to think nothing of it, and started back inside, but my dog pulled me back the other way, and as I looked back up to where it was, it had moved towards my direction, and was still moving. At this point, I thought well maybe it&#39;s plane, but that didn&#39;t explain why it was hovering before, nor did it explain the red and blue white spinning around it. So I watched it for a couple more minutes as it came towards me, and then is stopped. It stopped again in mid-air, and hovered for maybe 30 seconds, and then started moving again, only this time heading East, the whole time with the red and blue lights spinning around it. I watched it until it was out of my line of vision behind other houses and trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This &#34;craft&#34; emitted absolutely no sound whatsoever. I&#39;ve seen planes and helicopters around here. The planes are NEVER this low to the ground, and you always hear them. Same goes for helicopters. I&#39;m in a valley, you&#39;d hear anything up there. This thing was maybe 50 feet up, and made absolutely no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were around six on each side and one in the middle. I was more than sure that they weren&#39;t meteor but I hadn&#39;t seen a meteor but I saw pictures of one and it looked nothing like what I saw.  They moved so fast that my mom that was standing right next to me didn&#39;t have time to look up and see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was bright white, very intense, and 5-6 times larger than Venus.  The bright light lasted 1-2 seconds and then was replaced by a very small faint dot that moved rapidly on a southeasterly course until it disappeared from sight about 45 seconds later.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could not see them at first because I was driving but the urgency in my wifes voice  prompted me to get a view at what she was seeing. I turned around and did see what she had been witnessing. There was 4 objects hovering in the sky maybe 300 feet above the lake. In an instance before our eyes,  three of objects disappeared and then re-appeared around a mile west and where now in different formation. I have lived in the area all my life and have never seen any balloons  over the lake which did cross my mind but balloons don’t dissapear and that could be the only reasonable explination available. I am a marine corps veteran and also a aviation mechanic. I have over 6 years in the field and have seen every type of military craft several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be a quite credible witness.

I stopped to deposit a check at the golden1 on on the corner..and watched more they were moving to the west seemingly slow but got out of site within 3 or 4 minutes so Im assuming fairly fast at that height. I noticed that without my polarized sunglasses on they were fairly hard to see.but with them on they were bright like a electrically charged kind of steel looking glowing hot metal sphere.got a strange feeling in my gut while looking at them,I think some other people near by were wondering what I was looking at.I was too mesmerized to care.Im a fairly avid outdoorsman and bird watcher nature lover...This was none of those things.Very beautiful and Different...Looked technological not organic.I very surprised to see something like this at this time of day..Like I said without my polarized glasses I probably wouldnt of seen it,Strangest thing Ive ever seen lived here my whole life.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We have an airport and the planes fly really low over the Bullhead Parkway to land. Well I happen to look up over the airport and noticed a small object in the sky. It looked like it was a far off plane but what I noticed that made me slow down was blackish smoke trailing behind it. My first thought was a small plane in jeopardy and was waiting for it to descend to our airport. But the object instead, flew straight up and disappeared, including the smoke that trailed behind it.  I tried to look for it but it was just gone. I couldn&#39;t make out any particular shape. All I really saw was a silvery glow of metal. I am wondering if anyone else saw this too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  The Perseid Meteor shower was taking place on this date.  PD))<n>

When we got to a clearing, we got out of the car and stared at the sky.  We were waiting on our eyes to adjust to the darkness so we could see the meteors. Unknowingly, we all focused on the same “star”. One of my friends commented on the “star” dancing.  At first we thought we were seeing meteors flying through the atmosphere, but instead of streaking across the sky, we realized it was staying in one general place. It was circular in shape, it glowed silvery blue which led up to believe it was a “star”. It was zigzagging across a specific portion of the sky.  It grew in size and brightness, and then decrease in size and brightness.  This pattern continued for about five minutes before we left the scene.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The size is what got my attention, as it became closer I was able to identify that it indeed was one object and not several lights together.  It was completely silent, gliding if you will to the south just over the Atlantic Ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate its size of being 200&#39;x200&#39;x200.  From a stopped position, to moving, there wasn&#39;t any noise nor lateral movement upon acceleration.  Object left from sight on south-easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was watching towards this direction when I noticed the stars over me being occluded from view.  I watched this dark spot travel from over my head to the south-east portion of the sky when it left my viewable area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The closest shape I could possibly assign to this experience would be a long somewhat rectangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been hesitant to report this since I had no one with me to collaborate my experience.

8/12/07 01:45|Plymouth|IN|Formation|30 seconds|As big as a large house with 2 car garage attached and kinda shaped like that 500 feet over my head..|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58189.html|315|ndxe200708| As big as a large house with 2 car garage attached and kinda shaped like that 500 feet over my head..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something I am having a hard time explaining flew right over my head what seemed like no more than 500 feet up at Washington Elementary School at about 1:45am... as big as a large house with 2 car garage attached and kinda shaped like that..<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 1am I went up to the darkened school yard alone to see if maybe I could catch a few early annual Perseid meteors shooting across from the North sky. I was disappointed to notice the installation of new security lights in my favorite urban astronomy field, which actually do nothing but cause light pollution and burn energy... so I decided to lay in the middle of some playground equipment where the shadows would cover me and give me a much darker if slightly more limited view of the sky. I was laying with my head to the west and feet to the east so the meteors would appear to my left and fly to the right. It was a slow show, but a pretty clear night. I could barely make out the faint glow of the Milky Way. I saw about 5 bright Perseids over the course of approximately 45 minutes, when something enormous and low appeared directly in front and above me to the East-southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I say enormous I mean it seemed like a large house with 2 car attached garage was flying over my head. As soon as my eyes flicked to it, It was directly over me. Although it was dark with no Moon, the craft was darker, like it absorbed light. Its hard to explain the shape. Like 5 or 6 or 7 black square boxes connected oddly, sort of like a 3 box rectangle with 2 other box protrusions on either side 1 front and 1 back, with a large orange circle in the center of each square 2/3rds the square size. The orange glow did not seem to be lights, but more like very hot orange glowing metal. There were no running lights what so ever. I got the impression it was much larger than I could actually see, and was not supposed to be able to see it, but the orange heat glow lit up just a small portion of the bottom of the craft which is all I really saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although the square and circles were symmetrical, the boxes seemed to be put together in an odd shape. I came home and drew it and painted it but I cant get it to look exactly like what I saw but you can at least get an idea. This craft did not seem aerodynamic in any way, yet it was flying super fast, Lear jet fast, although flying is the wrong word. More like it moved like a waterbug across the surface of water, or dragonfly like... kinda skiddering diagonally sideways..<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed directly over me and shot off West Northwest. As it passed I flipped over on my stomach and elbows to get a better view and t disappeared over some trees that fast. The whole event lasted less than 30 seconds. Not a single sound came from it. The crickets kept on chirping. There was no wind. It was very calm. An odd thing seemed that maybe it was moving slowly or standing still until my eyes flicked to it, and it shot off straight over me. I do not know if it was watching me or was it just moving over when it saw me an decided to take off? I was kinda hidden by some steel playground equipment..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen strange things in the sky before, but nothing even remotely close to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what satellites look like. I know what the ISS space station looks like. I know what comets and asteroids and meteors look like. I own a 6&#34; Newtonian reflector telescope. I have been to military air shows before. I know what planes and helicopters and blimps are capable of. Although I have never seen swamp gas ignite I am pretty sure this was not that either!  I saw what I saw. As to who was driving that remains to be seen!  I have another sighting posted on here where I saw 3 black V triangles in the same schoolyard, which happened 11 years ago. I would like to add that looking back I think the sightings are connected, and from pictures I have seen I think they are the same type of craft that was over Phoenix Arizona in 1996 the same year, but in my case they were much much higher and therefore smaller. And there were 3 of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just my speculation but it seems to me as if these lights/boxes can move together like an F-16 wings retract and expand for higher speeds, but not for the same reasons. They move from V to more wide mouthed U and boomerang shapes, and now I think they can form any shape, maybe even come apart and move freely and then rejoin at different angles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Keep looking up!<n>

I spot another plane but this one was different It had strobe lights on it, and was very high in the sky.  It seemed to go in a zig pattern too. Wasn&#39;t going to fast but wasn&#39;t going slow either not a nice steady pace like an airplane. Here is where its gets real interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It veered off to make a sharp right and that is when i ran in the house and grab my phone and came back outside to call this hotline.  I went back outside and I could still see it.  I then went to get my camera and used my cell phone to take video but you can&#39;t see anything due to the craft being so high in the sky.  It even flew above me way up and I couldn&#39;t tell the shape of it.  The lights were white, red, blue, and I thought i even saw green lights too. The space craft made huge circles at least three times while I was out there.  Maybe it was considering making contact?  What is even more interesting was I saw the same craft the night before traveling near bland and belle missouri that happened about 9:29 pm. It had the same zig zag pattern, but was going a much faster pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to see if I could spot the craft outside, but it looked like a storm moving in so I went back into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mean honestly who wants to be waken up in the middle of the night, by his wife? My husband dosen&#39;t.  I unfortunately was the only witness to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On two different occasions when looking straight up I&#39;ve seen this star sized red light that moves around now and then.  I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s some kind of satellite.  It stays in one place though and then moves a few degrees and stops and then repeats this moving a few degress from there to a different spot.  I have not seen it disappear, it outlasted me as I don&#39;t have much stamina.  What I&#39;ve done is gone back inside for awhile to rest and then I&#39;ve come back outside to see if it&#39;s still there and I was able to find it quickly and it continued doing its strange stopping and then moving a few degrees and stopping again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stays completely red the whole time and does not scintilate at all.  I have to admit, part of me is wondering if it&#39;s a UFO but I&#39;ve never heard of a UFO described this way.  If you know what it is please enlighten me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this in Alameda California.  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know the date, it was during last summer, that&#39;s all I remember.  I don&#39;t think it was ET, I think it may have been a  manmade UAV.  I recently joined an Astronomy forum and someone there thought I should report it here.  I have to say that I am surprised that so far no one else has seen something like this on the forum I joined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I saw a number of meteors, and then noticed a red light about the apparent size of a large star.  It appeared closer than a star and was the color of a red stoplight.  It was stationary for a few seconds, and then it shot to the left.  It left a brief tail and then disappeared.  It seemed to just vanish leaving no trace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light looked nothing like the other meteors or stars I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sound was as if there had been some massive object above the house, lasting about 5 minutes.  After about a half-hour I was still unable to sleep and so I went to another room to watch TV.  I decided to step outside to check out the meteors (hoping to see some more).  Around 12:30 I looked across the lake and saw a strange red light hovering over the shoreline.  It moved slightly from time to time, as if it were trying to balance itself out again.  A bit closer and to the left there was another object moving in a similar manner, which was white. I watched the red light for a while it would sometimes drop and then more higher up again.  Also, every so often a flash of red and white light would appear on one side or another.  I at first hoped it would come near to me, and at one point it seemed to start to move closer but it made me slightly nervous. I felt a bit apprehensive and excited at the same time, and I felt that whatever it was could sense my reluctance toward it coming too close and it backed off.  Whatever it was felt out of this world to me and seemed to understand my anxiety.  Around 1 AM i went back inside, it was still hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have no reason to place a hoax sighting but I have always been interested in this sort of thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my back garden at home with my partner and we were watching the meteor shower that was happening that night. Before you think that it may have been a meteor, it had no trails after it and was not moving like a meteor would.  I was looking about the sky and at the stars when it looked as though one of the stars was moving. That’s the only way I can describe the shape and colour, as a star, it was pure bright white and had very little or no glow at all coming from it.  Aircraft fly over my house and I no what they look and sound like, and the thing that I saw in the sky was nothing I had seen before.  It had no flashing lights that come from a helicopter of plane and there was no noise, plus it was too far up in the sky for any plane or helicopter to fly.  I followed it with my binoculars for about 35 seconds as it flew at a calm, steady speed in a straight line and lost visibility as it flew out of sight over the other houses.   After about ten minutes I was looking about the sky through my binoculars when I saw something else move in the way I had saw the first object move.  This one was a slightly different shape and duller than the first and looked to be higher in the sky.  As it flew in the opposite direction to the first object,  it appeared to meet with another shape and this one also moved but this may have been due to me moving so I just discarded the third one as nothing.  The second object I saw moving was more of a longer shape like a rounded off cigar shaped object.  It was duller than the first object I saw and was hard to see as it was so high up, even in the binoculars. I followed this one for about ten seconds before I lost sight of it.  I do believe that what I saw was my very first UFO sighting and would really appreciate it if you looked into and got back to me via email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope you find what I saw and good luck .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This one round,about the size of a softball or cabbage,  bright yellow glowing, (with a strobing light) object came through the NE corner of our backyard, silently flew through the yard diagonally and turned west at  the corner of our house and flew beside our home. It was only 8-10 feet off of the ground. We were so dumbfounded that we all just stood there and didn&#39;t say anything for a bit. Sadly and regrettably, we didn&#39;t follow it. I would have thought I was nuts if my husband and son hadn&#39;t seenit too. It was definitely not a meteor....it was too low....it flew slowly and was low too the ground and the light blinked ot strobed slowly and methodically...not eratically. My son was 14 , my husband is co-manager of a local grocery and I am a church secretary.This was at 414 S.

It was up a ways in the sky, and at first she thought it was a satellite, but it wasn’t moving and it was far to clearly visible to be a satellite.  We grabbed our binoculars and noticed that it had 3 colors to it, and the lights were flashing and changing positions.  It began moving after about 25 – 30 minutes of watching it and it moved very slowly just beyond the mountain top.  We got into our car and made our way to shelter rock school in Danbury and watched it for about 10 – 15 minutes and again it moved.  We then went to Lee farm Park in Danbury and watched it for just a few minutes but then it was really to far away to really see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/11/07 23:00|Miami|FL|Triangle|Approx. 5 mins.|Miami suburb night sighting of a silent, low-hovering obtusely-angled arrangement of reddish lights|2/8/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79918.html|326|ndxe200708| Miami suburb night sighting of a silent, low-hovering obtusely-angled arrangement of reddish lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back in 2007, on a clear August night, I saw something in the sky that arrested my attention. My eyes locked on it as I tried to come to terms with what I was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my car, engine off, driver&#39;s side window down - across the field from the elementary school I attended as a child - smoking a cigarette and listening to the radio. By pure chance, I turned my gaze out the window and upwards as I expelled a plume of smoke from my lungs, and there they were . . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four reddish orbs, hovering substantially low in the sky, as silent as the surrounding night. They were NOT equidistant from each other but nonetheless arranged in a matter that allowed me to conclude that they formed the frame of an aircraft of some sort. Their placement in relation to one another seemed to suggest, to me, to form a shape of a triangle . . . the lights themselves forming an obtuse angle, stretching from left to right. The four lights were more left to right than up and down, and again, were NOT in a straight line, but formed an angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon first setting eyes on the spectacle before me, I immediately shut off my radio. I have no recollection of radio interference whatsoever. If there had been, I&#39;m sure I would remember it. There was no sound of traffic in the distance, as it was rather late at night and I wasn&#39;t anywhere near a main road or highway but tucked away in a residential neighborhood, blocks from my own house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was dead-silent and hardly moved, if at all.  The individual lights themselves didn&#39;t budge, nor flicker, blink, dim, or brighten.  Their illumination was constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After staring up in utter awe for a few minutes, I looked away and reached for another cigarette, found my lighter, lit up, and then returned my eyes to the sight, at which point the lights were much further up in the sky, retreating into obscurity (and thus not as bright as they had been), and soon disappeared altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best estimate of the time duration of my sighting is 5 minutes tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what I saw that night, and not being a professional in the field of UFOs I don&#39;t pretend to identify what I saq but just merely describe what I witnessed.  And I will say this . . . in the faces of all those that might henceforth attempt to explain away my experience as if they had all the answers . . . I SAW WHAT I SAW AND NONE OF YOU CAN CHANGE THAT.  When you stop and think about it, where we&#39;re at in reference to UFOs, that&#39;s really all that can be said about a UFO sighting, isn&#39;t it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I looked up and it was a bright red light fairly high in the atmosphere.  My husband and my mother both saw the light and we watched it.  It stayed stationary, but it looked like it was revolving, the brightness of the light was almost the same effect a lighthouse has, as it rotates the intensity of the light became brighter.  An airplane passed fairly close to it, but it seemed to be even higher up than the airplane.  It then zipped to another spot and rotated a few more times then the light slowly disappeared, it did not move left or right it went up.

Greenish-bluish flashes started occuring. There were about 6 flashes. They were in one area of the sky high up. They lasted about 30 seconds Then the flashes stopped. The sky went dim over there. About 10 seconds later, we heard 2 booms in the area of the flashes. Then everything went quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved in a straight line, however it would come almost to a complete stop, then take off again with a huge burst of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end, it came to a sudden stop, then with a bright flash it took off again, but this time it left almost a nike-swoop shaped trail and seemed to speed off straight up. a few seconds later, the dot of light faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then, I have noticed similar objects on 2 separate occasions, however the objects maintained a constant speed and moved in straight lines.

No sound was detected until they were directly overhead and then only a minimum rumble was heard. These craft were flying very low and slow. Approximately 700 - 1000 feet high. Maybe 30 - 40 mph.

The apparent size was perhaps 8 to 10 times larger, and its magnitude was perhaps 5 times that of than any of the stars visible in the waning twilight. It was the prospect of seeing Perseids meteors that had us sitting outside in the tourist camp near the Flaming Cliffs in the central Gobi. The character of the pulsing light seemed to be more of something tumbling out of balance, but there was no apparent movement of the object and somewhat reminiscent of a light house. The event lasted long enough that after my initial sighting was I first drew the attention of our driver who was sitting next to me to it. I was then able to call to my nephew who was inside a ger (yert) laying down to get up and come out and spot the light overhead for a short period before the light faded. I’m capable of believing this to be a satellite of some sort given the angle the suns rays would have been traveling at the time of the event, but it was just a very unusual sighting I thought worth the mention and still leaves me wondering what it was we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Perseids meteorite shower was outstanding being seen from such a place with virtually no light pollution, and a relatively high elevation. Quite a few shooting stars to make a person say, “ähhhhhhhhhhh”<n>

From an outstretched arm, a dime would have easily covered it twice over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were many lights in the cluster of varying sizes, perhaps dozens, but I could not determine an exact number.  The cluster was very far away on the horizontal, perhaps hundreds of miles, and seemed fairly high in the sky – if you held your arm out at a 45 degree angle, it was higher. From this cluster, smaller round lights would shoot out in varying directions; from my position, mostly east and west, and in horizontal or slightly downward trajectories. At least 9 smaller lights came from the cluster. These moving lights could be seen traveling for distances of sometimes 3 times the size of the cluster, sometimes up to 6 times the size, then vanish.  The lights of the cluster and those moving from it were significantly different than the airplanes which were also present in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for at least 20 minutes, and then I went inside.  After about an hour, I went outside again, and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not think it was a star or satellite, and the position was not one in which planets appear.  I do not think it was a constellation, as the round lights of the cluster were so close together, and because of the smaller round lights ejected from it.  The round lights of both the cluster and those that were moving were slightly dimmer than the brightest surrounding stars, and did not twinkle, but maintained their appearance throughout.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired attorney living in the country.

From our vantage point it appeared to be above the Siegen Lane area however it was most likely over the Gulf.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mass was over the size of several airplanes in my opinion. While we were observing, it broke into 4 separate pieces that appeared to be the size of an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now to put some size reference on what I mean by &#34;the size of an airplane&#34;, when you look up into the sky and see a jet flying overhead at the highest point you have seen one, then you understand what I mean by &#34;the size of an airplane&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately we did not think to whip out our cell phones and take a picture, we were in awe of what we were seeing. I have yet to see anything on this in the news. We did not see any other streaks across the sky that may have given us the thought that it was just a meteor shower.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We are near IAH and at first he thought it was a plane, then at further inspection knew it wasn&#39;t. He ran in our home and told me to hurry and get outside to see whatever this was. It appeared to be light in color, no lights and ocassionally a wing like thing seemed to flap. It just kept going higher. I had retrieved the binoculars and we tried to see but they kept fogging and were unsuccessful. It just kept going higher and disappeared into the clouds. Very unsettling. We are educated upper management senior citizens, this is not a dupe.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After a moment of thinking what possibly could&#39;ve made my power momentary interruption, I instinctfully, without prior thought, grabbed my camera and went outdoors to photograph the daturas in my garden.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a semi-professional designer and amateur photographer and have been recently posting photos in a Flickr.com account.    As I began to set up my SLR-type Sony Cybershot DSC-H5, I saw a flash in the NW skies, toward Jackson, MI (it is now about five minutes after the power flicker).   I set the camera to auto and &#39;burst&#39; two series of five photographs.   Immediately I viewed them through the camera&#39;s 3-inch lighted view screen and saw one image with a definite black dot infront of a small cloud.   At that point I went indoors and downloaded the images onto my computer and found that there were at least two objects, one definitely metallic and disc-shaped, flitting about the skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up into the clear blue sky and saw a very bright orb, approx the size of a pea held at arm’s length.  The object appeared to be a few miles away depending on the size of the object.  The light being emitted was brighter than anything I have ever seen- somewhat like a flashbulb that was on continually.  After a few seconds, the color shifted to a dark charcoal black with a halo ring around the perimeter.  The black was unlike anything I can describe.  Much darker than black itself…. Very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved slowly from West to East in the sky and kept switching from black to very bright.  I noticed a group of three men standing nearby and asked them what they thought it could be.  One replied &#34;that’s a balloon,&#34; and they went on talking and ignoring the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb began to move up into the heavens and get smaller.  By the time my ride arrived, I could still see it at a great distance but I could only see when it was bright, not black.  This was no balloon, not a military aircraft that I could identify (McCord AFB is nearby).  It certainly was not a helicopter or plane.  It is very difficult to describe the intensity and nature of the bright glow and the charcoal black.  I am certain that this was an unusual object that cannot be identified by any means of conventional wisdom, making it a UFO.<n>

What I captured initially were just routine fighter jets, when I played back the video, I saw a white light in the upper right corner of the frame. As I played the video from the beginning frame by frame, I noticed a single dot entering the frame converging with the second jet. In the next frame it appeared to go through the fighter jet forming black dots in the next frame above and below the jet, in the next frame three black dots appear  perfectly triangulating in close proximity around the jet. In the next frame they seem to have scattered. In the next few frames a light appears in the upper right corner of the frame, camera then goes out of view of object, camera steadies and in the next few frames a white light is seen again in the upper right corner descending rapidly, it goes out of focus for some frames until it is seen again, as a black dot converging with the fourth fighter jet. Then as soon as it converges in the next few frames is seen rapidly fleeing away at an ascending angle, the final image capture shows black dot above a previously unseen unknown object. With my limited access to better technology to further view these images, this is what I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to view the video.  PD))<n>

It appeared to be the size of a jet plane, and the blinking lights (red and white) at the &#34;corners&#34; resembled plane lights, but it was much lower and moved much slower than a plane. It also made a very low rumbling sound that did not sound like a plane. It moved in a west to east direction, gliding very smoothly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else witness this?<n>

While on Hwy 4 heading east it looked like whatever it was, landed somewhere I would estimate to be between Hwy 12 and Hwy 160. We assume it crashed/landed/exploded or whatever and illuminated the entire eastern skyline with 2-3 bright flashes of light. I thought at first it was lightening but funny thing. There wasn’t a single cloud out. We continued to monitor the sky on our drive home to Stockton and noticed as well several aircraft in the sky but we are more than certain these were normal airplanes.  We were both wondering if anybody else noticed this since we were not the only autos traveling Hwy 4 last night. Could this have been a meteor?<n>

He claims he was laying in bed with his curtains open and his eyes closed when he saw a bright light through his eye lids. He opened them up and looked out and saw a bright ball of light that zig-zagged up and away.  Right when the ball was moving up and away, the house started shaking.

Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a formation of about 6 (maybe 7) star-like shapes (no it wasn’t the Pleiades!), at about magnitude 3 flying in a WSW direction.  They were only visible for about 5 seconds in the area of Aquarius/Pisces.  They were quite faint, there was no sound and my impression was that they were fast.  That was it,  A couple of minutes later I saw the space station and a meteor to boot!<n>

I reached for my camera phone to take a picture, but within a matter of seconds the two bright streaks disappeared, from nearest the ground to the circle.  The circle disappeared when the streaks did.  I&#39;ve seen many, many meteors, and this was not a meteor.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We started a small fire, set up the tent, and made smores. As night fell, we turned out the lights to see the stars. At approximately 10:20 p.m. we saw an oval object appear in the sky. It hade no definite shape, but was glowing orange on the top half.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter, her friend and myself moved through the back yard to keep it in view around the trees. It was about 30 degrees above the horizon, and moved from our west to south. Its speed appeared to be slower than when we have watched planes. There were no lights (red, blue, green or white), only the orange glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all 3 remarked how it looked like something burning. I have witnessed shooting stars, comets, aircraft, hot air balloons, and even the occasional faint satellite, and this was none of those. The size was similar to that of a dime held at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My immediate thoughts were that there had been some sort of disaster with the shuttle or space station. My daughter said maybe a plane on fire, but we figured a plane would not keep speed and altitude if it were burning (plus there were no other lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that the confirmation of 2 11-year-old girls may not hold much weight, but we all saw something very different tonight.<n>

We suddenly saw an array of about 10-15 lights, appearing sequentially on the southern horizon. They were in groups of one to five, and were traveling along the same trajectory from south to north at a constant velocity—about the speed of a small plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to assess their size or altitude, but they appeared to be fairly large and spherical, with a single light in each shape. The lights appeared to be glowing, similar to waxing and waning yellow-colored flames. They were much larger in appearance than any meteors, satellites, or space shuttles we have ever seen in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they approached the northern horizon the lights dimmed until the lights were no longer visible, but the outlines of the objects gradually faded after the lights dimmed.

I had backed the boat into his garage so we would have some light to work by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2200 hours, my father said &#34;What&#39;s that up in the sky?&#34;  I looked out the open garage door, toward the northwest, to see a string of 6-8 &#34;orange flame&#34; colored lights traveling in a north easterly direction across the sky.  They were evenly spaced approximately 20-30 feet apart.  I stepped out of the garage and walked out into the gravel driveway in an attempt to get a better look.  I estimate that lights were between 300-500 feet from the ground traveling between 5-10 mph.  It appeared that the lights were attached to &#34;something&#34; as they moved in a linear direction with absolutely no change in speed, direction, or elevation.  My initial impression was that a small airplane was towing a rope with lit torches attached, through the night sky.  That thought quickly faded as there was absolutely no airplane related sounds what-so-ever during the entire time of the sighting.  In fact, everything was quiet.  I made a conscious effort to try and identify the shape or sort of object these lights were attached to without any success.  No sort of craft was visible or heard at all either between or near the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approximately 1-2 minutes, the lead light began to fade and went out.  My impression is that it looked exactly as if a torch had simply burned itself out.  The remainder of the lights dimmed and appeared to burn out, 1 by 1, from front to back in a similar fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When all the lights went out, we returned to working on the boat.  Neither of us could explain what we had just seen.

As the band was standing in form at attention, something caught my peripheral vision above my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lifted my head and very distant in the sky I saw a series of stars. At the time I was taking a physics class and I knew which were stars and what was not. Any way I saw a swirling blue and yellow light between 2 stars in the sky. I was able to study the movement because the marching band was receiving a lecture and we were not permitted to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I gazed at the blue-yellow light and recognized the pattern, it had seemed to be forming the same shapes as the marching band below it. At that time I grabbed the closest person and pointed in the direction of the light. Without describing what I saw, I had asked them if they see anything. The person had responded, &#34;Is that star moving?&#34; another person noticed and looked up as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to get the whole band to look without saying a word and they all saw what I saw. The band is multi-racial, and they all noticed. Apparently it spooked the directors, because I heard the tremble in their voices.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course some of them were in denial and said it was a satellite, but those move in straight lines, and there much more distant and dim. Others said it might have been an airplane, as they said that, an airplane flew under it. I said, &#34;No, my friend, that right there is an airplane, whatever that is, is not&#34;  The light that I have described from where I was standing appeared to be 2 centimeters in diameter. It was much brighter and closer than any star in the sky that night. It was close enough to see that it was moving. It didn&#39;t leave until the band practice was over. It appeared as though it was seeking entertainment from the marching band.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I happened to look up suddenly while entering the freeway from an on ramp of some small town just before Roseburg. Drove the curves for quite some  time with this object just continuing to descend it seemed, but never did. Lost sight of it around one curve and then it was gone. Appeared as though it would crash into the mountains, but didn&#39;t. So - was this an isolated meteor, or was it  something else? Wonder if anyone might know - I was  quite surprised to see this thing so bright and clear in broad daylight. This is the second time I have seen an anomalous object in the last several months - also reported that one  previously - this stuff is starting to creep me out as I have always thought I was a pretty grounded person and not unaccustomed to looking up at the sky and finding nothing remarkable!<n>
8/10/07 12:00|Hancock|ME|Cigar|2 minutes|Elongated cigar shape, translucent or transparent, controlled flight, no fuselage|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58323.html|361|ndxe200708| Elongated cigar shape, translucent or transparent, controlled flight, no fuselage<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was swimming at Hancock Point Dock, and after a swim, I laid down on the dock on my back. I had sunglasses on; these screened out UV and so I could see quite well. Clouds were at high altitude (cirrus), mostly blue sky and the clouds were scattered. I had been thinking that it would be a good time to spot and observe a UFO, which I am interested in generally. Previously at the dock, I had seen some somewhat unusual things including one craft which looked like a more angular Space Shuttle with no contrail at high altitude going southwest to northeast (that was in a previous month perhaps about May 2007, and it occurred just after the Space Shuttle was launched that day, so I assumed I may have seen the Space Shuttle although it seemed impossible to me at the time). Anyway on this day I was relaxed after swimming and saw a tubular shaped object. This looked like a translucent plastic tube, slightly tapered at both ends. It was proceeding from north to south at high altitude but below the cirrus clouds. I could see that because of its altitude, and because I could see it clearly, it must have been quite large, I would estimate about 30 feet wide or less. It looked like the general shape of straight across airplane wings, but was translucent looking similar to what a bubble or translucent plastic balloon, no color, and could see blue sky through it. Also, there was no fuselage or anything attached. The object moved much like airplane wings, not along its long axis but along the short axis for its direction of travel. It appeared quite stable in its motion and direction. I observed it for a minute or more; and although it did not seem to go behind any clouds, the object disappeared from view while it should have stayed in view. It did not look like any sort of &#34;floater&#34; or eye defect like that; it looked like a real object similar to a very high altitude balloon, and it did seem to slightly block out the upper cloud layer above it as it flew between me and the high cloud layer. It was defin! itely be low the cloud layer. Toward the end of the time when I was carefully watching this object, it seemed to waver slightly as if it was slightly shifted by wind, but this variation was very slight, and may have been a result of my own motion or even my imagination comparing the object&#39;s motion to the nearby cloud layer. This is really only the second time I felt I saw something unusual. In the early 1960s I saw a green fireball at night, silent, with green particles flying off it, but I had assumed at that time it was some sort of near Earth meteor and nothing very unusual-- (although that was the most phenomenal sighting of anything in my life-- with one friend (we were camping out, and my friend also saw that object). But that was huge; this translucent balloon looking thing was relatively tiny compared to that. There was no sound associated with the elongated balloon thing. One thing I would like to mention about it was that it did not seem random in its motion; rather, it stayed transverse to its flight path at all times as if it was controlled; a balloon would have moved end over end somewhat; this did not do that at all. As I said also it had no fuselage whatsoever, and seemed to have nothing at all other than the elongated translucent plastic looking material, slightly tapered at the ends but not pointed. I was wide awake at the time of the sighting, having just swum in very cold water, and I looked away several times and back at the object to test that it was really there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I smelled something unusual in the air like sulfur. I looked up at the stars and I noticed three stars blinked different colored lights. One star blinked red, another blinked green, one blinked a blueish color, and the other star was white. They were formed in a isolates triangle. If an aircraft was in the vicinity of one it would hover towards it. When it would hover I could see and trail of light coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little farther up I noticed what looked to be a oval-shaped object. About 5:00 a.m. CST I noticed lights coming for it in the shape of a circle with a Y inside. The lights were white and would fade on and off. About four time I would see a beam-like  flash of light coming from the oval-shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The white star seemed to follow the oval shaped object. All were heading in a northwestern pattern at a decent speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed that animals were acting strange. My cats were running, hiding, and refusing to go near and also a male deer came up close to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 5:40 I let my cats in my house. I came outside only find all possible UFOs had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to record it with my digital camcorder but I doubt the objects were bright enough to be recorded.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This light seemed to bounce in the sky like a butterfly. It was also moveing at a very fast pace. There was no other lights around this object. The light went behind a tree line around the stonecrest mall area. One night later on 8/11/07 around 9:45pm I saw a bright light flash twice and it went away. This was around wesley chapel Rd. My whole family saw it on this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We where on Madison Ave heading north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Grandson and I notice what we thought was a helicopter flying low at the intersection of Stop 11 and Madison Ave.  I told my Grandson that it was flying to low, and maybe it was a police helicopter looking for some one.  As I drove closer I notice one yellow and two white lights at which the white lights where  going on and off.  The yellow light stayed on.   As we got closer we could tell it was not a helicopter, and it was hovering above Stop 11 and Madison Ave.  I pulled into Egg Roll King Restaurant and stop my car to take a look, my Grandson got out of the car, I stay in the car.  It wasn&#39;t a plane or helicopter.  Both of us could see the bottom clearly.  The bottom looked like a triangle shape, I could see metal beams two on each side of the triangle.  I could not see the top, cause we where underneath the object.  The only lights we seen where on the bottom of the triangle.  The white lights we going off intermittently as the yellow stayed on.  I could see the outline above the triangle of the object.  It appeared to be somewhat oval shaped, and what I mean by that there where two spots where it protruded out and it equal in shape, opposite each other.  The color of the object was metallic, the triangle beams where of a black color.  We watched this object from one 1-2 minutes, then it started to move to the south slowly, then to the west.  We got back into the car and followed it for about half and hour, it want faster then higher and higher then disappeared.  I never in my whole life seen anything like it.  There also was no sound coming from it. I am also sending a picture, it&#39;s not the best drawing, but it it close to what we saw.  Thank you<n>

Out of nowhere, a triangle shaped object appeared at close range and at the same time, the roar stopped.  The object was completely silent and maintained an altitude of less than 100 feet for the duration of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object’s shape was in a triangle and was solid, as it had an outline and blocked out the stars behind it.  It was very dark, with each point of the triangle having a rather dim white light, and in the center was a blinking red light. These lights turned off for a period of perhaps one-half minute, just after I moved my position to be directly under the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the object seemed to be about 25 to 30 feet long from the front point to the back, and the dimension across the back, as seen later, seemed to be somewhat shorter.  It traveled very slowly (a human could have out! run it) on a level horizontal altitude toward the south/southwest, over pastures, a road and then a bean-field, for about one-half mile before I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed over the bean-field, I noted that the back end of the triangle seemed to be less than 10 feet high, and completely but dimly lit with white light.  A few times, the land below and to its left glowed with a soft white diffused light.  The sky just above the illuminated land was lighter than the sky above the object, but only up to the height of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My view was unobstructed during its path except for a few moments when 2 or 3 trees got in the way.  The sky was dark with no clouds and airplanes (with running lights on) could be easily seen flying at high altitudes.  There were no planes at low altitudes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duration of sighting may have been about 3 to 4 minutes, hard to tell, as I was rather stunned to see such a thing.  I did not think it was an airplane, glider, helicopter or any other object I had ! ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired attorney living in the country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other witnesses.<n>

He called me over and we were watching for about 5 minutes or so when we saw the object get very bright almost as if it had stopped and just started glowing intensely.  At this point, my son started watching and we were pointing at the object.  Then two other planes came in from behind the object.  They began flying in formation behind the object for several miles.  The object itself was very light and seemed high in the sky.  The planes followed closely behind the small light until it was out of view.  The odd part was that we live near enough to the airport, that we see planes all the time.  These planes made no sound at all.

Another thing that was very strange is that these lights would change flight patterns and would zig-zag.  These lights acted the very same way.  They were traveling much faster than a passenger plane.  They looked like the brightest stars in the sky but after you looked at them for a couple of seconds, they would begin to move at a high rate of speed to another section in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up and there was what looked to be a plane with wings similar to a Concord.  It seemed as though it was flying very low and was approximately the size of a 50-passenger plane.  It was light grey/off white in color.  I don&#39;t know how far this object was from me, but I think it was extremely low because from where I was I could see six brackets underneath (three on each side) attached from the body of the plane to the wings. They looked like L-brackets but were spanning out on the wings at about 45 degree angles.  There were no markings on it and I did not see any windows.  It seemed somewhat normal except for the fact that it was FLYING BACKWARDS.  It looked as if it was man made, it sounded like it was man made, but the fact that it was flying backwards totally threw me off.

I did not have a hard time focusing on it as it was completely stationary (clouds were flowing by it at a good clip).  Anyway after about 5-minutes of viewing the craft seemed to go into a cloud.

I focused my attention to the area and then I was able to see many objects in the sky. The objects seemed to be of diamond shape, but completely flat, so just imagine a 2-d diamond.  It was metallic in color as it reflected the sunlight extremely well when the horizontal plane was perpindicular to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immeadeately told my friend about what I was obeseving and told him to focus his attention towards that airspace, but he was not able to observe them. I remembered that I had been wearing my polarized sunglasses so I took them off so he could have a look, and lo and behold he could see them too. This was the case for a minute or two but when we grew closer we were able to observe them with the naked eye. The objects movement was so calculated, it was most reminiscent to a group of sardines swimming in the ocean, in that they all were oreinted in the same direction and turning and interacting with one another with crazy precision. It was funny because my friend and I had been keeping ourselves entertained by sharing mostly everything that we have heard/seen about ufo&#39;s from coast2coast and various other surces and BAM! who would have known that we would be able to observe something so awesome as what we saw.<n>

I was walking back from my car toward my girlfriend’s house when I happened to look up.  As soon as I did, I witnessed a single bright orange ball moving extremely fast from west-to-east in a straight line, and the color did not appear to shift or become dimmer at any point.  By the time I came around to the front of the house and tried to get a better look, I could no longer see the orb.  The object was certainly not any sort of aircraft I have ever seen.  It appeared to be solid, and its height did not appear to fluctuate.  In other words, the motion was completely lateral--parallel to the surface of the Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no tail, so I immediately ruled out the possibility of a meteor or comet, not to mention the fact that the object was certainly not falling.  If I were to wager a guess, I would say it was flying at an altitude of 1000-1500 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my view, it was roughly the size of my thumbnail, probably a little larger, which suggests to me that it was [naturally] a great deal larger.  The craft emitted no sound whatsoever, and there were no aircraft in the vicinity.<n>

I&#39;m an amateur astronomer/sky watcher and had a pair of 16X Nikons. I noticed a rather bright &#34;star&#34; moving from the NW to the SE. I watched it for @3 seconds and it disappeared. Then 3-4 seconds later it reappeared, still traveling in the same direction. I got the binoculars on it and it appeared simply as one of the brighter stars, in motion and with a constant glow. It repeated this twice, on the last &#34;illumination&#34; it came to a dead stop, increased in brightness @ 4X, remained at this maximum illumination for @ 2 seconds, and disappeared. That&#39;s it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said, this object appeared as nothing more than a moving star, a rather common sighting of terrestrial origins. It was not moving exceptionally fast, it was the on/off of the &#34;light&#34; and it&#39;s finale that I found unusual. As for altitude I can&#39;t speculate beyond that, though not in what would be called space, it was MUCH higher than conventional civilian/commercial aircraft operate at. I&#39;ve no idea what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Not off of the ground, but more like over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being military, I have seen some weird things, and never believed in UFO&#39;s.  However, this was amazing.  They moved slowly, and then would jump straight up probably 2 or 3 hundred meters, then would come back together. it had greenish blue lights, and id say i could count about 10 or so lights on the side facing me on each of them.  It lasted about 6 or 7 minutes, and then they went beyond the hill, and I couldn&#39;t see them. I ran inside to get a video camera hoping they would come back, but they didn&#39;t. When I was stationed at Fort Hood Texas, we saw a few weird things in the sky, but nothing ever like this. we always thought it was people doing night training..but this is not Fort Hood, and I&#39;m not aware of any night training missions around here.

When you are near them, tiny sparkles of light randomly appear like tiny flashes of a camera.  Often there is a strobe beacon in the area of them as well, and they do react to motion and light.  I also see on a regular basis a formation of lights, as well as lower altitude crafts with multiple color effects.  These tend to hover at a higher altitude in horizontal and vertical motion.  Usually to the East but have seen them South and West at times.  These craft preclude heavy orb activity up and down Arivaca road, and I have started seeing more and more orbs lately.  I work out in the desert at night, so I see them from 11pm to 3am.  I know where to find them consistently, and reliably in the same areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

During that time it has moved about 35 deg. across the horizon. It then became stationary for about 5 minutes. After that time it proceeded to move again.

8/7/07 22:00|Erie|PA|Fireball|over one hour|Orange Flaming Orbs fall from the sky over Lake Erie, August, 2007|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77134.html|396|ndxe200708| Orange Flaming Orbs fall from the sky over Lake Erie, August, 2007<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Event occurred during a late summer rain storm. Although the rain was not heavy, the dark cloud over Lake Erie was distinct. The phenomena observed began as a casual observance of a single speck of light. We observed what appeared from the shoreline as a light perhaps a mile or two offshore. The only way we could observe this occurence was with an average powered pair of field binoculars. At first looking through the binoculars it appeared as if it might be a small boat, but closer examination revealed that this was something &#34;on fire&#34;. I quickly alerted my companion to look into the binoculars to get his opinion. He also saw this ball of flame. What happened after this first encounter was quite startling. Let me say that I have never had a close encounter and am suspect of anything currently being written about the UFO phenomenology. However the unfolding events of that night have not only startled me, but have stayed with me for the last three years. O! nly today was I able to define my observances based on other eye-witnesses who had similar sightings. They have described what they similarly saw as &#34;orange flaming orbs&#34;. Other descriptions were ascribed to them, but in my case the &#34;orange flaming orbs&#34; fits the description perfectly. I thought that one orb appearance was enough, but what makes this an even more intriguing mystery is that after this first orb disappeared beyond the Lake Erie&#39;s horizon line, another one began to fall from the low hanging dark storm cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have read other accounts and descriptions of &#34;ascending lights&#34; and fast lateral moving lights but these were not like that at all. We watched as consecutive flaming orbs fell very slowly from the sky and eventually into the water. What is also amazing is how each was orchestrated in its falling velocity (extremely slow-- slower than a parachutist, so we knew this wasn&#39;t a nighttime military mission) and also that the intensity of the light stayed consistent-- from the time it appeared coming out of the dark cloud until it hit the water&#39;s horizon line. I should note that there were no sounds being emitted and no sounds of jets, airplane or helicopter engines were heard. The fact that it was a drizzling rain (with no lightning, I might add) made it impossible for this to be man-made-- such as what I thought it might be: a summer &#34;art performance&#34; by some of the local artists. No one in their right mind would want to be out in this weather on the vastness of Lake Erie. No ot! her lights appeared-- suche as boats or planes. The house we observed all of this from is remote from the city so no street, traffic or building lights could have interfered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As much as I am recreating this story, we unfortunately had no access to good night time cameras or videos, but I would testified unequivocally that this was a phenomena that deserved a full and further investigation. To continue with the observation, we stood on the back porch with a full panoramic view to the west toward Cleveland and to the east toward Buffalo. We were facing north toward Canada when these lights were observed. In the same fashion as described earlier, we observed at least 16 of these same flaming orbs extremely slowly fall from the sky and into the waters. As each one disappeared the next one began to come out from the underside of the cloud. This event went on for at least one hour. There were more that continued to fall and perhaps a whole string of them from our line of sight and down toward Buffalo, but I actually felt frightened (amazed and excited as well) and wanted to report this occurance to the Lawrence Park police, but being a skeptic and resp! ectful of this tiny suburb and being late at night I hesitated to call anyone to bring undo attention to the neighborhood. I looked in the Erie Times News the next day to see if there was a story about this light phenomena, but did not find anything, nor was there anything on the television. This event has stayed with me since 2007. It is only today that I found your reporting website and also found better descriptors based on other observances.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Shortly after seeing this noticed what appeared to be a falling star to the right of the first object and several miles away.  The falling star came to rest in the sky at a considerable distance from where it first appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the second object came to rest, it had the same appearance as the first.  Flickering and was moving.  It moved out of sight at a very slow pace.  My view was obstucted by trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted approximately 10-15 minutes.  In fact, the first object is still visable.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/6/07 22:45|Texarkana (10 mi. S of)|AR|||Inexplicable bright lights and moving objects|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58029.html|404|ndxe200708| Inexplicable bright lights and moving objects<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event date: 08/06/2007 Time of occurrence: between 10:30 P.M. and 11:00 P.M.<n> <n><n> Location: Southwest Arkansas (approx. 10 miles south of Texarkana)<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were sitting on his front patio conversing when over his shoulder I saw a somewhat red/white light appear above the horizon in the eastern/southeastern sky moving at a 45 degree angle and then the light became a series of 3-4 white rectangular lights that appeared in a stepwise fashion, each bright light burning for a second and fading.  My friend could tell from my reaction to the initial lights that something was unusual, so he turned in time to see the last couple of bright lights burning/fading.  We were astonished and confused.  He said, “Maybe it was fireworks.”  I disagreed.  Within seconds another series of 3-4 bright white rectangular lights burned in a periodic, stepwise manner further north in the sky.  This scenario continued with the lights sometimes burning at angles, thus appearing diamond shaped, sometimes flatter and rectangular.  One time the lights appeared and did not fade before the next appeared; this left an angled series of five or six bright, white, diamond-shaped lights that illuminated and faded in 2-3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Star-like points of light also appeared and remained illuminated for long stretches of time as they moved in random paths in the sky.  It was difficult to determine how many of these points of light were moving simultaneously in different parts of the night sky, but I would estimate four at one point.  The aforementioned large, bright, white lights seemed to originate from these point of light, which were like fast moving stars.  The points of light would change direction haphazardly.  I was watching one of these points of light that appeared in the direction of Cassiopeia and headed southward in the sky very quickly when my friend said there was another further south moving toward yet another one that was slowly moving, then seemed to become stationary as the other light approached it; these two lights converged and disappeared for a split second only to reappear as a single bright, white light that moved away very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were airplanes in the clear sky on this evening, and they were easy to distinguish with their flashing red lights and straight paths in the sky.  It was difficult to gauge the distance to these lights against the night sky, however the distance seemed significant from our perspective.  One of these starlike points moved so rapidly across the sky it had to have been moving extremely fast and been a little closer, but it was the tiniest pinpoint of light and still seemed quite a distance away.  We had an open view to much of the horizon, and the activity occurred in a range from the horizon to approximately 30-40 degrees above the horizon.  After we had witnessed a few of these lights I went upstairs to get my friend’s wife and her sister to have them witness these lights.  They stuck their heads out the upstairs window and saw a round and said, &#34;Cool,&#34; then returned to their movie, not as impressed as we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend is an agriculture pilot in that area; I am a Registered Nurse, with multiple science degrees and way too many generic science classes taken over the years.  We are not crazy; we were not intoxicated; and I would hesitate to tell too many people.  But we did see these unusual things in the sky, and I am sure there’s some rational governmental explanation, and I would love to hear it!<n>

A very bright light illuminated and went off.  Then what looked like an inch in the sky to the right another very bright light went off. This repeated a 3rd and 4th time.  Then I saw the first of what would be atleast 15-20 of these strange red and blue lighted cigar shaped crafts.  It just went directly left like 4 inches in sky then dissapeared.  Then another bright light appeared and went off.....moved inch right and on and off again...then moved up and on and off....then left (completing a square).  Then I saw what had to be 3 of the cigar shaped red and blue lighted crafts going in differnt directions and they were traveling extremly slow.  Seemed to just blow in the wind and none made any noise.  I went inside to get my mother to show her the display and she saw the cigar first then few minutes later the bright lights started again. She got scared and went inside and I soon followed.  We opened the mini-blinds in the living room window to keep watching. Ten minutes went on with the bright lights and cigar shaped ships.  The cigar shaped ones had the ability to be visible then non-visible, just like the bright lights.  Then the strangest of all the occurances happened and I have no good way of describing it.  An extremly bright neon red light shot up in the middle of the sky and it changed colors as it got higher in the sky to neon orange then neon yellow.  The light looked to be 1 inch long at the base. Then the left side curved to the right.  The right side curved to the right.  The light met at one point where the curved sides met. This illuminated the sky.  It was a light like I have never seen.  Then it dissapeared.  I continued to see the cigar shaped ones and the bright lights untill 10:55.  I do not know if it stopped when I stopped looking.....I was too scared to watch anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was going incredibly fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I told my husband to look, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It definitely was not a meteor or conventional air craft.

Stayed stationary for 10 mins. Noticed many aircraft in vacinity to compare it to. Was about twice the intensity of Venus. As I was watching it it just blinked out and was gone. As it dissapeared it gave the impression that it dissapeared from left to right, as if someone had rubbed out the left side before the right side. Anyhows, it was gone in less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It first appeared to be in a corkscrew type trajectory, then seemed to emit clouds of smoke, and then travelled in a straight line although appeared to be descending at a shallow angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing is that it emitted no sound whatsoever and was travelling extremely fast.  We regularly have aircraft passing overhead at both high and low altitudes from Coventry and East Midlands airports so are used to the relative altitude, speed and sound.  This object did not seem to be like anything we have seen before and myself, my wife and my son all witnessed it.  Unfortunately it happenned too fast to capture on video but was a very strange sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I emailed our local airports but they suggested it may be a meteor or similar as I recall but have kept the email I sent at the time from which this report is based.<n>

Lights on wing tips and also a white strobe and a red strobe visable. 3 traveling in the same flight path easterly. Behind the 3 at a distance we saw a solid white light traveling the same flight path. This object had no visable flashing red or white, strobe type lights. Just one big solid white light. It seemed to travel faster then the airliner in front of it. It appeared to almost catch the airliner but then drop lower in the horizon. This light was followed by 3 more of what appeared to be commercial airliners with their flashing lights. The airliner that was behind this strange light must have seen this light also along with the 2 others behind it. There were again several more airliners following each other in that same flight path a total of aprox 9 more all in aprox 15 minutes. Then witnessed another single light traveling north westerly a little smaller in size then the first, and again no other lights present. This light was headed on and intersecting course with what appeared to be another airliner. The two crossed paths at what had to be different altitudes or they certainly would have collided.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These pilots would have certainly seen these lights at a close distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure what we seen but the sky was busy a total of 20 airliners and 2 unidentified in the sky over a 20 minute period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We were sitting around a campfire in Success, New Hampshire at around 9:30 or 9:45pm on August 5th, 2007 at the edge of Success Pond. Other than the several camps around the pond, there is nothing in the way of civilization for many miles, going in any direction. There are no street lights and no light pollution from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overhead coming out of the west, a very bright whitish light could be seen, moving at a high rate of speed. The light was bigger than Venus in size, and as bright or maybe a bit brighter, and the color was the blue tinged white, like a white LED or classic fluorescent kind of white. There appeared to be a football shape to the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled over our heads, across the pond, going in an East-Northeast direction, vanishing over the state of Maine. It was above the clouds as it vanished behind the high clouds twice, to reappear after getting in to clear sky again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would be easy to pass what we saw off as a satellite in orbit, but it was clearly wobbling and moved like a fish tail in water, in a shallow S or slalom back and forth, while maintaining a straight course. It was also much brighter and larger than any normal satellite would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in sight for 2-3 minutes before vanishing over the horizon. There was no noise, although when a jet passes over one can eventually hear the faint sound of the engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS passed over NH at 22:08 hrs..  PD))<n>

It flew as if a helicopter would-maybe a little slower-and made no sound. This occured as storms were rolling in from several directions. It came into my vision lower in the sky and continued rising at a steady pace as it flew northwest and into a dark storm cloud. Strangely enough, I have witnessed the same event before-right before an intense thunderstorm. It was maybe a year or two ago about a mile away from this second sighting. It happened exactly the same way, about the same time of day, but flew from the southwest to the northeast disappearing into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I only saw them for 5-9 seconds as I was driving southbound. They appeared to be at least as high in the sky as the tallest building in the skyline. I could not tell however how close they were. They could have been large and far away or smaller but closer.Then when I passed a hill next to the freeway the orbs were gone.

There was what looked to me like a metal weather balloon with engines on both sides.  I had a head on view of it.  I did not stop to look up when I drove under it.  It was less than a 100 feet above my head when I drove under it.  It was parked between two mountains where the road intersected it, just floating in the air.  It looked exactly like the Haiti UFOs seen the same weekend.  It was practically silent except when I drove under it I could hear a constant whirring noise, just a few decibels above my car noise with the window down.  I thought it was a weather balloon or some advertisement until I realized (when I got far enough away to see it in my rear view mirror) that it was no longer there and secondly when I saw the Haiti videos.  I could not see the engines since I was in a car and my view above me was clipped, and since I was driving up a hill when I saw it head on it was only the metal that I saw.  It was on the same scale of a car or two length.  I thought it was much further than it was until I kept getting closer and the scale changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The sky was crystal clear. This was a round or oval type craft that had a glowing orange oval or ball around it the orange glow would fade in and out at times it almost looked as though there was a smaller light on the bottom. The glowing light was out of this world nothing I have ever seen before. There was no sound from the object. The object was moving very fast it traveled from west to east rather fast taking only a few seconds to get across.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Seen by 8 people.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58307.html|426|ndxe200708| An fast flying ornage sphere, flaring brightly each time it made 90 and over 90 degree turns.  Seen by 8 people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred on Saturday, the evening of the 4th of August in Canaan Maine.  My friends and I have a regular camping spot that we meet at just about every weekend during the summer to camp and cook out and enjoy the spectacular view.  The spot is on a ridge, and known locally as &#34;The Pinnacle.&#34;  This night, it lived up to its name.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the Pinnacle, an observer has an expansive view of a large lake valley oriented more or less due west, with the north and south views open before the tree line by about 75%.  The valley is bordered on all sides by long low ridgelines, like the one we were camping on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends and I were cooking dinner on an open fire when my girlfriend mentioned that she could see a light moving in the distance.  I stood up and looked where she was pointing and could see an obvious orange orb, having approximately the size color and brightness of Mars on one of its closest approaches.  The orange orb was moving parallel to our ridge, in a more or less south to north direction.  The were no features on the orb other than its clear spherical shape.  No protrusions of wings or tail, and no lights to speak of, blinking or otherwise.  It was the lack of running lights that first made me really question what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, I called it to the attention of my friends and we all started watching it.  It was obviously very far away, but for that, it was moving very fast to our perspective.  Much much faster than a plane would have.  For nearly five minutes we watched it cross about half of the full sky from our point of view, and then it suddenly flared bright arc welder white and at the same time made a 90 degree turn to the east and started coming more or less toward our position.  When that happened we all gasped as one and all conversation that been going on as to its nature ceased.  From this point until it vanished later, we were silent.  It traveled for another three or four minutes, seeming to approach almost right over us. and then just as suddenly flared again and made another turn, of over 90 degrees this time, so that it was heading about northwest.  We watched it for another couple of minutes until it vanished beyond the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that we started talking about what we had seen and tried out different explanations to try to explain it away, but nothing fit.  A satellite wouldn&#39;t have changed directions and flared the way it did.  Neither would the space station.  A meteorite would have burned up after only a few seconds, not ten minutes, and certainly not changed direction multiple times.  A helicopter would have had running lights, and considering how high up we were, would have been clearly visible as such.  Also, it would not have been self-illuminated over its whole body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the main things that interested me was the fact that it didn&#39;t slow in the least when it made its turns, as if inertia didn&#39;t exist.  At the speed it was going, inertia would have required it to slow down, and that&#39;s assuming a plane could even make the angle of turns this thing was making, which to my knowledge, they cant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as confirmation of everything we were thinking, about twenty minutes after the sighting we saw a pair of what were obviously planes flying fast and at high altitude.  Whether by coincidence or not, they were streaking in the direction of where we last saw the orb.  Chasers perhaps?  At any rate, the difference between the planes and the orb we saw were obvious, and just cemented the unusual qualities of what we had seen that night.  Some of my friends are a bit more skeptical of these sorts of things than I am, but even they were left speechless and agreeing that what we had seen was definitely beyond conventional explanation...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From our vantage point it appeared to be above the Siegen Lane area however it was most likely over the Gulf.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mass was over the size of several airplanes in my opinion. While we were observing, it broke into 4 separate pieces that appeared to be the size of an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now to put some size reference on what I mean by &#34;the size of an airplane&#34;, when you look up into the sky and see a jet flying overhead at the highest point you have seen one, then you understand what I mean by &#34;the size of an airplane&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately we did not think to whip out our cell phones and take a picture, we were in awe of what we were seeing. I have yet to see anything on this in the news. We did not see any other streaks across the sky that may have given us the thought that it was just a meteor shower.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear sky; sun was coming up when I looked straight up and noticed a lot of contrails.  There were 360 degree turns, 180s, 90s just all over, but pretty much confined to being over central Florida, Orlando area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I followed the trails I pretty much guessed it was probably fighter aircraft out of MacDill AFB, Tampa.  I thought maybe an early morning skirmish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove my car out of the garage and continued on to work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped at a large intersection approximately 3mi. to the north of my house and happened to glance up at the contrails.  Two bright white stars were right in the middle of all the trails.  I thought those are awfully bright stars till I looked at the rest of the sky – NO STARS.  The sun was rising (0630) and washed out the rest of the stars but these two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were absolutely still, no movement at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light changed and I continued on to work.  (I didn’t even notice the head-on collision that just took place before the light changed).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stopped by another traffic light approximately 3 miles farther north.  I looked up again.  One of the lights had moved a little farther away, but remaining relatively motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light changed and I kept watching as I drove.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light that had moved slightly off began to go straight up, faded and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second light remained for approximately 5 minutes more and then did the same, began to go straight up, faded and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within two minutes after the last one disappeared; a jet airliner went directly underneath where the two lights were.  The jet was leaving a contrail, but was only 1 to 2 miles behind and it was disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The contrails these objects left lasted for the best part of an hour and a half.  These objects were at a much higher altitude than the jet liner as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also found out later that morning the Mars probe was launched from Cape Canaveral around 0530.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some guy tried to tell me it was the trail from the rocket as it went up.  I have lived in Central Florida for over 50 years and watched way too many rocket launches to know it was not the rocket trail that drifted over.  The launch pad is a good 60 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before, but it sure was interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were bright enough to light up the clouds in that given spot and would occur every 5-15 seconds for 1 hour. I called a nearby relative who went outside and seen the flashes were actually in 3 spots. The flashes repeatedly appeared in these 3 spots with no solid pattern detected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 hours later, I looked outside and the spot I noticed before had moved a lot closer but no longer flashing every 5-15 seconds and now more like every minute or so now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A one point I heard what sounded like a helicopter outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This could very well be some very active heat lightning, though never seen a bolt.

EVERY star in the sky was white, white maybe a bluish twinkle to it. this was just red blinking light. but it was so tiny to see, i was thinking maybe it was mars, i know thats red, and maybe the atmosphere made the &#34;blinking&#34; just much more apparent. after 10 minutes of wondering what it was, i remembered my video camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i am an aviation minded person, and i live near BUSH (hobby) airport. i know what an airliner looks like at 40 k, at night....this was MUCH higher. what i did notice about what i saw, was how it moved...but so slow, that i couldn&#39;t recognize it at first. the only way was to use reference points on the horizon (my house) over time. when i noticed it didn&#39;t follow the same path as the rest of the stars, i started to doubt myself. at first it was moving towards a solo star in the southwestern side of the sky. minutes later, checking my same reference points. it had moved away considerably from the solo star. it also  had two smaller items that were emitted. they were bright white, floated around the &#34;red blinker&#34;, back and forth a few times, then rejoined. this happened twice. (but not caught on film.)  with the camera, i could then tell it was TWO rapid strobes next to each other going off. but, it also emitted green color as well. it was a third color, but not a third &#34;bulb&#34;  so both lights went from red to white, and sometimes green. but it was FAST!! like hyper speed Morse code...<n> <n><n> <n><n> the thing disappeared to my naked eye, but i could still hold it on the camcorder. but it was fading. it didn&#39;t &#34;go below the horizon&#34; it didn&#39;t &#34;take off like a rocket, in some direction..it just FADED...not like an aircraft going over a large distance.i searched for another ten minutes. couldn&#39;t find it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> have 30 minutes of footage (roughly 10 minutes actual, on and off). have no idea what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> here is a quick video that i did for an onlinde aviation forum . this is heavily cut just for &#34;quick and dirty purpsoses&#34; to see if they have any idea. i have no clue what it is, the way things are these days, its hard to tell, so i try not to speculate...it is what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [URL=http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v205/GAU-8/?action=view&amp;current=whatisthis.highquality.flv][IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v205/GAU-8/th_whatisthis.highquality.jpg[/IMG][/URL]<n>

As he was describing the triangular craft with 3 big orange lights when we actually saw it over in the distance! It was facing us, then rotated to its left, our right... So fast that the orange lights left trails going sideways. I was shocked! My husband told me it was definatley the same thing he saw riding ridiculously low to the crops on his way to work. He didn&#39;t know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I&#39;ve looked this up on the internet, and I did find a picture of the exact same lights, and the article that followed said these were flares being dropped from a plane. Well I think that is a bunch of B.S. because we actually saw the craft for one thing, and flares being dropped would leave trails going down not sideways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We don&#39;t know what this is, whether its some secret military aircraft they&#39;re testing out here in the middle of nowhere, or if its aliens but we definately saw it.<n>

I&#39;m not sure if it was ball lightning or something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 11:30pm and after the rain and lightning had passed, I stepped outside on the back porch for a cigarette.  I did not see any lightning at the time or hear any thunder that I recall (but I was not listening for it).  I was facing the north to the back yard and decided to turn around.  Just as I turned to the south, I saw what looked like a comet but larger shoot across the sky.  I can only describe it as a very large comet, white light, with a tail.  It flew under the clouds in the south which would be in the Watertown direction.  Since it was cloudy, the object was low, and quite large (from a distance), I can only estimate that it was not a comet or shooting star.  Stunned (for I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before), I waited to see if anything else would transpire.  Some lightning did issue from the clouds to the south, along with some thunder shortly after, the kind that webs out of the sky toward the ground, but what I had seen a moment before had shot horizontally from west to east, and was a lone object not attached to any such electrical webbing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I brushed this even off as being a first time sighting of &#39;ball lightning&#39;.  This morning I looked it up on the web, and although it is sometimes described as having a tail, I am only coming upon stories of &#39;ball lightning&#39; &#34;hovering&#34; and moving slowly, which is a little confusing to me.  What I saw did not hover or move slowly, nor did it resemble the ball lightning I came upon in a short film on YouTube.  This moved quickly and brightly, like a ball of white fire.  I do suppose it could be ball lightning, but am not sure.  If anyone else in the area had seen it, reported it, or experienced the sort in the past, I would very much like to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a hazy sky last night with large grey clouds moving to the north.  The first time we saw the light, it was a bright light moving at a high rate of speed high in the sky over Canyon Lake.  It was moving north to southwest.  There was a large grey cloud in front of it, so at first we thought it was a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the cloud moved, we saw the light would move from North to Southwest, back to North and then it would move from North to Northeast stopping at certain points, then go back to the Southwest.  It was a cycle that never stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then thought that it might have been a strobe of light from the ground like the large lights they put in a parking lot to attract attention, but we never saw any strobe of light from the ground up.  This light pattern was high up in the sky and it would change it’s interval’s of speed, but never changing the pattern that it took.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have a telescope, but due to the rate of speed and the distance that it would travel, we could not capture it.  We did not have a camera or a video to take any picture of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to go to bed, but opened our curtains to watch from our bed.  This pattern of light showed non-stop, the last time I checked the time, it was around 1:00 a.m., at that point, it had not stopped.<n>

The object was incredibly bright, and I would say as bright as Venus when it was visible here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The things that interested me most was 1) It was NOT flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) There was NO sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) There was no trails of any kind and NO smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4) It was an incredibly bright white light that seems to be round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size was either massive because it was close, or it was the light it was emitting was just very bright. It never dimmed. In fact it stayed the same brightness as it passed over me and only faded as it got far away. Had the hospital not been blocking a further view, I estimate I would have seen it for a few miles. I compared it with the few stars left in the sky and it was incredibly big and very far away, or close, and so bright it just looked big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last time I saw this was on July 31, 2007 at approximately 5:30am (eastern time) traveling in the exact opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We questioned each other about what they might be, and decided to attempt to follow.  We continued to see them for about 3-5 minutes, but then lost track of them through the trees, while driving.  They were hovering, seemingly just above rooftops, briefly hesitating and holding still at times, but mostly moving slowly across the sky.  The red and blue lights along the V were very pronounced, and stead not blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

8/3/07 21:00|Princeton|IL|Triangle|2 minutes|Slow, low flying triangle shaped craft, three white lights, one red blinking light|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58023.html|442|ndxe200708| Slow, low flying triangle shaped craft, three white lights, one red blinking light<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event occurred between 9 pm and 11pm on Friday, August 3, 2007, and was viewed solely by me from my rural residence located in mid-central Illinois, about 40 miles north of Peoria. The sky was slightly light-colored and not sharply clear (e.g., not intensely black with entire Milky Way in view), but stars, planets and high-flying airliners and their distinctive running lights were clearly visible.  There was no precipitation, no fog and no moon out at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood facing south, looking at the stars and planets in the sky. All of a sudden, I heard a roar over my right shoulder (i.e., from the north).  I turned toward the sound. The roar stopped abruptly and I saw that there was an object in the sky almost directly overhead - actually west of my position by no more than 700 feet.  It had an altitude of about 1,000 feet and seemed to be a solid black object, triangular in shape, and having three white lights, each at the object’s extremities in a triangular pattern, with a centered red light, blinking regularly and somewhat hurriedly.  As it moved away, the blinking red light made at least one white light appear to be blinking as well – an optical illusion?  The object could be blocked from view by a nickel held at arm’s length. The shape, size and black color were confirmed by how the object blocked the sky and stars from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft moved quite slowly, smoothly and silently.  Its speed was significantly less than a typical small aircraft; a car would have very easily overtaken it. It was clearly not a helicopter. The object flew south/southwest and could easily be seen for at least 3-4 miles.  As it flew, its altitude was even more clearly seen to be about 1,000 feet. It was the lowest object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved southward, the sky and land below and to the east of its path twice glowed with soft diffused white light; however perhaps this could be explained as being the result of weather anomalies, particularly as there was no clear view of any light beam emanating from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total viewing time of the event was about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was cloudless and unusually clear for my urban location. I had just watched several satellites pass overhead, when I noticed a light low in the southern sky. At first I thought it was another satellite however it seemed a lot brighter and faster than the ones I had just been watching. The object was going from South to North and appeared to be at great altitude. Numerous general aviation and commercial aircraft were visible at the same time. The object appeared to be self luminous instead of reflecting sunlight, as it had an unusual blue/purple tinge similar to an electric welding torch. The object passed almost directly overhead of my location, continuing North until I lost sight of it behind the roofline of my house. The light maintained a straight course the entire time I could see it, traversing the sky from where I first saw it to where I lost sight of it in approximately one minute or so. Shortly before I lost sight of the object it blinked out and lit up again in a regular pattern about three times, going dark for several seconds. I checked the Heavens Above site and could find no info about any satellites passing overhead at that time. I also watched the next few nights to see if the object would reappear and I did see the satellites I had seen that night, but no sign of the bright, fast moving object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She did not see the images at the time the photo was taken but they are quite evident in the picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was taking pictures of the sun as it shown, dimly through a thick layer of smoke from nearby forest fires. To the right of the sun is a silvery object, resembling a bicycle helmet. I have asked 2 professional photographers and they assured me the image is not a prism, or lens reflection and the object does exist in the setting in which it was pictured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also pictured is a round silvery blur, which though more distinct, may be explained as a reflection off the lens.

There were no clouds in the sky and was completely sunny.  I looked up and saw two glowing light green oblong/cigar shaped objects side-by-side flying in the sky that looked as though they were either flying away from me or actually falling from the sky.  They were moving faster than I have ever seen anything in the sky move.  As I continued to watch them for around 8 seconds or so they vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a light, about the size of a star, rapidly blinking red and white. The object was very high in the sky, moving very swiftly, in a zig-zag pattern, from north to south. It moved much faster than any plane I had ever seen. As it passed over I stood up to get a better look and it split into two orbs right before my eyes. They both continued on in a zig-zag pattern to the south and I lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were looking at the sky and just talking. We both looked up and we saw a bright orange/tan light, and at first we thought it was a plane. All of a sudden, the light zoomed ahead, and slowly dimmed. We looked for it with binoculars, but could not find anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A short while after, it came back, getting closer to us, but not as bright.

It was late in the evening, about 10-11 at night, when I saw first noticed it and it took a good minute or two to get from where I first saw it until it disappeared behind a mountain. I never made mention to anyone else to confirm what I saw because, unfortunately enough, I’m the only believer in the group of aliens and UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just a ball of light, no other flashing or blinking lights on the sides like a regular small plane would have and I didn’t hear a sound from it. Though several seconds after the light disappeared, a small plane did fly over in the same exact &#34;path&#34; (for the lack of a better term) the light flew over.<n>

Seemed to be coming straight at us them turned and went directly north. Stayed very bright orange and had no other lights. Was about 9:15 pm watched it move slowly until out of site. Speed and no blinking lights along with strange sharp right turn seemed to rule out conventional aircraft. Was in middle of lake and had un obstructed view at all times.

I could not identify it as anything I have seen before so I mentioned to my sons and my husband .. he pulled over and stopped to look at it. It was a bright white light, nothing else was visable around it and there werent any additional lights like you see on an airplane or helicoptor. It did travel at a consistant rate of speed in a liner path. Imagine your watching the night sky and see a satellite ,, it was like that only much closer to the ground and far far brighter. anyway ,, we have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

(It remaining steady) At this point I pointed out the object to my girlfriend next to me and she aknowledged and pointed out an other one next to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So then I look over counting a total of five of them The first one closest to me must have been at a lover altitude ore it was bigger in sice I dont know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other four were visible at the same altitude ore size, they were sitting there in a formation stright line with the two last ones forming a arrow tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The exact location was between seatac and Sattle downtown I&#39;d say right over Beakon hill. Its to difficuld to guess the altitude my guess 5000feet Agl or less then 10000 AGl.

We live in the town called Cowiche its north of Yakima out in the country. It was a very clear night with the stars out.  There is a cannon that leads far into the hills and towards Tampico. You can see at least 3 miles up the cannon from a distance as the slope goes up toward the mountain base. We were on a flat stretch that is called the hop stretch and at that angle you could see up the entrance of the Cowiche cannon. We saw an oscillating greenish/blue light and a reflective look as if the lights where reflecting off of something shiny with a hit of reddish underneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was about a mile up the road from us moving toward the mouth of the cannon hovering just above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer the object looked disk or roundish in shape and was moving very slowly into the cannon and then ascended up to just about the ridge sides of the cannon and continued very slowly as to be traversing the cannon and we stopped and watched it for about 12-20 minutes as it slowly continued up the cannon with its lights oscillating and disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wow we thought this was weird and very cool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

On 8/1/07 I reported seeing orange lights in The sky between the towns of Fostoria Mi. and Clifford Mi. That sighting was at Around 10:20 pm on the night of 7/31/07. With a Military jet fighter fly by in the same area around 10:50pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of 8/1/07 I witnessed the same type of orange lights again. This time the lights showed up at 10:15pm, but it was only 2 lights this time and they were farther apart and a little higher off the horizon. They were in around the same area of the sky as the night before. Again the first light appeared dim, then brightened and disappeared. Right after the first light went out the second one appeared above and to the left of the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started dim, brightened then disappeared. The sighting only lasted seconds but was bright and very noticeable in the night sky.  This time there was no military aircraft involved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the previous report from the night of 7/31/07. I stated that it was hard to tell if I was seeing 1 craft with multiple lights or 3 separate craft in tight formation. Well now after the sighting on the second day and only seeing 2 lights that were father apart, I am inclined to say that it was 3 separate craft on the first night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be keeping an eye out again this evening and plan on having the video recorder with me. If this happens for a 3rd consecutive night I will submit another report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The only way to describe it is to say that the sky itself began to move in different directions, like a wave action, and was becoming distorted in a small area.  There was quite a bit fast distortion with apparent motion of the stars for about 4-5 seconds.  I cannot really describe this distortion with accuracy because I have never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A huge, in &#34;width&#34;, (estimated width of a 727&#39;s length from my vantage point) thin, dark, crescent shaped object emerged from the distorted area of the sky headed in a south westerly direction.  It had several bulging circular dull yellowish shapes on the bottom of it but they did not appear to be lights or if they were lights they were not on.  Each of these circular shapes lined the entire bottom of this object side by side.  It displayed no illumination at all, but I could still see that it was a physical object.  There was no sound, and I would estimate its altitude to be at or below 1,000 feet above ground level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no true frame of reference for this altitude or size other than the fact that I am an experienced pilot and judge distances constantly with good accuracy.  It was obviously not low, rooftop level, and it was equally obvious that it was not at a high altitude or in orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What struck me as being very odd is that as it emerged from the distorted area it was traveling SIDEWAYS, not in the direction of what one would expect from a crescent shaped airfoil such as the B-2 Spirit.  It traveled so fast that it was out of sight within 2-3 seconds.  It did not appear to climb or descend, just shot away at tremendous speed after appearing from the disturbed area of sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no logical explanation for this.  If I was not star watching just prior to the disturbance occurring, I doubt I would have even seen it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I immediately ran into my house to tell my wife, she looked at my face and said, &#34;What’s wrong? You look like you have just been robbed!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

8/1/07 11:00|Beaver Creek/Alaska Highway (Canada)|YT|Other|10 minutes|Strange Solid Black line in the sky, horizon to horizon, broad daylight|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57975.html|466|ndxe200708| Strange Solid Black line in the sky, horizon to horizon, broad daylight<n> <n><n> <n><n> on august 1st 2007 at approximately 11 am in the morning, while driving on the alaska highway near lake creek campground my co worker and i noticed a thin black line going from horizon to horizon ending at pickhandle mountain.  we guessed that this black line in the sky was at about 30, 000 feet up, going north to south.  We estimate this height because right after that we noticed a jet coming into sight and following the exact path of this strange black line. The jet continued along the line then changed direction and went due north towards alaska.  The black line dissipayed about ten minutes after we originally noticed it.  My coworker and i have been working this highway for 20 years and have never seen such a thing before.  This black line was something strange that we have never before seen in broad daylight.  We are just inquring about this as we have never seen anything like it before.  EVER.  Something about this was very weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live in a small village so there is no city light reflection at night, and when the sky is clear, it is really clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occasionally I can see space junk flying across the sky in a wide range of colors. (Green, Orange, blue green mixed) but today it was much different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking straight out of my balcony to the sky, an object seemed to start to glow and turn into a perfect white light.( It was not moving)  I could now see the objects shape perfectly as the light seemed to get brighter. Once the object turned into the perfect light the object then began to move and disappeared into a cloud bank to my left.  It was amazing, the sky to the right of my balcony was clear, so saying it was space junk popping into view and out of view can be dismissed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting was clear and undisturbed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fantastic<n>

They were going at a very high speed faster then a sat goes by about as fast as a jet fighter at 200ft would look but out in space. I couldnt tell how far out they were because i never saw a moon to go by but they had to be quite big for me to see them as far away as i saw them.Thus wasnt birds or a metor shower or anything else that i have ever seen and left me a little shocked<n>
