Then, it slowed abruptly and stoped brieflyand reversed backwards and upwards at about a 45 degree angle. The light then slowly moved vertically downwards and then continued on its original trajectory before literally fading away....I am extremely freaked out I had never seen anything quite like this...so i logged online and found this site to report it...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It started out to be a cloudy night, but cleared up around 21:30.  The stars were very clear and bright.  We saw about four satellites right away.  We also saw a nice iridium flare which lasted about 5 seconds.  There was also alot of air traffic.  About 45 minutes later we saw a completly silent light; twice as big and twice as bright as any other star or planet.  It moved from horizon to horizon west to east in less than two minutes.  It moved alot faster than the rest of the visible air traffic.  There were no red blinking lights or strobe lights whatsoever on it.  You could clearly see all the other planes strobes and blinking red lights.  It also seemed alot lower, and closer to us than any other plane in the sky.  It was completly silent.  We could hear the other planes clearly.  I managed to get about 45 seconds of video of it; the video is kind of shaky because I did&#39;nt have a tripod; but there is a pretty still part that shows the backround stars for a speed and altitude comparison.  I also filmed some other planes to show how easy it is to see the strobes through a digital camcorder.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The UFO appeared to have nine lights, the center light being largest. The center light was lit the hole time, as I recall. The lights were all orange-red colored, almost glowing. The center light moved from place to place in the western sky. The light randomly stoped moving from place to place, then two lights on each side of the center light, that were slightly smaller appeared simultaneously. Right after the second lights appeared to the side of the main light, two more appeared on the sides of the secondary lights, slightly smaller than the second lights. This occurred twice more making nine lights side by side. It appeared like this;  (*)( * )( *  )( *   )(  *  )(   * )(  * )( * )(*)  ;The middle light being larger than the rest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After all nine lights were shining the UFO would hold for, I&#39;d say 3 or 4 seconds. It would then close up reverse order from how it opened, or lit up. It repeated this process several times, as if it were searching for something. After about 30 seconds it shot off into the sky and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was at about 5 to 8,000 feet and looked like a welding rod (reddish white) light with a very long contrail behind it.  This craft was very near or over Hobby airport.  Anyway took about 12-minutes to make a complete rectangle in front of me while finally departing to the south (while maintaining the same altitude).  What I find unusual is the following:  1.  Maintained it&#39;s brightness throughout it&#39;s movement in the rectangle (so was not a reflection in the setting sun or landing lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  Numerous Southwest aircraft seemed to completely disappear during this time and did not resume till 9:00 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  No engine noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.  Gave off contrails, when no other aircraft before or after did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.  Never made out body of aircraft or wings (even as it moved around the rectangle in the sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6.  Flew extremely slowly (12 minutes to make a roughly 3-mile diameter rectangle).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a pilot, have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was about an hour before sunset and I was traveling East towards town from the Melrose area of Douglas County.  I was watching an object that looked like a jet in the distance,,,it was highlighted by the sun which was behind me.  The Sun was far enough down that I was in shadow and the Object was seen to be in the sunlight,,,about 3-5 miles away and approx 5 thousand feet high.  Something Ive seen many times,,,a jet highlighted by the setting sun in the distance..<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it for about 30 seconds I noticed an object that was in its path ahead. It was shaped like a cigar,,,,I thought it might be a blimp of some sort.  As I watched the smaller bright fast moving lighted abject I could tell it was going to cross paths with this larger Object,,,which was huge compared to the traveling abject.... The cigar shaped object was moving very slow in the same direction of the first object....NORTH,,,  As I watched both objects the small bright object was clearly going to cross the path of the other.  Kinda curious I watched to see if they would cross each others path,,,thinking ,,,well Its just in line and looks like its going to hit it...  .Then just before it did ,,,,it slowed and entered into the cigar,,,just as soon as it did,,,another object shot out of this cigar thing and traveled very very fast out and along the same path the first object had traveled to enter the cigar. Only it was not bright and shiny and moving somewhat faster the! n the first one had traveled coming in......it was dark and small compared to the Cigar....When this happened I was shocked and just watched as the Second object shot across the skyline and was gone...then I noticed the cigar object was somewhat see through and I could clearly see about 4 or 5 dark shapes inside it,,,Like pea&#39;s in a pod would be.... At this point the road turned and I lost sight of the whole Eastern Skyline....I was not inclined to say anything to anyone?  Which is strange in itself?  So I didn&#39;t,,,but have thought about this much since it happened.... My best guess as to the size of the Cigar Object,,,would be about a foot ball field in length ,,,or two..and maybe 4 stories high...it seemed to be rounded on both ends...like a grain of rice... If not for the sun setting and lighting the Cigar Object I do not think I would of seen it as it was very opalescent ...almost cloud like..... Thats it....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

My friend I both saw the same thing. This sighting is our first and only. This happened only a few days after a young man (16y) drowned in mitchal pond/lake. I live in Lakehaven apartments and the lake is next door. This death was all over FOX news. I doubt a significants. I was showing him the candle light mural that was floating where the young man was found. There is a baseball park ajacent to the lake and a tree line dividing the two. As we walked I noticed a ball game in progress. I saw over the tree line on the horizon, an orange glow. I thought at first fireworks dieing out and blowing in the wind, but no. They kept moving, and there were six. Flying in formation, Three in front and three in rear. The front formation was a diagnal line of three. The rear was a triagle pointing to the front formation. It would have seemed a large single craft if they weren&#39;t oscelating freely. They moved slightly in an imperfect formation. This formation continued accross the sky, which was a clear dusk sky. The indivividual objects were a color that I can barely describe. Amber, blue, grey all put together. The light was not incandessant, nor hallogen. It was more irridessant, a glow. But a glow should not be able to be visable from the distance we saw them at. The distance is impossible to estimate because of the undetermined size of the craft. They appeared very high in the atmosphear, and were moving over the horizon very quickly, but soundless. There was no light bending or streaking, as a fast jet may cause if it flies fast enough and emmits a bright light it may streak to the observer. The only way to describe the apperance of the UFOs is they resembled a size magnified human egg. Round with an inner circumferance and an outer. I screamed &#34;What the **** is that?!&#34; repeated several times. There were several other people arround the lake, but when asked they calimed to not have seen anything. Only my friend and I saw it, that we know of. We did ask anyone and everyone we saw near the event only to our dismay, as we began to feel insane. As the Crafts continued across the dusk sky, we both observed them vanish one by one, front of the formation to the back. No sound, just dissapeared. I have no explaination as to how they dissapeared, other than they left the atmosphear or had some otherworldly technology. I&#39;m not saying these definately were visitors of another world, but what we saw was not military in my oppinion. I highly doubt humans have a craft as we observed. If this were millitia I would assume it to be top secret and would not be flown over a residential area. I know what I saw. It was not normal. We were frightened. I do believe us to not be alone in this universe, as it would not make sense if we weren&#39;t. But why would someone come here? Discovery? Warnings of impending self desctuction? War? Please contact me at Guitardude823@aol.com. I am very curious as to what the hell we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was early in the evening. We started walking through the park and decided to play around.  We got started getting rough and wrestling around.   He was holding me down when I happened to look up.  He was facing the opposite direction I was, when I saw an object in the air pretty low.  It was too low to be a plan or such. I knew it wasn&#39;t a satellite either.  After a couple seconds of looking and focusing it became clearer. It was a round saucer that looked silver at first until it started giving off a glow of white light.  I immediately tried to get my friends attention. I yelled his name, he proceeded in trying to hold me down, I yelled it again and got his attention. I told him to look where I was pointing. He had something in his eye, he took a second to clear it up while I was yelling look!  look!  He finally looked up. But couldn&#39;t see it at first for a moment. I was looking at it the whole time.  It was going a little slow at first as it was when I first seen it.  It was heading over our direction over us.  It kept the same level the whole time in the air.  My friend finally caught it and was watching to as it just started to go faster.  At that point it was only visible as it was going faster until it took a tremendous increase in speed and just warped into disappearing into the distance.  My friend saw it at the last moment, but however he did seen it for the 15 seconds he did.  I don&#39;t know if we were the only ones to see it in the area.  Another one of my friends was walking by the park fence moments after the sighting happened.  I had told her what we just seen. She said that she believed me, but I don&#39;t know.  I have told a very limited number of people about this. I don&#39;t care who believes me or who doesn&#39;t.  The fact is, I know what I seen.  I have photographic memory and remember ever detail. It was the most weirdest and incredible experiences in my life so far. ! It sure gave me a new perspective on things.  I never doubted o! ther existences, but I wasn&#39;t sure either till that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

On the way I pointed out to him, &#34;Hey, M**** what do you think that object is?&#34; he replied, &#34;I don’t know looks like a commit or something.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We discussed how slow it was travelling at first we believed it was staying in one position, however we noticed that it was actually moving incredibly slowly. We observed the huge fireball that must have been approximately two hundred metres away from us, it was travelling parallel to the ground. The object or commit had a flaming tail as well, it was so bright the flame it was literally one fire, or glowing. my friend and I concluded that it was a commit or something I left the object that was still moving incredibly slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my way in the car back home, I had second thoughts firstly, no commit or asteroid could move that slowly its impossible. Secondly no natural phonoma like this could have possibly be flying parallel to the ground, that’s just strange. I’m not saying this had little green aliens in it, but it definitely wasn’t natural.If anyone could come up with an expliantion because I am deaply confused about this event and due to this it has fourced me to believe in ET’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 2005 is approximate.

6/30/05 17:35|Santa Clara|CA|Disk|2 min|Black disk shaped object  motionless observing airport  free falls and wobbles back up and vanishes.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45175.html|16|ndxe200506| Black disk shaped object  motionless observing airport  free falls and wobbles back up and vanishes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thursday 6/30/05 at around 5:35 pm, I was walking toward my car in the parking lot at work when I saw what looked to me like a round black object standing motionless high in the sky south east above the San Jose airport. I was looking up at an angle 135-140 degrees, considering straight up to be 180 degrees. To give an estimate of the size of the object in view, it would compare to that of holding up a cherry seed between ones thumb and forefinger at arms length. Now I can not begin to calculate its true size not knowing how high and the miles away the object was from where I stood. A moderate breeze was blowing toward the east. I assumed it could be a large weather balloon. Then after what seemed like a minute had passed, this round black object suddenly rotated revealing a disk or saucer shape. Within seconds of this new transformation, I began to notice a bright white flash every couple of seconds or so but randomly and not consistant. Then it began to free fall downward but in a way resembling a leaf falling from off a tree limb.  Twice I saw the bottom part, round and circular, tilt toward my direction so that I could see a faint orange glow or gold aura , even looked like it was sparkling somewhat . The object descended straight downward about a hand length. Then it hovered about 3 seconds before shooting upward like that of watching a bumble bee in flight. By this time I pretty much ruled out the notion of it being a large balloon. I heard a roar of a jet plane taking off from the San Jose Airport but could not see the plane until it got to a certain height heading northwest in my general direction. The large jet aircraft came into view as it ascended upward. I could now compare this unidentified object to the jet plane. The object was indeed considerably farther up and toward the south east than I had previously thought. The large commercial jet plane as it went overhead just slightly to the east of my position was the length of my thumbnail at arms length. After the Jet plane was nearly out of sight toward the northwest, this black disk shaped object currently hovering high up in the sky south east of the airport took off so rapidy that it vanished in just two seconds. I continued looking and then the object or another disk object reappeared out of no where for three seconds and then it vanished in thin air and did not reappear. I don&#39;t know what I just witnessed for nearly 2 minutes, but it is certainly a mystery to me that I am anxious for it to be solved!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I followed it and it went to my home and just sat hovering over my house and it didn&#39;t make a sound it moved very strange it could move as slow and fast as it wanted,it turned by just pivoting around standing still.I felt like it was showing  watching   me that it knew I was watching it and it was watching me.It turned and I was trying to follow but it just bolted,it was gone,  Two days later it was over a plublic bus station hovering just watching,which is not that far from my home.I remember both of the days I seen the ufo were cloudy.  I never told anyone because they might think I was crazy.It had big lights all the way around it and almost got the feeling it knew more about me than I knew about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At times they seem extremely shiny as they rotated. Then they formed a V pattern and started to move north, at wich point they just disappeard. It was like turning of the light. I was with a friend, and I stopped several college student walking by to see if they could see what I was seeing. They all saw the same thing. When I was 10yrs old and living in Argentina, I saw the exact same thing. Even then everyone on the street stopped and looked at the sky. Please let me know if this is of any help!!!<n>

It&#39;s so crazy because we seen a light and the first thing y dad said was its a helicopter.  I also thought it was at the time until we kept going down the 10 interstate east bound.  Until we seen it get closer we noticed it made no noise my dad still thought it was a helicopter but i knew there was no way.  It got so close to the ground I actually thought it was gonna crash but as soon as it close to the floor it shined 3 lights on the desert floor I noticed it was a triangle shaped object.  My dad and I were shocked that we didn&#39;t want to wake my mom up because she was sleeping.  It was odd because it was silent and it moved in a way which reminded me of a glider... Ive many things on the internet regarding a tr-3b so I.  Know it is real also that craft had a little blinking light like our own government planes so I think it&#39;s not alien but it is scary to know we have this technology.  Also it is possible that we reversed engineered this craft..  It&#39;s funny because the gov still deny such crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in 2005.  PD))<n>

It was just about 4 am when i fixed my sight on, what i thought to be, a very bright star or planet. My binocs were not focused so i took a second to adjust, then looked back at the object. I just had my binoculars focused when i noticed the object started to move. My heart started beating real fast as i watched it pass directly over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a brilliant white point in the sky larger and brighter than any sattalite or planet I have ever watched in the sky. The object moved on a straight path from West/N.W. to East/S.E. It made no sound and, from my best quess was at an elevation   equal to or slightly higher than airliners at their maximun cruzing altitude. The object had no other lights blinking or otherwise that i could see, it was traveling at a very high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as it passed over me i ran to the back door of my house and started to pound on it, my body tingling from my adrenaline rush, i had to get a second opinion or maybe just have someone else see it too.  The door opened and i pointed to the sky and said &#34;so, tell me what you think of that, I was wathing it through my binocs , i could of swore it was stationary, they all of the sudden it was moving!! The other person said &#34;I dunno, Ive never seen anything like that before.&#34; I continued to watch it as it dissapeard into the sky it didnt go over the mountains and disappear, it sort of faded in the distance then abruptly disappeard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then jumped on-line and tried to find a website that could tell me about sattalites and their course they fly. I found a few that sould have been in the area at the time but none with the heading i observed, but i am an amature when it comes to  interpereting the information on the websites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What did I see?<n>

As we watched it would dissapear then reapear somewhere else in the sky usualy going in another direction. We kept watching it standing in the parking lot for probably 5-10 minutes then it dissapeared and we couldn&#39;t find it again. After about 3 more minutes or so some fire trucks and police cars pulled up and said that all of the alarms in the church were going off. But we were standing right outside and never heard a single alarm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

She was very agitated and excited and told me she had seen a flying satellite dish.  I was quite surprised an asked her what she meant.  A satellite dish! she insisted.  Satellite dishes don’t fly, I responded. Yes they do, she said.  She couldn’t sleep late at night and looked out her bedroom window. It was a golden disk the size of the moon and it flew over the tops of the trees.  The trees there are very old and tall eucalyptus, about 70 feet.   And she added a unique detail- she said it dripped golden liquid off the edges. I asked her if she knew what UFO’s are. She answered “I don’t believe in those things!” She didn’t watch much television, only watched Animal Planet.  Where would an 88 year old lady get such an esoteric detail as the golden drops?  Also her bedroom window faces north, the moon can’t be seen to the north.  She was a very intelligent and spiritual lady, and I certainly believed her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

So it was some time between that.I was feeling fine, but all of a sudden I felt weird, like an electric charge like when you rub a balloon on ur hair you can feel the static, like that but all over my body and I was lying back and wouldn&#39;t move and I was getting this massive headache but it wasn&#39;t exactly a headache, I just heard this kind of quiet sound like somethings hovering above my house then it got louder, like I didn&#39;t hear it I felt it in my head, It wasn&#39;t literally loud but it was loud to me. And I could just hear it as if I was in a little room with a radio turned on loud.It just sounded like something was hover around.It was so weird, I wanted to look out the window but I just couldn&#39;t get up, I don&#39;t know if it was my mind that just was scared to find out what it was or if it was something else. All I could remember is that Loud sound but at the same time it was silent..I don&#39;t know how to explain it and there was a white light that&#39;d go pass my window, I had blinds so I couldn&#39;t see out it.This was going on for about 30-45 mins.I was thiking it was just a car but that sound couldn&#39;t possibly come from a car, I&#39;ve never heard it before and what about the light, it just sounded like it was hovering around really fast then just staying in one spot. Anyways I don&#39;t really remember much or how but I ended up falling asleep.. Then likean hour later it happened again, That sound ringing in my head just woke me up this time I woke up scared, not cause the sound being loud in my head I don&#39;t know what it was, but I woke up and just sat there listening to that sound hover away.It was weeks later maybe a month I was hearing it again. Weird my dad had just got up to pee(it was night time),I told my dad about my weird headache and how it sounded like something was outside my window! , I&#39;m su re a UFO that I&#39;ve never heard before such a sound like that staying in one spot, I was telling him maybe I need to see a doctor cause that headache was just, not normal. Then we got into some other conversation completely off subject then all of a sudden I started hearing that sound again. I interrupted my dad and told him to shh and listen, but he kept talkin and went to whispering then shut up by that time it went away. Haven&#39;t heard it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

There I saw comin|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44708.html|32|ndxe200506| I work late hours and had just returned home. It had been a hot day, so I went out on my balcony to water the plants. There I saw coming from my left side - it&#39;s southeast - an orange light shining so bright, that it looked starshaped - like the kind of star you put on the top of a christmas-tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was about 7 to 10 meters(30 feet)above me, who lives at the top floor of a five-floor building. That would make the altitude of the light about 25 meter (75-80 feet).<n> <n><n> <n><n> That early in the morning my neighbourhood is totally quiet, so I am absolutely sure that the object was soundless. It flew slowly right above the middle of the street making the darkened roofs glow in the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a flare. There was no wind, and a flare would have a downwards glide. The thing flew silently keeping its altitude on a north-western course across the port of Copenhagen, and after a kilometer or so it turned westwards. I was so busy watching it, that I hadn,t noticed the other one, until it was right above my head. The second one was looking the same and took the exact course of the first one. My estimate is, that there was about 1000 to 1500 meters between them. The velocity was about 8 mph. It too turned westwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve reported it to the danish ufo reporting center, but so far no other observations have been made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am quite stunned about this and was sure, when I watched them, that they were not man-made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing make me wonder though. President George W. Bush is visiting Denmark july 5. to thank the danes for participating in the Iraqi war. So every spot of Copenhagen is virtually vacuum-cleaned, and there is a swarm of american security-agents around. Maybe these &#39;ufo&#39;es are new military reconnaissance aircrafts. If they are, the lack of sound is astonishing. But if they don&#39;t want to be seen, it&#39;s odd, that they shine so bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Me and a friend were walking back to my house from another friend&#39;s house late at night somewhere around midnight (completely sober) and were walking through our old elementary school in Healdsburg, CA, walking thought the &#34;black top&#34; which is a large open space where we had break and lunch at the school when we were younger attending that school.  At the time of night and part of town the sounds of cars and other things are pretty much dead silent, as we were walking my friend tapped me on the shoulder, I looked at him and I saw the shock in his eyes as he pointed up to the sky.  I looked up directly above us maybe 500-1000 feet in elevation...! yes that low..was a triangle formation of red dim lights, non flashing.  One red light at each point of the triangle craft plus a couple in between each point.  Around 7-10 lights if my memory serves me right.  But we saw in between the lights pure darkness to confirm it was a solid craft to make up the triangle. It was HUGE.  We guessed at least a football field.  It was DEAD silent and flew at a speed most modern aircraft would &#34;stall&#34;....now, at me and my friends age we were both big military buffs including on USAF aircraft, as I later became in my adult life and army infantryman and he a marine.  At the time we were familiar with B-2 bombers and F117s.  This thing was nothing even close to human capability. The very SECOND we seen it we didn&#39;t even question if it was human or not.  We just KNEW it was from out of this world.  But what was so strange was that it flew so low and slow over a populated area...like it was scanning or something, who knows.  Not even a experi! mental military craft would do that over such an area.  No question in our minds we saw something out of this world and none of our friends believed us after the fact.  It never bothered us but whenever me and that friend reunite time to time it&#39;s the hot topic between me and him haha.  Something we will never forget!!  I hope in my lifetime there will be a explanation for these things (alien life)....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I remember saying to myself &#34;Wow, thats a bright star&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we both noticed how much bigger and brighter was becoming and within seconds it was right over our head and hovering above a corn field we were driving by.  It was a black triangle. It was rather small and moved so quickly.  I remember it head green to red lights glowing around it...and as we turned onto the street it was lowering itself onto, we pulled up close enough to listen to it...but there was no noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right when I began to open my door to get a closer look it flew straight up and away as fast as it came.

There were very few celestial objects visible in the sky, save for Venus and a few stars. I spotted what seemed like a bright planet in the western sky moving swiftly southwestly. At first I thought it was a planet that only seemed to move in relation to swiftly moving clouds. But it was moving too fast in comparison to stationary trees. It was not an airplane. The object disappeared behind a small low drifting cloud about the size of a large house. By all experience and reason the object should have re-appeared in two seconds after passing behind the cloud. It did not...to my great puzzelment.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very close to my house, maybe about 2 blocks away. It was moving, not like a plan. It was going straight then made a slight turn and started going straight to the North East. It was still visable from my back yard at a higher ground, I stepped on a latter to see if i still seen it and then it finialy disappeared. .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I went outside, she told me she had seen a space ship.  Asked to describe it she said it was shaped like the &#34;planet with the rings&#34;.  She described the circular part as gray or black in color, but she wasn&#39;t sure because of the white light &#34;spinning&#34; around it (in the ring).  She described the object as large and slow moving.  She says it made a humming noise.  When I asked her if it was close or far away like an airplane, she said it was close and about the size of our living room ceiling.  When I asked her why she didn&#39;t run in and tell us, she said she was just staring at it and watched it until it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She has never made up any outlandish stories before, so I felt like I needed to write down the details and found this website when searching Google.

It fell out of sight into the horizon a couple times, and I saw the light turn yellow as it streaked away faster than any aircraft could move. This object would appear one one side of the horizon to another very fast, the most amazing thing was the lights, this object was TRYING to put on a light show for us, towards the beggining I did see two airplanes flying near it, not sure if they were just flying by or trying to observe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was definately not fireworks helicopter, or anything explainable by my current knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife and daughter returned to the house after getting something to eat to bring back home. My wife said to me immediately when they walked in the house that her and our daughter witnessed something but they dont know what it was. She said if you dont believe me our daughter(10yr old) saw this too, my daughter spoke up promptly saying its true and proceeded to describe a flash of light that crossed the road they were traveling on in the car. My wife was following up on her description as both of them were exicted to tell me. As it was approx. 9:50 PM returning home on a road that has a small wooded section within our populated city a brite flash  oval like object scoured across the front (approx. 6-8 feet) of the vehicle from left to right. The light even reflected off the front of the minivan and traveled at eye level horizontal from one section of woods to the other side. As it happened very sudden my wife described a stretched white bright flash oval object about the size of our computer screen which, is a 17&#34; screen. It was difficult for her to describe as she never seen anything like this. Our daughter described the same details but she caught a better glimpse. She described a odd shape oval that was very bright itself with a glow of less light and a cast of light from the glow. I had her sketch a drawing to show me what she saw. I will definitely keep the drawing for our records and send a copy to the reporting center. After they told me I drove out and traveled the same route but, did not notice anything unusal. I may go back during daylight and take look around.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The airport landing lights were off when they should be switched on by the pilot when landing. There was no noise and after a few seconds i realised after alighting from my car that the lights were stationary in the sky. I could not see any shape at all. I continued on after about a minute and while entereing the city saw an orange glow at about 45 degrees elevation traverse from s/w to n.e towards the airport about 10 km away. it moved quite slowly but in a straight line not deviating and had no navigation lights or sound at all. It had a haze around it however and was not man made.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was standing on my back doorstep filming the storm on my digital camera (it has a movie mode).  The storm passed over and I finished filming, had been filming for 24 minutes.  I was looking at the clouds moving accross the sky to see if I could spot any more lightening I could film and as a cloud to the south west moved accross the sky behind it was a bright almost silver glowing circular object.  I&#39;d say it was about as big as a tennis ball and it caught my eye as it was so bright against the stormy sky.  Before I could turn the camera back on a cloud came accrooss and covered it and I never saw it again as there was no break in the clouds.  I suppose it could have been an aircraft but was difficult to tell if there was any aircraft noise because of the storm passing northwards.  My immediate thought when I saw it was that it could have been Sirius (you know from other reports i&#39;ve sent in that i often look out for Sirius) but I believe Sirius to be further west and lower in the sky than this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I saw a dark craft travelling through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that made me think that it was odd was that the craft had no lights on and was flying very low to the ground.  Also it was rather egg shaped with no wings, and a rocket like booster on the bottom of it.

Shortly after I called my brother in to see it 3 more lights had appeared which formed a square with the first light. The top right light became extremely bright and a smaller light of the same brightness then appeared directly to the right of that light. The lights did not move and appeared to hover for aprox. 5 minutes. They did not blink or flash, but the light in the right of the square and the small one beside it gave off an extremely bright white light. The lights were all circular. Then after about 10 minutes since the first light appeared they all vanished at the exact same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a fireball object going just over a mountian and not even 10 seconds later, i saw 3 lights in a triangle formation go over where i was camping. The object was solid because it blocked the stars overhead. It was extremely close to the ground because i could feel something like a light breeze only when the object was overhead and when the object passed, the breeze was gone. There were no sounds or anything other then a slight &#34;woosh&#34; sound as it went over head. I got out my camera to see if i could get a picture and the batteries were completely dead, although they had been replaced earlier that day. Once the object went over the valley below where i was camping, the camera suddenly came back on and the batteries were full. My friend who was camping with me saw the object too and decided that we should go home as soon as the sun came up and i said that it sounded like a good plan. When the sun came up, i went to my car and saw that there were weird markings on the dust on the back window. The looked like someone had taken only 3 fingers and made marks on the back window.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/27/05 21:25|Kill Devil Hills|NC|Sphere|60-90 seconds|Dark Orb Moves Erratically over the Beach -- Outer Banks, NC|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44625.html|67|ndxe200506| Dark Orb Moves Erratically over the Beach -- Outer Banks, NC<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside (alone) on my screened-in front porch to sneak a cigarette (I’ve been trying to drop the habit).  I was facing south looking towards the side of the K-Mart store a few houses down at the end of my street wishing to myself that there were not so many lights on that street when, off in the distance, I (barely) noticed this orb-like object.  My first idea was that it was a planet, though that did not make rational sense because it appeared much closer than a planet would to the naked eye.  Suddenly, this object moved sideways to the right, then the left, then upwards a bit and again erratically sideways, sometimes hovering for a second or two but then always resuming its path in moving up.  By this point, my heart began racing because I realized that what I was seeing did not make any sense.  I stood there and watched the object as it continued this erratic pattern across the sky until my view was obscured by the roof over my porch.  I ran outside to the other side of the house so that I was facing east and again found the object continuing its path.  Some people on the beach (I live 2 blocks from the beach) set off some fireworks (the low-grade kind that can be bought at any store around here).  The fireworks shot into the sky a distance roughly equal to 4 or 5 two-story houses.  The orb, by this point, had moved north/northeast past the fireworks and--even with the extra light in the sky, the object did not appear to reflect the light.  For a moment after the fireworks, the object seemed to move a little fast and within seconds of that it disappeared into the clouds.  I stood there in awe for a few seconds waiting for any possible reappearance, but nothing.  Immediately afterwards, I called my family to share what I had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still unable to make rational sense of this.  The object made no sound and moved steadily as if on a path, but erratically.  Additionally, the object did not seem to give off any colors as an airplane or helicopter would.  The object was perfectly round, which is why I describe it as an orb.  Because it was night, it was hard to tell if the object itself was colored, the only way I can describe it is that it seemed to blend in with the night sky.  The only reason I noticed the shape is because it had a faint, but distinct outline which seemed to give off a soft glow.  By glow, I do not mean that the object itself was glowing.  I mean the only glow was in the outline.  Beyond that, the only other description I can offer is that the object appeared to have been a dark or matte metallic.<n>

We were in our subdivision and as I turned the corner onto one of our streets I saw out of my driverside window a solid triangular shaped object about 24-48 feet about the treetops over several houses. It was low enough that I could see without any doubt what it was. It was hovering but not stationary. It was illuminated with a bright silvery white light and a bright blue aura. The object was triangular but instead of the corners being pointed they were rounded. I yelled at the kids and my daughter looked and saw it and screamed. THe object then sped up and flew west over the treetops and up into the sky. It made no sound and there was no movement from the tops of the trees. The light was so bright that it made it possible to see the object clearly. There were no markings or windows. It appeared solid almost like aluminum but even smoother. As we drove down the street trying to keep up with it it continued to fly higher and west. There is no doubt whatsoever as to what we saw. I have never in my life see something like this. I am a nurse and I never imagined something like this existed. It was low enough that we saw exactly what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(the whole time the craft was in the northern sky) every time it changed postions i looked farther than it went because it moved so fast i thought there was no way it could move that fast and stop so fast. (it moved so fast my eyes barly registerd that it moved) but anyways at it had moved in the northern part of the triangle it slowly seemed to be moving up maby farther from the atmospere. it;s very hard to explain. but the lights begain fading but not because of distance more of the width of the circles of light. the width begain getting slimmer and slimmer. and the lights begain changed shades to darker. and the craft all of a sudden shut of the lights. but i could still see it was there.( like black on black) the only way to describe it was that some people have good enuff eye sight to see the part of the moon that isn;t being shone with light from the sun. baslicly like that. as i stated into the darkness of the craft in a split second it seemed to dissapere and i saw a few stars the apperd (normal stars) kinda like something was blocking it. aka the craft. when my mind finnaly register that i had seen somewthing i coudn&#39;t explain i kept thinking of aircrafts that might be simmiler to what i have seen. the only thing i could think of was the airplanes developed by canada that looked simmiler to a sauser. but this WASN;T round at all. defanlty a triange the lights that i saw iluminated parts of the ship. it was gray. i didn;t hear any sound cuz them dumb hillbillys were too loud. haha oh also i am sending a crrapy drawn picture that might help explain it if possable please call me or get back to me i would like to talk and further explain. ASK FOR ((name deleted)) OR U WILL NOT GET TO TALK TO ME thank you and i hope u consider me not crazy hahah.<n>

Normally, I am very skeptical of such things, but I am postive it was not a airplane, helicopter of any sort. It hovered for about 5 minuetes then seemed to move behind some clouds for some time. It made no sound but was greyish in appearance with some thickness to its shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw another approach from the south &amp; was very bright then just disappeared. These are almst in line with bright star in west at about 3:00 o&#39;clock. See several other less bright objects near them. These objects look like satellites in the sky. No shape to them &amp; look like stars. These objects hover, move up and down, zig zag etc. They stay in place then make rapid movements like I described. I thought my eyes were playing tricks with me, but my wife witnessed them also. I like to watch for satellites at night, and i thought the one at 1:00 o&#39;clock was a satellite, but the movemnt on this was crazy! The one that disappeared was spooky. I am sober and live 40 miles west of Chicago. If possible have someone else look and confirm.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be motionless not ascending or descending.  It looked to be about 1 mile away and at an altitude of 5-10,000 feet.  The sky was clear and visibility greater then 7 miles.  My wife and my 6 year old daughter also witnessed the object.  We were watching this for about 10 minutes and then it slowly began to rise higher on the horizon and move to the right behind a tree that is in our back yard.  I could see the object through he tree branches and leaves.  I immediately got out of my pool while my daughter handed me my binoculars and headed to the front of the house.  It didn&#39;t take more then 30 seconds to get to the front of the house.  To my surprise I looked up to the East well clear of the tree and couldn&#39;t find the object.  I yelled over to my wife who was still in the pool and asked her if she could see the object.  She said she could not.  I looked all over the sky but could not see the object.  Since it was moving at such a slow speed I should of been able to see it once I move to the front of the house and away from the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

6/26/05 11:00|South Holland|IL|Changing|6 minutes|Dark rectangular object in the sky which later appeared as a dark teardrop|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44582.html|76|ndxe200506| Dark rectangular object in the sky which later appeared as a dark teardrop<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 11:00 AM CDT on Sunday, 6/26/2005 (I had just looked at my car&#39;s clock), I was driving by myself in my car, going west on 166th Street in South Holland, IL, approaching the intersection of 166th Street and Indiana Avenue, where I was going to turn left (north) onto Indiana Avenue.  It was a perfectly clear morning, although a little hazy.  While still driving on 166th Street heading east, and approaching the intersection with Indiana Avenue, I saw in the eastern sky, right above the treeline (actually between two bunches of trees in the distance), a dark grey or black rectangular object hanging in the sky, which seemed to be tapered on its lower end.  It was about the size of a dime, if held at arms-length.  Its shape was like a rectangle with its longer measure pointing up and down, but its lower end was more tapered than its top end, as if maybe the lower end was pointed away from me and the top end was pointed towards me, so that the top end appeared bigger and the lower end smaller.  I don&#39;t know how far away it was, or how big it was, but I&#39;d estimate, just by the way it looked through the haze, and the fact that it was low on the horizon, that it was only a few miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It most definitely was not a plane.  I suppose it could have been the rectangular underside of a dark green Huey-type army helicopter, but it sure didn&#39;t look like that, and I can&#39;t think of any reason why a military helicopter would be in that area (there aren&#39;t any military bases nearby), and hovering with its nose pointed up at such an angle, so that I could see its entire undercarriage from several miles away.  I think that such an extreme manuever would have put any helicopter at risk of crashing.  Also, Huey-type military helicopters make a very loud &#34;whump-whump-whump&#34; sound with their rotor blades that can be heard (and sometimes even felt) from miles away, but I didn&#39;t hear any sound.  My first thought was that it might be some kind of strange rectangular advertising balloon, or a cluster of balloons in a rectangular formation, even though I&#39;d never seen a rectangular configuration of balloons before.  And, it just didn&#39;t didn&#39;t look like any balloons I&#39;d ever seen.  It looked like a solid object.  I actually said aloud to myself, &#34;What the hell is that?&#34;  I&#39;d never seen anything like that before.  It was very low on the horizon, and I was able to catch only a few glimpses of it between the many trees in that area, as I drove.  When I first saw it on 166th Street, it seemed to be stationary, but after I got onto Indiana Avenue going north, I realized that it must have moved, because I couldn&#39;t find it again in the location where I first saw it.  About 3 minutes later (11:03 AM), I got another glimpse of it as I drove east on 154th Street, near the intersection of 154th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue (I drive fast).  At that time, it had definitely moved quite a distance to the northwest, because now it was almost due north of me, behind St. Jude Church, but still several miles away, and low on the horizon.  I then drove further east on 154th Street, trying to find it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3 minutes later (11:06 AM), I saw it one last time as I drove east on 154th Street (also called Pulaski Road) in Calumet City, near the intersection of 154th Street and Michigan City Road.  It was now directly north of me, way off in the distance behind Dirksen Junior High School, and it now looked like an elongated dark grey or black teardrop, with the larger bulbous end facing down.  It was also obviously much farther away, because it was more obscured by haze at that point, and smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing it in the distance behind Dirksen Junior High School, I turned left onto Calhoun street, going north, attempting to get past all the trees in that area and find it again.  But when I got to a relatively clear area near Calhoun street and Sibley Blvd. a few seconds later, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was definitely the strangest thing I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky.  I&#39;m still trying to find a logical explanation for what it was.  I thought maybe there was an air show downtown, and that this object might have been some weird aircraft that was part of the show.  But as far as I know, there was no air show going in downtown Chicago on 6/26/2005.  Then I thought, maybe it was some type of large advertising display being pulled by a small plane.  But it was just too big and bulky-looking to be that.  Usually, such aerial advertising displays are of the long, thin banner variety.  Any advertising display which was so big and bulky would have interfered with the aerodynamics of the plane pulling it, and caused the plane to crash.  Then I thought, maybe it was just a strange rectangular balloon.  But it was just going too damned fast to be any type of balloon.  I&#39;ve seen Goodyear-type balloons in this area before, so I know what they look like, and how slow they travel.  If it was a balloon, it could not have covered such a distance and disppeared from view so quickly.  And, as I mentioned, it definitely was not a plane, and I don&#39;t believe that it was a helicopter, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to know what the hell this thing was.  It&#39;s really bugging me now.  I actually called the non-emergency numbers for both the South Holland and Calumet City police, and asked them if anyone had reported anything strange in the sky at around 11:00 AM, but they both said that nothing had been reported.  That doesn&#39;t really surprise me, due to the short length of time it was visible.  But I would like to know if anyone else saw anything strange in the sky that morning, or whether it was just a big, dark colored helicopter or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I alerted my neighbor and we both took pictures.  We noticed that it was glowing, but could also make out slight blue and red colors.  Then it started going back up, very slowly.  The at one point, another smaller dot moved away from it like it was projected to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 15 or so seconds, it disappeared.

Upon development, the pictures show now only the dot, but other streaks of light, maybe something moving fast or something being projected (?).   And most striking, a handful of darker dots all around the pictures and the object.  The look like dark spots, but a couple of the pictures show a red spot in the middle of the dot.  I have no idea what those were, since they were not visible by my naked eye, but show up on every single photo.<n>

They flew as high as a plane and had no real path. We witnessed at least 20+ of these bright flashes of light over an hour time period.  About every 2-3 minutes a bright light(similar to distant lighting)ld light up the sky, but clear skies on this eve, with every star visable.About 20 minutes into this siting a large aircraft flew over very low using a very large bright beam that lite the sky.  About 10 min. later another aircraft flew over using bright lights without the bright beam. No regular commercial airplanes were seen during this time frame which was very unusual<n>

When I was approaching Fresno, CA I noticed an object with about 6 light about 200 feet up in the air.  The object was moving vigorously in a wave like manner.  The object was hovered over farm crops.  I instantly noticed how peculiar the object was as I moved closer.  I drove side by side with the flying object for about 15-30 seconds and observed it moving in the motion of a sting ray.  The object was very large and had bright white and blue lights on it.  As I traveled north I noticed it did the same, but weaved backwards and proceeded forward.  I continued to watch the object through my rearview mirror and I noticed that it was moving as if it were sowing something.  I immediately thought of crop circles.  The object was making a wave-like motion and traveling back and forth, it was a huge dark triangle with lights on it and not too far off the ground but high enough to be flying (like I said about 150-200 ft).  Being approximately 50 ft away from the object I could not hear the object making any noise, such as aircrafts do.  But it was moving at about 20-25 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While stargazing, a friend of mine (female police officer from NJ) noticed &#34;three satellites moving together in formation&#34;.  I chuckled because I had been pointing out satellites and  &#34;shooting stars&#34; for most of the night because out of the eight of us camping together, half had never seen one (due to the light-pollution in Northern NJ).  That&#39;s when I turned around and was amazed to see three &#34;stars&#34; moving in a tight, smooth formation silently gliding across the dark sky.  Their motion was fluid and constant (like a LEO satellite) up until the end of our horizon when one of the &#34;lights&#34; moved out of formation.  It was not a solid object because I clearly saw stars pass between the &#34;lights&#34;.  My friends were amazed and I was left stumped for answers.  It moved from a southwesterly direction towards the northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

There were non-flashing red lights on the rear of the craft and on the left and right sides of the craft.  The bottom of the craft had at least four, red, flashing lights that strobed seemingly randomly and very fast.  They might have been flashing in a circular sequence.  The craft moved much faster than a commercial plane and there was no sound that I could hear.  I was laying down next to a river, however.  It was too high to really discern its shape--I could see no fuselage or wings.  Due to the placement of the lights, the craft looked diamond-shaped.  There was a left-right, front-back symmetry in the placement of the red lights.  We were close, of course, to Dugway Proving Grounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object came into view while I was staring out the window lying in bed.  It was white with red and white flashing lights.  The lights were strobing fast.  The object seemed to be moving fast, erradically, zigzagging, making turns in sharp corners.  Maybe tumbling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was heading first West, then N. west , then No.  I went to the window and saw it pass out of my view.  I went from window to window and then ran outside.  It was gone.  It had made no sound -- I had the window open.  It had the whole open sky before it  so it should have been there when I went outside.  I am actually not sure what the shape was.  It appeared small and white and high but the lights were brilliant.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was traveling west to east. Its movement was quick. It stopped for a split second over the pond behind my friends house. Then made one more quick move and stopped again for a split second as it went past the east end of the pond. Then in a blink it was out of sight. It was hard to judge the altitude of the light because of the darkness and its quick movement. I would estimate it was no more than one hundred feet off the ground. My best description of the light would be a bright flourescent light contained inside a white plastic shell. My best estimate of size would be around 1 foot in length. If it was on some sort of craft I couldnt tell, it must of blended in to the night sky. There was absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I observed the aircraft, I notice directly behind it at approximately 15k feet was a slow moving shining sphere. I immediately ran inside and retrieved my binoculars and digital camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first priority was to photograph the object but I had a very difficult time locating it in the viewer because of the distance. Using the top of cameras housing as a gun site I aimed and took three photos. Upon review using the LCD viewer I could not determine if I had succeeded in photographing the object. I traded the camera for my binoculars to get a better look. At first the object look like a scientific weather balloon with what appeared to be rigging hanging down from bottom to where a payload would be attached. It was at this point I justified my conclusion when I remembered strange news report earlier in the week of reports of weather balloons over the WTC site in Manhattan. As I continued observation of object with my binoculars, I could see that the rigging and payload at the bottom of object was swinging back and forth at a very violent rate. This seemed odd to me because the sphere did not oscillate nor did the rigging whip, while this was happening. Then just as my site of the object was to be blocked from trees, the bottom of the object turned bright orange that engulf three quarters of the sphere. At this point my view was blocked. I tried to circling around trees and climbing up on my deck to get a better view. After a few minutes and to my disappointment the object seemed to have disappeared and I could not relocate it. I did manage to get two blurry pictures of what looks like a white pinhead in the blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to either to be circular with a darker center, or four lights around a darker center. It was not an airplane or satellit. It should be remembered that East to West satellites can NOT be seen from the continental United States, or any lattitude substantially far from the equator (since they only travel along the equator).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sunday June 26 into Monday: Four objects spotted. Three travelled South to North; one travelled more slowly than most in a Northwest to Southeast direction. As a side note unrelated to this, a strange rushing sound was heard in the trees. There was no wind or rain. I have no explanation for the noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then noticed a third light out in front of the other 2 lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my eyes adjusted, I realized I was seeing a triangle-shaped object. This was not a equal-sided triangle, but long pointed one. The sides of the triangle were about 3 times as long as the base of the triangle. I noticed the object appeared blurred, like it was oscillating or vibrating at a very fast frequency. The flight characteristics appeared jerky or out of focus all along the perimeter. When the object passed between me and some of the stars, the star light was blocked out. This was something I had never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a disabled Navy Veteran and I was stationed on the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Coral Sea for almost 6 years and I have seen a lot of different types of aircraft. I live 5 miles south of a Marine helicopter and Harrier training base. There are 2 Proving grounds within 25 miles of my house; Yuma Proving Grounds and the Barry Goldwater Test Range. So, I have seen many types or aircraft, both fixed-wing and rotary types. I have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will not take a guess on the altitude, speed, or distance but I had the impression this object was at a very high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute of observing this object going south, it just faded from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, we thought it was just a plane..so we walked forward, hoping to get a closer look. As we walked towards the object, it seemed to hover closer towards us. My friend asked us to stop and see if it was moving. We stopped and observed that it was ever so slightly moving to the right of us. It was just hovering there, not dipping up or down. Keep in mind, this is on the beach with thirty mile an hour winds whipping. We decided to run towards it to get a closer look and as we did...it seemed to come closer to us for about 15 seconds. We all observed 8 or so large lights around the bottom of the object, which was round with what seemed like a &#34;cockpit&#34; on the top. The tipical UFO. As we continued running towards it, it seemed like the object saw us...and hovered away to the right...dipping lower and lower until it seemed like it had landed, and where it dissapeared..there was a bright light in the sky. It never made a sound<n>

I stood in one place until my girl friend came outside (she walked in just for a moment?  At first their was a circular black thing in the sky.  Then another came out of it and another.  The three black circles moved into one and then in two, back to one and it transformed back into three seperate black circles.  It then took a vertical flight into the sky and it seemed to disappear and reappear.  My kids where kind of freaked out and so was my girl friend.  I have never saw that kind of movement before.

Ten others followed with bright lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> June 25, 2005 -- At around 10:50 pm, we were driving down Division St. and at the intersection with 164th, the driver looked up in the sky and saw a light. She thought that it was a star, but it was too big and bright to be one and the other two people in the car looked as well, and the object seemed to move on its side. When it turned to the side, we saw a disk shape, which had a haze of light around it. The object was wider than the moon but length seemed a lot smaller. The passenger even put on her glasses in disbelief, but she still saw the object. After we all started screaming, we went down until 174th, and right when we took a right, two more objects moved near from the right. One of the incoming objects was bigger than the other, but they were moving towards the big one that was first sighted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quickly, we went to our house and looked out the window. In the same direction we saw two or three of the same object moving back and forth and also stopping for a few seconds. The objects looked like bright lights (bigger than stars, and brighter) and they were not flashing. They all seemed to be coming from the same direction and going in the same direction (east to west). We figured they could not be planes because they were not flashing, and they were moving so quickly, yet stopping every now and then.  Also, two of them came very close in contact, almost touching each other. After about nine of those objects moved towards the right, we could not see them because of the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on, after they were gone, we looked towards the sky, and we saw two planes pass by in a 45 min span. We could differentiate between the object and the plane. The plane had a constant shape, was slanted and had the flashing tail lights. We also called the non-emergency line to check for helicopters in the area, and we were told that there was nothing going on. They also gave us the number for the UFO center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone saw something, please speak up. We didn’t believe in UFOs until tonight. Can someone explain whether so many objects, whether they are planes, helicopters, blimps or anything else can do such motions in the sky without colliding. How can they stop and go (shift left to right)?<n>

My boyfriend, his two children, and I were outside of our apartments talking and having fun.  My boyfriends son layed down on a picnic table and looked up in the sky and said &#34;Daddy what is that?&#34;  Greg then calls to me to come outside, because I had gone in to grab a drink.  I come back out and look up and see what looks like 3 black circles directly over our apartment.  It was hovering pretty close and then it started to move up and off to the southeast of us.  As it was moving it changed from one circle into what looked like 2 circles and then into one.  We watched it until it disappeared into the sky.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before, nor has my boyfriend or his children.  It did not have any lights on it nor did it make any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One moved slowly away to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday I was outside looking at the clouds and beautiful sky and had seen a Bald eagle flying up with some light clouds moving to the east.  I went back inside for a 30 minutes and then went back out to see a clear sky. All the clouds had blown over to the Cascade mountains. In a split second I looked adjacent to a Hemlock tree top. Very high in the sky was an object that appeared spherical, due to the shading of the object. It was the size of a small womens ball type earing. It appeared stationary. Immediately I called for my friend who came out of the house and I showed it to her. She said, what could that be? I said, I don&#39;t know but it stayed there for a while so I wanted someone else to see it. She has 20/20 vision and immediately clearly noticed another one more toward the east of the larger one first sighted. I then saw another one further north and approximately 10 to 15 degrees away from the other but it was smaller and more toward the Cascade mountains. We observed a total of three, only one, the first was larger. The larger one started moving in a relative southern direction or to our right. I called her son out and he observed the one larger one as well. We stood and observed and then her and the son went in. I looked away for a moment and the large spherical object disappeared and then the others. No images were taken. To provide a reference I would say they were at least a foot appart from the visual perspective but not aligned in a straight line with each other .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Earlier that day they went to collect herbs (thyme) from the hills surrounding the city (Cehu Silvaniei). While they were walking, 2 really scared gypsies approached them and they told them to come fast because there is a &#34;fish&#34; shaped metal object near their wagon. By the time they got there, a cone shaped object about 5 feet tall was moving straight up with a relatively slow but constant speed. The gypsies said that it started moving up when 2 of them got about 10-20 meters from it. When my parents saw it, it was already in the sky, about 50 meters up. It was rotating around its axis and it was shining in the sun each time it competed a rotation.  They looked at it till it was around 800-1000 meters up, then they left.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared large (size of a quarter) depending upon how far away it was  (although no other craft seen, at other times aircraft in the vicinity would appear much smaller)  craft was lit all around the outside edges with with about 5 smaller lights at the top and about 4-5 very large lights around the bottom, and dim, small lights around the sides.

6/25/05 02:25|Greenville|SC|Unknown|15 mins.|Third kind of encounter?  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44635.html|98|ndxe200506| third kind of encounter?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stay up late on most friday nights watching a movie or reading while my family sleeps. Last Friday night at about 2AM my dog bogee got my attention by wanting to go out. So i got off the couch and walked to the back door to let him out. As soon as he hit the ground, he bolted towards the far backyard as if after something.(Our backyard is completely fenced in except on one corner of the house) I looked out ahead of him to maybe spot our cat, a stray cat, or some other kind of night animal. There is an old storage shed in the back yard about 25 feet from our back door. Behind it on the next street over is a streetlight. For a split second my eyes focused on something running along the inside of the fence towards the back of the shed. As it vanished behind the shed, bogee turned the corner to the shed RIGHT after the animal, and began to bark violently as if he has cornered something (he has done this countless times with the local cats)At this point I figure it&#39;s a racoon, at the MOST a stray dog. Bogee is a shitz-zeu? Anyway you get my point. He&#39;s small. so I go running out to make sure what ever it is, it doesn&#39;t begin attacking him. After about 15 feet I begin to hear the sound of something REALLY wanting to get through a chain-link fence by slamming into it over and over. As a round the corner bogee is standing at this end of the lane, (The back of the shed sits inside the fence about 2 1/2 feet so there is a small lane about 15 feet long that ends with blackberry bushes then the turn of the connecting fence.) and the animal was at the other end. It seemed to be tangled in the blackberry bush pretty good because it had stopped trying to go through the fence and became still. The streetlight from the other street helped me make out something. I could see what my mind told me was I guess skin. The animal was &#34;breathing&#34; with quick rasping gasps. And this &#34;skin&#34; rose and fell with these sounds. It was very reflective, as if wet, so I cant say what color it was. SO at this point I&#39;m kinda getting freaked out,so I squat down to lay my hand on bogee&#39;s back to quiet him down. At that moment the thing decides to bolt. But it doesn&#39;t come towards me (which in turn would make me scream like a woman) but takes a run at the back fence and slams into it. Now listen to this. It uses the recoil of the fence to jump up to the roof of the shed and scramble onto the shingles. YES, I was taking a few steps back. About 20. When, I started to dry heave. Alot. NOW I&#39;m scared.Bogee begins to howl as I run back towards the house. My eyes are watering so my vision is blured, but I dont smell or hear anything odd. (Well, except for me unexplainable puking my guts out in my backyard.) In between heaving i raise up and catch a glimps of it jumping from my shed&#39;s roof to my neighbor&#39;s shed roof. Not a long jump, about 6 feet wide, except his shed is a two story! It landed on the ROOF! It scurried over the top and was gone. I continued to gag for about 4 or 5 mins. As I made my way to the door I heard, felt? I low thooming, like thunder underground, that lasted maybe 2 seconds? then I was inside and closing the door. (yes I made sure bogee was with me) If I had to guess on the size and weight of the animal in question I would say anywhere from 50 to 65 lbs. As the size I can&#39;t actually say. I never really got a good like at it. But if I had to guess a size or shape I would say it was pretty close to a large chimp. Actually I think to this day that is what I saw. What else could it be? Yeah I know, the puking. I can&#39;t explain that. Probably never will. I never tell people about it, this is South Carolina. But I though maybe you UFO people would be interested in hearing about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((initials deleted)) Greenville SC<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

About 40 Miles from Baker, CA after passing Barstow, CA, we (my passenger and I) noticed a Bright white &#34;star&#34; off to the northwest, just off the side of the highway.  As we continued North on the HWY, we noticed 2 smaller lights to the sides slightly lower than the bright center light.  They appeared to be of equal distance and angle from the center light.  As we approached, it increased in width.  It was 11PM so the only lights were the travelling cars and the stars, it was a clear night, it seemed we were getting closer to the object, triangle.  As we got closer, we noticed that the stars vanished behind the object, the black object.  We continued past the object and never saw it again.  It seemed as if it were not moving at all or so slow it was unmeasurable.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looking at a fairly bright star towards the east about 3/4 of the way up the sky from the horizon when I noticed what I thought at first was a satellite .It was faint like a dim star but as I looked more carefully I saw that it was really three points of light making a very small triangle . I saw no strobe lights and the three lights were all of about the same brightness . They were moving from south to north very slowly and seemed to be at a great altitude . They were somewhat reddish in color. The lights had not moved far when they began to get much much brighter like some one was turning up a dimmer switch to its brightest setting and then back down slowly . They kinda of flared up and the lightwas a very bright bluish white like a star going nova  . This brightness lasted only a couple of seconds and then they dimmed to their original magnitude and then within a couple seconds of that the disapeared entirely. This happened 4 times in sucession with 4 different sets of lights . The 4th was much closer to the horizon than the other three and it lasted the longest maybe 20 seconds. It to flared brightly and then very quickly dimmed and was gone. I then went into the house and told my son about it and went back outside . A few minutes later he came out and I was describing what it was that I had seen and was pointing out the location in the sky when I noticed another one in the same area but this time going northwest to southeast. He saw it immediately and as he watched with me the lights flared and faded as before . We continued to watch this for about an hour and it happened repeatedly in exactly the same manner . the amount of time any one of these small triangles were visible ranged from 20seconds to LESS THAN 5 SECONDS . The emphasis is intentional . They were definetly not planes unless planes dim their lights or shut them off completely . They werent satellites either unless they can do the same thing . I have seen satellites on many occasions of meteor shower watching and I have NEVER seen anything do this . All of this activity took place in the same small area of the sky at a high altitude except for the 4th one  All of the sightings after the first 4 were moving in different directions but originating or appearing in the same area of the sky near cygnus (I think ,Im not very good at constellations .  Have you ever heard of anything like this before ? My son is 15 and very curious about what he has just seen as am I. I had just sent you the a report of the only sighting I have ever had ( TILL NOW !) just last week . Weird .<n>

While I was looking at some of the brighter stars in the sky I noticed what I thought was a jet of sorts cruising at a very slow rate of speed. As I watched it, it split into three parts which had a sort of redish glow to all of the parts. Standing outside of my house these objects would have been East towards Metro Rochester. They looked circular in shape or even ovalish. I could not see the color of them but within about 15 seconds the three objects stopped in mid air. One went East, one went West and the third shot up into the sky and as soon as I looked to see the other two they were all gone. I did not hear any noise at all. I don&#39;t think i could guess the speed of the objects but it was super quick.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As she went to get the video camera (and found that all four batteries were dead, even though we just charged them not long ago), I watched the lights &#34;rotate&#34; on a central axis and then could make out a dimmer fourth light, at this point I realized that the pattern formed a perfect triangle shape, similar to the &#34;Star Destroyers&#34; from the Star Wars movies.  I could make out one bright light at the point and three across the back, one in the center and one at either &#34;point&#34;.  The triangle rotated towards the south and continued straight until out of sight behind haze.  It always moved at the same slow rate and there were no sounds associated with either of these events.  The first elapsed in maybe 20-30 seconds, the second probably 2-3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course this piqued our curiosity, so we stayed out a while longer, and I saw a &#34;shooting star&#34; like I have never seen before, it was large, and I could actually see the comet shape and particles falling off the back, it looked like bright orange fire, I&#39;ve never seen one this large or colored before, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s probably just coincidence but I thought I&#39;d mention it anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The street was lined with very large trees and I was looking at the point where the trees intersected with the sky. There was suddenly a gap in the trees and I saw a large triangular thing with lights on the bottom hovering there not too far off of the ground. I immediately told the person driving to stop but we could not see past the trees. We turned around and slowly drove back looking for another gap in the trees. For a second I saw the triangular aircraft again. It was unlike any plane that ive ever seen. I know that there is an airport in the area but I have lived in this neighorhood for 2 years now and I have never seen an airplane fly over the neighborhood, especially one that looked like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The amount of lights were 5. The object was hovering at a stagnant nature about 70- 80 feet above the street. The lights seemed to be 10 feet in diametar (all the same size) considering the distance we observed it from. Becasue there was no sound admitted from the craft we knew that it was not any flying object we were familiar with. We were not too far from the center of the city, so we assume that many others saw it. We now regret that we didn&#39;t stop the car to observe the craft for a longer amount of time. If anyone else has seen this, please post a report. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear summer evening, not a cloud in the sky. I looked up and seen at what I first believed to be a commercial airplane. I pointed it out to a few of my friends. It struck me strange that the aircraft was moving extremely slow for an airplane. Also, I found it pretty weird that there wernt any lights on the aircraft as well. I continued to look at it for a few more seconds, by then the aircraft was really making me curious. I continued to walk, but my eyes were brought back to the sky again out of curiosity, but this time the aircraft was nowhere to be seen. Myself and my other friends took a few minutes searching the sky trying to find it, without any luck. This ruled out the possibility of the object being an airplane, since airplanes do not magically diasppear. Also, since it was a clear ending, I also ruled out the plane flying over the clouds. Now I&#39;m not sure what I saw...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Friday night, I was sitting on my car, leaning back looking up at the sky, in a parking lot off of Palatine Road, in Palatine, Illinois. The sky had some cumulus clouds above. At 7:40 pm this shape started to move across the sky, moving slow heading North. You could tell it was somekind of egg sharped craft, not from this earth. No blinking lights just an dull grayish colored egg shape. Suddenly, it had a blinking flash light effect as the craft parked next to one of the cumulus clouds, as if it was taking pictures below. Suddenly it powered faster going straight across the sky, then it seemed to move in a zigzagged motion, then turning in a left direction, heading west. It appeared again at 9:17 pm, moving again heading the opposite direction, zigzagging going right, and heading east, slowing down and then speeding up ward moving faster, and finally disappearing. I waited around 11:00pm, the craft never re-appeared again. It had a Aura, and motion that made it seem, that it was a highly advanced technical craft, to advanced to be designed from any military sights of our earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I slid out from under the front to answer a cell phone call. I laid back on the ground and looked up. Just 12&#34; infront of the eve line of the shop I noticed a small dot way up in the sky. I looked at it for a few minutes and talked about it to the person on the phone. The dot must have been extremey high. I expected it to move out of sight in just a couple of seconds. Figuring it must be a jet at a very high altitude. When it didn&#39;t move, I really got interested and lined it up with the overhang. It moved about 1/2&#34; in 5 minutes. I got up and walked around and couldn&#39;t locate it. I laid back down and it was still there. I do not know why I didn&#39;t go get someone else to look at it. I guess I was expecting it to move. It was not an airplane or a helicopter. I am used to the trafic from Seatac and Auburn Airport and have an Aircraft back ground. Just thought you might be interested. And to see if anyone else has reported seeing it. It was just a tiny round dot. But very metalic looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like a large chrome(silver)sphere shaped object moving slowly in the sky behind the YMCA building. It looked to be maybe 4000 to 5000 ft in the air. As I kept watching the object it moved upward to my left at a forty-five degree angle into a small cloud. I never took my eyes off the cloud thinking sooner or later it had to reappear somewhere beyond this cloud,but it never did. I finished my walk and never saw the craft again.  I might have been a weather balloon,but I&#39;ve never seen one that large and able to move in a straight line at forty-five degrees on it&#39;s on power.  If anyone has any idea as to what it might have been I would certainly like to know.<n>

The sky was mostly clear but the wind was approximately 15MPH.  At exactly 8:00PM (according to the time on the pictures I took) I heard what sounded like a jet, and I looked for a few seconds for it (direction of sound was somewhat difficult to ascertain due to the wind and the waves by the lake shore) before I spotted what I assume was the source of the sound.  The object appeared to my naked eye to be white and cylindrical without wings and flew from south-southeast to north-northwest in a straight line at a speed that didn&#39;t seem unusually fast or slow for a jet, and I believe it was lower than most of the jets I see in the area because I could see it fairly well with my eyes and it was clearly visible.  Barksdale AFB and the Shreveport Regional airport are east of my location approximately 60 miles and most jets I see travel from west to east or east to west in this area and I&#39;ve taken a number of pictures of them as well.  The object did not produce a contrail nor exhibit any unusual behavior other than appearing to fly without wings.  I attempted to take three pictures of the object (zoomed at 6X at 2 megapixels), the first of which turned out very good and clear and verified that no wings were visible.  The second picture was focused on the tree tops and the object was blurry and washed out, and by the time I took the third picture I believe the object had disappeared behind the trees.  From the time I first spotted the object to the time it disappeared was approximately fifteen seconds.  My son continued playing and did not see the object, though he heard the sound of a jet engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On Thursday, June 23rd 2005 at approx|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44538.html|119|ndxe200506| I live in Sharsptown, a residential community located in the southwestern side of Houston, Texas. On Thursday, June 23rd 2005 at approximately 6:45 pm I noticed a very bright object in the southern sky traveling north to northwest at a very high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I normally do not look up at the sky, but a pretty red cardinal caught my attention as it perched on a telephone wire in my backyard. I was wading in the swimming pool at the time and as I watched this bird I noticed a very tiny round or ball shaped object that looked like a typical star in illumination, but not as distinct because it was still daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was very tiny to the naked eye—no larger than the head of a shirt pin. Owing to its size, I presumed the object to be flying at a very high altitude—much higher than typical passenger jets that fly at 35,000 feet. The speed of the object I judged to be three to four times faster than passenger jets flying at this altitude. Usually when a passenger jet flies overhead at 35,000 feet or more you can watch them for a couple of minutes before they move out of your visual range. In the first twenty seconds I watched this object I believed it would move out of my visual range in less than one minute. At thirty seconds it changed to a westerly still maintaining its velocity and illumination which did not change. I lost sight of the object after 50 seconds as it faded into the brightness of the sun in the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I experience a similar even in 1965 when I saw a similar object while living in the City of Orange near Santa Ana in southern California. This event was reported in The Register newspaper. At the time my father, a West Point graduate, was a lead aerospace engineer at North American working on Gemini space vehicle projects for NASA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot say for certain what I saw over Houston, but as an ex military man I trust my instincts and whatever this objects was—it flew at a speed in excess on MACH I perhaps even MACH II.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

6/23/05 12:20|South Bend|IN|Rectangle|10-15 mts|Repeated white rectangle and round object by airport and hiding behind cloud|7/13/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44847.html|121|ndxe200506| Repeated white rectangle and round object by airport and hiding behind cloud<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have witnessed UFO&#39;s on my way to work several times.  This was just the last time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area I see them is always by the airport going down the highway.  Now, the first time, I noticed a round bright light in the clear blue sky that would fade out and reappear as I traveled along. It seemed to stay with me.  It didn&#39;t move. It seemed to stay fixed in the sky except when it would fade out and reappear almost as if to stay with me.  This lasted about ten minutes and was in September of 2003.  This past year I have noticed it at least two other times.  Except two other times it was not a light but a solid round white object that seemed to hover and then zoom off into the distance.  The last sighting looked like a white rectangle that I was open to the possibility of it being a jet.  So I watched it as it went behind a cloud and never came out.  I watched that cloud for at least ten minutes.  I really felt that it wasn&#39;t a plane, but knew for sure when it &#34;hid&#34; behind a cloud.  I have had other experiences in my life since I was little, including lights surrounding my bed and not being able to move. My sister was a witness to this and stared in shock.  Also, a couple years ago my son noticed a &#34;moving star&#34; when he looked out his window.In that same time period he showed me a rash under his left rib cage that was the shape of a perfect equilateral triangle.  This is just the surface of the things I&#39;ve seen.  I&#39;m beginning to think that they&#39;re following me. By the way, my very first sighting was when I was about nine.  I noticed a glowing green oval shaped object darting in a zig zag pattern in the sky and then disappearing.  The lights in my room occurred when I was about four.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Every once and a while I will see falling stars and airplanes traveling from the airport, Hartsfield. Anyway on this night I saw a triangle shaped object with 3 lights at each point, it was moving very slow and much closer to the ground than the other commercial aircraft, there was a smaller object moving behind the larger triangle. The smaller object was moving back and forth (left to right) with a lot of blinking lights on it, whereas the triangle was moving slow and steady south to north east, no blinking lights on the triangle. It was silent until it passed, then I heard what sounded like normal engine sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what I saw, I just know that I have never seen anything like those two objects before. I saw the mention of this web site on the National Geographic episode about UFO&#39;s with Peter Jennings, so here I am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have read other reports of triangle objects on your web site, however none had a smaller craft/object tailing the triangle.

The sky was clear. I had just got done watching a high flying jet that was going from North to South leaving a trail. About 30 seconds later a VERY bright light caught my eye. It was 80 degrees above the horizon SSW of my position. At first I thought it was a planet that I had somehow missed, but it was atleast 10 times the brightness of Venus and was moving slowly in a Northerly direction. It then began to dim to the brightness of the dimmest stars I could see, so I naturally thought that this was an Irridium flare. I then opened the window to get an unobstructed view with the binoculars. All of the sudden it was now moving in a Southerly direction, exactly opposite of what it was at first doing. I saw the direction change, it did not turn at all, but instead just instantly was going in the opposite direction. I watched it until I lost sight of it behind the roof of the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/22/05 23:30|Millville|NJ|Sphere|30 minutes +|One bright object moving awkwardly interacting with other man-made aircraft.|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44523.html|128|ndxe200506| One bright object moving awkwardly interacting with other man-made aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped outside and noticed aircraft traveling in the sky. From the angle I was sitting it seemed to be quite a few travelling.  My first assumption was that it was a military convoy since there are usually groups of 3-4 choppers that will travel through here during the day on occasion.  I noticed they kept coming.  I walked down the street about 50 yards to get a better angle and noticed that 4 of the aircraft were circling the sky.  They were triangler in shape with flashing lights.  These were probably planes since they had red and blue flashing lights and they seemed to be moving in a standard pattern.  Another one or two were definately choppers because I could hear them as they flew closer and farther away.  One of the objects, however appeared to be brighter than the others.  It also did not follow the same patterns as the other aircrafts in the sky.  It seemed to glow bright white without flashing lights.  It moved awkwardly and faster than the others but interacting with the planes.  It was more sphere like and there were no real flashing lights.  My first thoughts is this is a military training drill or it is an air search since there is an airport a few miles away but I have never seen this amount of aircraft circling the sky repeatedly for this long.  It&#39;s been almost an hour and they are still outside.  I&#39;ve tried to take pictures and digital film but my night-shot mode is poor and the digital film just won&#39;t pick up the objects.  I&#39;m sure this is explainable but just in case I felt I should fill out a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Stars shown and the full moon rising, no wind, temperature in upper 60&#39;s/lower 70&#39;s (F). Southwest facing beach. A tight cluster of lights appears in the southern sky, low altitude, moving from west to east. four or five distinct pinpoint lights, all different colors: blue, green, red, yellow... blinking/pulsing.... the cluster drifting east, erradic course jogging up a little then down a little, always moving east. The rapid strobing lights forcing my mind into non-thinking trance state. I knew at the time that this was an intelligent occurance, that it was for transmittion to me(if not others).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few miniutes the cluster suddenly vanishes. I then look up at the night sky and see that wherever I look, tiny strobing pinpoint lights flash at me. I keep looking in different sectors of sky and see this same responce. As soon as I look, they flash at me, when I look away, they stop. This second phase lasts 10 to 15 min. then the sky quickly fills in with clouds. Two of my freinds, I was able to direct their attention and they saw this first phase. The other two friends where occupied.<n> <n><n> <n><n> no sounds where heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was sitting on my back deck waiting, I saw a shooting star out of the corner of my eyes. The sky was extremly clear and I could see more stars than usual. As I watched the sky, I noticed what appeared to be a satelite moving North to South. It did not dawn on me at the time that satelites do not normally move North to South. I watched it move across the sky and was following its path. When it reached 12:00, or directly over head, it stopped. I was floored. I have seen many satelites travel across the sky, so I knew this was not normal. It stayed motion less for about 5 seconds, then it move in the same direction quickly in a &#34;S&#34; pattern and stopped at approximately 11:00 O clock. Again it stayed motion less for approximately 5 seconds, then streak west to east and out of sight in approximately 1 second. I am a private pilot who has flown many nights and have seen many satelites. This event leaves me with no reasonable idea what this was. It was not a weather balloon, laser, plane, cloud, meteor, or satelite. I was awake, not tired, no stress, not intoxicated, or under the influence of any medication. It appeared first like a star, when I realized it was moving I thought it was a satelite. It did not grow in size or get brighter. It stayed constent in appearance and brightness. It defied all logic and Physics. I have read simular stories of this pattern, and have always thought that people eyes were playing tricks, or they wanted to see a UFO so bad that they saw what they wanted. I was not looking for this event. Am not a UFO buff. But this event has changed my thinking. I was totaly amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I realized that there were actually 3 lights moving in a triangular formation, with the brightest in the rear, and 2 dimmer lights leading. They were headed in a southeasterly direction, towards the rising Moon. I watched them, in total, for at least 7 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first noticed them, they were moving at a typical satelight speed, and after returning from grabbing the binoculars from my car, they had slowed to the point where they hung almost stationary in the sky. I was very surprised that they hadn&#39;t moved out of my range while getting the binoculars. They slowed so much that there was only minimal movement against the stars. I watched them, with the binoculars until I lost them in the Moon&#39;s glow. They did not appear to &#34;drop&#34; in altitude with the distance and never appeared more than points of solid golden light throughout the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I WAS LOOKING AT IT TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST, THE AIRCRAFTS THAT WERE IN THE AREA WERE HIGHER THAN SAID OBJECT.

My wife saw these things up in the sky. We looked up in the southwestern sky and saw about 15 objects hovering and doing manuevers. They were in this mode for about 10 minutes. They then came in a formation directly over our head. They flew slowly in formation for about 5 minutes. At this time  the shapes were very visible. They had a long body shape like a plane with wings. Only 9 of these objects were flying in this formation. The others just disappeared. After they flew overhead in formation they then did their little dance again. About 2 minutes later they got back into formation and they were out of our sight. These objects were not a plane. Planes cannot do these moves. They were flying at a relatively high altitiude. I would guess about 10 - 15,000 feet up. My wife and I are both college grads.

As we were leaving the track in the park I noticed a solid black object in the sky.  It was moving very slowly and flying extrememly low. Low enough to were I could make out the shape.  It was triangular in shape but had buldges coming out of it.  As I continued to jog I noticed it began to morph/change shape.  It then changed into what looked like a bunch if grapes.  As I was following it, my girlfriend then noticed it and wondered what it was.  We both began to slow down and watch the object.  As we approached a street intersection waiting for the light to change so we can proceed w/ our jog, another person who was waiting to cross the street also noticed it and asked us if we are seeing what he was seeing.  At that moment, a commercial aircraft passed underneath it.  However the object continued to move slowly across the sky.  We continued our jog but I kept an eye on the object.  As it continued to move,it turned into a red color.  Soon thereafter, it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The one on top appeared to have a ball of light at the head of the line. They did not move. I watched them for about 10 minutes to see if there was any movement. There was none. I thought they might be shooting stars or comets with tails. The lines were uniformly thick though and the same length. The outlines were fuzzy and not sharp. I went outside in front to get a closer look and then went into the backyard to see if I could still see them. They did not move or change. I watched for about 30 minutes and then went back inside the house. I watched them from my bedroom window which is in the front of the house where the kitchen is. They never moved or changed. I finally fell asleep and when I woke up it was still dark and they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was 3 separate objects but all 3 lights moved at the same speed (very slowly) directly over my head. It came out of the northwest moving toward to southeast, toward the moon. I could not see anything within the lights, but the light in front was slightly brighter than the two trailing lights. The lights formed a large triangle and almost came to a complete stop over my house. I couldn&#39;t believe it! It moved toward the moon and just disappeared. I also saw 6 other lights at the same altitude moving in different direction just prior to and after the triangle passed. None of the lights made any sounds and all moved very slowly. One very bright light stopped directly over my head and then moved toward the north very slowly and disappeared. This was about a minute before the triangle approached from the northwest. I don&#39;t know what they were, but I saw them. I&#39;ve seen similar lights in the past, but never a triangle or lights that stopped. It was very cool! I don&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s, so they were probably military aircraft. There were no flashing lights, so I wonder. All of the lights were white.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the evening we were enjoying the beach around dark sitting and talking in the sand above the breaking waves. We were in the Little Lagoon area of Gulf Shores (address available upon request)   I noticed a twin-engine aircraft approach parallel to the beach at about several thousand feet above the water and about the same distance from shore. Immediately after the plane flew past us, three white lights appeared in the sky above the horizon and below where we had seen the airplane. They were connected in a horizontal line and were very distinct. They seemed to be about the size of aircraft lights that would be from a distant aircraft, perhaps slightly larger.  They were not moving at all and after about 10 seconds,immediately stopped shining. A few minutes later, they appeared again, and then again once more. There were no clouds in the sky except for some high, thin clouds. So it was not clouds which caused the lights to appear and reappear, etc.  Later, a somewhat full moon rose on the horizon to the left of where we spotted these strange lights. There are also several oil rigs out in the Gulf of Mexico below where were saw these lights, however the lights were NOT at sea level. Three of my family members witnessed the lights. We heard no sounds either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Possibly above the treetop level, about 100&#39; above the ground level. My first night UFO sighting. I think a helicopter saw the whole thing from the beginning, possibly before I saw it. The UFO location is in the city on a clear night sky. I wonder how many witnesses have reported the sighting. The actual sighting is more serious than what I have imagined from hearing the UFO stories through the internet and broadcasting. The sighting videos may not appear dramatic, but in real life, it&#39;s very different. If there is a daily alert article or column published in a daily newspaper based on the events, it can be most appreciated to the concerned ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

When we walked towards the back of the yard which was completely dark I noticed a big orange light coming up from the woods. Now I can pretty much distinguish it wasn&#39;t something normal due to the size of the light, it was about the size of a small compact car. The object was around a quarter of a mile away and about 50-100 feet off the ground as it was just starting to rise from the trees. I told my brother what the hell is that in the sky and when he seen it he immediately started running back towards the house, not wanting to stay by myself in the dark wooded area I ran with him. Now there is only 1 street light around this neighborhood and it was on the other side of our house across the street. There aren&#39;t to many homes around the area which makes is pretty dark at night.

They would disappear and then reappear in a different location.One object seemed to be in the shape of a dome on top. I saw one, then two and three. There were most usually two. The odd thing is that as I was taking pictures of these dark objects, I began to notice the clouds changing aways toward the right of them. I took three pictures of the changing formation. I was using a digital camera and when I took the picture of the large configuration, my camera went totally black except for the normal information readout. I have never had this happen before. I tried repetedly to take a picture and it just wouldn&#39;t work. Even the viewfinder was black. I had to turn it off and then turn it on again. By that time the large configuration was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/20/05 16:57|Kaunas (Lithuania)||Circle|10-25 sec.|Strange circle-shaped object over Kaunas, Lithuania|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44707.html|154|ndxe200506| Strange circle-shaped object over Kaunas, Lithuania<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing happened when I was in the local airfield in Kaunas, Lithuania, waiting for an airplane to arrive. I was looking at the sky when I suddenly noticed a strange flying thing. It was definitely very far away, because I could only see a small circle moving quite fast from north west to east or south east. It couldn&#39;t be an airplane, because there was no sound, and it was too high. Moreover no planes fly that way. If u&#39;d look to the map, u would see that Kaunas is in the centre of Lithuania, and Vilnius, a capital, is in the east. So the biggest part of airplanes fly from east to west(and vice versa), or, if airplanes just cross Lithuania, they have to go from north to south. My father said it could have been a sattelite, although it was day and the sun was shining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was lucky to carry a digital camera with me, so I captured an image, therefore I know the exact time of this event (2005-06-20 16:57). The image (I&#39;ve sent it to You) shows a small object. I used the biggest zoom (3X optical + 4X digital) to capture the object, so the quality isn&#39;t very good. It could look like a cloud to You, but I can asure You that it was much smaller and it was moving constantly and very fast. I could see it for 20-30 seconds, and then it hid over the clouds (which means it was moving higher than clouds)  Probably I was the only one witness, although there were 20-30 people some 100 metres away. I&#39;m sure they could have seen the same if wanted, but the object was very small, no sound was spread and it hid over the cloud after 20 or 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what was there. I can&#39;t say it was UFO, but I haven&#39;t seen anything like that before. We have many airplanes (small ones, and big passenger jets) passing Kaunas, and I know how they look and sound like, so it couldn&#39;t have been an airplane. The other possibility is that it could have been a sattelite, but, as I&#39;ve said before, I have never seen anything like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was silver with a black bottom (which I presume was shadow) but I saw no fins or even a gondola (or carrage)where the drivers would be.  I also noticed it was longer and not as plump as a blimp.  I&#39;ve seen the Goodyear Blimp and this was much longer.  I also heard no sound.  The motor of a blimp is not something you would miss.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it, I noticed that it was tipping forward and back, like a see/saw as it moved slowly along the sky.  I thought this to be rather  odd movement for an airship.  It did this all the while I watched it.  Finally it moved out of my viewpoint.  I tried to catch it again at the top of a hill, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, I saw about 10 white panel trucks with a blue shield and the letters *cc inside the shield.  On top were the Yellow caution lights utility trucks have.  The * is represents the letter I didn&#39;t catch.  They were all moving fast and not paying attention to stop signs.  I had the idea they where searching for something because some of the trucks had what appeared to be radio equipment in their beds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve not heard of any reports of downed blimps in my region.

It must have been around mid morning as it was completely daylight with no clouds except below us. In comparing the size of this object from the same distance on the ground i would estamate it to be about 2 times the same size of a med car. It was totaly round and no marking on it at all. It was a brush aluminum in color and was completely visable. We were above the clouds and with no obstructions around to distort any thing i saw. I was in such shock i was afraid to even ask anyone on my side of the plane and for fear someone thought i was crazy or something I KNOW someone else had to have seen the same thing also.The item passed us in the opposite direction going at a high rate of speed and at the exact same of height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I didn’t pay much attention as I thought it to be a neon sign on the Bank of America building across the street.  I rolled over and attempted to sleep when the light again flickered through the curtains.  I still ignored it, and again with even more intensity the light flickered through the curtains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reluctantly got up and moved the curtains so I could see where the light was coming from.  I looked up at the top of the Bank of America building of about 20 stories high and the neon sign was not flickering.  I was closing the curtains when I noticed what I thought was a police helicopter surrounded by bright lights. Spot lights were coming from the base and shining in various spots in the parking lot.  My first thought was that it was some kind of drug bust and the helicopter would be landing with a swat team.  However, the craft did not land, but stayed hovering high in the dark night.  Now it had definitely got my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I focused on it, I made out the shape to be a cube, definitely three dimensional.  I couldn’t make out any substance such as steel.  It was a cube of light, swirling bright light on a three dimensional cube.  I was still trying to rationalize what it could be.  I then remembered seeing special shape hot air balloons in Albuquerque which lit up at night in similar fashion.  &#34;That’s what is must be,&#34; I told myself.  Then something even stranger happened.  I heard musical tones similar to wind chimes or ancient flutes that we often hear in Greek mythology type movies.  But the sounds were coming from inside my head even though it felt I was hearing them with my ears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became afraid and did not move for about 20 minutes while I continued to watch.  I finally said to myself, &#34;What ever it is knows I am here, and I cannot hide from it.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately dressed and walked outside.  I stayed underneath the 2nd floor overhang and peered out to see above.  It was even more magnificent when viewing through the night air although it was hard to focus on, somewhat blurred.  At that moment I was surrounded by an orchestra of musical tones again sounding like ancient flutes or pipes.  I thought to myself, how beautiful!  The song was child like, something you might hear a children’s nursery.  Again, I heard the music in my head and outside, but not in our natural way of hearing, hard to explain . . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> To make a long story short, I packed my bags and was running to my SUV when an early morning garbage truck and driver stopped in the alley next to my car. I looked at the driver in the eyes and signaled to look up with my eyes.  I turned and ran with luggage in tow, got in my car and drove two hours to my home in Lubbock.  I drove to my sister’s office where my mother happened to be and told both of them what I witnessed.  By the look on their faces they were fearful for me.  I phoned a friend of mine who happens to be a deputy sheriff in Amarillo to ask if anyone had phoned in such a sighting in the early morning dark.  He laughed hysterically and said no, but would let me know if anyone did.  He did not call back.  I’ve since moved to Phoenix and have told only a handful of people what I witnessed that early morning on June 20, 2005, five years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous.

We had binoculars so we looked at it and it had two bright lights, it floated and the lights never flashed on it, it also had no stream coming out the back end of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At around 8:33, we witnessed what we first thought was something blowing high in the sky as the wind was really starting to blow.  We saw the object move in random directions, zig-zagging, and also descending lower. We thought it might be a plane, as many planes approach Portland International Airport in the general area where we first spotted it.  However, the object moved irratically as if blown about, and then  moved south and began descending far faster than any plane could normally.  It disappeared behind the hills approximately east of Troutdale, Oregon, about 8-10 miles away.  We have never before reported a Ufo sighting, and never have ever seen a UFO, but we are convinced we saw something most unusual tonight.  We are 55 and 50 in age, and highly educated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had light and dark components, but was so small and so distant that any detail is hard to describe.  The wife felt it was somewhat triangular in shape, and the husband saw a bright light with an irregular shape around 3 sides of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One witness called home and asked a family member to go outside and two other witnesses saw streaks in the sky, both heading west, estimate altitude was 15-20 thousand feet. One witness reported the original object was not moving, but when they reached their home, the object look like it dived and then disappear or like it just shrunk and turn small. Two family members saw the other two streaks and one disappeared and another one appeared south of it. That one disappeared and another streak appeared going east, it looked like a fast moving plane, but no sound or sonic boom was not heard. Has there been reports of such events?<n>

First feeling was that it was the bright reflection of the sun off of a Mylar party balloon. However it did not move. Absolutely clear sky and no movement. Sighted and aligned the object against my deck posts as reference. It did not move. Made an assumption that it was likely the International Space Station&#39;s Solar panels reflecting the sun. It was there for a good while. Finally noticed that it was gone. A Southwest Airlines jet allowed me a point of reference and I snapped the digital image that will accompany this report. The object is to the left and above the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We thought it was an astroid because of the fire tail it had at the end we were waiting for it hit and expect something severe to happen as it was heading in the direction of the sun but as we can see it going down all of a sudden it change directions towards up again,at that point it was a dot but we did notice the sudden direction change going up again we lost sight of it because of the glare of the sun.  That night we waited to see the news on the object we saw but nothing was said. We seen green lights flying past or down from the sky before but this this was bright red, this was the first time we were afraid it was going to hit.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was around 7:00-7:30pm. I thought it was odd to see a star this early, but was amazed when I saw three more lights. I live about 20 miles from a major airport and know what I was seeing was not an airplane. We got the binoculars and could actually see the shape of the light. I looked like an ameba shaped light with red and yellow lights around the outside. The lights moved aross the sky and a fairly slow rate. The move in a somewhat straight line, but two hung together. The two that hung together , one was underneath the other, then moved up to the other at a very fast rate of speed and remained close to the other light. They moved together. The last light stayed behind. I know that some airplanes that take off from Newark International Airport must have seen these light. I NEED TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE SAW THEM!!!<n>

I had no idea where we were ( above what state or city etc ) as I am not familiar with plane routes..............so i had no idea where we were. ......anyway, he told me we were above HUNTSVILLE ALABAMA and we were at 6000 FEET. ....I then looked at my watch at noted it was ABOUT 6:10 PM ( my watch set at timezone of my home in WEST TN )...I am not sure if that would be the same time in HUNTSVILLE ALABAMA or not. ......<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see this out of the corner of my eye. It was pretty clear skys and i watched it clearly. It appeared to be something like a ROUND BALL and looked sort of chrome in color. I have no idea of the size as the distance would be sort of hard to gauge in the air for me but if i had to guess id say maybe 5ft to 20ft in diameter???  CAN YOU HELP ME FIGURE THIS OUT?  WAS ANYTHING GOING ON IN  HUNTSVILLE AL AT ANOUT 6:10PM ( WEST TN TIME )?  ARE THERE ANY HISTORY OF THIS?  IS THERE SOMEBODY ELSE I CAN CONTACT?  IS THERE ANY GOOD INFO ONLINE THAT WOULD HELP ME?  IF SO WHERE ONLINE IS IT?  I am not jerking you around and i am 36 years old. I feel stupid even asking and even dumber admitting I saw this but i did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i hate to give out my name at least right now. hope u understand for know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i cant just &#34;stop&#34; thinking about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i need to know more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> any assistance would be appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Q: I WE WERE MOVING FORWARD IN AN AIRPLANE, THEN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHAT APPEARED TO BE MOVING UP FROM BELOW TOWARD US FROM THE BEGINING MUST HAVE ALSO NEEDED TO BE MOVING ALONG AT THE SAME PACE AS US. IF NOT, WOULD WE NOT HAVE PASSED BY IT??? SO  MAY BE IT WAS ACTUALLY MOVING ALONG UNDER US AND GAINING ALTITUDE............SO IT APPEARED TO BE MOVING UP IN A STRAIGHT LINE........THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT, IT HAD TO MAYBE HAVE NEEN MOVING IN SAME DIRECTION AND SAME SPEED AS US WHEN I ORIGINALLY SAW IT AND NOTICED IT COMMING UP TOWARDS US..................CRAZY!........WAS IT SORT OF FOLLOWING US?????................SPOOKY BECAUSE I AM NOT A BIG FLYER AND THIS WAS THE ONLY THE 2ND TIME I HAD EVER BEEN IN A SMALL PLANE.

From the lowest tree line we saw a very bright, metallic shining sphere go quickly into the sky . It reached jet altitude in such a quick time. We (3 ) saw the object in and out of the clouds moving swiftly. It was far away; in no time then gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

NOTE: this is not a fake report just to get folks excited i simply would like to know if anyone else in the area noticed the object for personal clarification purposes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was in upstate New York,  Sullivan County in the town of Bethel.  The sky was practically crystal clear and blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on my deck facing South East.  I saw an object that looked like a silver sphere about 70 degrees above the horizon line, moving left to right about 120 degrees (10 o’clock to 3 o’clock).   It was completely silent and seemed to move at a steady medium to fast pace, then disappeared behind the trees.  The event lasted about 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course I was completely alone!

The rectangle was flying with the long sides leading and trailing. There was absolutely no sound, identifying features, or lights. Since it was just a black rectangle in silhouette it is extremely difficult to estimate the size of the object or the altitude. But I believe it was a large object that was quite high. I would estimate the speed as being roughly equivalent to that of a jet fighter cruising at about 10,000 feet. I am 66 years old, a former Air Force aircrew member, and I hold an FAA Flight Instructors rating. I am not a UFO nut. I have seen just about everything that has flown in our skies since the early 1940&#39;s and I can say with 100% confidence that this object was totally anomalous.

At first, I thought it was just an errant helium balloon -- we see those floating in the same way often enough.  But as we watched, we realized it couldn&#39;t be a balloon.  The object appeared to be shiny, silver and spherical.  We were unable to judge the size or distance, but it did not seem to be moving up or down (as a helium balloon would).  It moved across the sky (approx. west to east) at a steady pace and altitude -- perhaps at the speed of an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/19/05 12:50|Albuquerque|NM|Unknown|about 5 min|A brightly flashing object was seen in broad daylight.  It rose suddenly, hovered, then dived and sped away.|6/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44485.html|173|ndxe200506| A brightly flashing object was seen in broad daylight.  It rose suddenly, hovered, then dived and sped away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a flashing, silvery glint off in the west as I was driving home.   I thought it was a piece of trash in the air at first, but it had a very bright, metallic glint to it and it was holding altitude and moving along toward the south-southeast, dipping and climbing a little in a very odd manner.   I stopped and watched it;  the flashing continued in an irregular, fluttery fashion, and it continued its southerly motion at a deliberate pace that seemed very much at odds with the wind at the time, which was calm at the surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After perhaps two minutes of observation, the object was due south of me;  it suddenly rose very rapidly to a position probably 70 degrees above the horizon and stood motionless.   It continued to flash and I could see a black phase alternating between the bright ones.   There was no discernable shape and the size was just sufficient to give me the impression of angularity.  If you imagine a rectangular mirror of a few square feet of area, perhaps half a mile away, tumbling and twisting randomly, but hanging still in the air, that&#39;s what this thing reminded me of.  It seemed to be relatively close,  I would guess between a quarter and a half a mile, but probably not over a mile.  As it hung in the sky, flashing, I could occasionally see hints of color and there was occasionally a sense of a sort of fuzzy distortion immediately around the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to hold in position for approximately a minute and then it suddenly dived down at a very rapid rate and then shot off horizontally just above the southeastern horizon, traveling roughly east-southeast.   It vanished behind some buildings and trees.   Surface winds were light and variable, with a breeze of perhaps one or two miles per hour.  Temperature was in the eighties, the time was a few minutes before one in the afternoon.  The sky was perfectly clear and visibility was on the order of eighty miles or better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing I can think of that might have behaved like this would be a small piece of aluminized mylar caught in a thermal.  But this object was moving a relatively high rate of speed for most of the time I was observing it;  the winds present at the time cannot account for this motion.   The zoom to high altitude might have been caused by a thermal,   but the hover and very rapid descent to low altitude (around 100 feet) followed by a rapid translational motion is beyond anything I know that thermals are likely to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My husband was reclined down looking out the sun roof.  He jumps and says &#34;what was that?&#34; I did not see it yet.  My husband discribed it as a gray, huge watermellon shaped object.  We were getting off the by-pass and I was looking for a place to park to look.  A few minutes later, I parked in the Meijers Parking lot.  By this time it was a mile away.  Large like the size of the Sun at sunset.  My husband said it looked like a triangle from off in the distance.  It did not move like a plane.  Back and force like a sea-saw.   It went in and out of the clouds a few time, then disappeared.  To me it looked totally round, like a dark circle, balloon, without a basket.  We are 49 years old.  Of course when we share this with family, they just smile and listen.  End of story  My son had a &#34;UFO&#34; experience too about seven years back.  He was in his car with cousin, maybe a friend too, and something small like his car, came real close to them and took off super fast.  It tagged along with them at the night time and zoomed with percular patterns, unlike airplanes.  My son is now a pilot.  He was only 18 or so back at the time this happen, late in the evening with his cousin, who also saw the unknown aircraft around Warsaw, IN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister claims about 30 years ago, she and her friend was chased by one,  My mom thought she was drunk.

Then it came out of the south and still traveling at this great speed { I would say about 5 times the speed of a commercial jet} it stopped and reversed course for 1/2 a second and went forward again and reversed again and then shot up and disapeared.

As they rose, the three white objects stayed aligned with each other in a diagonal line, one silver to the left and and one silver to the right of the 3 white objects. While the two silver objects kept a little distance from the group, the three white objects would go from a straight line equal distances apart, like the famous star formation, to forming a triangle. They seemed to be drifting north and up and at one point i saw what looked like a bright orange airplane flying very close, just above or through,  the objects, it was about a millimeter long at arms length and the objects were like pinpoints. There were almost no clouds in the sky at this time and eventually the objects were too hard to see/follow. I thought it was weird that i could see the orange plane by the objects but couldn&#39;t really see the color of other planes that were much closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The location is at the base of Mr Graham as you can see by the photo. Nothing but desert between mountain and house I was at. I have looked at the object over and over again on my computer but can not determine what I see and I have showed other people also. In showing this and mentioning this event I have found out they also have seen strange things and also experianced them although they were never reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mt Graham is site of a supposedly private telescope funded by universities. It has been reported that there or were military on site and no one is allowed near. The rumor is that the scope also sits on top of multistory complex of some type.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At time of photo, 06:38 actual time, the object seemed to be hoovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Photo is taken through the windshield of an automobile.  Object is very small, and quite blurry.  We do not know what the object is, but have requested more information from the witness.  At first, we thought the object might be a bird, but if it remained motionless in the sky, as the witness asserts was the case, that would rule out that possibility.  PD))<n>

My 12 yr. old son, myself and a fellow fisherman watched in awe as it came closer to us then moved back without any sound.  We were amazed at its ability to manuever so quickly and with an amazing speed. It was a very clear night with good visability, the object moved rather fast but was completely translucent. As it moved across the sky we could see the stars through the object. My husband is a web designer, I am a business owner, and are friend works as a contracter for the city, so as educated people we were all in a state shock as to what we had seen.  We live very close to Crestview Florida where sightings happen on a regular basis, but until that night we were all very skeptical about such events.  We did however all agree that what we had seen was not man-made.  My husband and I both served time in the military and are quite versed on military  planes.  My husband was in the Gulf war on a carrier and has seen the many different planes up close and personal.  Whatever this was it has made believers of us all.  I am very curious to find out if others out that night have spotted the same object.  Please feel free to email me with any and all information you might have received as we would like information on that craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was the only one home at the time too so I knew that som one had to have opened it. I lay there frozen, afraid to get up and see what was going on. then I looked over to my left and there were two beings standing at the side of my bed. I just couldnt belive it I thought I was dreaming or something. So they were kind of whiteish color and had a sort of a glow to them that was amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I looked over at the door and there was one there too like gaurding it or something. Then the one closest to me reached out and touched my ribs on my left side. All of the while the other two were just sort of standing around watching.The one touching my ribs looked at me right in the eyes and he said not be afraid ,they did not come to harm me. I was so scared I couldnt even yell or talk. It was like I was in a sort coma where I was aware of everything around me but couldnt speak or move. This lasted for about two or three minutes and the next thing I knew I woke up on the other side of my room on the floor, naked. It was really weird too becouse my side was really cold where I was being touched.My door was closed like normal, I looked at my clock and it was 400 am. I couldnt swallow or anything becouse my mouth and throat were so dry and I was curled up in a little ball. The beings were like I said before, whiteish in color and had a sort of glow around them. They had big black eyes and really big heads with no ears. Also I was able to notice they had really long fingers. I dont know but it scared me so bad I am having trouble sleeping. I dont even sleep in my room I have been stayin with a friend and dont even really try to sleep becouse I am scared it will happen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I first noticed the two smaller lights, they could have been redish in color, they were moving fast and in a diagonal pattern. When I had a more unobstructed view I then saw thata perhaps a purposeful diagonal flight pattern was being maintained and then noticed the large white bright oval shaped object flying between them. That one was much larger and brighter than the other two. They were moving fast, kept the same pattern and were staying low on the horizon. By the time I turned right onto West Haven Road which runs north, I could only get a glimpse now and then of the bright white object by looking to my left through the gaps in the trees and houses. My first impluse was to follow them, but they seemed to maybe be going lower and would be hard to see unless I changed my direction to head west. When I reached my house and exited my SUV I did not here any noise to indicate planes or jets were flying close by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I pointed it out to my sister and her boyfriend, and we all watched the thing. It was slightly lighter than the sky around it, and had a small orange light at the very tip of each point. Whiteish smoke was coming out the tail end (the shortest side) and trailing away, kind of like a cloud. It was moving... I&#39;d guess about the speed of any airplane(?). After about 35 seconds of us watching it, the whole thing just faded. The outline faded, the white smoke stopped (but the smoke that was already in the sky died away slowly), and the orange lights dimmed. The two rear ones died out completely, but the one on the front tip just dimmed until it was around the brightness of a red dwarf star. (I don&#39;t know whether it was a stealth action.) The whole ship slowed down, and moved very slowly from that point on, and we just watched it for like another minute, and then my sister said, &#34;Just drive.&#34; So we went, I kept trying to watch for the triangle&#39;s light, but I lost it, and by the time we got back, I guess it must have flown away or just dimmed completely. I&#39;d guess it was between 22 and 45 degrees up in the eastern sky (from our POV).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our background? My sister and I are born-and-raised Americans, and the boyfriend is a Russian. They aren&#39;t UFO buffs, and I&#39;m mostly a paranormal investigator (excluding UFOs).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Just as the ceremony ended the crowd of some 5,000 attendees was proceeding north toward the main platform.  I was headed in exactly the opposite direction toward the television remote truck, the event was broadcast on cable TV, to retrieve a piece of equipment I had loaned the production crew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a nearly cloudless day, the air was very clear and the sky was deep blue.  Out of the corner of my eyes I noticed something unusual seemingly floating north to south across the valley at about 500 feet altitude. I t was perfectly round, about 30-40 feet in diameter, brown like a basketball with no seams, it had no windows and it made no sound.  It looked like a dull brown ball, was completely smooth and devoid of any features.   What I saw was a silent brown ball slowly moving across the valley heading due south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There wasn&#39;t another person within a hundred feet of my location so there was no way to point it out to anyone else.  I may have been the only person to notice it.  Apparently whoever or whatever was in the thing was checking out the large crowd of people on the ground beneath it.  It took less than a minute for it to cruise past then suddenly it took off at high speed and disappeared into the distance gaining altitude as it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I just blew it off. I was not particularly motivated to mention my sighting to anyone since when the subject of UFOs comes up most people roll their eyes and ask, &#34;What were you smoking before you saw it?&#34;   I wouldn&#39;t bring it up now except not quite a year later I got my real introduction to UFOs.  In May of 2006 I was being a tourist taking pictures of the Sundial Bridge in Redding, California.  That evening I loaded the pictures on my PC and while looking them over I noticed something in one photo that caught my attention.  It&#39;s just a bright spot in the photo but it is clear enough and distinct enough that I knew it was not simply a reflection in the lens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had no idea what it was but I was determined to find out if it was an anomaly or if the experience would repeat.  I went back to the same location and shot over 800 still photos with a Sony DSC-F828 digital camera.  I not only caught more of the bright objects, many of them, but I snapped another even stranger looking object that really got me into finding out what I had tapped into.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In August of 2006 I purchase a Canon GL-2 video camera. It has a 200x zoom and something called Frame Mode which treats each frame of video as a stand-alone jpeg rather than the interlaced images most video cameras shoot.  The still frames shot with the GL-2 are clear, sharp and jitter free.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To date I have over twenty hours of footage shot in a variety of locations that in my opinion proves without doubt that we are anything but alone in this universe.  There are four distinct objects that I find all the time. Some large and some unimaginably small, approximately .030&#34; in diameter.  The tiny ones are around by the hundreds at very close range.  I have video of them on my hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve made rudimentary communication with the small ones.  They obviously know I&#39;m shooting video of them.  They put on a display I can only describe as waving to me. I printed one frame of their formation and waved it in front of them and they repeated the wave at my request.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this to MUFON, actually met with the regional director in Portland, Oregon.  After showing him some of my footage he basically blew it off and brought up an image on his computer that he claimed was a &#34;real&#34; UFO. My video is all shot in daylight making the objects  clearly visible, not just blobs of light in a dark sky. His &#34;UFO&#34; video was nothing more than a tiny white light in a black sky. Oooo! I was unimpressed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO shows on television are mostly eye-witness accounts with no photos or videos to back them up. I&#39;ve seen better on You Tube. I have clear videos of objects that unless authority is truly hiding some serious technology from the public were not manufactured here. If you are interested in seeing clear video of objects that can fly circles around fighter jets and have flown circles around airliners in my video, look me up. If not I really don&#39;t care because I&#39;ve found the mainstream self proclaimed UFO hunters to be frauds working to hide the truth rather than expose it. If you are different let&#39;s talk.<n>

PD))  Hampshire UK sighting, multiple witnesses desire no contact.|6/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44448.html|195|ndxe200506| Hampshire UK sighting, multiple witnesses desire no contact<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feel free to pass this one on - I would appreciate you not sharing my email address, although all names mentioned here can be used, including my own. The witnesses are reasonably safe from identification.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 00:50 hours on the morning of Saturday, June 18th 2005, I ((name deleted--witness, male #1)) of the village of Fair Oak, Eastleigh, Hampshire, and two colleagues, who I am only permitted to describe as ((name deleted--male #2)) and ((name deleted--female)) were standing outside of their home close to the village center of Fair Oak, and involved in sky watching while idly discussing the stars and the activities and modus operandi of UFOs, when after mentioning to them three minutes earlier that &#34;sometimes, if you ask to see an object ... they sometimes comply,&#34; such an object did in fact appear - or seemed to appear as if on request.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared in sky, almost overhead, but clearly several miles up.  I&#39;m estimating three or more as it is difficult to estimate as the sky was very dark and no point of reference other than the sky was available.  It came in from the south-southwest, initially appearing as a brilliant and fast moving light source, I estimate as being about two milimeters in diameter as if judged by reaching out and pointing to it with my outstretched hand and finger (I am five feet, three inches tall for the record).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that we are familiar with astronomical, atmospheric and satelite activity here, and that particular night the sky was exceptionally clear and dotted with stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a second or two of making its appearance, the object suddenly bloomed brilliantly into a white point of light five times the brilliance of the brightest star (and to an estimated size of around four milimeters) and then after approximately half a second (having apparently gotten our attention) it dulled down considerably but remained in motion, on the same course and at the same speed. At no time did it display any evidence of being an aircraft either in motion, speed or lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then seemed to dull out completely and stop and take up position in the sky close to Orion&#39;s second star in the Belt of Orion where it seems to have remained for the remainder of the fifteen minute observation of the witnesses. The incident was terminated when we went inside. In the actual event, if the object, if indeed it was a UFO, was in sight for a grand total of between three to seven seconds before becoming lost in the starfield overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both witnesses, who have a casual interest in the UFO phenomenon, but no serious technical background in it were wildly impressed by the sighting and announced to me that they had never seen an aircraft perform like that. They were also impressed by the fact that following the incident, we saw not only a passing satellite - clearly cutting across the heavens - and a meteorite entering the atmosphere and burning up. Both objects performed as you would expect, and did not reflect any aspect of the fast moving light source which we witnesses. This drove home the unearthly quality of the sighting to the &#34;newbies&#34; who were my additional witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was highly impressed, it was almost as if my comments about &#34;asking to see something,&#34; were being acted upon, although this should be considered merely speculation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name of witness deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates a time of 05:00, but states that the sighting occurred at 00:50 hrs..

I was on the tail end of a cloudy sky (above me and to the East were clouds, a clear sky coming in from the west).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Directly over my head, I saw a sphere moving under the clouds horizontal to the earth. The sphere was a translucent orange. I stood up immediately wondering what it was. My first thought was that some kid must have lost a balloon, but soon realized the object was traveling far too fast and in a strait line. I later determined with a compass it was traveling in the direction of 135 degrees SE. I watched it until it faded out of site on the far side of the horizon which took only a few seconds. I could see other planes in the sky at various altitudes. All were much slower than the sphere. It must have been traveling at a very high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood out there on the patio trying to figure out what I had just witnessed and continued gazing up in the sky (this time looking for orange&#39;ish spheres). About 5 minutes after the first sphere, a 2nd sphere was spotted. This sphere was not directing overhead, but a distance to my East (maybe a mile). It also was traveling in the same direction as the first sphere and at the same apparent speed (same color). There was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued looking up in the sky for the next hour, but no other sphere was seen. This is the first time I&#39;ve ever witnessed anything like this. Wouldn&#39;t believe it if I had not seen it for myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These sphere&#39;s were definately &#34;not&#34; man-made. They were almost like an orange plasma ball of some type, except they traveled at a high rate of speed as though they had a distination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m still trying to figure out what they might have been. I have no clue.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was using my new Meade CaptureView 8x42 Digital Camera Binocular.  ((For full specs on this Camera got to: http://www.meade.com/manuals/TelescopeManuals/CaptureView/CV-5.pdf.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The settings were as follows;  mode=movie,size=2M(1600*1200), lighting=auto exposure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was observing the stars through the Meade I noticed what appeared to be a star moving in the sky.  I tried to focus and track this star or ufo?? (wasn&#39;t sure at this point).  I was moving from east to west trajectory.  I noticed that the object appeared to be speeding up then slightly slowing down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the Binoculars the object appeared to have  a yellowish tint to it.  The object appeared to be disappearing and appearing agian then was gone.  The entire time I was pressing the button on the Meade because I thought the camera was set in still-mode but apparently it was in movie mode (operator mistake).  What I was actually doing was starting and stopping the movie mode lasting about 8 secs each time.  I captured about 1 sec of what I believed to be the object on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a  4 yr military veteran and this was not a plane.You are welcome to have an image analysis to explain what the object is.<n>

AT AROUND 10:00PM, I WENT TO PICK UP A FRIEND. SHE WANTED TO TAKE HER CAR BECAUSE SHE WAS GOING TO LEAVE EARLY,SO SHE WAS BEHIND ME AS WE WERE DRIVING TO MEET SOME FRIENDS. AFTER DRIVING FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, I SEE AN OBJECT FLYING TWARDS MY CAR AND LOW. IT LOOKED LIKE AN AIRPLANE, BUT SIDEWAYS. IT WAS MOVING FAST AND I DIDN&#39;T HEAR ANYTHING UNTIL IT ALMOST HIT MY CAR. I SWERVED LEFT AND RIGHT THEN GOT TO A SAFE SPOT AND GOT OUT OF THE CAR. I WANTED TO SEE IF THE AIRPLANE HAD CRASHED INTO THE NEARBY BUILDINGS. NOTHING HAPPEND. IT DISAPPEARED. MY FRIEND ASKED ME IF I WAS O.K. AND I ASKED HER IF SHE HAD SEEN WHAT HAPPEND OR THE OBJECT AND SHE SAID NO. SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE LOOKED DOWN TO PUT A CD IN AND WHEN SHE LOOKED UP MY CAR WAS OUT OF CONTROL. LAST YEAR IN OCTOBER I SAW THAT SAME CRAFT, BUT ON T.V. I WAS WATCHING A UFO SPECIAL AND SOMEOME IN ANOTHER COUNTRY SAW THE SAME CRAFT AND WAS ABLE TO RECORD IT.

Then we saw what he saw. It was a round silver matalic color at first and then it turned bright yellow. Not sure if it was lit up like a fireball or if it was just reflecting the sunlight. It traveled very slowly from Northwest to Southeast. It went behind a cloud but you could still see the yellow shining through. It then came out of the clouds and continued in the same direction that it had been moving..still very slowly. The Bar B Q was done at about 7:18 pm so we brought it in the house. I then went out the front door and saw the object still slowly moving to the Southeast. I then came in and ate and went back outside but it was gone by then.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked out the window, into my back yard, and saw something yellow moving from behind the trees above the back street. I thought it was some kind of yellow bird, so I watched it as it came into view. When it came out from behind the trees I saw that it was disk-like in shape, and from where I saw it looked about two-three feet wide. It was just plain light yellow with no special markings or lights or anything. It was hovering a little lower than the power line but not directly under it and it gradually moved up higher above the power line. It moved slowly from the left to the right of my view, lightly bobbing up and down as moved. I watched it disappear behind more trees. My dad, my grandma, and other people in my family have all claimed that they&#39;ve seen UFO&#39;s. I&#39;m pretty sure I was the only one that saw it.

After the  five minutes it moved a little and sort of tilted on it&#39;s side and flew away very quickly. We hadn&#39;t realized that it could have been a UFO until later, when we actually started discussing what it could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

She pointed it out to me.  It appeared to be an all black cube, moving from north to south, just below a layer of cumulus clouds.  It was to the southeast of our site.  The side toward us was pulsing/flashing a code—blink, blink, blink, pause, blink, long pause, then repeated again and again.  It stopped its forward N-S motion, and slowly ascended into a cloud.  At the time there were several planes in the area, and also high flying birds.  It was not one of those.  It was difficult to judge the size of the cube, but I would say it was about the size of an airline fuselage.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am an amateur astronomer, but I usually view the sky in the early evening to about midnight. The milky way is just to the west of my house at this time of the morning.  As soon as I stepped onto my upper deck I began to gaze at the sky.  A flash of light is what originally got my attention.  When I focused on the spot just to the west of me,  I noticed three star like lights with the magnitude of about 5 1/2.  They were moving in perfect formation like a large 100 degree triangle pointing in the north to about 5 degrees maybe to the east. They seemed to be following the milky ways direction or they were atleast in that portion of the sky. They did not twinkle or vary from their formation.  They continued in their direction, northwardly, until they were lost in the distance. It took about 1 to 2 minutes for them to pass from almost directly above me to the horizon. I am not usually up at this time, but I know this is a popular time to view satellites and I have never seen one to know the difference between ufos and normal celestial objects that would be moving that way.  Another thing.  I could see stars inside the triangle so it was not one solid object.  It was like watching a small constellation move across the sky.  There was no sound of jets, but I live along side a noisy highway so there was some highway noise.  What made this seem so special was the way they moved with such precision together across the sky.  I think there is a logical explination for this, but would like to know if what I saw was a ufo. I don&#39;t know why I saw a flash of light first, or if that has anything to do with the formation.  It could have been a shooting star, but what a coincidence.  I live about 60 miles north of Houston so there is alot of air traffic and they go in that direction the most.  I think I have included everything to the best of my knowledge.  I hope it is relevent.  I am a christian who believes that if God included everything about our universe, the Bible would never end.  He lets us figure some things out for ourselves.  I believe we are the only humans with the ability to have the holy spirit in our hearts, but nature is an awesome thing.  God bless all the scientist and curious people reading this and happy researching. P.S.  On the 15th, two days ago we had a major black out over 10 counties lasting from 7pm to 1am.  I&#39;m sure if there is anything intellegant flying out in space above our atmospere this looked like some kind of signal.  Just a thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like when a firework shoots up and it bright green but it was just sittin there and rocking side to side very subtly. Also I noticed a police officer immediately pull into the parking lot ahead and another one go down a road ahead right under where the object would have been. The second I received my food and pulled out in the exact spot about a couple hundred to 1000 yards in front 100ft up where i had seen the lights there was nothing. On the way home from the restaurant I saw several state troopers and police vehicles parked in a lot outside of there cars talking with one another. I wonder if someone else might have seen this because it is a heavily populated area near Chicago.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked at it for about 20-30 seconds when I said to my mother &#34;look over there at all the lights, expecally the triangular one, what do you thing it is?&#34; She looked over at them and said that she did not know what it was. Then I told her that I was going to take a picture with my camera phone but as I went to get my phone and take the picture the lights looked at if they went out almost one to two at a time and were gone. I looked at a sign on the freeway to see where exectally we were on it so that when we went back by on the way back to San Diego on 6/19/05, I could look to see if it was possibly a building or something. However, on our way home on Sunday I looked out over the desert to see if there was anything and there was not. If anyone else saw these lights and know what they were please post a response.

The sky was clear, with stars throughout the sky easily visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately the eleven o&#39;clock position in the south, south-east sky, I saw what I thought was a triangle of stars, presumably part of a constellation, when I realized they were moving in unison towards the south, south-east. The three lights were shining steadily and unblinking. Their estimated brightness was between 3rd and 4th magnitude stars(probably closer to 4th magnitude.)  The object or objects made no noise that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were rather slow moving as compared to aircraft I have seen in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The triangle shape was that of an isosceles triangle. One light in front, the other two at the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate the distance between the two rear lights as approximately the width of the full moon disc. The distance from the rear lights to the front light was approximately twice the distance as that between the rear lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 60 to 90 seconds, the lights faded from view(Due to haze in the sky perhaps, as the front light disappeared first; the following two almost immediately thereafter.)  My spouse also witnessed the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

6/16/05 22:30|New Brighton|PA|Light|nearly one hour|Flashing, color-changing lights and explosions in the sky.|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44631.html|214|ndxe200506| Flashing, color-changing lights and explosions in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was telling my friend outside in his front yard of aan incident that occured when I was young of star-gazing and seeing a &#34;star&#34; that changed color.  Then he looked up and said &#34;kinda like that?&#34;  I was amazed to see the same type of bright color-changing light that I saw in nearly the same area and same position in the sky as when I was young.  My friend lives about a block away from the house that I was in when I saw it the first time.  We stared for a long time and viewed many color change patterns.  We saw yellow, green, blue, red, purple, and white lights come from the object.  After looking for a few minutes, he ran inside and got binoculars and we looked closely to confirm that it wasn&#39;t a plane (I dismissed this idea immeadiately because it stayed in one spot in the sky for a long time) or a radio tower light.  Both possible explanations were impossible because planes only have one or two color blinking lights and it was not attached to a radio tower.  Soon after this, we spotted another color-changing light below and to the left of the first.  I saw what looked like fiery explosions coming from both of the objects and they moved in the sky, going from point to point and stopping rather than moving as a plane would.  We decided to go inside because we were afraid, but I kept checking to see if they were still there.  About ten minutes later, one of the objects had disappeared.  then, the other one left also, but possibly not for good.  I&#39;m not going to say either of the objects landed because I cannot confirm this next part.  My friend was pacing up and down the street when I heard a sound behind him.  It sounded like a car went speeding directly behind him at over 100 mph. This would be impossible as his house is in a position where no car could accelerate that quickly.  He asked &#34;Did you hear that?&#34; and &#34;Did you see anything behind me?&#34;  I did hear, but I did not see anything behind him.  He then told me that when he heard the sound, it felt like something ran directly behind him.  It was so close, he said, that he could feel the wind from it.  I have no idea if this second incident has anything to do with the lights in the sky, but it certainly made us believe that we were in the presence of something unsual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Baldy<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not completely sure of the approximate time of the event, but i know it was between 10 and 11 at night. I was up in the mountains with a few friends of mine and we were celebrating the last day of school. The mountains were and still are, one of our common hang outs but that night was a little different because a new area was recently opened after construction was finished. We decide to go on the new path, which my two others were familiar with. We parked up on area that was the base of the road. We all got out of the and my two other friends began to walk towards the ledge of the cliff directly in front of them facing the interior of the mountains. I stayed at my current location and began to gaze at the sky as i do most every night. I turned about 180 degrees, facing the west, before abruptly stoping at the sight of something i had never seen before. It was a circular object, bright and luminesant. From my view point it appeared to be as big as the moon or maybe bigger. The object had to relativly close because of it size and no plane would safely fly at the elvation through mountains terrain  nor would need to be at the elevation. It was very bright and had a great radiance about it but no light was cast by it. It was a combination of colors but at the same time one solid color, consisting of white, yellow and orange. But before i could call my friends over to look at it, the object shot off at a speed and a velocity i have never seen before. It was very still for a short period of time then dissapeared in the same amount of time or shorter. I began to cheer and laugh because it was my very first U.F.O sighting. My friends gave me ridiculous conclusions of the objects identity, but all of them were nothing like what i saw. I see planes in the sky all the time when i am up there and none of them are that large and could move at speeds that fast. About a week later i was watching a documentry of the SciFi channel called Roswell: Startling New Evidence. As i watched the program, something caught my eye and luckly i taped it so i could go back and check it out. The topic of the section was about project blue book and they began to show different documents from the organization. The thing that caught my eye was that claremont california was listed in one of the documents, and next to it was a case file with a claim of seeing a description of the thing i view shortly before. I also was told by another close friend that he viewed the same thing as me on the same night from his bedroom. It was around the same time as my encounter and he described a loud noise at first and then silence. The object then hovered slowly over his home about three stories above. With these added encounters that are very similar to mine, i am happy to know that i am not the only one who has seen these un-identified objects and very egar on knowing its origins and seeing it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Correct time of the sighting is unknown to us.

The sky was almost cloudless, apart from a sparse, almost mist-like covering, extremely high up.   At first, I thought the items were two aircraft travelling together, as is often seen, and the sun seemed to be reflecting off the planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I realised that they were, in fact, stationary.  They also appeared far too high in the sky to be planes.  I called my husband to have a look.  He also observed them and thought that we should report it to the Airport (Birmingham flight path is above our house).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly took the binoculars outside to view the objects at closer range.  Through the binoculars I could see that both objects were flashing slowly from red to green to red, and so on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two spheres were visible in the sky for approximately half an hour and then completely vanished from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I have not previously taken a great interest in UFO&#39;s, my Mum is a subscriber to the MUFON magazine and a keen ufologist.  She informed me of a sighting reported around a similar time of year by railway workers in Coventry.  This spurred me on to report my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was sitting at the front of my garage with the door open and my, my huge speakers were on really loud playing Guns N&#39; Roses - Night Train, then the triangular shaped thing came from the sky, I&#39;m really just guessing it was triangular shaped because it was cloudy, and all i could see was the bottom half, but it angled in like a triangle. It was spinning kind of slowly, it had 3 bright blue lights under it, and it had blue lights moving around all over it, kind of how the white strips are on a microchip, but they pulseated, and i was petrified in my chair, i seriously couldnt move, I tried to get my camera but i was stiff in my lawn chair at the edge of the garage. then the blue lights under the triangle turned white for about the last minute it was there, then it made a loud tornado siren like noise and it dissapeared, then finally i was un petrified and i looked back at my cd player and it was steaming, i went back to open it and rescue my cd before it melted and the cd player was jammed shut!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.

I knew from the color of the light that this was no ordinary spotlight, it was a blueish color that reminded me of the new headlights on some cars but casted no shadow. Curious as to what it was coming from we all looked back at the same time and seen a bright bluish white light hovering (no sound) above the last house on Virginia AVE. which was less than 75 yards away. Before anyone could even think of something to say the spotlight flashed toward the sky and faded out as if it knew we had spotted it but the craft remained glowing. About 2 seconds later still baffled we watched the craft dart off to the north with unbelievable speed (literally the blink of an eye) and was gone. about 2 to 3 seconds later we heard a very loud boom like thunder although there wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky.

This sighting occurred roughly in June 2005. I was with a friend in the garden of my front yard of my house in Croswell, Michigan. It was late and we were enjoying the summer night when we saw an orb in the sky heading east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was darker night, and there were a few stars, but not many. My property is also obscured by many locust trees. The orb was very high. It left no trail and was intensely bright white with no other hues on the edges. It was a single orb, slightly larger than the stars and moving fairly slowly, though not obnoxiously slowly; so that when we first saw it we dismissed it as a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a plane, as it was too high and suddenly changed speeds. It went from a turtle crawl to traveling very quickly, within the distance of my driveway, which is short and circular. Then, as it came over us, since the garden is on the north east side of the house, it made an extremely abrupt 90 degree turn to the south. Immediately we were jumping up and down with excitement as I screamed: “It’s a UFO!” We then began chasing it, as the trees obstructed our view when it made the turn. As we ran into the backyard, towards the south, it made another extremely sharp 90 degree turn to the east, disappearing over the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Shortly after, orb 1 which had stayed in its position also extinguished its light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing more was seen until a week later when my wife also saw the same type of light outside of our living room window.  This sighting occurred at the same time of night.  Only one object was seen, but object was much closer to the house at about 15 feet away and 15 feet from ground.  Object moved from right to left approximately 10 feet distance with a curving right to left pattern.  My wife then hurredly left the scene and no further observation occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Objects appear to move at about the same pace and pattern as a bumblebee, size of object is hard to discern, but about the size of a large coin.  Intensity is very similar to optical type LED lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I looked up and right above me appears 5 lights The object filled the sky completely almost, and the object had bright lights, in a backwards V shape moving east.  The object moved extremely fast.  While moving there was no sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reminded me of a stealth, but we have no stealth bases in our area and there wouldn&#39;t be 5 bright lights.  I know if I come out publicly people will think I need to see a psych but I know what I saw.  The light were white, not the normal amber.  I could not see an outline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P. S.

I got off my lounge chair and walked over to the railing to check it out and off in the distance, was a light, much brighter than the stars around it and it was pacing our ship. I though it was just another cruise ship since we were in the cruise ship lanes down there but I continued to watch for acouple minutes when it shot up at a 45 degree into the sky faster then any jet or rocket could touch and then it just stopped. It continued to stay at this high altitude for a couple minutes,(by now a pretty large group of people have gathered all pointing and trying to offer explanations) After a few moments it crossed back 90 degrees and shot back across the sky, stopped for literally afew seconds and then shot straight up and out of sight. We talked about that experience with the other passengers and even the older folks all agreed, There is no way anyone  or anything from this world could have eccelerated at the speeds and literally stop completely. I&#39;ll never forget it .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our vantage point was from North Central Phoenix near Deer Valley Airport. The lights were very far off in the distance and low on the horizon. The first time they appeared there was approximately eight or ten of them clustered together. They were all amber in color with the exception of one red one. They were present for about two minutes before fading out. They appeared again further Southwest about 10 minutes later, but there were only two. They lasted again for about two minutes and faded one after the other. About two minutes later they appeared in the same location in the sky, but there were three of them which also disappeared after about two minutes one by one. They continued to appear in different quantities for quite some time as they moved further away. I my uncle and I did manage to get some pictures of them. I&#39;m curious whether any of the pictures will turn out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A huge triangular shaped craft passed over us slowly. It was pretty low and blocked out all the stars. There were lights in the 3 corners, but the rest was black. I don&#39;t recall it being very loud. I had a sense of peace and we just watched it, even tho we should have gone to get cameras. He was in shock, but I had sightings before, just not this close and unique. It was later that I learned others had seen the same triangle.

The fireball was just hovering over the ocean about a few miles from shore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds, little pieces of fire began to fall from the original fireball.  Then, as quickly as it appeared, it disappeared in the most peculiar way. The fireball expanded, contracted, and then just disappeared into thin air. There was no smoke, no other aircrafts in sight, there was not anything except for eerie silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were so freaked out that we left the beach and went home.  We discussed the possibilities of an airplane crash, military experiments, falling stars, but nothing seemed to make sense.  It also just so happens that NASA headquarters at Cape Canaveral is a short 45-minute drive from Melbourne Beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the news for days, waiting to hear some kind of mention of this bizarre incident.  We heard nothing.  I was provoked to make this report after two years because a good friend, who had previously heard my account in detail, called last night to tell me a friend of his just described a very similar event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event occurred even closer to The Cape and was observed by several other people and boaters, but was similar in its characteristics.  Apparently, this event began with an odd-shaped formation of light, and then proceeded to turn into a fireball before evaporating into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were also in this case, other aircrafts chasing the object.  Again, there are no reports of this strange happening anywhere!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am extremely interested in finding people who have witnessed similar occurrences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Around 6:30pm I looked out the window and saw a UFO flying from the front of the plane and slowly passing by.

What was really striking was how flat it was and no sign of anything that looked like a cockpit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object flew very close, probably two plane length away from the plane. The passenger seated in front of me and I continued to watch the object go by until we could not see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I departed the plane, I asked the pilot what type of plane that passed our plane.  He said what plane?  I said, around 6:30 pm, it passed right in front of our plane.  He said he did not see it and anyway he was sure the tower was had their eye on it.

I have good vision and I tried to get an accurate view of the craft before it simply dissappeared.  It looked to me like a US missle...but it wasn&#39;t since it was just hovering about...I&#39;d guess a mile away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the local station, WLOS, and they reported no military operations were in progress.

It wasn&#39;t too hot, so I don&#39;t think it was a mirage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at it almost in awe...and suddenly I heard a strange sound.

Realative diameter would be the same as a dime held at arms length. the dark circle was motionless and appeared very suddenly in an area i had already been looking and did not see how it apeared it was suddenly just there. it was so dark and round with no light reflection that it looked like a literal hole in the sky. after about 20 or 30 seconds I witnessed a much smaller object move from the dark circle and move at high speed directly to the south. the smaller object was bright white or silver in color with a high ammount of reflection from the sun which was behind me. the smaller object moved to the south east untill it was out of site, i turned my attention back to the larger dark circle and it was still there motionless for several seconds longer, i took my eyes off of it for just about 3 to 5 seconds to attempt to use my video camera which I forgot i had next to me on the bench.  when I could not see the dark circle through the viewfinder I looked with my naked eye to make sure i had the camera at the right angle, but when I looked up it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dark circle stuck out very well against the blue sky which I had a good area of view of but could not see it anywhere, it was gone as suddenly as it came. and i regret I did not see how it functioned to come and go. was it a hole that closed up? or a craft that accelerated quickly or turned on some kind of optical stealth? who knows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the difference in size between the large dark circle and the small shiney object was equivalent to a boweling ball and a small marble<n>

From my vantage point it appeared to be at about a 40 degree angle from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved across the sky it passed over the highway in front of us. Its profile I can only describe as flat, like a pane of glass. As it passed by it rolled toward us and revealed its shape, which appeared as that of a diamond.

I saw something similar a week later, but haven’t since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The two witnesses in this case are well known to our Center, and we consider them both to be unusuall capable observers, and exceptionally reliable.

There was colored lights along the bottom of the craft. The colored circleted all along the bottom of it. The colors were green, orange, yellow, pink, and more colors I cant reall remember it was last year. I could feel a stange presence about it well maybe because it was a UFO.

As it passed in front of me, some minutes later, it instantly changed from white to &#39;baby asprin&#39; orange and kept its pace up the foothills in a northward direction until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since my camera didn&#39;t work right I didn&#39;t get a picture until it was only an orange dot in the distance.

My first reaction was that it was a lightning bug. The twinkle of light pulsed again but this time it had significantly progressed towards the northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became very focused on it now and watched very close for it to happen again.  And it did do so five or six more times before it exited my horizon to the northeast. The pulse of light was consistently not very bright and looked more like a &#34;thin rod&#34; that I can best describe. It was hard for me to judge its altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The initial pulse that I thought was a lightning bug seemed to be just above roof top level. But as I focused on the remainder of the occurrence I realized I could not accurately determine its altitude. The whole event took less than three or four seconds at which time it had gone from horizon to horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a pretty clear night, a fairly bright moon in the western sky, to my back and city lights, (O’Fallon, IL) slightly illuminating the north/northeast horizon. I guess it could have been a meteor but none like I&#39;ve ever seen. It appeared to be traveling at a &#34;level altitude&#34;. It did not appear to ascend or descend. It was traveling to fast to be any known type of conventional aircraft that I&#39;m aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Pulsing lights in the night sky can be tumbling boosters in orbit.  However, they do not travel from horizon to horizon in four seconds.  They usually proceed across the sky at approximately 1 degree per second.  PD))<n>

We had an encounter a mile from our parents house. It was pitch black so we didn&#39;t have a view of the ufo. The only thing we could see were its lights. There were 6 of them, blinking in about a 40 foot arc. We saw the first light, then the second, and then the first would dim as the third came on. This pattern continued across the visible lights, with a few seconds where we couldn&#39;t see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was straight ahead of us, less than 100 yards. It hovered perfectly in place with no sound. Which is something that humans don&#39;t have the technology to do at such a short distance. It hovered around 60 feet off of the ground. This continued for about 5 minutes, and then the lights were gone. I&#39;ve never seen it again or anything capable of doing what it did in my life. I hope my description was detailed enough.<n>

The two lights pulsated back and forth between each other while one would dip down slightly as the other rose and then the other would dip down and the other would rise. The lights were present in the same location for about 5 minutes then one at a time they faded out. At 10:54pm the lights appeared again; this time there was three of them. They pulsated from left to right in a row parallel with the ground. I watched them again for about 5 minutes as they moved from North Phoenix over to approximately Peoria and then on to Sun City or Surprise so close to the ground that they were barely above the street lights.

What I saw changed my life, and i will take a lie detector to prove it.  It was about 9 to 10 at night and it just got done storming... I worked with my mother and brother in a self ran janitoring company...  We left our house.. about 6 blocks from our house is a gas station to gas up before work..  Taking our normal path ((which i can go more in to the route if needed.)) another person a friend of mine was along to help us at work that nigh. We were driving a geo metro, a small car I was in the left side of the car..  My friend next to me in the back seat..  My mother driving and my younger brother was in the front seat. the distance between our home and the gas station is grid like city blocks, and right next to the towns broadway... this was not a low populated are..we live on third so.. once we hit 6th street i was looking up in the sky and saw the cloudes where glowing..not enough to make me thing it was something in the sky i thought it was a effect from the storm.. as we drove between street 6 and 7th I was watching this cloud when something starts to lower out of it... It was one of them traingle looking ufo&#39;s.. what was crazy was how close it was... for a mila second i couldn&#39;t believe what i was looking at cuz ... it was so close if i had a crappy hand gun or a really good sling shot i could hit it. it had a spot light like thing on each point of the traingle and the lights moved indepent from the others.. like they were searching from something... i yelled to the car.. LOOOOOOOOOOOKKK.. (( hehe. what else are you supposed to do when something like that happens)) anyhow.. my mother and brother turned quickly and looked right out.. we slowed the car down we had to be only going 10 at the time anyhow putting my head out the window I trying to get a bet look. the spooky part was... this thing was almost a block long.. hovered in the air pointing the direction we just drove from... and made no freaking sound a! t all..I can&#39;t explain to you when you see something almost a block long with no sound, just floating in the air.. its hard to even fathom..my brother and mother were looking at it... but the funny part was my buddy was text messaging and still to this day didn&#39;t see it ... but he will say that we were freaking out. Now as my head is hanging out the back window for sight the light in the front points right at me.... I never been scared.. like really scared in my life.... but when that light hit me I was waiting for something bad to happen.. but it was more like they saw us.. and kinda released they were being watch.... the traingle dropped down about 2 feet in the air.. and silently took off.. toward broadway.. bout 7 blocks the direction we came... and moved so damned fast i say it covered... 7 blocks in 2 seconds.. and went back up in to the clouds... mind you when they shot off like that... no force or sound was felt. I am a gamer by nature, and a ufo skeptic.. my brother is a lot the same.. and my mother is the type that she is so damned fightful of something like that she never make it up.  Im not the type of man who makes stuff up.. actually if you ask my friends the thought of this stuff wigs me out but i saw it.. and the truth matters.. im sure i could never tell anyone anything and some day if there are ufo&#39;s or miltary planes.. or what ever they are out there we will know.. but what i saw was the truth.. take this account do with it as you please.. i just hope it helps<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

What we saw were 3 oval-shaped objects, of uniform size and description.  These ovals were somewhat bright.  They would appear in a bowed line, then disappear only to reappear in a triangular formation.  They would then disappear and reappear again in a line but slightly &#34;dancing&#34; in a snake-like manner.  This cycle continued for 5 or more minutes, with no set pattern as to how they would appear.  However, the patterns that the object or objects made appeared to be equal and precise.  In addition, while they were visible, the &#34;tube&#34; device that carries the transaction from the driver to the teller seemed to not be working as we had a difficult time getting the machine to work until they were gone.  This was witnessed by me, a 37-year-old mother of two, my two children, both boys ages 13 and 8, and my son&#39;s 14-year-old friend.  My 30-year-old sister-in-law was in the front seat next to me, but she was unable to see this object.  We are not sure why as it stayed within the same basic area (disappearing and reappearing within the same general area and the area wasn&#39;t very large.  The rest of us were able to view the show for 5+minutes.  This was at 3:15 in the afternoon and the skies were otherwise clear<n>

Diameter Smaller than a House; thickness much less than the Diameter; basically, shaped like a thick saucer circle-shaped w/large rounded edges.  Unable to see the Bottom of the Saucers or any type of propulsion mechanism.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Very far off in the distance; west of my home, perhaps over Ontario or Chino, California.  Standing in my backyard stoop it moved southwest at first - movement seemed slow and not blatantly noticeable until all of a sudden I had to walk down the back steps to see it beyond my neighbors large tree and then it seemed to move northwest so that I had to reposition myself to the kitchen window to see it again.  The whole occurence lasted aproximately 30 minutes with the object eventually moving west beyond my line of sight.  While still watching the object, an early morning scheduled flight (I&#39;ve seen and timed it before while letting my dogs out in the backyard to do their business)crossed west to east just south of my home confirming what I was seeing was not an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife pointed out an object flying in the sky above us, and about 7 of us saw it (four adults and three children).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a boomerang/flying wing shape, and it was very large, larger than any craft that I have seen or am familiar with.  It was flying slowly across the sky approximately south, and it had a unique engine sounds, similar to powerful jet engines, but quieter.  The body was dark and barely visible, and it had small blinking red lights across the length of the craft (approximately 7 or 8 lights).  The lights appeared to blink without a pattern, which seemed kind of strange, and they did not resemble the lights normally seen on the commercial aircraft that fly over regularly.  There was (what appeared to be) a fighter aircraft that flew by a bit west and somewhat behind the craft.  We assumed that it was an escort, as it did not appear to be in pursuit, although it was clearly following/staying close.  It would occasionally bank and maneuver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strangely, about 10 minutes later, another similar craft flew over going in the same direction.  This one was further away from us, but it also appeared to be smaller.  It had similar lights and appeared to have a similar body shape, although it was difficult to tell.  It also emitted the same jetlike sounds. A few minutes later, a fighter aircraft flew back in the opposite direction and then banked east and flew off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are in a flight path of Burbank Airport, but there were no other commercial jets flying over at the time.  We are also about 50 miles from Edwards Air Force Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crafts appeared terrestrial (as opposed to the object I reported in November of 2003 over Valencia, CA, which was extremely out of the ordinary).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an executive for a major financial services company, and I had considered myself to be more or less skeptical until 2003.  I feel strange reporting something for a second time, since I had not seen anything unusual through my entire life until then.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/13/05 20:34|Seattle/Tacoma (between)|WA|Unknown|4 minutes|Shiny distant metallic silver object through binoculars at sunset...Associated with a rising black balloon-like object.|6/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44393.html|279|ndxe200506| Shiny distant metallic silver object through binoculars at sunset...Associated with a rising black balloon-like object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While eating outside I looked to the NW (the direction of the setting sun on this mostly clear day under weak surficial high pressure) and noted interesting cloud fomations that I looked at through binoculars.  Much to my amazement from 2034p-2038p through the binoculars I noted a silver object (elv. 30 degrees at 285 degrees, i.e. close to the horizon to the WNW) of undetermined shape far in the distance moving VERY slowly (one twentieth the speed of a plane) and either slowing its motion or stopping every few seconds.  It was going so slowly that I really could not tell its intended direction, if any, perhaps N to S.  It was so far away that I could not make out its shape with ordinary 7X binoculars.  It was metallic silver and shiny and would have irritated the eyes if it had been closer.  Note: It was SO SMALL that I would NOT have detected it if I had not already been looking through binoculars at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2038, a large black balloon-like object probably closer to me began moving upwards with the prevailing surface winds towards the object! (SW to NE under weak surficial high pressure).  The two objects never came in contact.  Then at 2038p I stopped to take notes thinking the silver object would just stay there and cooperate.  Well, of course, UFO’s never do, and by 2039p I could not find either object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conclusion:  While the silver object is a UFO since it has no explanation, the black object that was clearly below 5,000’ may have been a balloon escaping from the wealthy citizens who hold summer parties down the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I’m sure there are thousands of distant shiny silver objects reported to you that really have no significance.  Many are probably airplanes with the rising or setting sun.  However, in this instance the object was more or less stationary for 4 minutes.  But it is certainly possible that it was an airplane departing to the WNW at 285 degrees and catching the setting sun.  Yet four minutes is a long time (2034-2038).  I have some experience in meteorology yet none in aviation...and I certainly know that atmospheric illusions occur at sunset and sunrise.  I would hope to think of an alternative explanation for this yet for now it remains a UFO.  The black balloon adds interest, but I can’t say for sure if it really was a balloon from a party or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE:  Also note that Jeff Rense is no longer with Talk One Radio Networks as reported on your site.

I live in the Sanbernardino mountains and the skys are very clear with very little light polution. Outside my bedroom I can see millions of stars at night. There is a large cedar tree about 25 feet from my window that blocks some of my view. As I woke up to see this object, it was very peculiar because of it&#39;s size. I see jet plane, helicopters, etc. all the time up here and can tell the difference between them very easily. I have also had many encounters with UFO&#39;s in my past and I know what to look for and what many of the types look like. As this bright white object traveled, it went about a slow as a satelight moves. I see many of them also but this light was much bigger and was a lot lower in the horizon then satelights. This object faded out a few times then got brighter. Just as it went behind the big cedar tree, I lost sight of it for a while but because I knew this was no ordinary object, I got out of bed to go out on the deck to see it emerge from the other side of the tree. I was tempted to wake up my wife but I didn&#39;t want to lose sight of it, so I stayed there watching it. Now as it emerged from behind the tree, it did something very common of UFO&#39;s. It stayed bright and I could make out it&#39;s shape as a circle with no haze or glow around it. It was completely circular and contained it&#39;s brightness within it self. It was much brighter then the stars and the brightness was steady and not twinklely like stars. Then, it began to dim and them brighten up again then dim. Now its was fading, not moving fast, just fading until it completely disapeared within a second right before my eyes. I watched to see if it would appear again down further, but it didn&#39;t. It just went out of sight. But before it completely dissapeared, it faded into catregories of brightness. The more it faded the more I could see it was completely round until it dissapeared completely, almost as if it went from very bright to a transparency with just the outline of the circle about it. It was strange but very exciting at the same time. Also this UFO made no sound what so ever. I am an avid UFO watcher and always look up to ketch a glimps of one of these wonders. For some reason, I was woke up at the right time to witness one of these UFO&#39;s. This will be the 4th UFO that I  have seen since I&#39;ve lived up here in the last 11 years. MY son has seen 2 of them also. We often go outside at night to look for them. This is one of my favorite past times. I have also written a full report of a very close encounter of the fourth kind that happened to me in 1963. There were many witnesses to this particular UFO that made the headlines in the local papers. I was 14 at the time and a UFO actually gave me a ride in it&#39;s craft. I talked to it&#39;s occupants and can veryfy every bit of it! If you would like to read this account look up 1963, New Kensington, Pa. I am 54 now and own a catering business called ((name deleted)) in Southern California.

It was a pretty clear night with just maybe a little bit of haze and no sight of any air traffic in the sky. So after about a half hour  saw the first flash in the south east sky it was yellowish green in color and at first I thought I had just seen a lightning bug. so I watched for it again but wasnt there 5 sec. later i seen it again this time closer to me and I could tell that it was not a lightning bug it was way way to high in the sky. It flashed two more times right after that in diffrent but close prox. from the last and when the last one flashed I saw a very dim light come from the flsah moving north until I could not see it any more. I then got my cell phone and checked the time it was 2:30 a.m. After seening that and woundering what it was I found my self glued to the sky and about 5 mins. later I see a small fast moving jet of some kind coming from the same direction as the flashes of light from the south east and heading the same course as the flashes south east to northly curve.  Jet was like I said small and had a red light on the bottom with a wight strobe and near the tail end of the jet on the top a yellow strobe and a orangish glow like fighter jets have. I checke my cell phone it was 2:35 a.m.<n>

The evening was dead quite when the craft was spotted. My son was the first to have seen it. Then, my wife and myself. At a first glance it appeared to me as a regular plane in the distance with possibly landing gear down creating twinkling lights that veried from red to white. However, within a split second I realized that it made no noise and it was enormous in size realtive to the mountains that it was slowly moving past. Then, an immense roar seemed to propel it heading East. When it turned it was difficult to conceive the overall size. Also, as it turned it revealed more lights appearing in a cheveron or &#34;V&#34; shape. I believe it had to be moving very rapidly, but not as one might perceive when something of normal appearing size moves. I say this because anything of such immense proprtions would have to have a significant speed to propel it out of view in such a short time. We were unable to make out an outline. However, when it turned I ran from the top of the road, down into my house. I grabbed a digital camera and shot some video. I thought the video was worthless. With my naked eye I could faintly see the craft, so I thought the camera was not picking-up anythiong of value. After reviewing the video on my computer, I was embarrassed because I sounded rediculous with excitement. I even phoned the local police that night because I thought for sure we could not have been the only people to have seen it. Recently, after finding this site I saw a picture that had lights that seemed similar. A cheveron or &#34;V&#34; type object, so I took another peak at the video. I ran through the video frame by frame. Frames of the craft appear insignificant, bouncy, and have nothing to compare relative size, but two frames one is able to identify a string of lights. What is viewable could be the back of the craft, as it had already turned towards the South/East towards Mojave. I took that picture, using some simple photo tools, I enhanced the brightness of the object to try to see an outline. I will submit the picture to you. I am not a UFO buff, I would say it had to be military. However, due to the immense size of the craft puts a immense question mark inside my brain. Why so damn big! I was USAF for six years. I saw a lot of aircraft. While I was stationed at Edwards AFB it was not uncommon to see the B-2 Bomber flying around as we played golf, but this was no B-2. In size there was no comparison and while the B-2 has deceptive lines in flight it is not silent. I&#39;m still bewildered.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects were flying in a perfect shape of a triangle, the middle one slightly higher than the other two.  We brushed them off as planes and continued driving.  About 30 seconds later the three objects seemed to have moved hundreds of miles in seconds and were now directly behind the car and what seemed as only a few miles up in the sky.  They were a steely gray color, no lights.  We all three turned around and were terrified as the objects seemed to be getting closer.  We drove as fast as we could (80mph down an old gravel road) the remaining mile to our house.  When we reached the house the objects were still in the sky and seemed to have followed us.  We ran into the house to tell our parents.  When we came back outside the objects had seemi! ngly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Then it dropped down at such an incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first my mom thought that it was some kind of light that was behing the mountains until it zipped right onto our leftside.  Then it receded its shape into an ellipse thinning itself out then disappear behind the mountains.  Then it would zip back up into view above the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would constantly change shape. this went on for about 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I&#39;d had a very strange dream that had woken me up. I turned on the light in my bedroom and lay there getting my wits about me.  I then got up  and went downstairs to use the bathroom and to get a drink of water. As I passed through the dining room in the dark, I glanced out the windows and saw a bright blinking white light about 100-150 feet over the road.  I continued into the kitchen, then bathroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came out, I stopped and got a drink of water out of the refrigerator.  As I walked back through the dining room, I glanced out of the windows again and walked to the window to get a better look at the blinking light that was still there and saw the light moving from over the road towards the field between my house and my neighbor&#39;s. I stood there for a minute or two trying to figure out what it was when these blue bubble-like spheres began to fall from the light towards the ground in the field about 200 ft. from the house.  They seemed to tumble down and then sort of float a little way before landing on the ground.  They glowed bluish with a gold-like color interior, sort of translucent.  I think that about twelve or fifteen had fallen before I became very agitated as to what to do about it.  I then ran back into the kitchen and out into the enclosed porch off the kitchen facing them and turned on the outside lights on the porch roof that shown in the direction of the field. As I returned to the dining room windows (I looked at the kitchen clock and it was 11:22 p.m.) to see if I could see anymore of the bubbles or the blinking lights and I could see nothing.  I left on my outside lights all night long and didn&#39;t go to sleep until about 3:30 A.M  The next morning I walked the field but could find no evidence of what I had seen the night before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen several strange things in  the sky here for several years now, but nothing as up close as this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a professional person and am very sensible, with a sound mind.   This incident was just too strange, even in light of the last several years&#39; sightings, some of which I have reported to you. Many I have not, though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was dead calm.  VERY HOT.  There was absolutely no sound at all.   None from the object of light in the sky or the bubble-like spheres.  None in the entire area at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have drawn a likeness of what I saw.<n>

Odd Dark object flying from Dartmouth out of Harbour, not a bird!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This would be my second viewing of what I would call a UFO sighting. I once sighted something out of the ordinary here in Halifax while walking in Point Pleasnt Park after hours when the park was closed. Although you are not allowed to be in the park after hours a few friends of mine liked to play childish games in the dark with flashlights, usually in the fog. I was facing I believe south looking over the North West Arm ( a body of water in the Halifax Harbour ) Where something caught my eye, This had been back in 2003, at the time I didnt think too much about it, mainly because I didnt want to get caught by my friends. The time was about 11 PM and the night was foggy. A blue blob moved from avove me from the north side of the water to the south in a quick swift motion. It went pretty fast. Becasue it was foggy i didnt see any shape to it just an odd blue color, like looking into a CD or something. But this was not the report I was looking to submit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two nights ago I was awake and feeling bored, I went out for a walk down the waterfront here in Halifax and sitting on the boardwalk near the Metropolis building, or what I refer to it as, I seen an odd dark spot move across the sky from the dartmouth area to the harbour entrance. I&#39;m guessing it went East to west. No sound and not moving fast. No lights and no real shape. really it looked like a huge blackish shaddow moving across the sky. I did have my Digital camera with me and I did manage to capture a video of this event but when I tried viewing the video on my PC I seen nothing in the video. I was not going to say anything about this sighting becasue people dont seem to believe in UFO, but what I seen 2 nights ago was not a plane, it had no lights and no shape, Was not a bird, only seaguls fly at night and I&#39;ve seen my share of them flying here at night, plus they would show up on this video. My video is a mere 20 seconds long becasue it was done on my Digital cam.. Anyone else see anything like this?<n>

To my eye it was the size of the stars it flew between.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing is that in the middle of my viewing it flashed brightly for a second or two. The flash was about 10 times the size of the object. The object kept traveling at a quick rate of speed in the same steady direction until out of eyesight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was very clear, it had stormed here in Rockford about an hour or two before and the clouds had gone by the time I was outside.

I woke up at around 12:00am from some sort of noise that is too hard to describe. For the first time in as long as i have lived in my house (5 years), i opened my blinds. Instantly i saw a disk or saucer glowing with white lights in the sky. It must have been very distant because it was very small. The lights would become very bright and then dim so that it was invisible. This went on for about 30 minutes, while i tried to figure out how to turn the flash off of my parents new digital camera. I feel ashamed that i didnt wake them up upon this event in order to perserve my pride. I am an Honor student at Stanton College Preparatory HighSchool. # 1 magnet school in the nation. That said, i still dont believe in UFO&#39;s; but i have seen many aircrafts fly by my location, this one was floating in the same position almost glowing for that period of time. I did not take any medication of any type, nor have i ever taken a drink or illegal substance in my entire life. (I am 16). Thank you, i hope i will find someone else in my area who has also recalled this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a pretty nice night, kind of warm, hardly any clouds. We were standing by my house when I seen something flash out of the corner of my eye. I turned, and seen an ovalish-silver thing floating in the sky. I said, &#34;Do you guys see that silver thing?&#34; both of my friends said they did see it. We kind of watched it for a few minutes, not knowing what it was. It didn&#39;t make any sound, there was no smoke trail or anything. It looked like as if it was flashing every now and then. I ran into my house, got my video camera and told my mother to come outside to see this thing. I filmed it until it dissapeared into some pink clouds with a flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went to the park down my street and stood in a soccer field trying to see it. We were there for a good 20 minutes, when we decided to go to a much bigger farmer&#39;s field to try and see it. Well about half a block away from the field, one friend spotted it again. It was going much slower and a few times it looked like it stopped moving. I started taping again, but it was farther away and was dissapearing. We filmed until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Also, I am in South Carolina, and people around here aren&#39;t exactly open-minded or welcoming about things like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t remember the exact date, but I do know it was one afternoon, around 4:00 pm, in early June. The weather was not too sunny, but it was not overcast either. It was mild, pleasant weather that day.  I was home with my now husband, our infant daughter, and our then-roommate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband stepped outside onto our front porch to have a cigarette, and I started to follow him out. We were standing on the porch talking when I happened to look up at some birds that were flying over some trees approximately 200 feet away from us.  Right at that moment, a shiny metal object came into my view.  It wasn&#39;t close to the trees; from what I could tell it looked like it was at least as high up as a small airplane.  Like I said earlier, an airport is not far from my house, so I&#39;m very accustomed to seeing (and hearing) planes, big and small, fly over the house all the time.  But this shiny object made no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband saw it as well, and we called our roommate out to look at it. It looked at first liek it was shiny, metallic, and saucer-shaped. It wasn&#39;t moving at all. It was just hoovering where it was.  Then after a few seconds of just hoovering there, it started rotating and spinning, in alternating speeds. It looked like it was spinning in all directions, upside down, sideways, and diagonally. It looked as if the entire shape of the object was changing with every spin. It did this for a few minutes, then it would move over to the right and hoover a few minutes, and then it would move higher up, hoover for a minute. All the while there were birds flying around in these tress by our house, and that&#39;s when I could tell that it must have been pretty high up in the air. (Because in proportion to the birds, it looked very small.) After about ten minutes, it just slowly moved away, towards the west. I have no idea what it was, but I have never in my life witnessed an airplane or balloon of any kind, behave in a manner like that. To my knowledge, no aircraft or balloon, can hoover in one spot, and completely spin! , rotate , and change shape. And if there were such an aircraft, I highly doubt that the general public would be made aware of it, nor, would it be made visible in plain daylight, in suburban areas.  All three of us saw it. There&#39;s no doubt in my mind that it was not something that the airport knew about. I don&#39;t know if we are the only ones who saw it, but I still keep my eyes peeled every single day, in case it ever comes back. If it ever does, I&#39;ll be ready with a video camera next time. I&#39;d love to know if anybody else saw this in this area. Thanks for your time, and again, I&#39;m sorry it took so long for me to report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The gleam caught my eye and I then started to follow it. The object seemed to have sharp corners was chrome in color/reflectivity and had a tumbling motion as it headed North/Northwest from a Southeast origin. Object was moving extremely fast, too fast to be mistaken for mylar balloons. It was at a speed consistant with military jets seen at an airshow 2 weeks prior, but the shape was not an aircraft. The only way it can be described would be is that it looked like a shard of glass in its shape, tumbled like it was out of control, but never lost altitude and was moving extremely fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned my head and saw an aircraft and, wanted to see exactly what kind of aircraft it was, I turned on my side to get a better view. It was flying near east and the sky was cloudless for the most part. I found the flight path to be very odd so I began to think it was a bird but i realized that it was much too big. Its path was straight, although seeming to have some angualar velocity that was up. The most striking thing about the object that I noticed was the smoothness of the flight. Although one would not consider other aircraft to be unsmooth, this had a striking quality to it. It was triangular, exact detial I could not see. Its color was dark, although I could not tell exactly. It moved quickly from what I could tell given its relative size and height. It moved toward the tree line, although never reaching it, disappearing within an instance into the cloudness area of the sky. All of this occured in about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was looking out the open window of the truck as anyone would when I looked up to see what I thought might be a plane in the sky.  What struck me as odd was that it was going very slowly and the lights didn&#39;t resemble those of a jet or plane.  I saw 4 brilliant lights alligned perfectly in a square formation, moving slowly in the sky, southwest of where we were.  I asked my friend to stop and ran out of his truck to a nearby yard to see it more clearly (he did not come out of his truck because he was bewildered at why I suddenly yelled at him to stop and got out of the vehicle).  Staring up at the sky, I was intrigued to see that the &#34;object&#34; was in fact moving slowly, but not consistently.  It would move (in my field of view) about 3-4 inches across the sky, then would stop suddenly, then move again.  It then moved the OPPOSITE way back and flew very quickly out of site into the dark sky- trees and the houses then blocked my view.  At that point, I struggled to see it again, but I could not.  My friend had gotten out of my truck to ask me what had happened, and I told him the above, much to his disbelief.  I SWEAR that happened.  No drugs, not drunk, it was unbelievable, intriguing and frightful all at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We stopped and watched as the objct rose higher until we could hardly see it. By then it was a small light in the sky, but we could see it was traveling in large circles in the sky. It continued to make the circles for about 2 min. when another light appeared (which may have been something coming from the craft), it also began making circles, but in the opposite direction of the other one. They continued this and then just went away. Unfortunately we did not have any vidio cameras or cameras to catch them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
6/9/05 23:00|Carlisle|PA|Unknown|15 min.|I stepped outside for a ciggetett. As I looked up at a star, I noticed flaches of light at different points around this particular star|6/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44418.html|312|ndxe200506| I stepped outside for a ciggetett. As I looked up at a star, I noticed flaches of light at different points around this particular star.  A few jets flew over head with strobes flashing. The jets were much lower than the flashes of what I saw. It seemed as if the objects were manervering for position. Then flashes of light were seen eminting from eacj craft.  It seemed as though they were shooting at east other. Sometimes one would (fire) the the other one.  At other times both would fire at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was very much higher than anything of referance. A few commercial jets flew over but at a noticible much lower altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was reminded of the bible, the book of Ephesians, where it says that we wrestle not against flesh and bollod, but against spiritual wickedness in the heavenly places. Again in the Book of Revelation it speakes of Michael asnd His angels fought against the Dragan (Satan) adn his angels, and they prevailed not, but were cast down to the earth.  I saw a streak as lightning finaly zoom across the sky. seeming to become lower as it passed out of sight to the west behing the mountain.  Aliens are not from another world... but are fallen angels warring against God.  This activity will increase very soon. All will see &#34;signs in the sky&#34;.

I looked up at Jupiter. I am very familiar with the night sky as I have enjoyed amateur astronomy all my life. I own a nice telescope and have been observing Jupiter and Saturn within the last week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up to see Jupiter I was very surprised. There were two of them! This really threw me and confused me. The reason I say there were two Jupiters is that both objects looked identical in magnitude, size and even color. Jupiter is a yellowish-white to the eye. I knew one of these objects could not be Jupiter, so I watched carefully for movement. I did not see any movement or seperation whatsoever. Both objects were completely still in the sky. I noticed that the northern-most object had a fainter star-like object very close by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I was utterly confused. I did not know what this second object was. I stared at both for about 15 seconds (I wasn&#39;t sure which was the real Jupiter). Then I noticed that the one to the north started to dim out as did it&#39;s companion. The sky is clear tonight, no clouds at all, very good visibility. This object was about 5 degrees or a fist held at arms length north of Jupiter. It took about 15 seconds to dim. I could still see this object as a very faint star-like object for about another 15-20 seconds. Then I could see it no more. I watched for several minutes but did not see this object again. I came right in to make this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what this object was but it did not move at all the entire time I observed it. I am very familiar with aircraft and satellites. It did not make any sound whatsoever. There were no clouds. I could still see all surrounding stars the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I really thought it was swiftly travelling east over me in a direction to central London, however I then realised it was travelling vertically, a few seconds later in faded into the sky all logic points to the fact it may have entered orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate, elects to remain totally anonymous.

But this evening i received a call from my father and a number of my neighbours claiming they were looking at a UFO. They explained as being within the atmosphere, but pretty high up as they felt that it was infact about 100 KM&#39;s out towards Bass Strait. I continued to recieve phone calls from neighbours. And trust me, these are people from the most privlidged  suburb in Melbourne, and i believe that before tonight they weren&#39;t believers! They guessed the size to be anywhere between 5 - 15 football stadiums! With the flashing lights and everything. It was too far to get a photo, bit like taking a photo of an eclipse with a normal camera... i called a friend living 2kms east of my house, and he had a look out, and saw it, as did his family. However, he described it as a really big star with a disco going off on it! I called another mate who lives about 20 kms towards the UFO, but he dismissed it as bull shit and reckoned it was a US air force test on a new X35 or something... AVOL, NASSA? stuff like that, are these things that big??!! I found a sight on something to do with what he was on about, but they looked the size of ordinary fighter jets!<n>

The sighting occured when a fairly wide peak came into sight.  At this point, two people saw a gold or yellow colored saucer shaped craft, slowly decending towards their vehicle.  The UFO then stood idle for about ten second, and eventually ascended into the clouds, and never returned.  The witnesses then reported the sighting to a California State Patrol Officer, who told the witnesses that the craft was an airplane from the nearby airport.  The witness acknoledge this thought, but realize that the UFO was of a distinct saucer shape, unlike one of any known aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Craft was a triangle and had a reflective white light around the edges. The light was similar to the color of the stars in the sky, did not seem to be navigational in purpose. Extremely fast and did not trail any smoke or contrails. Aurora? Seemed to be at least at ten thousand feet but not more that about 30 thousand. Trying to guess at the size is tough, but I would say bigger than our B-1 but not as large as a football field.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I consider him a wise person, and will follow his suggestion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 8, 2005, I had just recived a phone call from my son that he had been involved in an accident on a road near a nearby lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was running out the front door and down the sidewalk to my car when I realized there was something coming out of a cloud.  I looked up and saw a huge triangular craft exit a cloud or something reddish brown like a cloud and it was straight up above me.  I was facing somewhat south as I headed to my car in the driveway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size and the silence of the craft stopped me in my tracks and for a second  I couldn&#39;t do anything but stare.  It came out of the north and was directly paralle to Interstate 540 in Lowell.  This meant it was headed in a southerly direction. The only way I can guess at the altitude is that it was about the altitude of a plane upon descent to the airport about 15 miles west of me.  That, or very shortly after lift-off altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound coming from it at all, and no strobing lights visible.  The shape was well defined triangle.  There were cream or light yellowed colored lights across the back or flat edge of the triangle and they went up towards the front point about three-quarters of the way.  The lights didn&#39;t extend all the way into the point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The width of it across the back edge appeared to be a football field or more perhaps.  I couldn&#39;t guess at the length because I was pretty overwhelmed at the size as it went over me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it long enough for it to go over several houses after mine, but it may have only been a minute or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not aware of any other witnesses, because I had to quickly go to my son&#39;s accident, but used enough time to run towards my front door screaming for my husband.  He ran out the back door of the house but it had already appeared to enter another clouded area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not talked with any of my neighbours except one who did not see anything that night.

I-10  I believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw in front of us, what seemed to be a glow on the ground, at 2 o&#39;clock from where we were positioned, and saw lights in the air, like balls of light, I&#39;m not sure, but maybe 100 ft up in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were around six of them, perfectly aligned with the road.  I was pretty freaked out, and so was my husband.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled into the last rest area before you hit Phoenix, and you could still see the lights. The lights looked as if they were stretched out for a couple miles or something. at the rest area, there were two we could distinctly see, I had my camera phone on me, and attempted to take pictures.  One, I believe came out, but the other did not. it just looked like a ball of light, nothing flashy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing photos of the Phoenix lights, I was amazed at how similar it was, but what I saw was slightly different.  6 lights in the air, one on the ground, (which was the first one we saw) and, these lights did not move, at all.  They stayed stationary, and then faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed at the rest area as long as I could, because I wanted to know if these light thingys moved.  I will be honest, I didn&#39;t see any movement.  I tried to look for some sort of form, and I did not see any.  I was looking for any clues besides it was a bright white light, so that I would have some definition to what I said once I confessed my report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sorry for not coming forward sooner.

I saw them only at a glimpse as they started fading out. I do not know how long they had been there. They were to the North and slightly West of my location. This would mean the lights were roughly over I-17 freeway and perhaps Carefree Highway. I have seen these &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; many times over the last couple of lights, so I continued to observe that portion of sky in case they would appear again. They did appear lower on the horizon; this time there was somewhere between 6 and 10 of them that appeared in a streak or straight line almost as if it were one that was in motion but only appeared in a series of dots of light. This second set of lights appeared about 5 minutes after the first set. The duration of this second set in a line formation was maybe 1 to 2 seconds. All of the lights in the second sighting were amber except for the last one which was red. They appeared from right to left at a slight angle from higher to lower (maybe 2 or 3 degrees off parallel with the ground). The lights were so low to the ground the second time that I could barely see them over the building to the North of this trucking yard. The first set of lights was much higher up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a dim light moving toward a known constellation. At first I thought it was a satellite (non blinking light just moving across the sky). I pointed it out to my girlfriend. As soon as she saw it it grew in size and brightness (brighter than Sirius on magnitude scale) and continued to move across the sky southeast. It remianed lit for approx. 5 seconds then dimmed back out and moved for another couple of seconds and then disappeared.<n>

It grabbed my attention because it was bobbing in the sky unlike a plane or star. It was moving up and down as it traveled south. As it went behind my neighbors tree in thier front yard I tried to keep my eye on it...finally when the light reappeared it was far off and very small and disappeared immediately. It was gone in probably 3 - 5 seconds. This is something I have never seen in my life. I love to watch falling stars and this was not one of them. I stayed outside for about 5 minutes trying to rationalize what I just saw and I saw several jets in the air with thier blinking lights just to tell myself this was something different; and it was.

As it moved at times the light was behind the object and I could see that it appeared to be a sphere with light behind it. It stayed in close proximity to where we first saw it and it never moved very quickly but it definitely moved while other objects in the night sky remained stationery. We watched it for over an hour then went on to bed. The next night June 8th we looked for it beginning about 2130 and didn&#39;t see anything, we checked again at 2300 and it was back in pretty much the same location as the previous night. We called my parents age 70 and 71 who live next door and they were able to see it. My daughters boyfriend age 16 who lives one mile west of it was also able to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived on the same property most of my life and my Mother has lived on the property for 71 years.

While I was watching it go South to North along the West coast I saw a little object fly behind the Jet or Plane going up at around a 45degree angle and it was out of view in around 5 secounds while the Jet or Plane was still there for another 20 seconds or so,it was still going North West. I do have it on my Camcord.<n>

My husband saw the lights first.  They were in the shape of a triangle at first, then the lights would change shape. He called us all over after he saw them in the triangle formation.  The lights were red and were far out in the Pacific Ocean.  I thought it was a mast of a ship or large naval ship but everyone else thought they were too high above the horizon line to be a ship.  The lights didn&#39;t move.  It was like there was a string of lights and certain  ones would turn off while other ones would turn on.  At one point it looked like the outline of a bow of a ship sinking into the ocean but it would have to have been a ship about 800 feet tall and 400 feet long for it to have been as visible as it was to us.  There  were probably 12 to 15 lights total.  After watching them  for about 15 minutes, they reduced down to 3 in a triangle formation and then they just went off.  Were not sure if it was one big object with lights on it or if it was several individual lights/objects.  I (only me) am still not convinced it was not a ship of some sort.  We turned on the news but could find no coverage of the event. Not being from the area, we didn&#39;t know if it was some kind of practice for the 4th of July lighted boat harbor event.  Definitely not fireworks  or flares, though.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Myself and two others were in the pool when one of my friends said to look in the sky.  Myself and my other friend turned to the north sky to see four red lights in a horizontal line.  They were above the treeline and were very large.  They were not like lights on an airplane, they were much, much larger.  There were four lights and then it went to just two lights (the end lights went out).  After it went to two lights, they went out and it disappeared.  We never really made out a space craft, we only saw the lights in the horizontal formation.  My friends and I believe we saw a UFO, but the fact that we saw what we believe to be 2 military jets fly by about ten minutes after the sighting made us wonder if the object was related to the jets and a military mission.  But it also made us wonder if the jets were sent to investigate the object that was seen.  Who knows, but we know we saw something very, very unusual.  I&#39;ve never ever even thought I&#39;ve seen a UFO in my entire life, but when I saw this object, I had no doubt that I had just seen something that could be one.  I would love to be contacted by an investigator to see if anyone else saw this thing or for information on what it could of been.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was just over the treeline of the horizon. It looked to be about three miles away. It definitely had glimmering lights that were flashing and the lights color was white. At the beginning of the sighting, it was still light outside and no stars were visible. We determined for certain that it was NOT a satellite, a meteor, a blimp, a comet, etc. Because they move and this object was stationary for about 15 minutes! I thought it may be the star Sirius cause I know a little about astronomy and it is the brightest star in our constellations over Earth. But when we went outside to investigate further, we saw more signs that this was an unexplaniable phenomenon. We had high-quality binochulars, and we both saw in them that the object was silver colored. Then the most amazing thing happened. We both witnesssed the object very quickly move to the southwest and then several seconds later returned exactly to where it was prior. Then a few minutes elapsed and it suddenly moved very quickly further from our view in a backwards motion. It was no longer visible, which means it cannot be a star. We moved back further about twenty-feet and up a slight hill on the side of our property. We could see the object again. My brother and I think that the object was being operated by intelligent forces because of the way it moved so fast and deliberately. After a couple of more minutes the object retreated a distance into the west and we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a celestial body.  PD))<n>

As I took the snapshot, I did not hear or see any object; it was only after I returned home to South Carolina and reviewed my pictures (taken with a digital camera) that I noticed what appeared to be a dark spot in the picture. When I zoomed in on my computer, the spot began to take the shape of some form of aircraft. I thought maybe there was a spot or blemish on my camera lens, but checked the pictures taken just before and just after the subject snapshot and found no similar spots on those shots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object is disc-shaped, with two distinct portions. the lower portion is disc-shaped and the upper part appears to be something like a cockpit. There is a reflection on the top part and the bottom is in a shadow. It is not clear from the photograph, but the object appears to be moving left to right, which would be heading west northwest. The reflection and shadow are consistent with shadows cast on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate the object was about 1 and 1/2 miles from me. This is a judgment call, referencing the mountains nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note that I am a skeptic regarding alien ships and such. I&#39;m sure there is a good explanation for what is in my picture. Upon request, I will submit the photograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(taller than wide)  It was like brushed aluminum in color, no paint.  There were no wings, as an airplane would have, but there were small fins located about 3/4 the way to the tail.  It blended in well with the color of the sky, and just disappeared the further it got from me.  By the time it got 1/4 mile away it was not visable to me anymore.  It made no sound and flew about the speed of a small airplane.   It was headed in a straight line, East by south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The night was clear.  I was facing almost directly west, perhaps a few degrees south also, looking at the stars.  I picked out the Big Dipper, and a very bright star/planet (Jupiter?) south following the arc of the handle at about 45 degrees or a little more up in azimuth.  (There is another group of stars that is like an inverted triangle at a higher azimuth, and Jupiter(?) was straight under the point star of that. I am in the city so only the brightest stars of most constellations are visible.)  As I was wondering if the bright star was a planet or what star, I noticed an odd flash of a light near it.  The object seemed very, very high up in altitude, higher than a plane would normally be, so at first I thought I was seeing a satellite, then two satellites.  The first object I saw did seem to appear at each flash farther to the right (north) to about four fingers&#39; width, but did not continue on beyond that and disappeared at that position. As I watched I noticed that there was another light, and then two more all surrounding Jupiter(?).  Most appeared less than a finger&#39;s width from Jupiter(?), but one was out about two fingers&#39; width.  These flashes of light were distinct and quick, not twinkly like stars, and there were no visible clouds.  Either the object I had first seen was moving to all sides of Jupiter(?), or there were several objects, as these flashes would appear at about 11 o&#39;clock, 2 o&#39;clock, 5 o&#39;clock, and 7 o&#39;clock positions around it with no regularity as to which light went on where.  One light seemed to have an interval of about 45 seconds for a few flashes. They did not seem coordinated with each other. The lights were small and contained, not lighting up the sky, just themselves. They were white, and perhaps a little red. They flashed one at a time very quickly on and off again--if I blinked I missed it, which made it hard to pick up a pattern. They stayed off for varying periods.  There was no sound, and no smoke trails. A jet in another part of the sky looked completely different and could be heard as it went on.  The environment was otherwise very quiet except for an occasional car passing on the street in front and a little rustling of leaves in a light breeze. The objects stayed around Jupiter(?) for about an hour or more altogether but seemed harder to see later as Jupiter(?) sank a little to the west.  I could no longer see four. I also looked at other stars in the sky but nothing similar seemed to be happening with them. I could see only the light flashes, not the actual objects making them. This is the first time I have ever seen anything I felt I should report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So just out of curiosity, I stepped outside and sat on some stairs and I looked up at the sky and there was about 3 solid lights moving slowly.  Around this time the dog started to bark and act kind of manic, once and a while sitting and looking up at the sky.  I became interested so I stayed a while outside and the same amount of lights appeared like 10 minutes later but forming a triangular shape across the sky.  Then later on around midnight, I started to notice that there where jet like sounds and two lights appeared together.  One light was small and unchanging and was following another craft that looked like a commercial ariplane.  Both were moving in the same direction at apparently the same speed.  I became scared so I went inside, where I kept hearing a couple minutes of jet-like sounds followed by about 5 min. interludes of silence, then starting back up again.  The same thing has been happenening since then untill today and in the day some people and I have been noticing the jet sounds in the same way I described above throughout the day.  Maybe its normal, I don&#39;t know.  By the way, my dog is still acting kind of strange, eventhough I took him to the vet to see what was wrong.  That didn&#39;t help.  Another thing, I tried to record but the battery went dead and when I charged it, the camcorder didn&#39;t want to record and kept ejecting the tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had stopped moving though, it was just sitting there. After a few moments it shot forward again, to the north, then stopped and shot forward again at a dead right angle to the east before vanishing about a second later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a white and red light. I think both were flashing on and off but not like an airplane. It was more like the lights were fading in and out over a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, Lawton is right next to Fort Sill, which is the US Army&#39;s main training ground with field artillery. (I think they test stuff here too, but I&#39;d have to ask Deja) There are numerous air force bases around. On top of this, we&#39;ve seen a stealth bomber moving silently (and very eerily) overhead so I&#39;m under no illusions - this was the DoD playing with their toys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I found equally interesting was that, ten minutes later, as I was packing up, an unmarked helicopter passed fairly low nearby…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first we thought it was a plane, but it wasn&#39;t making any noise and it wasn&#39;t moving. We kept on driving and it started following us. The object got really low beside some houses on my friend&#39;s side. She could see it really close by her window. She said that to her it looked like a circular object. What i saw, it did look like a circular object. Then it moved onto my side where I was driving. Then it seemed to have changed shape as it flew ahead of me over to my side. It then started to look like a rectangle that had two wings that looked like two block ends. There were no nose or tail on the object. The lights were not blinking, but they were solid and motionless. I turned to my friend to ask her to look at it and when she did it started flying toward a field at the end of the street. It flew into the field and started moving like it was bouncing up and down. While we were sitting in her driveway, it was still there. When we walked onto her front porch, thats when they dissapeared. We then saw them again later that night, looking out of the window by her bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Theres a mini-mart along that road were I used a payphone to call a friend to ask if he was seeing what I saw, He lives on Fairdale Ave nearly two or so miles from my location he went outside and saw the same thing I asked him to describe it and and got the same thing,only he said it was solid black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Luckily there were two police officers at the store at the time. I quickly asked both of them if they too say the craft. Both saw it, one even took out some binoculars. We all looked and when I did I could tell then that the craft seemed almost compressed and square like a CD case. After a few more minuets the craft started traveling westward finaly turning south and disapeared over the mountians.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were located on Crescent Beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all out on the beach at approx. 1:00 p.m. Facing away from the ocean were myself, my husband, and my father, chatting with my mother who was tanning on her beach towel.  I happened to look up into the sky above us and noticed a round, grey object moving at a steady, fairly rapid rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was absolutely not an airplane of any kind and appeared to be very far away, far enough away in fact that when it reached clouds it appeared to move either behind or through them, appearing on the other side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got the attention of my father and husband in time to point and ask, &#34;What is that?!&#34; The three of us watched as this object moved across the sky (right to left) and disappeared behind a cloud, not exiting on the other side as it had before, just disappearing into &#34;thin air&#34; I suppose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The same or following day (I can&#39;t remember which), I took a photo of the ocean and skyline. I don&#39;t recall the time the photo was taken, but there was no sound of any kind of aircraft at all.  I noticed nothing in the photo until I loaded it onto my computer from my digital camera and saw a round grey object hovering above the ocean in the right side of the photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is nothing in the sky at all (even clouds) except this strange object. This is not any type of aircraft that myself or any member of my family could identify, therefore I can only imagine it may be a UFO. It is rather creepy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.  PD))<n>

By the time I saw it (maybe 5 seconds later) it was at about 45 degrees in the sky in relation to my vantage point.  It appeared to be spherical (or at least circular) in shape and black.  I saw no detail at all.  It appeared to be one quarter of the sun&#39;s size.  It was moving at a steady pace WSW and appeared to be ever so slightly descending…hard to tell, though.  From the time I saw it until it disappeared behind a building on the horizon, about 10 seconds had passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving slow and in a straight line. But the first thing i noticed funny about it was that it was soooo far away. Even a plane traveling at its highest distance from the surface of the earth has some distinctive shape to it. and usually has a few lights on it to where you can make out the wings. Well this object I saw looked as if it was a very distant star. It was faint but definately visible with the naked eye. I just followed its flight until it just faded away very slowly. At first i thought mabye it was a very high plane that just went into some cloudy haze and that was the reason for it fading away, but when you look over a little more i could see every other star in the sky with the naked eye. I waited to see if it was going to come out of this unseen cloud but it never resurfaced . It simply went away. Now I&#39;m not saying it was a UFO but for one its distance, its speed, and it just fading away makes it a little suspicious. It could have been an asteroid or some large rock or ice flying through space having the suns light reflected on it. But unless there is documentation of such an event it will still remain a mystery to me.<n>

I closed the back of the van when I was finished and turned and looked up behind me. I saw one round light in the sky. I thought it was the moon at first behind the clouds but then it moved to the right and then the left never stoping again and then just got smaller as it took off to the left more. I thought it went around the back side of the house cause I lost site of it once it got past the roof of the carport. I stepped out and looked behind the house and saw nothing. I was just gone. I never saw it below the cloud line. I was telling my family that it was like someone shinning a flashlight down from the sky sort of like when you hold one under a sheet, I could see the outline of the clouds cause the light was behind it. Between the clouds it was brighter. I never heard a sound or anything. Creeped me out!!! All I know is I will never just blow someone off again when they tell me they have seen something strange in the sky or anywhere for that matter ever again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were going to the local Walmart (blarg) to do some browsing of Chinese goods and to the right in the sky above the mountain appeared a huge formation of lights...  So we decided to stop and try to get them on video..  just as we though we were too late the large light reappeared and soon others started appearing around it ... then something amazing happened ... other lights started flying down from the sky and joining the formation of lights ... it was simply amazing to witness and even more amazing is that this has finally been caught on video ... the video was jawdropping and the objects are so clearly taped that its just a miracle that it was caught ... the camera was on the tripod during the first few seconds of taping and it caught the lights appearing and flying down perfectly..  i decided to turn on the higher zoom on the camera so i removed it from the tripod and changed settings and began taping again ... this time i was zoomed closer to the objects and they started flying back up in the sky and disappearing....  it was all caught on tape and this time NOBODY can ever say that flares are all that are flying up around here in phoenix Arizona..<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/5/05 21:35|Yerington|NV|Cylinder|2-5 seconds|BLUE GREEN Cylinder/Bullet object with RED aura seen over Yerington, Nevada|6/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44306.html|362|ndxe200506| BLUE GREEN Cylinder/Bullet object with RED aura seen over Yerington, Nevada<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 5 June 2005, at approx. 2135 hrs. my vehicle along with another vehicle were travelling north on Alt 95 Hwy a few miles north of Yerington, Nevada. There were 4 adults in the two vehicles. We were travelling together and were in communication by portable radios. My business partner called me on the radio, and asked; &#34;DID YOU SEE THAT?&#34; I answered him and said &#34;YES! and explained to him I thought it was just a reflection in the window from passing cars. The object was seen at the above time and date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were travelling north, and I always carry a GPS handheld, I instantly looked at the time, and turned on the GPS for the exact location. The object came from out of NNE at about 30 degrees off north. I estimated the object at 35 degrees off the horizen, it was travelling at an angle of 25 to 30 degrees heading towards the mountains in front of our direction of travel in which the object disappeared behind after 2-3 seconds of the sighting. The object came in from the east heading in a west direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was &#34;cylinder&#34; shaped, even a &#34;bullet&#34; shape as my business partner descibed it. The object made no sound, no other a/c were noted in the area, no other lights were seen after or prior to the sighting. The object did not emit any other objects or lights. What all that saw the object was a &#34;RED&#34; aura on the bottem, and a &#34;BLUE/GREEN&#34; light half way up the object, this aura light was bright in intensity. Holding out my hand at arms length, the size of the object was 1/4 inch thick and 1/2 inch long. Taking a best educated guess, this was a very large object! Because of the darkness of the mountains and trees in the area, I could not reference a distance and or a true altitude. As we were at about 3-4000 feet in altitude, my best guess the altitude was at least 10,000 to 15,000 feet  (See drawing enclosed, lines are only drawn to show direction and movement)  As my spouse was driving,(she did not see the object) I was in the passenger seat of our VW Jetta. I noticed the object coming out of the right corner of the window coming in from the east towards the mountains in front of us...  The mountains were about 30-40 miles north of our position, as Hwy. 50 crosses Hwy Alt 95 which goes into Silver Springs, Nevada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My business partner and I compared notes at to what we both saw. The other witness was a 20 year old woman, who was driving my business partners car also at the time of the sighting. (Their statements will be posted or mailed at a later date.) My business partner is 22 years old, works at a casino and owns his own internet business, the woman is 20 and works at a resturant. My background is 12 years in the USAF, several years in financial services and many years self employed. From my military experince, this was no known military or commercial aircraft that I know of. I have witnessed meteors, fireballs, and resently while in Colorado Springs, Colorado the falling of space junk which lit up the sky in a shower of sparkler lights... In all my years I have never seen anything that would remotely compare to what this object was. I would say it was a solid object, with a &#34;RED&#34; aura on the bottem and a &#34;BLUE/GREEN&#34; upper half and shaped like a cylinder/bullet in design. The estimated speed that the object was moving? Taking a college guess I would estimate the object travelled over 20-30 miles in 2-3 seconds. Estimated location of object; Lat; 39.06826 N    Long; 119.14044W  NOTE: The following day, while in Reno, Nevada, my business partner did experience a severe nosebleed for about 5 min. Again, he is 22 years old, and expressed to me, that he had never had a nosebleed before. His mother even lived in Reno, and he was sorta used to the altitude. I did tell him it could be the altitude and the dryness that may of caused the nosebleed episode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of our sighting of this &#34;unknown&#34; I would estimate there were a half dozen other vehicles going north in front and behind us because the main Hwy 95 was flooded out due to a dam breaking and flooding the highway at Fallon, Nevada. So several vehicles had to be detoured. Hopefully, others will call or send in their reports from that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As mentioned, the two other witnesses will submit their reports to me shortly, and I will forward these to NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We are reporting this to see if anyone else is seeing the same thing.  It usually happens between 9pm and 11pm when we take our dogs out into our backyard before bedtime. We sit in our chairs facing the northern sky and look at the stars.  The &#34;star&#34; enters our field of view from the northwestern sky (around the 10 o&#39;clock position), and flies in a steady but very erratic up/down pattern. It then flys to the northeast (around the 1 o&#39;clock position) at a steady speed, keeping its up/down erratic pattern, and then suddenly...poof! It&#39;s gone.  Since the beginning of June we have witnessed this event 6 times. It is a steady, bright looking &#34;star&#34; and has no flashing lights, identifiable form, etc. Has anyone else seen these &#34;stars&#34;?  We definitely know from the flight pattern that it is entering or near to entering restricted airspace over Edwards Air Force Base. We have numerous flights of commercial and personal aircraft over our house on a daily basis- but not one of them ever fly into the airspace heading towards Edwards. There is a definite flight pattern these normal aircraft take around this restricted airspace- and yet, these stars head into that direction until they &#34;dissolve&#34;. Very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  The witnesses probably are observing satellites fly into the shadow cast by the Earth.

She attempted to look out the window to see something (At this time I was not aware that her call was about a ufo). She then ran out the door asking her brother to go with her. After several minutes I called her on her cell phone to ask her why she ran out of the house.She told me that she was looking at a ufo. I immediatly grabbed my camera and ran outside to see. Many people were looking at this black circular shaped object hovering in the sky above Brooklyn somewhere. We observed the object from 7th st. between Ave&#39;s B &amp; C. It hovered for a long time in the same location sometimes getting closer and other times moving away but never really leaving its position in the sky. The object appeared to wobble and also possesed a light corona. Not to far from it was a second object that hovered but was fainter and from time to time would completely vanish from site. After about 20 minutes it started to fade, it was however begining to get dark which might explain it&#39;s slow disapearence. After waiting a long time we decided to go up to the roof of the building and observe from there. At that point it started to get dark faster and the object faded further but was still visible.We decided to go in as we had no devices to zoom in on the object. This is the first time I am reporting a ufo but not the first time I have observed one. When I was in my twenties I worked for Fairchild Republic. The creators of the A-10 wharthog and other military aircraft on Long Island. I understand the mechanics of flight and it&#39;s characteristics. It was unusual for something of this nature to hover for so long in one loction. Only a helecopter could do this but the elevation made no sense and does not explain it&#39;s shape, woobling, length of time in one position and corona.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The weather was warm and sunny but it was very hazy.  I heard the sound of a helicopter or old prop plane.  I looked up and around to see what it was.  My house is under a well used fight path, so aircraft are not unusual.  I looked up and I saw a long straight white object moving in a purposeful way(not drifting), in the direction of its end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very thin, as if they was no way anyone could be inside.  There were no appendages or patterns of any kind. It moved as fast as a plane appears when it is below cloud level and coming into land but it seemed to be just above the level of the haze cloud which would have been about 20 000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It became very hard to see as it blended into the cloud and got lost in the sunlight.  I lost sight of it but I continued to look South in the direction it had gone.  Then after a few seconds I saw it appear out of the bright white haze as something darker, but this was too brief to say anything else.  A few milliseconds after it reappeared as a darker object, it flashed brightly.  The flash was not like a white light but appeared to be a strong reflection off a metallic object or an electrical spark maybe..<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the length of a dime or U.K. 5p piece held at arms length.  It had similar proportions to a matchstick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should also mention that I did have my shiny new rebel xt\350d at the time and I ran inside to get it.  But I am embarassed to say that I accidentally had +2 stops exposure compensation set.  At the time I was confident I had good pictures but when I downloaded the images I could not see a thing.  I have attached one of the pictures that would have been taken around the time it reappeared.<n>

I am also a former Fireman and First Responder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of June 5th, 2005 at about 0130 to 0200 hrs, I was sitting out in my front yard in rural Royal, Arkansas. I was facing south, talking long distance on the phone to my brother in Maryland. We often talk for long periods late at night and I have observed several interesting meteorlogical and celestial phenomenon during these conversations but I had never until this time, seen anything that was in any way difficult to identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a thunderstorm approaching from the west (my right) and the entire area was under a Strong Thunderstorm Watch issued by the NOAA a couple hours before and I had, for some time, been watching the distant (As much as 10 miles distant) lightening as it illuminated the low hanging clouds of the approaching storm. At one point, I turned my head to the east (my left) where the sky remained fairly clear and some stars were still visible, and it was at this time that I saw what I at first believed to be a very large meteor burning up as it entered Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Approx Ground Coords Under Event: 34 Deg,34.152 North, 093 Deg, 12.730 West (WGS84)  I was immediately puzzled by the fact that the object appeared to be pulsing as it traveled from east to west across the night sky. The effect was as if a very bright, blue-white, blinking light was moving at high speed, creating the optical illusion of a series of &#34;dashes&#34; as it traveled. The object blinked, creating 4 dashes on it&#39;s east to west heading and then to my complete surprise, changed direction without any visible manuvering or change in speed. One split-second it was traveling east to west, the next, it was traveling a nearly reverse heading, approxmiately 15 to 20 degrees more southerly than it&#39;s initial heading. The object blinked four more times, creating visible &#34;dashes&#34; each time and then simply disappeared. The light from this object was bright enough to leave an after-image on my retina for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound and no other observed phenomenon in relation to the appearance and disappearance of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went outside and there was a large, three-pronged thing in the sky.  There were three big lights, in the shape of a triangle, and a light that kind of went around the thing that changed from blue to red and some green.  I went to tell my husband about it, and it moved up, but was in the same horizontal position.  He confirmed that I&#39;m not seeing things. I got in the car to drive a little closer and saw several more just like it.  They would get brighter and more dim, but mostly stayed stationary, although there was some minimal movement.  I took a picture, but it was just a bunch of weird lines. There were also 4 planes in the very near vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.

This is a confirmation of his sighting by two witnesses, but the event I am reporting is from Northern California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my brother and I were watching the sky, a bright flashing object appeared directly overhead.  This object moved generally to the Northeast, but in an erratic manner, darting in different directions.  The object seemed to be made up of at least three lights in a triangular formation. The object flashed, like a camera taking pictures, every few seconds.  The only thing that could be seen of this object were the flashing lights.  Object moved without making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Adams looking towards the mountain at 10:15 pm Saturday night until midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s a synopsis:  First sighting: a star sized white light UFO was crossing the sky directly above us going from approximately North to South at a fairly fast clip, and was &#34;snaking&#34; perhaps 10 degrees back and forth by several nearby stars.  It moved across the sky for about 20 to 30 degrees of arc, and stopped, parked there and dimmed.  With the hundreds of stars visible and the fact that it stopped moving, I soon lost track of the UFO&#39;s exact position.  Another witness had a telephoto lens and saw a red light attached to its tail, while it was moving.  I managed to spot this UFO first, as I have excellent long range vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second sighting: a brighter star sized UFO came into view from the East traveling in a Westerly direction.  It traveled for about 10 to 15 degrees of arc across the sky at about a 60 degree angle from the ground.  Then, in a very short space, it took a smooth 30-40 degree arcing turn to the NNW, traveled a short distance, and stopped high above Mt Adams.  No dimming.  Lost site of it among the hundreds of stars that were out (I can only go so long without blinking!).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Third (and best) sighting: A medium bright, star sized UFO came in from the WSW, meandered somewhat randomly for 10-15 degrees of arc, heading in an Easterly direction.  It stopped right next to a dimmer star.  Suddenly it &#34;lit up&#34;.  I don&#39;t mean it got a little brighter; it got hundreds of times brighter than it was.  Imagine Mars, when in view, is the brightest object in the sky by 2-3 times the brightest stars in the sky, and multiply that by 50-100 times. The &#34;lighting up&#34; lasted for 3-5 seconds, then dimmed to a faint star in size and brightness, and moved off into space, dimming to nothing, within a couple arc degrees, in a snaking trajectory, heading ENE.  When that UFO lit up, the dozen or so people there reacted with awe, cheering and yelling for more.  That UFO was just letting us know it was undeniably there and perhaps saying &#34;Hi&#34; -  I was extremely impressed... Absolutely drop dead awesome!!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fourth sighting: A star sized UFO traveling from the North and very dim, was moving South when it &#34;flashed&#34; like a strobe pulse, maybe 5-10 times brighter than Mars would be, then returned to a very dim object (barely visible). A few seconds later, it flashed again, and dimmed. This scenario repeated 10-15 times while crossing directly overhead, and traveling 30-40 degrees of the sky, changing directions several times, along the way. The flashes were randomly timed, varying from a second to several seconds in between. The UFO then stopped almost directly above us, and parked there for the rest of the night, dim and unmoving. It was SE of the big dipper, then, and was aligned to two stars below it, where I could see and check on it, and it didn&#39;t move again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the viewing time I saw a shooting star (which I&#39;ve seen dozens of before), and airplanes, which were obvious by their trajectories, flashing colored lights, straight traverses and speeds. Observed them many times before. The four UFO sightings, above, were nothing of the kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot be certain what the witness observed, but we have an opinion on the third and fourth sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third is not inconsistent with the flash of an Iridium satellite.

The reports appears to us to be consistent with the direction a witness would have to have been looking, in order to witness the &#34;flare.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> The fourth sighting is not inconsistent with a tumbling booster in space, but that is only a guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PD))<n>

There is lots of airplane activity over our house, as we are directly under a major flight pattern coming from JFK airport.  I always like looking up at the planes, especially when they are lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 7:35pm, a plane flew directly overhead.  As I looked up to watch it, I saw what I first thought to be a star. The plane flew past, but I kept looking at this light.   My wife saw it too.  It was still very light out, and this star would have to have been very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds, we noticed that it started moving towards the east.  At first, my wife thought it may be a balloon very high up, but it was moving too slow and too uniformly to be a balloon blown around by the winds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 3 minutes of very slow movement, the object stopped.  During the time it was moving, my wife ran inside real quick to get the digital camera.  She also witnessed it begin to move, and then stop moving.  Once it stopped, I took the camera, and tried to get a picture of it.  As I was training the camera on the object, it basically vanished.  We didn&#39;t see it zoom off, it just stopped being there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife is a bit of a skeptic, but even she thought it was weird looking.  She keeps saying it could have been a balloon, but she seems to be trying to convince herself more than me.  I&#39;m still not sure what it was, but it had the brightness and look of a star, but it didn&#39;t twinkle.  It was stationary, moved to the east slowly and in a straight line, and then stopped again, before disappearing.  By 7:40 it was gone (according to timestamp on the camera).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did take 3 pictures of the sky, but the object was gone at that point.  I thought a viwe of the sky might pick it up, even if I couldn&#39;t see it anymore (if it had moved to another location quickly).  But all 3 photographs show nothing.<n>

So I went to go let the dog out before going to bed. While standing at the back door waiting for the dog to do her business I saw this light. It was flying kind of low and slow and flashing on and off really slow. It was really bright, it kind of reminded me of a flash on a camera. My back door faces west, so it looked like it was maybe out towards Dyess and was flying north. I watched it for a few seconds and it just stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see airplanes flying here at night since Dyess is here and my house is near an airport, but this wasn&#39;t like the lights on a regular plane.

I decided to take some pictures of the Shanghai skyline with my digital camera when I shot this photograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were not any objects in the sky before or after I took this picture, at least none that I or anyone else in the bus noticed.  The tall tower building you see the object next to is the Pearl Tower, the tallest building in Shanghai, China.  This picture was taken in a moving bus without flash, mind you there is still a window between the camera and the outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dark outline on the right of the picture is the curtain. The dark spot just left of the middle of the picture is a smudge that appeared in several of the pictures taken out of the same window overlooking the same area.  Strangely enough, I was never able to identify the location of this imperfection on the window but I give it enough doubt to believe that it was not anything outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you zoom in on the object you can see its detail.  It is reflecting the sun from the same angle as the tower and you can even see a bit of a shadow on the bottom of the object.  I know it is not an aircraft because there weren&#39;t any in the air before and after taking the photo.  I had seen a few aircraft in the air that day but none had been so reflective and not one was even close to this shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also know it is not a reflection of anything from the outside creating a glare on the window, because the glare would have bled out more on the dusty windows.  There is definitely something out there in this picture; the pinpoint detail that can be seen really shows it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I showed this picture, instantly after taking it, to the other students in the bus.  There were mixed explanations.  I don&#39;t know what it is, so I leave it up to you to interpret what it may be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We see a bright glare in the sky, where the source indicates it should be, but we do not know what it is.  We have no reason to believe it is necessarily a genuine UFO, but it is unidentified.  PD))<n>

At first I thought it was a low-level airplane, but as I watched it (it was only one craft) it&#39;s behavior was extremely unusual.  The object flashed a white light approximately 6 or 7 times during the entire 10 or so seconds before flying off into the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving very fast, about 3 times the speed of a normal aircraft.  It was heading nearly direct west at first, flashing twice, appearing to jump between each flash.  Then, it &#39;jumped&#39; to a 90 degree angle south from the original flight path, blinking once again.  With each blink, it seemed to travel about the same distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It again, jumped and flashed direct west, then took another 90 degree angle jump to the north, where it flashed again, seemingly to resume it&#39;s original course.  I said &#34;do you see that?&#34; to my husband and the thing flashed again, still on the path headed direct west, then very quickly flashed a couple more times and took off toward the horizon until it was out of sight.<n>

She told me that I should pull over to look at it because she was convinced it was not an ordinary aircraft (no wings, no tail stabilizer, and no navigational lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We immediately pulled into a nearby parking lot and got out of the car within a minute of her sighting. We stood by the car and I put my sunglasses on to block out the sun which was near the object and making it hard for me to make out.  After doing so I realized everything my wife said was an understatement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never seen a craft move so oddly (against the wind, stopping, moving again and then finally moving up through the upper clouds and disappearing completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at this vehicle which to me looked like a metallic object but somewhat shaded due to the Sun. There was absolutely nothing sticking out of this object which made it appear eerily saucer-like and the way it moved made it very convincing.  Also the object made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personally I am convinced that this U.F.O. was either a classified military vehicle or of unknown origin. Please take note of the sketches I made that same day when I returned home while the observation was fresh in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  High-quality graphic of the object, and how it moved, is provided by the witness.

The three objects projected out equally and evenly from the center source and then they all disappeared at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were shaped kind of funny, kind of like potatoes.  There was no sound and no explosion or anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very, very weird, it kind of reminded me of craft that lost their cloaking function for a few seconds and then it began to work again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone else seen anything like this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was 15 I had a pretty close encounter with a UFO, but it looked nothing like this.<n>

These aircraft have larger than jets body size and a considerable amount of more speed (2-3 times). also leave a very heavy thick contrail when leveling out.  I would&#39;nt put these craft in the same category as some other happenings I&#39;ve witnessed but pretty cool nonetheless.My guess is man-made on these babys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S.not sure whether or not flight was audible because of commercial jets racket.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

The light came up from the ground and then made a circular motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They thought that was weird because they had never seen anything like that before!  And then as they got closer to their destination they noticed on the north side of the highway brights lights in the sky, the lights were white.  It was moving real fast, not like an aircraft.  And then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 minutes later they noticed the lights again in the sky.  This time it was much closer to them and they witnessed blue laser lights coming out of the craft.  They were dispersed one at a time four times.  It was over an open field at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when the mom driving slammed on her brakes and everyone starting crying.  They were so scared.  And then the craft flew over them at that time the mom opened her sunroof on her car and they noticed it was triangular shaped and the wings appeared to be transparent. The craft went behind them and blinked the four lights three times and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they arrived home they were all shaken up and couldn&#39;t believe what they just witnessed.  The witnesses were a 35 year mom and her 12 year daughter, my 12 year old daughter and another little 12 year old girl.  I believe they really experienced something unusual and they would be considered very reliable witnesses.  In that area there is hardly ever any aircrat flying in that rural area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were hoping that someone else witnessed the sighting.  We did not report it to any of the authorities so we decided to contact this website to see if anyone could help us figure out what was the sighting that they encountered.<n>

We were planning on setting up camp for the night when my wife called me out of the jeep. I went over to her and she explained she had just seen several lights in the sky.  I thought she was probably joking around and pretended i believed her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About two hours later at around 21:00 a collection of lights caught my attention.  They were formed in circles.  Each circle had 6 lights to it.  My wife saw them as well.  They really did light up the sky. There were loads of these circles that were slowly moving around the night sky. Some dipped below the mountains and some rose above the terrain as they moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took pictures on my camera phone of these lights however i cannot send them to this site as they cannot be transfered to computer unfourtunatly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and i stayed for about 15 minutes before falling to sleep while they were still above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke in the morning to find no evidence of lights or craft in the sky.  I was not too far away from a military installment so there is a chance they were testing military aircraft up there.  But no aircraft i have ever seen and i used to work in an airport in spain.<n>

But when we drove by the CROSSROADS SHOPPING CENTER on Sam Rittenburg Boulevard and Ashley River Road we saw a UFO it was a circle UFO it had red yellow and orange lights on the bottom and emitted a blue beam then emitted green and purple beams then it changed into a cone UFO the top of the cone was red and the bottom of the cone was yellow. Then it changed into a triangler UFO than was all green lighted then 2 more triangler UFOS showed up then all 3 triangler UFOS were all red lighted then all purple lighted then 2 triangler UFOS were red lighted then the other one yellow lighted. Then all 3 triangler UFOS were all orange lighted and one emitted red beams then all 3 UFOS were still all orange lighted then they disappeared going over the CROSSROADS SHOPPING CENTER and we didn&#39;t see them no more. It was exciting for us to see these UFOS it was partly cloudy outside a warm night pulled in the shopping center got out of our car and observerd these UFOS we didn&#39;t hear no sound to these objects. Then we went to a convenient store and got some gas at the gas station and got some snacks and cokes and kit kat bars. Then we went ice skating at an ice skating rink and then I went to my friends house to hang out have some beers and I spent the night there it was really a fun night and pretty neat to see these UFOS me and my friend will always remember seeing the UFOS we saw and going out to dinner and just hanging out.<n>

It looked as if whatever was zooming at high speed behind the cloud had casted its light onto the cloud--something which a shooting star is unlikely to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt an odd sensation on the top of my head , almost like goosebumps or static electricity. I felt the need to run my fingers through my hair to make the feeling go away. I found this as odd, but passed it off as only a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the night after (tonight) I experienced something similar to the night before--only much closer...while walking along a sidestreet before getting to my home, I thought i heard an animal behind me, so i turned my head to take a cursory glance; almost half a kilometre away and a quarter kilometre above myself I saw a flash of light streaking across the sky horizontally, as if a firecracker went off; vibrant white, almost blinding. I could hear a hiss and a crackle (like a vinyl record player makes).  And again, that odd senstation occured--a static feeling on the top of my head followed by vibrations down throughout--stopping around my knees.  Though what is strikingly odd is how close it was to the ground and to myself.  I could hear it as well, so there is no mistaking the streak of light coming from within the earth&#39;s atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my 3 years of walking during the night I have never seen anything like this--not to mention twice during two nights. I have seen a shooting star before several years ago, and I know enough to know that there must be another explanation for this. However, the sensations that have occured directly after the flashes were not caused by my inner body, as I have never felt this particular way ever before.<n>

Don&#39;t believe you guys took any time to look at it.  It is by far the best UFO video ever.  Now the video link I&#39;m including is not the best video, but the original is available to someone who has the means to acquire it.  I have tried to acquire a copy of this video to no avail. Now the way I originally viewed this video was thru my TV&#39;s High quality DVR.  Had this video on my DVR for over 1 yr., and it got erased by mistake.  When viewed on a high quality DVR you will have (62) frames of this UFO (3.5sec)   I&#39;M sure if you can get access to a DVD of this video you will be able to professionally observe and prove this object is a silver disk that shoots out of the water and changes direction like no terrestrial vehicle. In my opinion this silver disk accelerates from 100 or 200 mph to 1000 or 2000 mph in less than 1 sec.  Please do not dismiss this msg. I had been in contact with the president of your co. years ago. OK here is the link<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.mtv.com/videos/the-duel-full-episode-ep-15/1549313/playlist.jhtml<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes it is a reality TV show (Real world Road rules), this makes it much more reliable video with higher definition than any camcorder.  Please, Please review this video very carefully. The time frame is 4:25-4:28. You will see this vehicle accelerates so fast that it actually echos on the video, this isn&#39;t cause of the poor quality online, it happens in high quality DVR at (62 frames in 3 sec). the 1 disk echos up to 2 times in (1) frame, that is damn fast!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC receives many reports about &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34; captured by television and movie cameras.

I looked up and above the tree tops I saw a close up of a very large craft,rose in color, no sound. It was so close, I saw at least 2 black wide doorways/motifs with a narrow horizontial window located in each. I believe it was either circular or oblong. I could not see the top or bottom and it had no obvious lights, but it was luminated. The strange feeling I got was whomever was inside wanted to make sure I saw it, reason for it being so close. I didn&#39;t see it arrive and it was gone in a flash. I still wonder why I looked up at that moment. Two nights latter I had a dream or maybe it was an experience, I&#39;m not sure. Someone who appeared to be human was holding a gun like object aimed at my torso, which slightly burned and I could not move. It was clear &amp; blue about 16&#34; long. Latter in this happening I saw the gun again and I remember saying &#34;Don&#39;t use that again&#34;. I was in a standing position. I was scared from the moment I saw the UFO and having the experience/dream didn&#39;t help. I still wonder if it&#39;s going to reappear, but my fear isn&#39;t as intense. I would of reported this earlier,  today I just found the website.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were just getting ready to leave when we saw an orange glow in the sky.  we sat down and started watching. The glowing ball just sat in the sky for a while then flew over us. We saw the bottom of it. It was triangular in shape and had blue and red lights on the bottom. In about 2 mins. after that another flew over then another, We waited for a while but didnt see anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

For some reason I looked up into the sky and and image flashed before my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened so fast! It was a rosey color with 2 black doorways or could of been motiffs. Inside appeared to be a long horizontial window within each doorway. I could only see this side, I didn&#39;t see top or bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound and I didn&#39;t see it arrive or depart. The part that bothers me is it was so close, just above the tree tops. This sighting was about 2=3 houses from where I live. I was facing north west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live about 4 blocks from the ocean.  The dogs didn&#39;t seem to notice anything, no barking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This took place on or after midnight. I tried to put in 06/01/2005, but it would not accept in the form. I only have a webtv unit, maybe that&#39;s the reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also reported this before, but I didn&#39;t see it listed. I also had a strange dream or experience 2 nights later.  I was standing and what appeared to be a human aimed a gun like object at my torso and I remember my stomach burning.  I could not move.  Later on I remember telling him not to do that again. The gun was about 16&#34; long clear and blue. The entire experience really did scare me and I can&#39;t seem to put it aside.  I had sent a sketch of this sighting last week via email.<n>
