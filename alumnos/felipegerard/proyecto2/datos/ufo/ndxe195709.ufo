PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4 matalic silver cigar shaped objects; no sound september1957, kentucky<n> <n><n> <n><n> no sound........        matalic silver aluminum color. first appeared out of sky in a right there manor, one would move and hoover then next and so forth. we stopped our car and got outside and just watched, they moved at a slow pace about 300ft to 400ft? from the ground. We called a military base in nashville Tn only to be told they were weather baloons, &#34;YEA RIGHT&#34;. I statsd Hopkinsville Ky, however it all happened between there and Nashville Tn. We were truly in awe. They appeared to be about 40 or 50 ft long of course this is a guess as we could not judge from our position on the ground. I don&#39;t know what they were as we had never seen in our lifetime anything of resemblence. we were not afraid, just curious and amased and after all this time when others do not think you strange was hoping someone else had seen the same things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1957 was such a long time ago and the person with me was named ((name deleted)). I don&#39;t know if he is still living or not. The last I heard he was living in St. Petersburg Florida, that was in 1981 and I have had no contact with hi since I do not know if we had passed the Kentucky line on into Tennessee or not. I went with this person to buy one of the first chevy Impala cars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am leaving in a few minutes to fly to ((North Carolina)) ((business information deleted)). I will return by Friday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my early 20&#39;s at the time. I don&#39;t think that I could find the spot, It was at that time like fields and country side and I don&#39;t think it took us another hour or hour and half to get to Nashville. I think I would remember the highway if I looked on the map, if it has not gone to an Interstate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes, it was so interesting and I felt unique in that I had seen something so unreal and special, However declined to say anything about it to only those close to me and I think Mr. ((deleted)) felt the same way.<n> <n><n> If we had a camera at time, I believe we could have given the world some very close spectacular pictures.  I will try to submit a drawing of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I forgot I did contact some web page a few years ago but had the wrong town that we were traveling from. We had actually left from Bowling Green Kentucky and had passed thru Hopkinsville and some where after that was where we saw the unknown and they were beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Remain<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

It was quite, had lights like windows around the perimeter of the craft, and was the size of a Boeing 727. McCord Air Force Base is close by and I sometimes look up into the sky to spot the planes that go by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This siting was over 45 years ago but I just stumbled onto your site recently. I have not seen a UFO since then but in mentioning the siting to others, I have been surprised to hear other stories from friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a car pool to a job at Boeing, one of the engineers said that he saw a cigar shape UFO. At work at Boing, a technical support analyst told me that he was traveling to California on the freeway from Washington and all the cars stalled out when a &#34;bunch of ufo&#39;s flew overhead&#34;. In Galveston a computer operator told me that a UFO DISK shape flew over the caseway one day while he was traveling to work in Galveston. In every case this information was not provided until I said that I had seen a UFO once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two good reports from the same witness.  Second report is posted for July 25, 1952, for a sighting over Tacoma, WA.  Dates are approximate.  PD))<n>

I was in the army stationed at Fort Bliss Texas (the air defense center) training to shoot down aircraft.  Fort Bliss is not too far from Biggs Air Force Base. ( A SAC Bomber Base).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had fallen out for formation around 4:30 in the morning and it was about 1 hour before sunrise.  While standing in formation (I) we observed a dish shaped object approaching from the west, white in color,( that could have been due to the altitude and the reflection of the rising sun giving it that color) and you could tell it was spinning because what appeared to be flames were coming off of it. The object stopped very suddenly and began to hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You could tell that the object was spinning and leaving what you could say was a vapor trail.  The object moved at great speed and would stop abruptly and change direction. The entire platoon witnessed this object for about 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As with any occurance like this; we talked about it during breakfast and I think that is as far as it went. We had heard on the news several reports of strange  objects being seen in other areas of the Texas panhandle around the same period of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally the object reversed itself and went out of site in the direction from where it came.  But when the sun came up the vapor trail disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no flashing lights or lights that could be seen nor was there any sound that could be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

(Lt.Col.) for the AFR,was traveling on a rural road outside St.Paul, witnessed 3 UFO&#39;s coming at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stopped by side of road and saw 3 UFO&#39;s land in field just off the road.  Got out of car and climbed over fence and headed for the 3 UFO&#39;s.  When I got 100 yards away they raised up, got in formation and took off at lightning speed.  Nothing like anything I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next A.M., the St. Paul paper was full of reports on the UFO&#39;s.  None, however, saw them on the ground like I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO&#39;s had flashing lights around the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  We spoke with this witness at length via telephone, and he seemed exceptionally credible to us.  PD))<n>
9/5/57 17:30|Los Gatos (west of)|CA|Disk|one minute or less|3 craft seen in day light, very low altitude and as clear in detail and color as a car on the road.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52348.html|6|ndxe195709| 3 craft seen in day light, very low altitude and as clear in detail and color as a car on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 3 ships my wife and I saw were disc shaped and slightly concave on the bottom side. On the top side there was a definite &#34;cabin&#34;, with round port holes around the outer edge.  There was a &#34;pole&#34; (knob) at the center bottom. The ships were glowing from within and were an all over color like that of a bluish floresent lamp.  The sighting took place in late day light and the crafts were flying in a canyon, so we could see the hills behind them, so the altitude could be gauged some what. My guess would be they were flying at less than 200 feet altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All 3 ships looked as though they were sailing on a slightly wavey sea and were gracefull in flight, with out a whisper of sound. They were moving very slowly, at a rate of 10 to 15 miles per hour.  Following each other, they each one very briefly paused, just slightly west of our position, nearly overhead.  When they took off, they traveled from east to west, at  approximately  a 45 deg. angle from the horizon, gaining altitude at an amazing rate of speed.  From our view point, they appeared to be 30&#39; to 40&#39; feet in diameter and when they took off, they diminished to a speck in a forth of a second or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Approximate size was 20 ft in diamater.  I could have touched it but made a quick exit instead .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Mom was a passenger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dad started pointing frantically to the South.  About 20 degrees above the horizon were three shiny ball shaped objects sailing along in perfect triangular formation in an easterly direction.  They turned North as they moved across the bow and their shape never changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They accelerated and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ll never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
