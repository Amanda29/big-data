On hot nights when I couldn&#39;t sleep I would put my face up against the window that was right next to my top bunk because the window was always cooler.  One night I did this and opened my eyes to see a disc shaped object hovering less than 100 ft. over my house.  It was all lit up in different colors and the lights kept flashing in a pattern.  My parents were sitting on the couch in the next room talking and I called out to them asking them what that thing in the sky with all the lights was. My mom didn&#39;t even look out but called back that it was an advertisement and that someone was having a sale or grand opening.  At the time, being only 7 this made perfect sense to me, but later I realized that from my discription she thought that I was talking about a strobe light.  It was at this time that I realized that that thing that I had seen was not anything the average citizen was familiar with. As I watched this object it slowly and silently started to &#34;drift&#34; in a slightly NW direction towards the Ridge Road viaduct just East of Wicker Park, until it was out of sight from my window.  Years later I was talking with a friend who had lived a few doors away at the time and she described for me the exact same thing even though we had never discussed it before.  She had seen it too.<n>

Lost sight of the device after it flew and then arched over nearby tree tops. Curious whether there have been reports of similar devices, or if someone my know what this device was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I asked if there were any radio antennas or lights in the area and she shook her head and told me that if there were, she wasn&#39;t aware of it. That&#39;s when we noticed the lights dart across the sky towards our direction. She stopped the car, killed the lights, and we watched as the three red lights darted over and around the car silently, as they faded to orange and back to red. After around 10 minutes, they disappearted as quickly as they appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

There had been a bad storm earlier, the road was wet and she drove cautiously at about 35/40mph over Highway 50 East. She went through Union, about 11 miles from Beaufort, and was heading toward the Bourbeuse River Bridge, a steel truss bridge, when she saw a brilliant light approaching in her rear view mirror...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before she could make an evasive move the car was hit. No sound was heard. Upon impact the car heated up, the windows fogged and the inside was bathed in light. The rear end was lifted. There was a vibration throughout. She could neither steer nor stop. She could see she was heading for the bridge,suddenly the car was dropped and she regained control. The light lifted over her car and disappear to the north. She crossed the bridge, got out, inspected the car, saw no damage,drove to the Arnold Police Dept. (Jefferson Co.). It was now approx. 1:40a. Arnold tells her to go back to Union. She got her husband and returned to Union. Union Police discover two shallow dents in the trunk lid about 22/24 in. apart, no other damage. A complaint is filed. Witness had aches, and bleeding from nose and ears after incident. Also remarked that weddings rings were off her hand and on front seat of car after incident. The witness later filed a claim with her insurance company for damages to the trunk lid. When asked what vehicle had hit her, she replied &#34;UFO&#34;.

7/26/78 18:30|St. Louis|MO|Unknown|minutes|Red light from outside lights up the my bedroom.|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31112.html|8|ndxe197807| Red light from outside lights up the my bedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am going on memory. My niece and I were playing the game Clue in my room when we were kids. She is 6 years younger than I. So, based on the fact that she was old enough to understand the game, and I was not out of elementary school yet, I believe it was 1978. It was also hot outside, so Iit had to be July or August. (I know we were out of school on summer vacation as well.) I entered the date 7/26 based on similar sightings listed at your site for Missouri. At the time, we were in my bedroom. I lived in a two story house. My bedroom window jetted out of the roof, and was on the side of the house. If you looked out it, you would see the top of the roof of the neighbors house. (These were steep pitched roofs...not flat.) We were playing and I looked up at my neice and said, &#34;your face is all red&#34;, and she said the same thing to me. We looked around and noticed the whole room was lit in red. There was no noise, and being that the window was open and we lived in the city near the Mississippi River we were accustomed to boats, trains, and airplanes form nearby Lambert Airport. So, it was unusual that if it were a red light coming from above i would have expected a helicopter noise, because whatever it was had to be flying low enough to light up my room. in fact, if you understand where my window was, it still baffles me how that much light could light up the room from that angle without it being right out the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I remember is that her and I ran downstairs and I told my mother and my sister (her Mom) we saw a UFO as we ran out the front door to catch a glimpse from the porch. We saw nothing and heard nothing. My sister thought we had made it up until about 20 years later when my niece and I both recalled this story to her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this originally to MUFON to see if they had similar experiences in St. Louis during the Summer of 1978 and they referred me to this site. It is odd that I can&#39;t remember the exact date, but I still have a vivid memory of the event that happened 25 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The weather turned bad quickly as huge dark clouds rolled in and covered the sky like something out of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were listening to the radio, stuck in traffic leaving the park, when the news at the top of the hour reported that police officers had pursued an object in the sky (nearby where we were) that they described as &#34;big as a house.&#34;  This spurred my mother to mention that she had just seen a ball of light in the sky.  She said it streaked down at us then veered away.  She dismissed it as balled lightning (which she had never seen, it just sounded logical.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, I thought all of these incidents were very strange, so I filed them away in my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently, I was looking at a Six Flags website which mentioned the incident, so with the date in hand, I checked some UFO databases.  I found the incidents listed on this website and thought I should add our report to it.<n>

I want to report something that happened to my neighbor and I years ago at our home.  This was in 1977 or 1978 in Kingsport, TN.  We lived near the area airport and we were used to seeing planes day and night (helicopters were rare, however.)   Our houses shared a driveway and we were out at night playing basketball under a street light my parents had put in.  Our houses were situated along the Interstate 81, which ran across the street from our homes, and there was a steep hill behind us which had no homes back in there, just woods and fields.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While playing, I noticed a regularly flashing red light was travelling from west to east basically parallel to the Interstate very slowly.  I just gave it a casual notice and didn’t even mention it to my neighbor, and went back to playing.  The light disappeared behind trees and hills in the east.  After a few moments, I noticed it coming back in the opposite direction, and it was travelling a little faster.  Again I just took notice, it was a little odd, but nothing to mention.  It went out of sight to our left (west) and I kept playing.  Well, after a short time (maybe 1 minute) it appeared again, moving faster.  This time I showed my neighbor, and we wondered if it might be some kind of helicopter.  This time after it disappeared to our right, we waited for it to return.  It did so, and was moving rather rapidly.  It was still a steadily flashing red light at this point.  We were excited, and ran up into our back yard to see better, because it let us get uphill above the level of our houses.  As the light travelled from right to left along the Interstate this time, you could tell it was getting closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This last time, it came pretty close, and the flashing light started to look like maybe it was more of a spinning thing.  There was still no noise from it.  It appeared to curve around a large hill at the left edge of our vies, and then it came out from behind that hill.  It seemed to have changed direction and was coming right toward us.  As it got closer, it was definitely a spinning craft (it was late at night, so the shape of it wasn’t visible) but the lights were either a red-lighted strip with black circles spinning fast, or something round with red-lighted portholes or something similar.  It was moving fast, and dipped below the tree line, but still above the hills.  It suddenly dipped down right behind our house.  No sound at all.  The distance it was at would have made noise very noticeable if it were a helicopter, or a plane.  It was probably only 5 or 6 houses down from ours and up in the air barely above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor and I looked at each other, mouths hanging open.  I think we both said “Did you see that?” at the same time.  We ran into the house to tell people.  The family said the TV had been out, just static (we didn’t have cable), for a minute, but was now back on.  They thought I was crazy, of course.  I knew when I ran in the door that no one would ever believe me.  I had seen another UFO behind that hill before, but that would be another entry, I assume.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I WAS AWARE THAT I WAS PULLING OFF OF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH NO MEMORY OF EVER STOPPING. AS I WAS PULLING ONTO THE ROAD I ADJUSTED MY REAR VIEW MIRROR BECAUSE OF SOME BRIGHT LIGHT THAT WAS BLINDING ME.  I WAS IN A CONFUSED !

Changed shape rapidly, and disapered into the darkness in a burst of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun was going down, the moon coming over the horizon. My friend was in from California, and we had just finished dinner. We decided to go out and have a cigarette and watch the sun go down. My friend said he heard thunder, but I said that was impossible, but I looked to the sky anyway. A brilliant flash of light knocked us both to the ground, and we looked up,  covered our eyes because of the light, and saw to rotating silver  craft. They changed shape rapidly to what looked like a giant black triangle. The first craft emitted a beam that lifted a 40 foot cactus out of the ground and fix the sand so the earth looked untouched. We then heard a deafening roar which we both assumed was the craft communicating with each other, they then both exploded into a brilliant display of colored light, and in the same way they came they were gone. My friend got up, lit another smoke, and said &#34;Well Rick, this is really one for the books&#34;. I have since moved to New York because I just got to thinking that too many of these UFO sightings take place in the desert. I still keep in contact with my friend, and this always come up in conversation.<n>

I said I would awake our grandfather if she didn’t take me with her.  So we drove to what is near the downtown district of Gulfport and I waited in the back seat of the car.  My sister spend nearly an hour talking to her boyfriend on his front porch and began kissing.  Disgusted, I turned around to look outside the back window and noticed at least 9-12 (maybe more) lights flying together in a chevron/diamond shape.  I got out of the car and watched it heading towards the beach/Gulf of Mexico.  My sister comes down from the porch and asked me what I was doing and I pointed the sky, asking what the lights were.  She ran to me and looked and as I returned my eyes to the sky it was gone.  She said, jokingly that I had seen my very first UFO.  I said no it’s not.  I then began to tell my sister and her boyfriend an exper! ience I had the month before.  I have since seen this light configuration 3 times since the first time.  I cannot tell if it is a group of crafts or one big one.  I have yet to see them separate; so, I assume at this point it is one craft.<n>

And  time seem to lapse by and then it took off real fast in a diagle it was going from east to west and just disappeared but before it disappeared it made some unreal turns that startled us. then the jeep was running again like it was before and the radio was working and TALK was calling us and they said they were trying to reach us for about five minutes with no reponse.

I was about 11 yrs. old gazing at the stars above on a clear night when I saw 2 bright lights that were the same size as the stars I had been watching, suddenly shoot across the sky parallel to one another coming to a complete stop imediatley. It&#39;s difficult to guess how fast they were moving but if I were to do so I would have to say more than 600mph.They sat in possition for maybe 3sec. Before they flew off in two different dirrections one due south and the other due west at the exact same moment. They were gone just as fast as they arrived into my view. Even as a child I knew this was nothing created by man. This has not been my only experience and consequentially get a bit angry at those who try to denounce the possability that we are not alone. Thank you very much for all the time you have spent in the field of UFO&#39;s.<n>

I was standing in an open parking lot talking with some friends. I just happened to look up towards  the sky and suddenly two very bright lites appeared in the sky. Slowly they came towards eachother and seemed to stop momentarily,then the two objects zig zagged in opposite directions as if they were communicating. This lasted only seconds. Suddenly they sped off in opposite directions at a speed that was very fast,faster than anything I ever observed. I cannot estimate the hieght that these objects appeared,but I would say maybe between 25,000 and 40,000 feet. My freinds did not witness this it happened so fast. As I explained myself,they just laughed and made the remark that I was seeing things. But I know different,what I saw could not have from this world,it was most definitely a very strange occurence.<n>

USA<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another person &amp; myself were watching the night sky, looking straight up.  We both saw what looked like a cluster of greenish lights, at a high altitude - they were in a slow, steady moving formation like a &#34;V&#34; - as if it were a formation of birds each carrying a green light.  The formation seemed to contain 8-10 lights, &amp; was not in a fixed &amp; perfect &#34;V&#34; shape.  We observed them moving in a southwest direction, then turned slightly, then disappeared.  Our observation lasted maybe 10 seconds, which was long enough to determine this was something unlike anything we could explain.  There was no sound - just little light green lights.  It was no airplane.  The sky was clear, &amp; we had an unobstructed view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was driving and Lisa was snoozing.  I remember turning off the a/c and the 8 track tape we&#39;d been listening to and rolling down the windows because it was such a nice calm night driving through the desert.  I noticed quite a few stars out, then an erie feeling came over me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, to my left, I saw what seemed to me to be 3 very very bright objects or crafts. A bigger one in the middle and two smaller ones on either side.  They all moved in a pattern that I&#39;d never seen before in my life.....  Like all of a sudden they were forward, and then they were back,and then side to side, with the (mother ship?) moving first, then the 2 on the side, moving exactly at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly woke up my sister (which I really didn&#39;t want to do since she was driving me crazy, never shutting up since we left Jersey)   But I needed a witness to this crazy thing I was seeing. I pulled over to the side of Interstate 15 and my sis saw the same thing I saw and said, &#34;Oh my God&#34;! &#34;what is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the really weird part......I hadn&#39;t seen one other car on the highway for maybe 2 hours.  Now, all of a sudden, there was this guy standing at my car window, startling Lisa and I, to say the least. He asked if we were OK and we excitedly yelled &#34;turn around, look!&#34;  And as he did, the bright lights disappeared. He again asked if we were OK and if we needed anything and we said no thanks. Then he was gone!  The strangest thing about this story was my that sister and I have never mentioned a thing about this to anyone or each other until 2 Christmas&#39;s ago at my mom and dad&#39;s home in Scottsdale ,AZ, 23 years later. It was as if we were kept silent on purpose, cause our family is very close and very loud and talkative and we found it so so weird that we were just now bringing up the subject.  Just to make sure I wasn&#39;t going crazy, I asked Lisa to tell me everything she could remember about that night. and bingo...exactly as I remembered it too.  She even described  the guy at the window to the tee as I remembered.  The unusual things about him were he was very short, barley coming up to the roof of the car, he had on a silver metalic zip up jumpsuit (which I don&#39;t know if they even made them yet in 1978) and the deepest set green green eyes you&#39;ve ever seen.  I didn&#39;t think anything of it but Lisa brought up the fact that not many people if any were wearing colored contacts in those days, and there was no possible way those green eyes were his real color.He also had dark skin and the most chisled features we&#39;d ever seen on a person. I also asked Lisa what he was driving that night. She said a motorcyle and that&#39;s what I thought too. The only thing was that neither one of us saw him pulling up or pulling away, which seems odd to me being that there was no one else on the road, and no exits off the highway for the longest time. ( I remember this because I thought I was going to run out of gas but thank God a gas station had just opened, because we hit a little part of Arizona on the 15, so instead of 5 am it was 6 am ( they&#39;re not on daylight savings time.) So where did that guy come from or go? And why did the lights disappear right when we told him to LOOK!? I was watching a show on Discovery or the History channel tonight on UFO&#39;s and it sparked my memory so I found your sight on my computer and thought what the heck, I might as well document our incident, whether anyone believes us or not. One more thing I remember. When the sun came up and the 6 o&#39;clock news came on ,they mentioned that several people had reported seeing UFO&#39;S, the night before, going out of the Rockies and into the dessert. I wonder why no one else has written anything about it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was shaped rather like a pencil that has been sharpened at both ends. It was a bright, glowing yellow with two equally bright orange bands which seemed to have a few greyish-green round windows? along the bands. It was moving vertically and the craft was also vertical as if standing on end. I watched it descend and saw it through the trees. I thought it was going to land until I realized it was beyond the horizon. It took maybe 20-30 seconds. I don&#39;t know if it made a sound as I had headphones on and was looking out the window. This happened a long time ago when I was in high school. I was the only one to see it. I would have called my dad into the room except by the time I realized what I was seeing, it was gone. It was very bright in the sky on a clear night, and I remember looking at the clock and noting it was 1:00 a.m.<n>

I was looking out my bedroom window which faces north.  It was a clear night.  I noticed a red disk shaped object hovering in the distance North-North East from my position.  It was stationary for approximately one minute then moved slowly left for a short distance before stopping and hovering again.  I don&#39;t remember if the object shifted in color but I am sure it was primarily red, flickering at times.  There was absolutely no resemblence to a helicopter or airplane I was convinced it was not our ordinary aircraft.  After another minute or so the objecty slowly ascended straight up until it was out of my line of sight.  It is hard for me to estimate the size of the object.  As far as its distance from me, I would guess it was at least 1/2 mile away, towards the direction of Port Jefferson.  In my opinion, this was definately an unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Wind unusually calm. Cloudless sky. Year was approximately 1978. Sitting alone on the deck about 11 pm, I saw A triangular-shaped glowing object, composed of smaller triangles, floated silently from NE to SW over the roof of my house. It went in the direction of the triangle&#39;s point. I ran to the SE corner of the house to see it emerge from the other side of the house but did not see it again. Could not tell how high it was; if it was within 50 yards of the roof, it was about 30-50 feet long; if it was higher, it was much bigger. My background: college graduate, never have done any drugs, never smoked anything, very light drinker. Always have been interested in aviation/ aerospace. At the time I was in my mid 30s with a husband and two young children. My son, also always interested in aviation/ aerospace, is now a pilot for a regional airline.<n>

Position of objects were directly above and slightly south.  Weather and visibility were excellent with no cloud cover.  What I saw  started out as two stationary lights that when looking at seemed to be about an inch apart. These two lights then began to move in straight lines in opposite directions, one moved west and one went east.  I thought initially my eyes were playing tricks on me and really only one was moving giving the appearance of the other moving.  I watched both for at least several minutes as each disappeared   much like how a satellite would at the same speed, etc.  It would be interesting if anyone could explain or give me some sort of explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The cabin had two stories and were sitting on the roof of the first story gazing at the stars. The sky was clear and we were able to see a beautiful show of stars that night. The back of the cabin faced the slope of the hill and we could see the other mountain on the other side and other lit cabins as we enjoyed the sky. After a few minutes we were able to see a moving spec of light low on the horizon and moving between the mountains and as it advanced it lighted the slope of mountains. In a manner of 30 to 45 seconds it was passing above and in front of us as we watched and looked at each other in disbelief as this thing was actually flying in a straight path leaving long streak of ligth green light and making no sound whatsoever and traveling at least 200 to 300 miles per hour.  It continued flying between the mountains leaving it ligth green almost transparent tail which looked more like it was its exhaust or propulsion and ilumiating the slopes as it went by. What really stroke us the most was the absence of noice or sound a normal plane at that altidude would make to travel so low at that speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued on until we lost sight of it.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening in the summer of 1978 my boyfriend&#39;s mother was giving me a ride to a store about 9:30 at night, as the store closed at ten. We were traveling from Lake Elsinore to Perris on highway 74. From certain areas on Highway 74 you can see the jets at March Air Force Base take off and leave. When I had a home right on the highway(Meadowbrook) we would watch the jets take off and land all night.  The roar from the jets was thunderous.  On this night we were at that area where March Air Force Base was very clear to us, and suddenly my boyfriend&#39;s mom, Mary, says &#34;Do you see what I see&#34;  and I really did.  There it was as real as the chair that I am sitting on, It was saucer(disc)shaped, with red, yellow, blue, and green lights in the windows, which circled the craft. The windows looked like they were lit from the inside, and they were flashing,interchanging lights.  The craft was hovering in front of one of the AIR FORCE JETS, staying in front of it, moving back and forth in front of the jets window, for as long as we could see it. It was the most amazing sight that I have ever seen. I know that the jet pilot saw it also.  And not to mention the people at the base.  It is just amazing to me that no one else reported it.  The third amazing thing is the fact that I saw an identical craft six years later.  I was watching the 1984 CLOSING CEREMONY OF THE LOS ANGELES OLYMPIC GAMES when to my surprize they landed an UFO in the Los Angeles COLESEUM.  And it was identical to the craft that I saw at March Air Force Base six years earlier.  You can imagine the questions that fill my head.  Who built the craft at the Olympics?  Where did they store it?  Did they ever test run it?  What is it capable of?   I personally think that they modeled the craft after sightings, rather than that being the same craft, because the one I saw could maintain its position in front of a jet as it was taking off, or landing. I&#39;m not sure which it was doing, coming or going, but I could tell the UFO seemed to be taunting the jet. ! No trai l or sound could be heard, except for the jet sounds.  From where we were positioned we could not see any beings inside the craft. I wish the pilots,like the one in the jet that night in 1978, would begin to speak about what they have seen. Thank you very much.  ((initials deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We were not aware that a UFO had landed during the 1984 Olympics.  If that occurred, we suspect it was a planned, or staged, part of the ceremony.   PD))<n>

The UFO followed them until they arrived at our home in Kansas, about 5 miles. My mother brought my brother (15 yrs old) and I (12) at the time and now 37, out side to see this object hovering over the house. The UFO was shaped something like a foot ball the length of about 2 school busses but with many white and red lights on the underside. As all of us gathered outside I mentioned to my mother we should get a picture of this. At that moment I do believe we were taken aboard the craft. I don&#39;t remember being on board but we lost about 45 min. The last thing I remember was being inside our home with both my parents as they were looking a blank T.V. screen and my brother was later found at the front of the house outside. My brother didn&#39;t remember anything about this but has been visited many times to this day only saying that he was with a small girl in all cases and she has never revealed herself. My mother only remembers the craft as they were driving home. My father doesn&#39;t remember anything to this day. At the time that this happened none of us remember this ever happening until about 8 yrs later. We still talk about this when we see one another. There are not any markings on my parents or brother but I do have a scare on my left ankle about 4 in long that I or my family do not know how it got there and is still visible today that may have been made by a surgical device and now has something visible under the skin. I&#39;ll get this looked at some day soon. I only hope that some one will read this and possibly notify me if they were in Kansas at the time and remember anything.

She was excited about something she&#39;d been watching on the drive out and had my grandfather, her mother, herself and I get into my grandfather&#39;s car and drive toward the object she&#39;d been watching.  The object had been hovering over the WDAY tower directly east of the town of Amenia, ND since she had spied it on her drive home or longer.  We drove southwest toward it from the farm and then straight west toward it on the Amenia Township road.   I recall that the object was the same vibrant orange color as the low summer sun, as if it were reflecting or glowing that color.  As the four of us drove closer I noticed other vehicles driving toward the sight also.  We must have been a mile or so from the WDAY tower when it suddenly began to move off in a zig-zag pattern and then shot off to the southeast at a higher altitude and incredible speed and immediately disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t imagine now why we didn&#39;t speak to any of the other people that came to look at this UFO but I would love to find anyone else that saw this spectactle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later,(1986??) my grandfather came over to my parent&#39;s house one morning as he often did when I still lived there and had another odd story to tell.  He and his wife had decided to sleep in a different room upstairs that they hoped would be a little cooler.  It is the only room upstairs that has west facing windows.  During the night they were awoke to find all the lights on in the house, however when they tried the switches they found they were already off- the light was coming from an outside source.  Grandpa got the shotgun, although he said later he didn&#39;t know what he would have shot.  I can&#39;t remember how long he said that incident lasted but he had no explanation for it.  It  came and went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently, in November of 2006 I was out late at night looking for my Siamese  and checking her usual spots.  One of her favorites is by the far north shelterbelt of the yard, behind some of the outbuildings. I circled around the quonset on this night as I often do when trying to find her, and as I started to return toward the house, I &#34;felt&#34; a large flying object glide over the quonset and cross the yard.  The sound was similar to an airplane gliding, power off.  I even ducked.  I could sense it go over me, but there was nothing I could visibly see.  I am familiar with hawks and owls in my yard and this was nothing like that.  I fly airplanes and this is where I come up with the similarity to an airplane gliding, but there was definitely a feeling of this thing going over, as if the air pressure had changed between me and the object.  I often watch airplanes flying over and I know how you can see them long before you hear them at night or even see their flashing strobes or wing tip lights.  This was entirely different.  It was at the altitude of the trees surrounding the yard and stealthy and invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

My captain and I were commercial fishing for salmon off  California coast.   The wind came up real bad and  we ran the vessel to an anchorage  of near Pointe Reyes. California. North of San Francisco.  A small anchorage it was. As a deckhand, I  began to do my work icing the fish.     There was another vessel in the same  area.  It had not called to us, as we left our marine radio on. It was late afternoon.  But still light. before dusk.  It has been some time but I will try to tell as i remember.   As I was looking out of the fish hold, I noticed  a large bright Golden Light as it came over the Pointe of Land north of the anchorage.  The Light was round. It stopped above the Land. Then 4 more arrived.  One at a time, lining up and hovering.   A straight line.  They  were not way up in the sky, but say, like a Seattle space needle distance, (maybe almost a couple).  Somewhere during this I yelled to the Captain to come out of the vessel cabin.  They , my captain, stood near, as by then I was out of the fish hold and on deck.  The  Round Sun-like Lights  did  what looked like manuvers.     They   lined up, and did different formations, changing from one to another. They all did this in close distence to one another.  Such as  a cross, a long line,  maybe a sort of pyrimid. They did this for a while. It seemed to be all for us watching. This kind of dance in the low sky.  As time went on, one Round Sun-like Light came to our vessel. It hovered above directly.  As I looked up, all I could see was the same form we had seen from a distence. It did not hurt my eyes. I saw no craft. It hovered low, but the Glow from it did not surround the vessel. I looked for a long time up. Finally, I looked around, and noticed my Captain was gone! I ran yelling their name to the cabin of the vessel.  I found them below deck. On their bunk, with a book in their hands, looking down. I said &#34;What are you doing in here? They are still ou! tside! &#34;    My Captain notified me,  they could not deal with ! it, and they were not going back out.       I left them, and returned to the deck. The Light Ship as I will call it. Was still there.  I stood there more time, with it overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally it lifted up in the sky, and returned to the other 4 that had been hovering in a straight line.        Once again,  different directional manuvers were done, then all took off together. Very fast in a northerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they left, a voice came over the radio, we had left on the whole time. We had not called anyone during this. the voice was a young crewman from the only other vessel nearby.  He said.  &#34;Did you see That!?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I responded to his call,   but then my Captain came up, from the bunks below deck.        I do not remember right now the further talk, but it was brief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still had work to do to ice the fish.  It was now getting dusk, though not dark.  There were no clouds during this time.  My Captain did not want to speak of this  much.   The Coast Guard was called, and was asked of anything going on that day/afternoon. No. No flares. Nothing reported by them. We did not report to them our sighting.    The strange Lights  left, and next day so did we. Once in port. We drove out and questioned the locals in the area. Not much to say, but they had seen strange lights off and on they said.   I do not remember the other vessels name.  I do not feel I should say mine, at this time, nor my Captains name.   I can say this, one year later in Oregon, south of Bandon, I saw what I think were the same 5 Light Ships.  They appeared just before dusk just off the beach, as I was looking from the land out to sea.  I was praying for guidence, as i had some decisions to make. The  5  Round Sun-like objects, lined up in front of me over the ocean.  Then just flew off very fast. It seemed to just let me know they were there.   I ended up living for a time in that area. there is more,   more sightings. i have entered a few others.  ! The other sightings were different craft. Not just a Light.! I ente red of the sighting of the Phoenix Triangle craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will end this now. if I can remember more, I will add it.  It has been some time.  I do not tell people. very few know of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> thank, for letting me share this.  maybe, that young man from the other vessel will, or has told his side of what happened.  He did say, that he had not wakened his Captain, who had a bad heart, and was sleeping.  So he had been a crew like me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

A saucer shaped craft came an hovered over my friends backyard where some 20 plus people were playing frisbee, volleyball, touch football and enjoying a hearty cookout. The craft came down and landed in my friend&#39;s backyard. a door opened and two tall, slender gray colored, about 6&#39;2&#34; and about 6&#39;4&#34; beings, came out and floated across the yard. The crowd panicked and backed away. My friend&#39;s mother ran out of the house screaming for everyone to get back. My friend&#39;s younger sister was frozen like a statue. These two beings floated across the yard,toward the frozen blonde haired young lady. Her mother ran right at the two beings screaming no you can&#39;t take my daughter. One of the beings raised their hand knocking the running mother over backwards, rendering her unconscious. The two beings came and took the daughter by the arms, floated back to the hovering craft, doors opened, in they went and the craft left slowly at first, then disappeared very quickly. The daughter was never returned. Since the summer of 1978, my friend&#39;s sister has never been seen again. The mother had a complete nervous breakdown, as she told of her own abductions. Officially the daughter&#39;s disappearance, has been categorized by the local police and FBI as an unsolved kidnapping. Everyone I have told this story to has never believed me. The mother told me of her own abductions as well as her daughter&#39;s abductions as a small child. The daughter had just become 18 years old about 6 weeks before she was taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked up over my shoulder to see how much sun I was getting and saw a huge cigar shaped object sliding through the sky at no more than 200 feet up.  It was very shiny, seemless and big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was heading south east at a slow steady rate.  There was no indication of a propulsion system.  It was the same in front as in back.  It confused my senses because it was so huge that it should have been making some kind of noise.  I couldn&#39;t even hear it displacing air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in view for no more than 10 seconds maybe less before the apartment complex next to my parents house obscured it.  About 15 to 30 seconds after it left my view a military jet fighter came right behind it low and slow.  The fighter validated my sense perception since it was obviously following the UFO and was loud.  It was very unusual for a fighter to be flying so low and slow over a populated suburban area.  I had never seen a jet fighter do that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I went outside that morning and within a few minutes I did see some heavenly body streak across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before I was about to go back inside to bed, I saw something else that I&#39;ve never seen the likes of before or since.  In the not too distant night sky I saw a disc shaped object floating slowly towards me. It was very brightly colored (the lights alternated red, blue, green and orange in a circular pattern around the object).  I was transfixed by this sight as it inched towards our house. Over the next twenty minutes it floated closer and closer to the yard where I was standing. After about ten minutes of observation it was clear to me that this object was approaching and would soon be directly over head. I would estimate the disc at about 500ft in diameter and flying about 500ft in the air. There were times when it appeared to come to a dead stop and simply hover, then begin floating slowly closer. The flickering alternating colorful lights were the most striking thing about it and I remember wondering what government technology could produce such an object. At about the 20 minute mark in the sighting, the object was nearly directly over my head and I remember a strong fear coming over me. I was afraid of being spotted by this craft and went back inside the house. From various windows inside I continued to watch the object as it flew over the front of the house and I ended up in my bedroom watching it pass over the back yard. The object never made a sound. There were a bunch of trees behind the house a few hundred yards away; once the object glided over those trees it appeared to descend further. I watched it hover just above those trees for another 10 minutes or so before it ascended and quickly flew ou! t of sig ht. No airplane, weather balloon, or helicopter that I know of could account for that sighting. I will never forget what I saw that night and I have come to believe that others have seen the same thing as well.<n>

At the time, I was a teenager.  I was working and got off shift from my parttime job and was going home.  As I was walking up the crescent to my parents&#39; home I heard sounds/noises that were not of this world!  I looked to my left (there was a field there at the time), and saw really strange lights.  I cannot explain it, but they were the type of lights that I have never experienced before.  They were so bright and I am amazed that no one saw them (not that I am aware of).  But what frightened me the most was the strange sound.  I wish I could explain the sound, but after twenty-six years, I am still shaken by it.  I ran home as fast as I could, rang the doorbell so that my mom or dad could open the door.  I was way too shaken to use my house key.  Anyway, my father answered and he could tell by my face that I was scared to death.  I told my parents and my dad ran up to our 3rd floor and looked out the window.  All he could see was those lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said before, to this day I am still shaken by the events that occurred in July of 1978.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone else experienced something like this?  Is anyone out there still shaken by an event that happened over 25 years ago?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/15/78 00:00|Santa Fe (Pecos Wilderness)|NM|Light|15 mins, plus|Dull red giant "bracelet" at Santa Fe Baldy mountain,summer 1978, Pecos Wilderness, New Mexico|1/19/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41161.html|42|ndxe197807| Dull red giant &#34;bracelet&#34; at Santa Fe Baldy mountain,summer 1978, Pecos Wilderness, New Mexico<n> <n><n> <n><n> I studied journalism, learning to answer who, what, when, where, why, how, how much, and how little for 3 college years. I&#39;m 60 now, but not a professionnal journalist. Now I&#39;m an artist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In probably July (or August) of 1978, I arrived on trail 254, I believe it was, at the base of Santa Fe Baldy mountain, in the Pecos Wilderness, just east of Santa Fe city, New Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Checked my watch at midnight there, had walked in 4 miles, and here it began. I saw lots of fog upon leaving the tree covered part of the trail, especially to the West, or left of me. In this fog were small, perhaps 1/4 or 1/2 inch across, lights of a dull red color. They started out a foot or two off the ground, and went slowly straight up, to perhaps 4 or 5 feet, then arched over such as a flair gun would create, but I did not see anything like a flare gun. Some lights may have gone farther,up to 10 feet..<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights moved slower than any rising anything I had ever seen. I could euphemistically say time slowed down for these rising lights. But this is only a description, not a claim of time slowing down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching this for a few minutes, I walked into the area where the lights were, which had ground brush and a few higher bushes, but the lights disappeared before I could reach them. They were spread out over 25 plus feet parallel to the trail, and launching at random intervals. I went back  to the trail and waited but no new lights appeared. So I walked further on the trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was considerable fog about, and I turned right to sit on a log and rest. After a while, I saw huge red lights, like balloons 100 feet across each. They were linked by a chain of the same dull red color and its intensity as the &#34;balloons&#34;, indeed as the &#34;flair&#34; lights now 50 feet back on the trail. This braclet configuration, was laid across the top of Santa Fe Baldy, as if a giant child had dropped it on the mountain, above its tree line (thus Santa Fe Baldy) so that the center of the bracelet was where the top of the montain was and the braclet&#39;s &#34;balloon&#34; fobs were perfectly horizontally surrounding the mountain a few hundred feet down from the top of the mountain. I estimated 2 or 3 such fobs would be behind the mountain, where I could see nothing. I saw either 5 or 7 that were partially or fully in view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This dull red color was consistent throughout both the fobs and the thin chain that linked them. I was stupefied and opened up a candy bar. There was no noise whatsoever, and I realized there was no 3 dimensional depth to any of the fobs. I took them to be spheres, nevertheless, rather than discs. The fog cleared a small amount and I was more sure of the sphere shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I sat there some non-corporeal &#34;spirit&#34; type beings, two, one adult male and one apparently teen male,wearing white robes, sort of like the proverbial ghost,floated in from behind me on the left, a foot or so off the ground. I was used to that having extensively practiced mediumship (I become a human telephone between this world and the &#34;spirit world&#34; whether for departed humans or never incarnated intelligent beings) but this appearance was the last thing I expected in this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The taller adult one telepathized to me: &#34;Too many doorways!&#34; So what? So what does that mean? Oh... I had been thinking of climbing up for a closer look. Had done it in the daylight before, and even that was rugged. He repeated the warning. Then the shorter, apparent teen (say 17 to 18 years old) said: yes, that I could actually get killed doing it. I thought nonesense, and was unmoved by them. The older one then kept repeating &#34;Too many doorways!&#34;  Too MANY doorways, I thought, what does MANY have to do with it? I thought about it for some time and pretended to agree not to make an effort to climb Santa Fe Baldy there that night. The spirits levitated back to where they came from behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I chuckled to myself &#34;Like Hell!&#34;  Daddy and Junior came back and Daddy yelled (telepathically): &#34;I said &#39;Too many doorways!&#39;.&#34; I was mad, but yielded. (Damn spirits, I thought, too holy to say more than a word or two. And god forbid there should be a discussion with them. Thank hell for important people! ((No, they weren&#39;t demons, just jerks.))  They left and I continued watching. Nothing changed. I saw no movement. I realized the fog probably obscured the dull red something from being seen at all down below some 3,000 feet in Santa Fe. I watched some more, got bored, remembered if this were a ufo something, its power system could be extremely dangerous, and so decided not to spend the night nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked away from the mountain for 2 miles and arrived at my reserved camp site at 2am, and the walk was hard because I felt very tired. I couldn&#39;t figure out why I should be so tired, and this walk seemed to take forever.  Then, when I got to Spirit Lake, on the near side, I had to walk through a group of 15 or so, late-high school or early college age kids, 2 or so of which were girls. They had no camping equipment, but 2 or 3 other young guys did. I went through them and followed the shore of the 50 yard-acrosss-lake to the far side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There I resolved to awake at 10am completely refreshed. I ate a bit, zonked out, and woke at 10 am &#34;completely refreshed.&#34; Only the kids with gear were on the far side of the lake, groggily rising. The 15 kids were nowhere and I guessed they were at a camp somewhere not too far away. I ate, packed up, and walked back the way I came, without incident, to the car six miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s all, for that situation, at least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There&#39;s a lot more, best for another time, when I have more energy. I&#39;m 60 years old and this happened 28 years ago. Thank you for reading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

I am the person reporting dull red light on Mountain Santa Fe Baldy. I am the journalism backgrounded writer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Loose ends for part one. in 1978, when this occurred,I didn&#39;s need, nor used any prescription, nor any hallucinogenics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said, the next morning I woke about 10am, very rested and refreshed, ate and headed back by the same route I came in the night before. No manifestation of the dull red light was anywhere. Everything was completely normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night in Santa Fe, I saw the same dull red light, in the sky in the southern area of Santa Fe. This time it was a single light, going on and off like a plane might do. Due to the dull red color it appeared slightly fuzzy, and was heading south, slowly, like a light airplane might appear to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Off and on for several nights, weeks, a few months such appeared in the night sky. In late 1978, I moved to Denver, CO. With some friends I went during the summer on an overnight backpacking trip in the mountains, about 100 miles west of Denver. That night I saw another one of the dull red lights flying in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped bothering to look for them. But, 20 years later, I saw a red light and heard a simultaneous sound of a light plane engine, for a few seconds. It was also dull, located just above the buildings east of the intersection of E. Evans and S. University, on the north side of E. Evans. I had just come from Chamberlain Observatory where I had viewed Saturn with their older but powerful telescope. There the astronomer lecturing for 45 minutes, started by telling people who wanted to talk about flying saucers to leave. A legitimate request, since it was his show, that of Denver University, and conventional science. Later, I viewed Saturn through the telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This viewing of a dull red light lasted 5 -10 seconds, and when it went behind the building from my viewpoint, the airplane engine noise also went away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why all the continuation of this dull red light, starting in 1978 as on the land of the mountain, plus the &#34;flare gun&#34; effect, then appearing in the night sky like planes? Then the final light appearing and disappearing in the busy intersection at night?  Kind of every which way but loose. A saying in journalism is: Believe nothing of what you hear, and then only a tiny fraction of that. I&#39;m a long way from a conclusion of what I saw, UFO or not. Someone has a book in which he said Martians have a cave under Santa Fe Baldy where they live and do whatever, but I don&#39;t remember the author or specifics. And there&#39;s been some remote viewing, which is a close relative of the clairvoyance I have used at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because the continuity of the appearances of the dull red light in whatever shape, bracelet or single light in sky, I record this. The bracelet did not fly, of course. And I was certainly puzzled by the flat appearance of the bracelet&#39;s fobs, which could have been due to the fog present thickly at first, and thinner later on, but making a false visual of flatness, even though otherwise it &#34;should have&#34; been a sphere (each fob).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Heard the saying &#34;You make your own karma.&#34;? This means whatever you do, you set in motion some of whatever happens next. Go to Santa Fe Baldy and use your wits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, this was in 1978. I haven&#39;t been back there since. I did not record these events at the time, that I recall. If I go back into researching these memorable events, I think I&#39;ll really want to seek out more current events. I do notice that I almost never, if at all, see accounts of dull red lights in UFO reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, there is more to this story than I have told, and I suspect it would take a small book to cover it all. I&#39;ve seen enough Science Fiction to help with scenarios which could illuminate these events, however indirectly. And I think there are multiple possibilities for the &#34;story&#34; of these dull red lights, including UFO source and non-UFO sources. And I had no direct reason to believe I was abducted in the 1978 or subsequent sightings of the &#34;something.&#34;  Thank you for reading this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

7/14/78 22:30|Spokane|WA|Disk|15-20 mins|A friend and I were driving and saw something odd in the sky coming towards us. We pulled over along with some other people to watch.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03279.html|43|ndxe197807| A friend and I were driving and saw something odd in the sky coming towards us. We pulled over along with some other people to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I had left work in the valley to run up to the northside to pick something up and bring it back to our work. It was getting close to closing time so it was probably around 10:30pm when we were headed south on the old Argonne highway. I was driving and I happened to look out my window. I spotted what looked like headlights  shining thru the trees on top of a mountain. I said to my friend, &#34;look at that car on the mountain&#34;. I then realized that it couldn&#39;t be a car because if a car was up there we wouldn&#39;t have been able to see it&#39;s headlights.Then we quickly noticed that it was moving in the sky heading our way. We saw a couple of cars pulled off the road ahead and people were standing outside watching so we pulled over too. We were shivering by then, excited and scared at the same time cause we couldn&#39;t figure out what it was. The only thing I really remember is the lights. It had a center light big and round and two smaller lights one on each side of the middle light. They were bright white lights. It came right towards us moving very very slow and I heard a very very faint hum. It seemed so close, like if I craweled to the top of a tree I could have reached out and touched the bottom. I don&#39;t really remember seeing the actual craft, but in my mind I know it was like a round disk not flat but maybe with a slighly rounded belly to it, but the lights were so bright you couldn&#39;t see it anyway. It passed over us and continued on and we all stood there dumbfounded our hearts racing until we couldn&#39;t see it over the treetops anymore. All of us that were standing there just looked at each other and said wow, what was that. My friend and I got into the car and headed back to work, we had the creeps the rest of the night. I had no knowledge of any aircraft that could fly so low, quiet and slow. Before this incident I saw the same type craft when I slept over at a different friends house one summer. It must have been the summer of 77, I was fifteen at the time. We were in our sleeping bags in the backyard. It was late maybe 11:00 pm. We were laying there talking and staring at the stars. There were alot of trees in her neighborhood and in her yard. Anyway we were just laying there looking up at the beautiful stars and then we saw this craft pass over us so slow, virtually no sound and the same lights as I described before. We were so scared, we waited for it to pass over before we lept up and raced into the house screaming and freaking out. We jumped into her bed and pulled the covers over our heads. This one was also flying very low, seemed like treetop level. Too close for comfort! Of course we told everyone but no one believed us. I am now 36 years old and have not seen anything like this since, although I would like to. My grandmother lives in Newman Lake , Wa and she has watched crafts play what she calls war games over her house. I wish I could have been there to see that! Don&#39;t know how often it has happened but I know she&#39;s observed them several times. I think she said these were colorful lights and they would zoom through the sky doing quick turns and racing back in the opposite direction. This wasn&#39;t just a brief display, these war games lasted maybe 45 minutes or so.<n>

When from space it seemed a formation of flashing light drop down in front of us and begain flashing.  They looked orb like and moved from one side of the horizon to the other then back agian flashing hypnoticly and moving very fast. They were very many people watching as well from the beach.My friend and I were very shocked to see such a thing and were very elliated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> then about 15mn into this light show of flashing orbs we heard a sonic boom,we look to or right to see 2 jet fighters flying at mock speed to intercept these orbs.  It was the first time I have seen a jet break the sound barrier!<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the jets got close to these orbs they shot strate up into space where we saw three red lights in the form of a delta!  The jets continued flying around in circles looking for the orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the strange thing about this was lack of any coverage in the news but people talked about it in town for a while.  Have never seen a report to date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Where we met a man named ((Name deleted)). He was camping on the very spot where I saw the sreak. He had a bike with a trailer that was called the blue streak. He also claimed to be chased by u.f.o.&#39;s all his life. There&#39;s a little more to this regaurding our meeting with him. I would like to know if any more sightings of blue streaks have occured. And if anyone knows of this ((Name deleted)) man.(I think he&#39;s from canada, and was a teacher)<n>

Night sky was clear with bright stars but dark due to new moon. Air was warm and wind was calm.  We pulled over on the west side of road to allow a passenger to relieve himself and I decided to stretch my legs. I was looking at the stars when I noticed a dark spot over the horse pasture on the east side of the road. As I looked closer, I noticed that the void was triangular. I asked the other three to look in that direction and we became alarmed as we realized that the total blackness was totally motionless and silent. No way to judge it&#39;s altitude but it seemed to be about 400 feet up which would put the dimensions at about 150 feet wide and 180 feet long. We looked at it for about 3 minutes and then noticed a feeling of a soundless resonance in our chests that was like a breeze but also like a vacuum and just then the perimeter of the triangle seemed to start glowing with many dots of a red-oran! ge color. The dots were numerous with approximately two to three dot widths between each dot. *  *  * The craft began to tip upward maybe 5-7 degrees and there was a single sound kind of like an electrical breaker and two front facing headlights began to power up. Not unusually bright at first but gradually becoming so bright that you could see the well defined beam for miles in the night humidity. The north facing craft gradually crept forward only a few feet as the speed seemed to increase log rhythmically. It was about 300 feet ahead when we jumped back in the car and followed. It went about 2 miles and turned 90° left at about 80 mph. We turned left on Grand View Road and followed for a mile by which time the craft seemed to be 20-30 miles away and all we could see was a twinkling light heading west toward Tulsa. There seemed to be a trail behind the craft like the one I saw behind the space shuttle years later as it streaked across Texas toward Florida.  After the initial left turn, the craft maintained a constant course but the original elevation seemed to lessen to ab! out 3°. We then drove off after agreeing not to discuss any talk of our encounter or of UFOs with anyone ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My father and I were driving a U-Haul truck.  We were returning an empty U-Haul truck to Tullahoma, TN.  We were moving from Tullahoma TN to Athens AL.  We had just Accessed Interstate 65 N from AL State Hwy 72.  We had just passed a roadside welcoming center on the left of the interstate going toward the Tennessee State line.  About 1:00 p.m., I looked up and above the tree line on the right side of the hwy was a huge silver ball.  It was a hot sunny clear day not a cloud in the sky.  I said to my father, &#34;Hey, look at that!&#34;  He said, &#34;It looks like a weather balloon.&#34;  I said, &#34;No it is not!&#34;  We argued about it.  We studied it for a little while and then stopped the truck.  We got out to look at it were we had a good view.  As we were debating, If it were a weather balloon or not, a door slid open in a downward motion near the bottom of the object.  We stood motionless watching!  We stood there in silence.  A smaller silver ball came out of the opening and went to our right.  Then as second came out and went to our left.   They both hovered there for about five minutes.  The small silver ball that came out second returned to the opening first.  Likewise the first went back in the opening.  The door shut slowly.  It sat motionless for a few more minutes.  Then began moving slowly toward the NE.  Suddenly with incredible speed it went upward and to the NE out of view.  My father and I in silence got back into the truck.  We said nothing to one another.  My father spoke first.  He said, There is no sense in telling anyone what we have seen.  No one would believe it anyway.&#34;  We continued on our journey in silence.<n>

Moving very slowly though the air. at the front the shape was round and thick, then it had like a narrow neck, about half as wide as the saucer shaped front. It then widened to like a square shape, but with wings, two sets of wings, like an aircraft.But the strange thing was that the front wings were much smaller than the back wings. And instead of faceing the back of the craft they angled to the front. The back wings were at the end of the craft, angled in the same direction.but were much larger than the front wings.  I could see details on the craft, but what I remember most was the what I think was the power jet out put ports????? Thats the only way I can decribe them. maybe 8 2 rows of 4. could see what looked like portholes on the side of the main square main body,it had so much detail, so dark and silnent, .I must of had watched it past over for at least 30 mins. beleive me ornot this was not made in the USA ,and it made a beleiver out of me.

I was down by the lake when I saw what I thought was a shooting star, but as I watched it,it stoped.  I was puzzled because a shooting star doesnt just stop in mid air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it turned into a round glow and started moving very slowly toward us.  When it was streaking like a star it seems very far away, but when it turned into this glow it seemed to be very close very fast, althought it seemed to be moving very slow.  I was so stunned I ran to the boat dock and started yelling for everyone to come and see this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then 2 of my sons came running down as the craft started to have pulsating lights that were rotating around the craft.  It stayed! there for a few minutes and then started to move away, when it started to move it turned into the white glow again.  then it was gone.  There was no sound.<n>

We were watching the annual fireworks display put on by the GM company. It was a clear night with a small amount of wind blowing from the west to the east. About 15 minutes into the show the light from some high fireworks lite up an object traveling from the east to the west. It looked strange and was traveling against the wind and didn&#39;t have any lights on. I was able to get a closer look at it with a pair of binoculars that I kept in the car. As the object passed over the GM plant the lights of the plant illuminated the object and gave us a better view. My sister and I took turns veiwing the object with the binoculars. We watched it until it faded into the darkness in the western sky. My sister and I then independantly made seperate drawings of what we saw. We then compared the drawing and they were the same. The object looked like 3 sphere&#39;s connected togeather by a Y type structure. One shere was attached to each end of the Y and the object appeared to rotate around the middle of the Y. There was&#39;nt anyway to determine the size or speed or distance or color of the object. We only know what it looked like illuminated by the GM lights.<n>

This was on the rooftop of a friend, very near Reseda Park in the SFV.  I told my friend, &#34;We’re going to see a UFO tonight.&#34;  After the fireworks died down, and overhead aircraft thinned out, I turned around facing north and saw what looked like a red ruby in the sky, although its steady brilliance was like that of a red wine with light shining behind and through it.  I said to my friend, &#34;There it is, there’s the UFO I told you we would see.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said it was an airliner, but when he realized it wasn’t moving, he guessed it might be a blimp.  We were probably looking up at it 30 degrees.  It began moving toward the east, gradually, slowly, and then stopped.  It did this several times over a period of about ten minutes.  By the time it was in the SE sky, and suddenly became a pinpoint of light, my friend could not see it anymore, because he had taken his eyes off of it.  I was fixed on it.  I thought it might be rapidly ascending upward.  But after a few minutes, it suddenly manifested its original diameter and circumference.  It appeared as the original ruby red when we first saw it, changed to a brilliant orange, then to yellow, and lastly to a pure pearl white before disappearing.  About ten minutes later, it reappeared in a NE direction, and both my friend and I watched it suddenly shift from a round orb or oval to a red semi-circular arc, followed instantly by a neon-blue flash, before disappearing.  The event was reported in a local newspaper, and I was quoted in two paragraphs.  An airline pilot, I learned from the writer of the news article, who was not quoted in the paper, told the reporter that he had observed the UFO and estimated it was 250 feet in diameter.  My next door neighbor, and his friend from down the street, were standing in my front yard looking straight up at what he said was a very large brilliant orange ‘ball’ of light.  The reporter told me that some officials were saying college students from a local city ! college were releasing gas filled balloons, timed to go off.  But the steadiness of the colors, and the size of the object, as witnessed by my next-door neighbor, a professional pilot, and myself compel me to believe that this was not some prank, but a real UFO sighting.<n>

It stayed for 30 seconds and then shot off at an angle toward space in an instant it was gone.  It made no sound.The odd thing about it is that only one sister and myself recall the event.  The rest of my family,( 4 others), although i know they looked right at the object in wonder,can&#39;t remember seeing it.

It was black in color and had a bright red light in the center with double lights like an = sign running from this center towards each corner of the triangle.  It moved from the east to the south before it just disappeared from our view.  After it was gone we both gathered ourselves to speak about this.  My father was in aeronautics so I new this was not an aircraft.  My cousin who is two years older than myself could confirm this as well.

They look as far as we could tell in the dark , except for the lights which gave us an idea as to the shap. The shape was that of a furnace flying slow with white and blue almost an electrical blue on the top. Around the center were an amber colored litebut sharper a color I&#39;ve ever seen.Now , On the bottom the only lites i seem to remember were spot lights that I could see hiting the tops of the houses at the bottom of the hill. It was really weird ! I was almost scared. These were at tree top level and never made a sound. I&#39;ll never forget that long as I live. Incredable is all I can say. Thanks for your time !

At that point my mother said look at that moon and I said that is no moon however it was the clasic color of the rising harvest moon.At that point it started moving south and up at about 30 degrees. It made no sound and excelerated at a tremendous rate in a strate line turning continuously lighter in color untill it apeared to be no more than a star that continued in the same direction untill it was to far and faint to see.This took no more than 20 seconds from the time that it started to move. I am rather certin on the size as it&#39;s dianiter was as close as i was able to toll the same as the top of the roof.I have been in the military and it was not a plane or conventional air craft.it made no manoover other than a strate line it made no sound although it had obviously exceaded the sound barier several times.I now work in electronics and know of no way of doing this. It was a solid object below the high tree line it had no markings or visible openings. it was not a reflection and when we aproched it was aparent that it was centered above the house that is still standing. and to the bottom was not over 45 feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Slowly it approched over the pond and dropped a long cylinder into the pond and started sucking up water.  I got scared and ran into the house to hide under the couch.  My brother runs in and says we have to tell Mom and the other parents.  We run to the next house and in panic we expalin what is going on right outside.  At first they thought we were just kidding.  But finally we got them to come outside and by that time it was moving off into the distance.  I remember seeing three little heads looking out of the craft.  The faces was not clear but you could definetly see them.  That was the time I ran into the house.  I&#39;ve asked my brother about this over the years from time to time and he remembers it just as I did.  My Mom also remembers us coming to her about this.  Thats was my only sighting ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 1985 I realized I my psychic abilities was getting stronger and realized that maybe this sighting was a sign to me.  About 10 p.m. in the evening my friends and I were in a hotel parking lot going to a club when we looked up in the sky and noticed with about 10 other people something zooming or shooting from very far in the sky to right over our heads - like when a plane is ready to land and you feel it is going right over your head.  This oval shaped silver aluminum looking UFO, was as it the oval was on its side with a very bright white light surrounding the whole equipment.  My concern was that I did not have my camera.  It stood over our heads for about 45 seconds with no sound - and then it zoomed extremely fast into the same spot in the sky it came from.  It did not fly - it zoomed.  A plane takes time to fly and does not stop with no noise. I believe in UFOs since that day.  I have an MBA and am an intelligent individual.  I know I am not alone - I just wish I had a camera - I could have been famous. Also, last week I saw a very large meteorite which was silver white and royal blue.  It looked like fireworks but it did not breakup until it disappeared right before it was going to hit the beach area. Till my next sighting...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I&#39;ll never forget it. It was the most amazing thing that I had ever witnessed. We thought we were looking at a satellite, until we were informed that satellites are constant... do not spin nor jut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was triagular. It must have been huge, because we could see it vividly within the stars. It had lights all around it that only shined around it when it was stopped. When the U.F.O. moved, the arrow heard would point into the direction it was travelling to-then jut to that position. Stop -spin-lights also spinning- point into another direction ..then jut to that position. It did this until it was out of our focus range.<n>

I thought I would mention this.  My companion at the time also saw this as you&#39;ll read below, but he has refrained from speaking about it.  But this is my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was flying right seat in a Cessna 172 from Flint &#34;Bishop&#34; MI going to Toledo &#34;Express&#34; Ohio.  I was flying with another broadcast engineer as we were returning from work in Lapeer, MI.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note the map attached to an E-mail I&#39;m going to send.  Our flight path is in blue heading south.  The dots on Monroe County show where we deviated from our path, almost landing at Lambertville &#34;Suburban&#34; MI.  The red is the path of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dusk and we heading South around Milan, MI, just talking about a directional antenna that we were working on.  I turned to the left to speak to my companion, &#34;Tom&#34;, and saw (5) white lights in the distance.  I made mention to Tom, and he saw them too, about 315 degrees from our direction of travel (South).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them for about 30 seconds, and could tell that their travel was to the west.  We called the control tower for Toledo Express and asked if he had travel ((traffic??)) in the area.  Toledo said no.  Another 30 seconds later we called again, and Toledo responded by saying, &#34;sir, we have no traffic and nothing on radar&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time they were about 340 degrees and growing larger, which to me indicated that  were closing on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then another pilot who was in Fulton County (Ohio) came on the radio and said, &#34;I see those lights too.  I&#39;m heading toward Metcalf (SE of Toledo), and they are 10-O&#39;Clock to me.&#34;  Toledo Express then came back on the air and said, &#34;Gentlemen, we don&#39;t have any traffic in the area.&#34;  Tom and looked at each other, and he said, &#34;let&#39;s chase it.&#34;   I suggested that it would not be wise not knowing what it was, or if it was military, and deviated from our flight plan to waste some time and put some distance between each other.  See the dots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we landed we talked about it, but felt that any pursuit of the story could lead to jeopardy of our pilots license.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The five lights were in a formation, and it was a clear night and at it&#39;s closest I could see clouds between the objects which appeared to be about 2,000 higher than we were.  We were around 5,000 feet.  At our closest they were probably between 4 to 6 miles off our right wing.  The formation was not in any pattern that would resemble lights on an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, although the pilot should be able to reconstruct the exact time and date from his flight logs.  The witness elects to remain totally anonymous, so we are unable to communicate with him.  We would like to invite the party who submitted the report to confirm the date with the pilot, and report back to us.  PD))<n>

Looked up and saw 3 triangular shaped ufos, looked like very heavy metal, no noise, no wind, just beams coming from one going off and on as if searching for something in the field.  All 3 started moving very slowly across the field and I watched them as they crossed over the highway below and slowly disappeared.  I can draw what they looked like, rough sketch, but saw another drawing by someone else many years later on a television special, not same time or area though.  My daughter was with me at the time but she was only 5 or 6, don&#39;t remember exactly, and she only has vague memory of this happening.

7/1/78 17:30|Carson|CA|Unknown|5 Min|For about 5 minutes  I watched an odd shaped  object in the sky over the city of Carson, Ca, that was then chased by 4 Military jets.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51166.html|72|ndxe197807| For about 5 minutes  I watched an odd shaped  object in the sky over the city of Carson, Ca, that was then chased by 4 Military jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just got off work and stopped at my folks house in Carson California to pick up my son. Carson is about 18 miles south of down town Los Angeles. It was about 5:30 PM on a weekday in July in 1978 or 79. My folks house is in the suburbs with curbs, gutters and alot of homes.  As I pulled up in front of the house an old friend pulled up accross the street to see his family. We stood on the sidewalk talking. It was a perfectly clear afternoon with a strong breeze, no clouds and a real blue sky. A blue sky is very important to me. There were several kites flying real high in the sky. As we were talking I noticed that one of the kites was very high. I point out how high it was to my friend but he looked and didn&#39;t see it. He always had bad eyesite so I just let it go. While talking I kept looking up at this one kite. It didn&#39;t act like a kite. It didn&#39;t bounch around in the sky like a kite, it just stayed still in one spot. Then it quickly came down lower. I told my friend the string must have broke. He looked but still didn&#39;t see it. Then the kite starts moving from spot to spot in the sky. It moved real fast. I said to my friend this isn&#39;t a kite. Then I noticed it kept changing colors. It changed from light gray to dark gray, almost black. My friend still doesn&#39;t see it. Then it hit me, this is a balloon. It&#39;s a silver gray balloon that is not fully filled and the wind causes it to change shape and the dark color is really shadows on it. Then it dropped down lower and I could see it. It was not a kite or a ballon. This flying thing was about 1500 feet above Carson High School and I&#39;m about 1/4 mile south of the school. The sun is in the west and I&#39;m looking north. I can see it clearly. It was not as long as a fighter jet but was wider. It made no noise or so little I couldn&#39;t hear it. This thing is 3 sided. Best way to discribe it is if you took a football and cut it in half from end to end. Now throw the bottom away and just use the top half. Now flaten out the sides so they meet at a ridge on top.The sides and bottom are not flat but slightly convexed. So this thing has a bottom and 2 sides with a slightly pointy front and rear where the sides and bottom come together. It was odd shaped. It is mostly a shinny gray. There are no windows or joint lines that I could see. There are no visible lights but there are light and dark gray lines that move from end to end along the sides and along the bottom. These lines look like gray bar codes that randomly move quickly and slowly from end to end. That&#39;s why it looks like it changes from light to dark and also seems to have shadows at a further distance. So here is this shinny gray thing rippling with gray bar code lines in plain site and my friend can&#39;t see it.  He&#39;s squinting and I&#39;m pointing to no avail. Then it takes off straight up and out of site. About 10 seconds latter it comes back. This time it is a little lower then before and a little clearer to see. My friend can&#39;t see it. I can&#39;t believe he can&#39;t see it. Half of Los Angeles has got to be looking at this thing. It is in sight for about 30 seconds slowly turning from side to side. Then again it goes straight up and again out of site, never to be seen by me again.  5 to 10 seconds later I saw 4 military type fighter jets fly over Carson and go straight up in the air after it with after burners roaring. There was no way they were ever going to catch this thing, it was far faster then the jets. I ask my friend did he see the jets? He said he did. I watched this thing for about 5 minutes.  I checked the paper and watched the news for days but nothing was ever reported. Haven&#39;t seen my friend in many years, bet he probably still thinks I&#39;m crazy and until about a year ago, I had my doughts. Why did the military and apparently only myself see this thing? I think my daughter unknowingly figured it out. She is an artist, a painter, she mixes and creates colors for her art. I have blue gray blindness. I only see certain shades of blues and grays. Most of the time, I only see grays. To me, the sky is mostly gray with a hint of blue on occasion and only on a few days out of the year do I see a bright blue sky like the day in question. While talking to my daughter, she said that I am missing alot by not seeing the different shades of blues in the sky. Then it hit me. It&#39;s not only what I don&#39;t see, it&#39;s also what I do see. This thing in the sky, it wasn&#39;t gray it was probably blue and the bar code lines, they were probably shades of blue not shades of gray. This thing could camouflag itself to the sky. That&#39;s why my friend and everybody else couldn&#39;t see it when it was in front of them. The military saw it with radar. I saw it because its camouflag colors fell outside of my color spectrum because of my blue gray blindness. Maybe on a grayer day for me I wouldn&#39;t have seen it. Its grays to me would have blended together to a camouflag but on this day with a bright blue sky, it stuck out like a soar thumb. Over the years I&#39;ve learned not to talk about the stuff I see in the sky like this thing and the other stuff because people do look at you like your crazy. On this day I know what I saw and it was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date in July 1978 is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was on the roof of the building.  Alone, I watched it.  It was almost transparent.  I couldn&#39;t see throug it but it was as though it was liquid.  It was the size of a small orange.  Silver in color.  When I finally yelled to the others, who were on the other side of the building to check this thing out, it moved away.  Of course the others didn&#39;t see it.  It headed towards the Edwards AFB. It didn&#39;t make any noise or course changes.  It just moved towards Edwards. It didn&#39;t take long to disappear since it was so small.  I guess since it was so small and knowone else saw it, I dont get many believers.  Well any ways there it is.  If you have any questions please write me at,   ((persnal information deleted.))<n> <n><n> @ the size of a small orange silver in color quiet, no noise at all the look of liquid lead but solid<n>

7/1/78 02:00|Los Angeles|CA|Circle|30 minutes|bright multi-colored lights emanate from disc flying/hovering silently approx 500 ft in the air|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63268.html|77|ndxe197807| bright multi-colored lights emanate from disc flying/hovering silently approx 500 ft in the air<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was visiting Gautier, MS for the summer in the late 70&#39;s and I remember there was a lot of talk in the media about a comet (or meteor) that would be visible early one morning between 2-3am. Being a curious person I set my clock to wake up so I could witness this celestial event. I went outside that morning and within a few minutes I did see some heavenly body streak across the sky. Just before I was about to go back inside to bed, I saw something else that I&#39;ve never seen the likes of before or since. In the not too distant night sky I saw a disc shaped object floating slowly towards me. It was very brightly colored (the lights alternated red, blue, green and orange in a circular pattern around the object). I was transfixed by this sight as it inched towards our house. Over the next twenty minutes it floated closer and closer to the yard where I was standing. After about ten minutes of observation it was clear to me that this object was approaching and would soon be directly over head. I would estimate the disc at about 400-500ft in diameter and flying about 500-750ft in the air. There were times when it appeared to come to a dead stop and simply hover, then begin floating slowly closer. The flickering alternating colorful lights were the most striking thing about it and I remember wondering what government technology could produce such an object. At about the 20 minute mark in the sighting, the object was nearly directly over my head and I remember a strong fear coming over me. I was afraid of being spotted by this craft and went back inside the house. From various windows inside I continued to watch the object as it flew over the front of the house and I ended up in my bedroom watching it pass over the back yard. The object never made a sound. There were a bunch of trees behind the house a few hundred yards away; once the object glided over those trees it appeared to descend further. I watched it hover just above those trees for another 10 minutes or so before it ascended and quickly! flew ou t of sight. No airplane, weather balloon, or helicopter that I know of could account for that sighting. I will never forget what I saw that night and I have come to believe that others have seen the same thing as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was working the 4 to 12 pm shift and observed a number of objects in the sky from a high land observation point called Liberty Hill in the town of Gilford.  The objects appeared to be in a perfect formation flashing lights back and forth between them as they hovered stationary in the sky.  I left work at 2400 Hrs. and headed towards my home in Sanbornton, NH (03269) and met up with another Police Officer, ((Name deleted)) of the Tilton Police Department, Tilton, NH.  We sat on the edge of Interstate 93 for approximately 2 hours watching the objects, mostly stationary in the sky-flash light back and forth.  Finally the objects flew South over I-93 and we communicated this information via radio to NH State Police Headquarters and they acknowledged the objects were over their location.  The next morning we were instructed to not speak about this incident again as it might cause panic amongst the population of the Towns and State.<n>

As them moved along very slowly from the bottom of the craft underneath several thin, but bright pink or red tentacles would roll down about 25 feet, stay there for several minutes and then go back up inside the object. This was repeat over and over again ever so much of a distance. We follow for several miles(5to7), never losing visual contact until they just vanish right before our eyes. also in the local newspaper the police had reported seeing these objects,several days in a roll.These are not the only ufo&#39;s I have seen in this same area. some I have seen on the ground at only 50 yards away (3cigar shaped), a T-shaped object close up just hanging in the air for about and hour and big as a city block. there are others, but I won&#39;t go into that now. thank you for your time, I hopr this is helpful in some way.<n>

MN. single very slow moving black triagle, 2 min visible<n> <n><n> <n><n> In midsummer 1978 I was in tenth grade, about to start eleventh grade.  I had bought a small motorcycle (250 Kawasaki) to get around by  myself and have a little freedom. I worked a few nights a week as a dishwasher at a high end Chinese restaurant called Howard Wongs.  Another dishwasher and I got off work about 01:00.  She needed a ride home and she was very cute so I volunteered.  She lived with her mother in an apartment building directly across the (North to South)street from a large grocery store.  The Grocery store (Byerly&#39;s) and the apartment building were both on the south side of and east west interstate that runs between Edina and Minneapolis.  I am sighting these details to give you the exact address, and also give you an idea that the area is very well lit, and in the urban/suburban category, almost directly on an interstate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She and I were talking for a few minutes as we were leaning on my motorcycle in the parking lot of the apartment building.  For some reason I looked up at the sky that was mostly clear but had a very few mid-level clouds approximately 1200 ft.  I know this because my father was a pilot, and I had spent nearly every weekend (like thousands of hours) of my young life in a small engine airplane, literally since I was born.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something caught my eye as I looked up.  I could see several stars, but the streetlights prevented seeing all of them.  The clouds above were slightly illuminated from the city lights, but there were only a very few clouds, and most crystal clear skies.  But nearly directly above us, and a little to the west, toward the Byerly lot, I could see that there was a very slow moving completely black triangle!  It appeared to be quite low, maybe about 300-400 feet altitude.  Once I spotted it, I immediately thought that I would here the sound of the engine of some idiot flying without tower cleareance, without lights, in an ultralight aircraft.  But to my astonishment there was absolutely no sound, completely silent.  I also was in astonishment that there were no lights or beacons on the aircraft, and that it was absolutely black, absolutely black as pitch.  The only way I could tell its shape was that it was so very slow moving, and I could clearly see its shape against the stars and few distant clouds as it passed them.   There was no wind that night. As the object moved in what appeared to be a directly North direction, I could clearly also observe that its velocity did absolutely not change.  I was observing its speed because the only other plausible explanation was that it was some freaking idiot in a hang glider.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I excluded the midnight hang glider because the speed and direction and altitude did not change at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, there are no hills in Edina, and nobody hang glides in the twin cities, but I had run out of any explanations.  The object was visible to me for at least two minutes as it moved steadily North at what I thought might be 20-30 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the object was only very slightly visible at all, my calculation of size, and speed and altitude could be off, but not by much as I had 20-15 vision at the time, and was eyeballing aircraft my whole life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dishwasher friend said she saw it, but if she really did, I thought later that she would be dropping her jaw like I was, and she just didn&#39;t react like she was seeing a UFO.  So I really don&#39;t think she saw it, but that&#39;s OK because it was dang tough to catch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years have gone by now, and after the advent of the internet I finally, after 34 years, see that many others out there have seen, and are seeing, very slow moving, absolutely silent and jet black triangles.<n>
7/1/78 00:00|Oreland|PA|Other|5 minutes|Electric Blue Half dome with possible alient encounter.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17899.html|81|ndxe197807| Electric Blue Half dome with possible alient encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son&#39;s interest in this phenomenon rekindled my memory of the incident (which was reported to UFORIC the day after the event). I was around 15 at the time.  My friends and I were camping out in my backyard which is adjacent to a golf course.  As I lay in the tent (my friends were hanging out in the front yard...Hey..I was tired), I noticed a bright electric blue light coming from the golf course area.  Opening the tent, I noticed an object resembling a half dome with a small protusion coming from the top of the dome.  It was oriented like a half moon in a verticle position rather than flat/horizonal.  There also appeared to be a base to the dome, cylindical in shape, attached to the flat side of the dome.  Its diameter was less than that of the dome and was, perhaps, a 1/16 of the overall size of the object (which I estimate was maybe 40-60 ft in diameter). The object moved from east to west over the fairway when I lost site of it at the far end o the fairway. A few minutes later, my friends joined me in the tent and I asked them if they saw it.  They hadn&#39;t as the were in the front yard and their view was obstructed (they also weren&#39;t paying attention). We all went to sleep. Around 02:00, I remember awakening to relieve myself.  As I climbed out of the tent, I noticed a faint blue glow from the west.  Then, the beam from my flashlight struck something no more than about 20 feet away.  Took me a second to realize I was staring at a person or being.  It stood about 5 feet tall and motionless about 20 feet away just on the other side of a small hedge.  Skin was grayish in color and the eyes were a burnt yellow color.  If it were clothed, it must have been close to the same color as the being. I stood staring at this being for maybe another 10 seconds absolutely stunned.  It then seemed to dive on the ground and I didn&#39;t see it get up again.  Thinking my friends were playing a joke, I went to check on them.  They were all asleep in their sleeping bags. I immediately awakened them, and we all got out of the tent, but we did not see the being again. In the morning, we went to see where the faint blue light was coming from.  Not far from my home, there is another golf course that also had an old abandoned iron quarry.  This quarry was, maybe 500 yards from my house.  In the grass of the old quarry, we found evidence that something had flattened the grass and weeds in the old quarry.  I don&#39;t recall seeing any indentations (like from landing gear), but the long grass had definitely been packed down in a circular shape. Back in my yard, we noticed something else as well.  Where I said that the being dove on the ground, there was a rough outline of a person in the grass...browned grass when the surrounding grass was green.  The grass was also packed down, slightly, as if something had been there. I told my father what I had seen and he called, I believe, UFORIC.  They dispatched an investigator who took my story, a few photographs of the area, and radiation measurements of where I said the being dove on the ground.  He also used some sort of visual dosimeter as well.  The investigator told us that there were elevated radiation levels in the area of question.  He did not go to where I believe was the landing site. After filing my report, I never heard from the investigator again and pretty much put the event out of my until recently when my oldest son took an interest in &#34;aliens&#34; and asked me if I ever saw one (or even a spaceship).  I&#39;m not even sure UFORIC still exists.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We (My Dad,step om,sister,cousin)were going home after visiting one of dads friends house.  I must&#39;ve been around 13 years old at the time and would spend my summer vacations with my dad in Puerto Rico.  I lived with my Mother in Boston Mass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night while in the car I noticed my step mom just starring out the window for quite a while before turning to us telling us that she thinks that she spotted a U.F.O. and that she thought that the light was following us!  I then looked and did see a red light in the horizon just hovering, nothing too spectacular just a light like radio antenna or something.  I tried to make sense of it by telling them that It seemed to be moving cause we were in a car and the slightest turns would make the light seem like its moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the strange thing about it was that it did not seem to move away like it should if it was standing still? We asked dad to stop the car for a better look and he downright refused and seemed to speed up instead like he was frightened.  I thought it was kind of strange to see him so scared like that. Eventually we lost it and did not make too much of a deal about it when we got home....<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I heard of reports of UFOs all over the airwaves and in the newspapers also. There was even a picture of an alien wearing what looked like a costume made up of lights. Then we really started thinking that we DID see something... Boy what I would give to have the clip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
