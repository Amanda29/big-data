9/30/89 22:00|McAlpin|FL|Unknown|2 minutes|Silent orange rotating light over McAlpin, Florida field.|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61073.html|1|ndxe198909| Silent orange rotating light over McAlpin, Florida field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, I was home alone with 3 small children which had been put to bed.  We had 5 outside dogs that began barking up a storm.  There was a large fenced pasture behind and adjacent to our property, with a tree-lined driveway leading toward and then turning to parallel this pasture. I went out of my front door and rounded the corner of the house facing the pasture and didn&#39;t see anything.  I saw the dogs sitting side by side and barking in the direction of the pasture.  I walked closer and past the dogs (who did not move forward with me).  I thought it odd that the dogs did not come with me to investigate.  When I had moved a few steps closer to the pasture, I saw a large orange light that seemed to be slowly rotating the circumference of an object.  The object itself, I could not see againt the night sky.  The light seemed to move from right to left, disappear momentarily as if on the back side of the object, and re-emerge on the right again.  I also noticed that the object itself seemed to be silently moving in a forward, downward and zig-zagging motion (closer to my property).  I ran back into the house and locked the doors.  I called my husband who was bowling with friends, and he scoffed as I explained what I had seen.  I was terrified, and realizing he wasn&#39;t going to come home immediately as I had hoped, I instead called a friend long distance, and stayed on the phone with her for well over an hour until he did arrive home.  I did not report the sighting to any authorities for fear of ridicule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/29/89 06:15|Miami|FL|Chevron|approx 15 min|Dark boomerang shaped UFO hovers over MIA airport then flies upward past arriving airliner|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36204.html|2|ndxe198909| Dark boomerang shaped UFO hovers over MIA airport then flies upward past arriving airliner<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not the eye witness, but I questioned closely the controller involved. I was an air traffic controller at Miami International at the time this event occured. I came on duty at 10 o&#39;clock am on this day. The whole facility was buzzing so I asked what was going on. The person I asked said that the midnighters had seen a UFO at the airport early..I did not get the full details for several weeks. The controller was obviously upset over what he had witnessed and refused to talk about it. I waited a few weeks for the right time and when it was quiet I asked this controller to tell me the whole story. Bob said that he working the midnight shift and his relief had arrived up in the tower cab as well as a flight data assistant (three total). They were chatting and one them looked up at the tower radar display. Something was quickly moving across the scope from the north and toward the airport. The observer called out and they all started looking out the windows (it&#39;s dark but getting light in the east). To the north something low was covering up the lights on the ground. At this point the UFO is almost over airport. They all saw it as it came to a hover over the commuter ramp, (low, 100 feet or less) which is in the middle of the airport. At this point I stopped the story to ask a question; how big was it? Bob said it was about the size a B-727, which is quite large. He also said that it was dark in color, maybe dark olive. The object hovered over a vehicle and turned on a bright light. There was a ramp person in the vehicle asleep. The ramp vehicles all have radios tuned to the ground control frequency. This person started screaming on frequency for the tower to quit playing pranks. The light stayed on for several minutes. Remember it&#39;s getting lighter outside every minute. The light turned off and it continued to hover. Now it&#39;s light enough to see detail. The object the rises vertically and passes very close to a an arriving Eastern Airlines A-300. The aircraft was coming in from the south and was on downwind and preparing to land. The pilot asked &#34;what the hell was that?&#34; The controllers said that they did not know. The object continued up to many thousands of feet, but still visible fron the ground. At this point two other controllers were driving into work. One was coming in from the south and the other from the north. They both saw the object ascend and watched it until it stopped. When it stopped it stayed motionless for several minutes and then it started to gyrate wildly. While it was gyrating it had many multi-colored lights flashing. The object performed like this for several more minutes. When it stopped it stayed motionless for several minutes and then suddenly went vertically out of sight. In the the tower things were hectic trying to see if the radar room could see anything and getting the airliner on the ground. While taxiing in the pilot asked if the controllers knew anything more and then stated &#34;well I guess I&#39;ve seen one now&#34;. Over the next hour or so &#34;answers&#34; started coming from various agencies, none of which were accepted by the controller witnesses. In the end the FAA told them to say nothing of the event. One final thing, Bob mentioned that for the next couple of hours (no wind) a yellow-green haze was seen to stay in the area where the object was hovering.This event was a catalyst, of sorts, to open a host of stories from other controllers.  All very interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can e-mail or call for more details if you wold like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/27/89 20:30|Oak Ridge (over classified Y12 facility)|TN|Disk|20 to 30 min|Huge Saucer with lights seen, over Oak Ridge, hovered, lights changed, and suddingly disappeared .|4/30/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36572.html|3|ndxe198909| Huge Saucer with lights seen, over Oak Ridge, hovered, lights changed, and suddingly disappeared .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred during the time of my wife&#39;s birthday, when I was consulting for a Contractor at Oak Ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While at the Y12 facility, after dusk, one of the employees after coming from his car saw a craft approaching the facility from another facility on that Government Campus.  He rushed in and told us to grab any cameras, and come out and see something spectacular.  Five were able to obtain cameras,  and approximately 40 to 50 employees, including guards saw the saucer.  It hovered almost over the Y12 facility for over 20 minutes.  It changed colors from time to time, and emitted light beams.  We five took many pictures from the basically same vantage point.  The Craft was much larger than a B2 Bomber!  It was estimated to be at least 400 meters from us for a time.  MUFON members were told about the incident, but they wanted pictures from daytime shots of a classified facility - which obviously are not allowed by the Government!  Since the film had to be turned over to the Contractor, and the Government,  the original negatives and slides are their property.  Afterward, some of the prints of pictures, and some slides, that were taken in the dark, which didn&#39;t reveal any clasified secrets were returned to the respective photographers.  When the FBI was questioned about the nature of the object,  they said they couldn&#39;t answer about the nature of the craft - &#34;since it was highly classified!&#34;.    Copies of some of these pictures were given to a book vendor at the 1992 or 1993 Eureka Springs UFO Conference, in exchange for some Bible UFO related books.  Also at the time, myself and an FBI Agent gave some of the pictures of &#34;Ball Lightning&#34; that I had taken over my farm north of Willow Springs, Missouri.  We asked the vendor, what he thought of the various pictures, and what he thought they were, and what he thought was their origin?  Pictures have been recently furnished to people at Laughlin UFO Conferences,  to ((e-address deleted)), The Museum of the Unexplained, and others inspite of some of the! m being published (1998)in &#34;Pleiadians from Alcyone&#34;.  (The pictures on pages 1 and 2 are  of the craft over Oak Ridge - which is not near Nashville, Tenn. but are of &#34;Ball Lightning&#34; north over our farm !).  ( The Pictures on pages 3 through 11, are some 35 mm slide pictures that I took, along with pictures that a Contractor Employee took with his poloroid camera, and two pictures were taken by another employee with a press type camera!)  By-the-way,  those pictures belong to the Gov&#39;t/Contractor/ and the employees were given permission to share them as they saw fit!  When one reads the referenced book, pages 12 through 27, they are interesting, informative, and make an interesting tale.  Is there a coincidence here with another similar sighting?   The bit about the photographer is very interesting.  I know nothing specific about Teygeta or Zeta-Reticuli-I, Alpha Centuri, Pleiadian Alcyone crafts!  So I did not create that story.   So what is the truth, it has to be scientifically investigated, and tbd.  I can only stay with facts as I understand them.  At the near end of the hovering of this spectacular, well defined, colorful craft;  the craft lowered a portion with different lights, like from some type of antigravitics/ superconductive propulsion unit (that is attributed to be the opinion of some so called observers?),  and then the craft slowly rose, headed off in a northerly direction, sped up and suddenly (without sound), and &#34;like a bat out of hell&#34; lifted up vertically, rose speedily out of sight and disappeared.  Was this experience a projection or a Hologram, I believe not so because of the definition in the shots taken by the various cameras!    greetings- fj/bf<n>

I was in the passenger seat, and idly gazing at the passing scenery.  There were multiple ridges, and out of nowhere an object appeared.  It was quite large, shaped like a helicopter -- except the body was out of normal proportion.  There were no rotors, and no discernible noise.  It was of a dark color, and It seemed to glide.  As I noticed it , I turned to my husband and exclaimed -- but by the time we both looked back it was behind another ridge and no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was like it vanished in thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband looked at me crazy and asked &#34;what the hell was that? I rplied, &#34;I don&#39;t know. You tell me.

There wasn&#39;t.  I tried to speak to him about it later at lunch break.  He wouldn&#39;t. He was still pretty freaked out about it.  But me, I was curious to know about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still to this day, I still seek in the skies at night. I have wittnessed other sightings in Grandview, MO. years later.  Not alone, either.<n>

We had just finished watching some movies when we thought it would be a great idea to go visit the small cemetery down the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To make a long story short, we were walking in the cemetery and- I remember very well- we had to go slow because it was very dark and we couldn’t see the stones.  We weren’t doing anything, just kind of walking around.  We got to the back where there was a small woods with a field on the other side.  We decided to turn around and go back to the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I clearly remember that I was looking down (stones and all) so that I wouldn’t trip when I suddenly realized that I could see all the stones with some weak shadows.  The light wasn’t blazing bright- kind of like moonlight that is filtered through clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped and looked up (as did my friends) and there well above us (but on the horizon) in the sky was a perfectly straight, rectangular bar of light.  It was big enough that you had to move your eyes from left to right to see it all.  I don’t know what direction we were facing.  As we stood there, mouths open, just staring, the bar of light got thinner from the top and the bottom- like you might see when a door to a lit room closes- but horizontally.  It got thinner and thinner and then just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not move except for the “closing” effect.  We asked our astronomy professor at SUNY Geneseo about it the next day.  He said it may have been Northern Lights- NO WAY!. . . straight lines on all sides, controlled closing of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing about it now- after many years- on a whim of looking it up on the internet and finding some other accounts that sound exactly like mine.

I&#39;m doing this because someone official must know. In the later part of 1989, at approximately 9 p.m., while driving home from dinner at my mother&#39;s house, I noticed bright lights moving very slowly toward my right, above the tree line.  I&#39;ve always been intrigued by U.F.O&#39;s and feel I&#39;m quite knowledgeable on the subject.  I had always thought that if I had ever saw one,I would not be afraid, but rather I would want to approach it.  Was I ever wrong.  I stopped to observe a round shaped disk coming my way above the trees to my right while still in my truck.  Slowly it approached.   Surrounded by very, very bright lights, not blinking lights but solidly lit.  At this time, the object is right by me so I get out of my truck, leave the door open, walk around the door to the driver&#39;s side fender and look at the craft.  When I realized there was no noise coming from it, that&#39;s when I knew what it was.  The biggest rush of fear went through me like I never  knew.  The craft was only about 50 yards from me.  I jumped in my truck, drove forward 200 yards, made a left, stopped and watched it slowly move away for about five minutes until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  My house was just around the corner.  I went in and woke up my roomate, ((name deleted)).  He went to bed way early because he had to go to work at 4:00 a.m.  I told him what I had seen.  He said I was crazy.  We went out front in the yard and I started telling him the story.  Just a few minutes into my story, as I was pointing in the direction of the sighting, we heard a noise from behind.  We turn and look.  About 3 or 4 black helicopters buzz the house and fly in the direction I&#39;m pointing.  Steve didn&#39;t think I was so crazy then. I&#39;m reporting this because lately it&#39;s been weighing on my mind.  50 yards is close!  If someone would contact me, I would like to tell them things about the craft and the amazingly effortless way that it moved. Please take this sighting seriously.  I am a business owner in Austin and have a reputation as an honest person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I ignored at first but after a while I noticed no cars either behind or infront nor any buildings or airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then checked inside the car for any light source and rolled the window down to get a better look.  It was quiet no noise at all and easy to look at not too bright.  I asked my friend whom was driving to look at it and she said she had glanced a while back and not sure what she was seeing either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we were not scared just trying to figure it out.  As I continued to be curious and stare at it, it took off straight ahead far enough to see it but moved really fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it showed up on my friends side window and she started to freak out right away.  It was only there a minute and then gone.  We did not see where it went it was just gone. We did not see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened a long time ago but we still talk about it and   I just wanted to share it with someone.  Thanks for listening.<n>

As a kid and somewhat as an adult i have always been afraid of aliens and the dark.  I slept int he same bedroom as my older brother who was 5 years older than me and who always put up with my childish fears.  Well it was a warm night and we had the window to our room open to let some air in,  As we were going to bed, (there were two twin beds seprated by a couple feet facing the window) i looked out the window and saw a large orange circle with two blinking lights following it, i assume they were planes.  I asked my brother if it was a ufo and as a typical older brother he told me to shut up and go to bed.  Well about 10 min later my mom started screaming and told everyone to go to the living room and look out the big window which faced the same direction as my bedroom window.  As we all ran to the room to see why my mom was screaming (there were 4 boys and my dad and mom) we heard a humming noise over our house.  When we got to the room we all saw a disked shaped object with alternating red and white lights around it in the distance.  It seemed like and eternity that it just hovered there, as we watched we saw some planes getting closer and eventually it seemed as though it wavered a little bit and proceeded to shoot straight up at an enormous speed.  My family has had many sightings living in Putnam, mostly form the same time frame but many from when i must have 3 or 4 years old and my memories are a little vague and not as clear about those events although i do still have memories of them.  My family has also experienced missing time and other stranger occurences<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I am a married Turkish citizen having 3 children. I was 44 years old when I saw the strange object. We were at a summer resort by the sea, about 45 kilometers on the west of Antalya.Just after dinner, without any alcohol and walked to the sea shore about 75 feet away from our bungalow and our dinning table. Lit a cigarette and seatted on one of the woodden strechs and started to look to the sky. Time was some minutes after 21.00 hours. I noticed the signal lights of an airplane,one red and the other green. The body of object had a color like aluminium but little darker. I did not pay any attention as I thought it was an airplane leading to the airport about 30 miles away. I kept smoking and noticed that the airplane / object was at the same position. I said how come an airplane stays at the same point. Started to look more carefully. At that time the object started to generate powerful red, green and yellow lights. As if the lights were generating from speedy propellers. With the effect of these new lights the body of the object became more visible. The shape was regtangular. The power of the lights were not the same. It seemed as if the power of lights were increasing with the increasing speed of the propellers. Red light got powerful , then the green light got more powerful than the red one. They were like the fancy lights of Las Vegas. Iwas shocked with what I have observed. Called my wife a few times to make her my witness but she did not attend as she was washing the dishes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light generation kept on some time then they became weaker and the object went straight up with an unbelieveable speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date of the incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Clear sky, no clouds. Returning from walking to a store in &#34;old&#34; Bellevue, I look up as several airliners, having departed Sea-Tac Airport, one-by-one climb out and turn right over the city. Though there is a high, evening haze, and their altitudes estimated to be between 6,000 and 7,000 feet, the aircraft are sharp in outline and therefore easily identified as to type. (that is they are not so high that the haze obscures detail). Another flies over. I glance up, but in an instant see something else. Something so unlike anything I have seen in the skys, that I do a &#34;double-take&#34;. For there, hanging stock still and silent, high-- very high in the haze, so high that only vague detail can be seen--is a huge, globe-shaped object! Perhaps pale yellowish-green, or a light copper color--dificult to tell through that haze. And, while in general it is a ball, the surface appears to be composed of a number of adjoining planes: either triangular in shape or rectangular, or perhaps some other geometric figure, or maybe all three. Again due to the altitude and haziness, I am not sure. In addition, some of the planes appear to protrude beyond their neighbors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Staring at the object for perhaps 20 to 25 seconds, I wish that I had my binoculars (I&#39;d gladly have given a $50 bill to&#39;ve had &#39;em with me). Then--&#34;Why not? I&#39;ll run home, grab them, rush back and have a real llok-see!&#34; Shaking my finger at the thing and shouting, &#34;Stay there. Don&#39;t go &#39;way. I&#39;ll be right back!&#34;, of I dash. Arriving againat the spot, huffing and puffing after the four-block round trip, I look, but alas--see nothing. Even searching all about several times with the &#34;binocs&#34; reveals only empty, hazy sky. It is gone, dammit!  I return to the location, at the same time, for two successive evenings, thinking that perhaps I had actually seen a giant satellite of some kind. But, nothing is there. No, I did not see a satellite; what I did see (though ever so briefly) was a gigantic USO-- Unidentified Stationary Object--bigger than a football field. Heck, bigger even than the stadium, itself! It may have been 500 to 700 feet, or perhaps much greater, in diameter; furthermore, at an altitude of at least 30,000 to 40,000 feet, it looked to be about the size of a dime when held at arm&#39;s lenth. Yet, at such a height; therefore, so far up in the haze, I could still just make out htos adjoining and interlocking planes which made up its surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

The car in front of me had to of seen it.I have see alot of these objects all my life in my area and so have other people here.As the car in front of me kept going I pulled off the side over the bridge and parked my car as it drifted away from me with no sound. I flashed my head lights at the light and the thing responded to my flashing of head lights.It moved from the left to the right and once it was lined up to my headlights it started to move toward me slowly with a up and down movement, coming closer and closer my heart was pumping as I was about rock throwing distance, In fear of what might happen and what I might experience I backed up my car up and got out of the area fast.I have see so many of these things growing up and its very hard to deal with when you try to tell people and you learn not to say anything!These balls of lights I see are about the size of a small car. I also have see them much larger and in formation moving  up and down by my creek bed then zip across the road into a field and sometimes they zig zag away.I only see them in march to may then again in september to november.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They reminded me of the lights on a radio tower. We watched it for maybe five minutes. I cant exactly say I saw a saucer but that was the impression of the shape I got from the lights. The lights then moved slowly toward the south across the back line of the property. Then it moved southeast and up into the sky and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report taken by B.Becker. ufomig@yahoo.com (Note: There were two other witnesses on the same day around the same time. One owned the adjacent farm and the other was a police officer. Neither wanted to fill out a report. They stated they saw the same &#34;object&#34; with red lights around the same time over the field as the primary witnesses.)<n>

Oh ya those dimensions were the width as it passed I heard nothing but after it passed I could see afterburners on the back big enough you could drive a transport into.  This vessel must have been man made because it was very shingley and rivety and was in dark almost military colours.  I reported this event to Mufon in the mid 1990.  Still have no seen nothing like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The Snowbirds, the Canadian Aerobatic Team, experienced a fatal accident in Toronto in 1989.

The triangle had lights all around the edges, not just the three corners.  The lights were of red, green, and blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After only a few minutes of looking at the object my mom was afraid and took me inside.  There were many witnesses because people were stainding outside of their houses and cars were even stopped in the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a little stunned that there is nothing at all documented about this case due to the number of witnesses and the huge size of the craft.  It was so massive I&#39;m sure it could have been seen for miles. I have never seen anything writting about it.  I&#39;ve search for years to find something but have been coming up with nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An interesting note is that there was an army storage base not even five minutes away.  I wish I was older so I could have stayed out and looked at the thing instead of my mom forcing me inside.<n>

I just stood there dumbfounded. It hovered over my neigbhors house (which is about 300 yards from my house) and then it just zoomed off in a southwest direction toward Hickory, NC. When I tell people about it - no one believes me - but I know that I did not imagine it - I know that I saw it. The lights flashed one right after the other - blue, green, red - then the saucer would turn opposite the direction the lights were flashing.<n>

I estimate the object to be about 18 to 24 inch diameter and moving at a slow walking speed, 2-3 mph It was just a bit higher than the trees. I saw it very clearly and watched it as intensly as one can keeping in mind the fact that I was driving my road home. My best discription that might create an image is &#34;a glass sphere filled with water slowly floating in the sky&#34;. It was like you had to see to look at it, It was almost invisible but caused aberation against the skyscape. It made no noticable sound, left no trail. I can see it in my minds eye now as if it had just happened, as well as the exact location of the event. I have told a few folks but never offically reported my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/1/89 00:00|Roswell|GA||3 - 4 minutes|Shape of object: Upside down stainless steal circular bowl Size of bowl: 12 - 15 inches in diameter Lasars: 3 inch diameter lasar beam|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52967.html|23|ndxe198909| Shape of object: Upside down stainless steal circular bowl Size of bowl: 12 - 15 inches in diameter Lasars: 3 inch diameter lasar beam was illuminated from the bottom of the craft shining down to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lasar Color: White Object on Ground: approximately 3 ft curled up rubber or snake like object  Unique Characteristic of Sighting: The bowl was upside down, hanging by a black 3 inch diameter solid material, it was hanging from a power line in an intersection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unique Characteristic of Sighting: The traffic lights were normally extremely bright on my drive home from work. This particular evening, I noticed the traffic lights were extremely dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of the sighting: It was a clear night on my way home from work. I had driven this route every night for the last several months. The traffic lights always illuminated up the area and you could see it for a couple miles. I noticed in the distance the traffic lights at the intersection where I turned left were extremely dim on this night. At first I assumed there must be something wrong with the lights. I figured maybe some sort of construction was going on. Anyway, as I approached the intersection I saw this bowl like object hanging from a 3 inch diameter cable looking connection device shining a 3 inch diameter lasar on the ground. I came to a complete stop just under the lasar so as to put the lasar right outside my driver window. I looked on the ground to see there was a rubber looking 1 inch diameter 3 feet long snake looking thing in the lasar beam. I looked back up and saw the under side of the bowl. It was solid black with the exception for the 3 inch diameter beam shining down. I started to put my hand out to see if I could determine its temperature and immediatley got nervous and turned left and stopped to car. I got out of the car to examine the device more closely from outside my car and it was suddely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t hear any sound. I didn&#39;t see it fly away. Of course, after I drove underneath and turned left I was in the car and it was to my back for about 20 seconds. I figured it took off while my back was turned. I didn&#39;t experience any loss of time. I didn&#39;t experience any abduction. It was simply hanging there and appeared to cause the traffic lights to go dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was only 12 to 15 inches in diameter. It was hanging from the power lines shining a 3 inch diameter beam onto the approximatlely 3 foot snake like object. And when it disappeared, the traffic lights were back to full illumination. The long rubber like object or snake like object was gone too. Everything was normal and no sign of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
