I told him I would be right there.  I was not asleep, nor was I sleepy.  I am usually awake until 3-4 am any ways (I am a nocturnal person).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I parked my car in the next alley, ran to their alley, and crept to their window to spy. I saw nothing, but could hear them loud and clear arguing, again.  I noticed my boyfriend&#39;s sister&#39;s car parked there, and I hated her, so I let the air out of her rear tires.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got bored waiting for them to finish arguing, so I out of the alley, and around to the front house. I stood on the very right side of the front chain link fence, and I could kind of see through to the back yard&#39;s back house&#39;s t! iny kitchen window.  I got frustrated that I was not able to successfully spy.  So I got off the fence and, in boredom, looked up at the night sky.  And I saw a UFO floating perfectly in the sky!  It wasn&#39;t too close and not at all far away.  It was about the altitude that a police helicopter would be at if it were searching for a suspect, that should give you an idea.  The UFO was metallic silver, shaped like a disc but it had a flat bottom.  There were no windows, lines, bolts, it was clean.  I saw it immediately, and I remember saying &#34;OOh myy GOD!&#34;  And it turned on: two red lights appeared on the tail, and a giant flash appeared in front of it, and the UFO immediately went through the flash at the speed of light.  All that was left was two red lines of disappearing light left over from the speed.  They faded away, and I was in shock for maybe several seconds, and I started freaking out, in a good way, jumping and running around yelling, &#34;OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!&#34;  And I looked around to see if anyone else was around to see it.!  No one was. I looked at my cell phone and it was 3:15 am, and no one else saw it because everyone was asleep. I will never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on, maybe a year later, two other people and I saw 4 UFOS. I will submit another report for that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It looked Like a satellite<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1230AM outside in my backyard at XXXXX Belmont California 94402.  When all of a sudden I heard the sound of high voltage being turned on the floating object resembled the floating craft heading toward Ceres.  The Dawn.  However, it looked like a floating satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And of course it is physically impossible to float a satellite.  Given the major fact it would have to over come an environment with no gravity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most astonishing part of the whole 3 minutes was there was no noise except for the lights turning on and a part on it was rotating those were the only noises I heard.  It was. I believe, illuminated on right side only.<n>
