Her and her husband are originally from Barrhead, Alberta a town some 70 miles northwest from Edmonton. One night on their farm while out doing their chores, milking the cows, etc. in the late fall. Their hay field was directly west of the barn and when their son at the time was 7 years old and was standing looking into the field, he said. Daddy, there is a stop light sitting in the grain field. As they turned to look they all saw a softball sized, brilliant red light/object sitting just over the tops of the grain. As they watched the object moved slowly and along the way it changed it&#39;s color to white and then finally green. The witness told me they had to have watched this event for approx: 20 minutes as the children had time to run back to the house and call the grandparents to come outside and watch what was taking place. The light/object kept up a steady pace over the fields. The family now watching the object through binoculars until they all lost sight of it in the far distance. It at times changing direction as it moved along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

9/15/60 21:00|Susanville|CA||5-6 minutes|Three craft in formation, high altitude, lights constant across sky - unlike aircraft running lights which blink and "hide"|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36107.html|2|ndxe196009| Three craft in formation, high altitude, lights constant across sky - unlike aircraft running lights which blink and &#34;hide&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observed three orange lights in formation, no sound, high altitude probably 15,000 est. travelling roughly north to south - notable because I have watched aircraft night and day since childhood as son of Navy aircraft electrician.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These &#34;lights&#34; were not red or green or white, nor did they ever blink. Aircraft running lights are sometimes hidden by a wing or fin, but even at high altitude the different colors of running lights are distinguishable one from another. Because of the altitude and darkness, there was no way for me to describe shape of objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were constant - unblinking, color unchanging as they traversed from north to south. Not satellites, which were visible at that time, but were single (no formation) and would &#34;wink out&#34; as they passed into earth shadow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I do not remember exact date, sighting was within an hour after dark - not once but three consecutive nights. The only difference is on the third night, one of the objects, which from such distance I could only describe as an &#34;orange light&#34; broke off from the &#34;formation&#34; and shot away to the east, while the other two lights continued southward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within days I heard news reports of law enforcement officials and other reporting cigar shaped objects in the area of Redding, California  I am submitting this report because Peter Davenport asked for anyone who has ever seen anything unidentified to file a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Witnessed.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36128.html|3|ndxe196009| Triple disc sighting prior to dusk with a light beam and possible healing. Witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was Twelve years of age in 1960. It was a beautiful late summer evening, the days were still long and it was just approaching dusk at about 8:30 PM. The sun was at the horizon but had not yet set, even though the sun disc itself was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was dozing in a steel framed hammock in thr family back yard when I had an accident that threw me into the air about seven or eight feet. I descended upside down and landed directly on my head. The last thing I remember was a loud snap, cracking sound as my head snapped into my right shoulder. That, except for the incident that I will relate next, may have been the tragic end of the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I am aware of is that I am standing up holding onto the nearby handrail. I don&#39;t remember getting up, I&#39;m just up. Then I hear a voice in my head say &#34;Look up&#34;. So I look up, there in the sky, directly overhead (86 - 88 degrees from North Horizon) are three hovering discs, all identical except the middle one is lower than the other two. These discs were the same color as the sky, sunset orange on the West side, and a darker pewter or brownish on the East. I would estimate the diameter to be five inches at arms length for the two at higher altitude, and about 8 inches at arms length for the lower disc. My judgement of the perceived altitude above me was about 120 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled at my brother who is already looking at them, &#34;Chuck, LOOK!&#34;. He saw the whole thing. He says that a beam of light came out of one of them and hit me. I cannot verify that, as I was out of commission at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After looking up and perceiving the three discs they immediately moved in perfect silent unison, due West to the horizon in about two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after that I had a long series of REALLY WEIRD nighttime events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something came into our room almost every night for a long time. When they came I would call to my older brother but he wouldn&#39;t wake. Then his weird experience would happen. I won&#39;t try to describe it here but it was scary, unknown, and very nebulous. I started to draw these figures of flying beings. My school performance went from poor to exceptional. Emotional problems that I had been experiencing seemed to reconcile themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neck has never caused me any pain to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother still comments on the events of this amazing moment in our lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are more incidents should you be interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

9/15/60 19:00|Kingsport|TN|Circle|5 Minutes|An orange, circular craft drifted over the house from east to west shortly after sundown.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04059.html|4|ndxe196009| An orange, circular craft drifted over the house from east to west shortly after sundown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the late summer of 1960, a group of youngsters (myself included) had finished dinner and were playing a game of hide-and-seek in the neighborhood.  I imagine there were about 8 to 10 children, mostly in the range of 5 to 10 years old.  I was 6 or 7 years old.  The sun had just set, but the sky still had a warm orange glow.  We played for some time and finally it was my chance to be &#34;it&#34;, the one who counted then went to find the others in their hiding places.  I recall that I couldn&#39;t count to 50, so I counted to 10 five times.  I was leaning on a tree in the side yard of our house.  By then it was pretty dark and I felt compelled to look up.  As I did so, I observed the leading edge of a circular object emerge from over top of our house.  I was transfixed: I just stood there speechless and stared at it.  It was bigger than our house and perfectly round.  I assume it was a disc and I was observing the bottom of the craft.  It was uniformly a brilliant red-orange.  There were no external marking, windows, lights, or construction details.  Just what appeared to be a self-illuminated object.  It was perfectly silent, which added to the drama.  As soon as it dawned on me that I was seeing something extraordinary, I was filled with the strange sensation that it or they  had seen me, too.  I ran into the house to get one of my parents.  My mother was finishing up the dishes, but she came outside to see it.  It was no longer visible.  We looked in the direction of the sunset and the sky was almost the same red-orange of the craft.  This has made me wonder if the craft was reflecting the sunlight or glowing on its own.  None of the other children saw it and my mother commented that I&#39;d seen a falling star before returning to the kitchen.  I knew I had not seen a falling star.  I was always nervous that whoever was responsible for that craft knew I saw it and might someday return.  In the years following this incident, I have had many occurences which can only best be described as psychic.  I&#39;ve had lucid drea! ms and numerous sleep-walking episodes -- once even going into the front yard of my grandmother&#39;s house and staring at the eastern horizon, only to see the moon rise just at that moment.  My entire family and I observed a spherical craft while on a drive one evening in Greene County, TN.  I discovered in a casual conversation one day that two of my three brothers had also seen spherical craft during their lives - in the exact same neighborhood where we lived when I had the episode mentioned above.  We believe in the reality of the experience, but have no conclusion about the exact nature of the phenomenon.<n>

When I was 15 years old I witnesses something ( along with a friend) that I can not explain. This has been on my mind for all these many years. I think it was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somewhere in the early eve while sitting outside talking my friend and I noticed an object in the sky.It was a cool autum eve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the crow flies it was about 1/2 mile away at the side of a large natural gas storage tank. It was silent and to my amazement it was all aglow and it seemed from where I stood that if there were molecules they were swirling around it.I think it was some kind of energy.  It did not apear overly large...maybe 20 feet in length or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered at the side of the tank, moved horizontally then it moved straight up to the top of the tank and then at the top of the tank it moved a small bit horizontally again, hovered and then shot straight up into the night sky and disappeared.It surprised me due to the precise movements it made.Almost angular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend ran home frightened but I was just in awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I wonder what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was there any UFO activity reported in the fall of 1960 or 1961 in the Buffalo NY area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
