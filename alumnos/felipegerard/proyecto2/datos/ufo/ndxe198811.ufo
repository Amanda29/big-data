11/30/88 04:30|Hickory Plains|AR|Unknown|5 minutes|UFO encounter or high-tech military aircraft?|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14796.html|1|ndxe198811| UFO encounter or high-tech military aircraft?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nov. 3, 2000  I just talked to a man who told me about an amazing encounter he had with what sounds like a UFO, or at least a military craft sporting impossible technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s his account:  In November or December of 1988, a man, who I will identify as Mike (not his real name), was driving along Hwy. 38 in rural eastern Arkansas between the towns of Hickory Plains and DesArc.  He was on his way to join buddies for duck hunting.  As he was driving on a deserted stretch of highway about 4:30 a.m., he became aware of an intense white light shining above the woods about a half mile in the distance.  There was a farm field between the road and the woods. An object appeared to be moving along the timberline at a slow speed, perhaps 5 mph.  The object was dark, and he couldn&#39;t discern its shape.  It emitted an intense white light that lit up the ground. &#34;It was the most intense light I had ever seen then or since, &#34; he said. Mike slowed his speed so he could look more closely.  His thought at the time was that it was a military aircraft from the Little Rock Air Force base at Jacksonville, about 30 miles away.  The pilot of the craft seemed to be moving along the edge of the woods looking for something.  It was about 100 feet off the ground, about 20 feet higher than the trees.  Mike&#39;s impression was that it was military personnel goofing off and shining a spotlight looking for deer.  He rolled his window down to listen, but he could not hear the characteristic sound of a helicopter engine or a noise of any sort. &#34;I think I&#39;m gonna&#39; get a good look at this,&#34; Mike recalled telling himself.  He stopped his pickup truck even with the object.  As he watched, the object started moving generally in his direction, which made him nervous. It slowly gained altitude as it moved to a point about a quarter mile in front of his truck and about 2,000 to 3,000 feet in the air. It abruptly made an impossible turn and accelerated and disappeared all &#34;in the blink of an eye.&#34; He also described it&#39;s acceleration like &#34;a shooting star.&#34;  He turned to look back behind him, but the object was not visible. He heard no sound of any kind.  He said his impression was, &#34;Whoa, now that&#39;s weird!&#34; He drove on to meet his buddies and told them the story, but he was met with disbelief.  I questioned Mike about missing time. He stated that he was 15 minutes late joining his friends.  He estimated the sighting only lasted 5 minutes.  He noted that he has driven the road many times and can&#39;t account for the lost 10 minutes.  Mike has only told the story to five or six people in 12 years.  He continued, for a while, to believe that it was a military craft, but Mike eventually acknowledged that it could have been something that was not manmade.  (Mike is relatively high up in an educational institution and is concerned about his name being used.)

It was a misty night early in fall. We came up too a stop sign at the junction of 68/80 in Aurora.  Across in front of us is the one store we had in town.  In front of store were the gas pump&#39;s.  They were dimly lit, but for some reason, we sat there thinking of what we could do next to fill the time of the night in our boring town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the driver just happened to look up and out the big front window of his Chevy Blazer. He next says, &#34;Do y&#39;all see that we were all setting up front and we all looked up above the gas station and in the dim lite of the pump&#39;s reflecting against the mist of the night it was a space craft just floating above the gas station..  The shape was that of a stealth fighter jet except this was ten times bigger.  A greenish low light glow came of it it was silent.  we could see Windows 4 across the front that were rectangular in shape.  the craft was pitch down on a slight angle.  They were looking! at us and we at them and we said amongst our self&#39;s in those 3 minutes what is that to each other over and over.  The driver said were going home that&#39;s what were doing.  Just as he put it in gear it tilted up and was gone in an instant.  There was 3 of us one of them passed away 2 year&#39;s ago kidney problems.  It was real as you are now reading this now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So from that point on I&#39;m a believer and I&#39;m always looking up .....<n>
11/27/88 21:00|Alamogordo|NM|Light|15-20 minutes|saw 5 objects doing amazing manuevers for 20 minutes|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62960.html|3|ndxe198811| saw 5 objects doing amazing manuevers for 20 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello,<n> <n><n> <n><n> My name is ((name deleted)), a desert storm veteran and a 12 yr USAF veteran.  I want to make this report just to do my part so we can someday find out the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My incident happened on Thanksgiving in 88 or 89.  I’m not really sure of the actual year, however, I am 100% certain of the day and of what I experienced.  I would like to add that at that time I was assigned to a Special Ops unit in the USAF out of Frankfurt Germany and I was just visiting my in-laws for the Thanksgiving Holiday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father in law and I went fishing up in the mountains of Alamogordo, NM on Thanksgiving.  We fished Silver lake all day and were suppose to come home early for dinner, but decided to stay late since the trout were biting pretty good that day.  By time we were on our way back home to Alamogordo, it was dark, however, it was a very clear night with no clouds or overcast.  We’re driving up and down hills coming from the mountains.  Alamorgodo, NM is home to Holliman AFB and next to the White sands missile range.  Also, this little city is based at the bottom of the mountain range and it is pretty flat down in the basin where the city sits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, as we are going up and down hills, we finally get the part of the trip, where you can actually see the entire basin, the city and a little past the city, there are two large Mountains or very large Hills (they are the only two large landmarks on the other side), which are located behind the city from where we were coming from.  As we are driving I started looking at the two mountains ahead of us and I noticed some lights by them. As I started watching them fascinated by the brightness of them, I noticed that there were three lights and they were moving in odd ways.  One would go up vertically, then speed off at a 45 degree angle behind the mountain, then it would speed back in front of the mountain.  Then soon, 2 more lights joined them.  I would describe them as bright white spheres.  Anyway, these 5 spheres or lights, were just doing the most unimaginable maneuvers in front of these two mountains.  I watched them for about 3 minutes to make sure I was not seeing things and finally told my father in law about them.  He started watching them as well and after a couple of minutes, he stated what the hell is that? We watched them for over 15 minutes and the entire time they were flying, hovering, speeding from point to point and even at times disappearing and reappearing on the other side of the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must state that I worked on the flight-line a lot, during the day and night and am very familiar with aircraft lights, at night, during the day and have a lot of experience working at night on the flight line. I can tell an aircraft or a helicopter with no problem.  I must also state that during my assignment in special ops, our unit worked closely with Navy Seabees, 82nd Airborne, USAF special forces (Combat Control Teams) and even had the opportunity to support Delta force.  Our unit covered all of Africa, Europe and the Middle East, so any missions, wars, conflicts or humanitarian efforts in those theaters, we covered and supported via the flight-line, during day, night, snow, sun etc..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Getting back to my incident.  I guess it’s hard for me to describe exactly what the 5 spheres were doing except by saying they were kinda of doing a star shaped pattern next to the mountains.  Also, I could not make out the details of the mountains, but I could see two huge dark silhouettes of the mountains.  These spheres were disappearing behind it then reappearing when they got to the other side.  It would take them maybe 1 or 2 seconds to go from the 1 o’clock of the mountains to the 7 o’clock position, then streak across the mountains again to the 3 o’clock position. Etc. If you draw a star with your pencil, that is exactly what they were doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to draw a diagram below, with the mountains being the black and the patterns of these ORBS in red.  Please understand, that these crafts or lights, were disappearing behind the mountains and sometimes flying in front of the mountains, so I could see very well that they were in close proximity of those hills, where they could fly behind them and in front of them. These things were extremely fast and their maneuvers were unbelievable.  I have flown on a lot of military planes and  helicopters, I have been to many air shows, and as stated earlier have worked on the flight-line extensively.  So I have seen most USAF aircraft, F15, F16, A10, F18, B1 bomber, B2 bomber, etc T38, KC 135, C130, C5, C141, etc, etc,  I am very familiar with those aircrafts and what they look like and what they can do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In conclusion, either I witnessed a new secret aircraft being tested that we have no knowledge about or I saw a UFO (I’m not saying flying saucer), just unidentified.  This incident has stayed with me for a long time and to this day, I cannot imagine any aircraft doing those maneuvers. These things were super super fast, agile and could stop on a dime.  As stated they would fly in front and the back of the two mountains so I could see them moving, speeding, disappearing, reappearing and hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess we could have been maybe 5-10 miles away.  I could clearly see the silhouttes of the mountains and could see these things fly in front and in back of the mountains.  We were close to whitesands testing facilities, so either new technology or the dreaded word UFO.  I also am very aware of the SR71 and the fact that it was activated n 1964 or 68 and as an active duty member, we really didn’t start seeing pictures of it till about 84 so they kept that out of the public eye for a long time.  These things were not conventional aircrafts.  I currently work for the DOD as a logistician.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

11/27/88 01:30|El Dorado Hills|CA|Unknown|10 minutes|drive-by close encounter|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30625.html|4|ndxe198811| drive-by close encounter<n> <n><n> <n><n> Leaving Sacramento on HWY 50 going back to Lake Tahoe early Thanksgiving morning aprox. 1:30am as I begin to climb the second set of hills, several miles down the road I notice what looked like a plane or a helicopter slowly circling above the highway at the top of the hill I had yet to climb. It had a searchlight shining down on the cars at the top of the hill much like a search helicopter would normally do. Except as I drove closer to the flying object I soon realized some strange things about it. It was unusual to see helicopters flying outside of Sacramento at that time of night, and I noticed it had no flashing strobe lights whatsoever - only two bright white &#34;wingtip&#34; or &#34;landing&#34; lights. The object became clear to me that this was not a helicopter as it had wingtip lights, however, it moved as slowly as a helicopter. Getting more closer, I think this is a very large and low flying plane with a wingspan of a B-52 or larger. Still, no flashing lights. Now it has turned off it&#39;s searchlight and moved to fly along the right side of the highway. At this time I am making my way towards the top of the hill and the object is about to come along side of me on my right side going down the hill as I am driving up the hill. The object is less than 100 feet above ground and about 100 feet out from the road flying slowly just above some power lines that were part of a large Sacramento radio antenna at the top of the hill. &#34;What the hell is that thing?&#34; I kept asking myself. It was too dark to make out anything. It was way too big to be a large plane with just two lights and no strobes flying way to low and slow. It wasn&#39;t until I was directly alongside the object, I rolled down my window to see if I could hear any engine noise when I saw enormous light between the wingtip lights. Rows of red, clear, and like a neon purple in  tubular sections, and there was purple lightning dancing between the bottom of the object and the ground! I screamed I was so scared because I was so close to it and yet I! had no answer to what it was other than alien being a real possibility. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing. I honked my horn and tried to get the people in the car passing me to look at it as I waved my hand pointing frantically at it for them to see. Once I had passed along side of it and passed it, I could no longer see the colored lights between the wingtips anymore, only the two white wingtip lights. I tried to pull over but couldn&#39;t so had to wait until I reached the top of the hill. I got to the top and pulled over and got out and looked, but it was gone. Shoook my head got back in the car headed home and I saw it again in my rear view mirror. It was just too low to see when I got out. I watched it for as long as I could in the mirror as I drove off in fright. The object stayed on it&#39;s course heading for Sacramento, slow and very low to the ground. The entire drive back home was strange, I kept looking up at the sky as I drove thinking there was maybe a mass invasion going on. When I got to Tahoe it was 5:30am. To this day I still have no idea why it took that long to get home. It&#39;s only a 2hr. drive. I only stepped out of the car for a minute or two at the top of that hill. I wanted to get a better look at it. I KNOW others had to have seen this but might have thought it was just a plane. If I only had a passenger or a camera at the time. I actually went back one week later during the day and took photos of the site and made documentations for myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/19/88 20:30|Sunnyvale|CA|Other|60 min. approx.|Figure-eights or infinity symbolism ?|7/23/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29821.html|5|ndxe198811| Figure-eights or infinity symbolism ?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking south from near the intersection Evelyn Ave. and Fair Oaks Ave. and saw bright lights about three or four times the size of a star making figure-eight movements parallel to the ground. My estimate is about 2000 to 2500 ft. altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took me a few minutes to figure out how many craft there were. One would make a figure-eight and have a trail of light behind it briefly, while the other craft would do the same but at 90&#39; to it. So that it looked like a four petaled flower, about 2-3 miles from end to end. The two craft would come very close and almost hit each other at the center point. The duration for one cycle was 4-5 sec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ANOTHER two craft doing the same thing about 4-5 miles away over Mt. View.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total of 4 ships making BIG figure eights. As I say each group of two at 90&#39; to each other. The loops or light trails were oriented on North, South, East, West directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 35-40 min. I said out loud &#34;is that all you&#39;ve got&#34;? 5-10 sec. later a red light detached itself and made an erratic path away and down before fading out. A white light did the same a few seconds later. I was getting bored and went inside. As an experiment I turned on my stereo to check for RF interference. Scanned the dial, some intermitant noisy static on 104.5 FM. My AM was not hooked up to the antenna at that time. I got a phone call from a friend. I thought it was to tell about me about the lights, but she hadnt seen them. I told her go outside and look in the sky. A few minutes later she comes back to tell me, it&#39;s &#34;search lights&#34;. They were not search lights, there was NO beam up into the sky and they were moving far too fast. It is hard to credit your senses that you are seeing what you are seeing when looking at ufo&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 min. later I went back outside and noticed that one of the &#34;flowers&#34;, (two ships) are gone and only the Sunnyvale two remains. Then I heard bam bam bam bam bam bam, six pops. Gunfire from behind me (north), real close. Somebody shooting at them! I thought &#34;thats stupid&#34;, their too high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then a ship comes from the area of the gunfire sounds. It was about 100 ft. away from me (east). Moving about 25 mph. It cleared the power lines by 10 ft. So however tall the high tension lines are, add 10 ft. It was dark but I got the impression it  looked like a &#34;top&#34;, (Ya know, the childs toy?) it had a light on the top and the bottom. One was red, one was white. I dont remember which color light was where. Probably the size of a car or truck, not very big. It leisurely made its way south-west towards Wolfe Ave. There are other details of this sighting and later events I&#39;ll leave out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While all this was going on I counted 16-18 aircraft in the sky. Apparently the miltary and whoever else was watching too. Pretty spectacular. But I never heard a word from the TV news or radio or people talking, anywhere. Not even a report on THIS website by anybody. During this time frame, 1988-91 I saw a lot of ufo&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  We believe that conventional aircraft, or perhaps advertising lights of some sort, would be the first possibility to be ruled out during an investigation of the sighting.  Sunnyvale is where Moffett Field is located, which is a major U. S. government research center, so perhaps the event was the result of some type of work or display conducted there.  If this had been a genuine UFO-related event, we suspect that hundreds of reports would have been generated, and the incident would be well known among present-dayUFO investigators.  However, I have never heard of the incident before this report.  We would welcome other reports, if others were witness to the incident.  PD))<n>

11/19/88 01:30|Tecumseh|OK|Other|25 minutes|Hovering UFO 40 feet above my head|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43962.html|8|ndxe198811| Hovering UFO 40 feet above my head<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving work from Long John Silvers from Shawnee to Tecumseh at around 12:30 that night. As I got onto the highway heading South to Tecumseh, I noticed a bright light coming from the direction of where Tecumseh sits. I at first thought the light to be the town&#39;s baseball stadium lights, and that maybe they were accidentally left on. Thinking nothing more about it, I continued home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally got off the highway when I reached Tecumseh, and took Rangeline Road back to my house (which also neared the baseball stadium there). As I got closer to the Walnut &amp; Rangeline intersection (right about where the baseball park would be), I noticed that the lights had disappeared. It was at the moment when I reached the intersection did something catch my attention. Something was hovering above the intersection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Startled and bewildered, I turned off my car and jumped out to get a better look. It hovered roughly 40 feet above the ground and looked no bigger than an average car. It gave off no bright glow or luminous light, but was definitely metallic in color. Whatever street lights around had given enough light for me to see this object properly. The object made absolutely NO noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only way I have ever been able to describe the look of this craft was that it looked rectangular but with slanted sides, the same way a shoebox would look if you squished it down and the sides were to &#34;slant out&#34;, like this &lt; &gt;. There were two bulbous objects attached underneath this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at the object for nearly two minutes when it started to turn its&#39; direction North, and silently it began moving at what I guess to be 40 miles per hour. I figured the object would be heading towards Highway 177, so I jumped in my car and did a u-turn to follow this thing. I chased it for one mile to the Highway 177 entrance and by the time I got on the highway, the object had taken off like a jet. I pulled off the side of the road and sat there for 15 minutes trying to take in what I had just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never reported this incident fully, just to my wife and a few friends. I still remember it like it was yesterday. Since then, I have had 5 more occassions where I have spotted these objects (not the same ones however). I suppose I just look up the skies more often since that occurence in Oklahoma. I now reside back in my home statse of California in Angels Camp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

As we talked, my attention was distracted by an airborn vehicle with a row of white lights across the front. There was no sound at all. It was not a plane, I did not know what I was looking at. I had to stop my conversation and ask what it was. The other person said he saw things like that frequently and that the locals referred to them as space ships. It came in very close and I had the distincet impression that it was aware of us and was beningn. It then zipped away up into the stars at a very fast rate toward a the middle of a triangluar constellation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Married for 8+ years with a stable happy life. Ironically, we had just moved back to the Stockton address (my home growing up)nearly three years previous in December 1984 from Roswell, N.M.. We moved to Roswell by chance. Placed an application at the local sign company while I helped a couple good friends move to Roswell. Not Once did any of my super good partners who were born and raised in Roswell mention/utter a word about the Roswell Incident 40 years earlier. Anyway--- at that time and probably ever sense I was in my late teens I&#39;ve always had the attitude that &#34;anything is possible&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can only say for sure that the date an year can only be 1987 or 1988 in early to mid November. Why I remember that it was in November, we were having an &#34;Indian Summer&#34; that year. I was watering the edges of my front lawn by hand when for no reason I looked up into the sky above me and all I could see is a black. No stars, no blue-black color that one see&#39;s normally as the color of night sky unless you live away from city lights etc.The whole entire sky was filled with this huge black opaque object as far as I could see in all directions. Then through the branches of the tree that I was standing under,set of lights appeared in a chevron shape with a larger reddish orange with a glimpse of yellow lite was in the center of this chevron shape of different colored lights. It was so huge and looked as though it was traveling no more than 30-40 miles per hour. I remember thinking to myself as to what&#39;s keeeping this ship from just falling out of the sky. Going way to slow to not fall out of the sky. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I could see the real actual night sky with all the stars in the drk-blue black setting. As it continued passing over, I could see the enormity of this thing as it traveled in a north west direction towards the city of Antioch, Fairfield, Vacaville, Santa Rosa and eventually to the Pacific coast. As it was leaving my area, I was estimating the altitude with the telephone poles in the area. This &#34;Mothership or whatever took up at least a 3-4 block sq. area and maybe more at an altitude no more than 300 - 400 ft in the air  and was so quiet (not a peep)it was noisy. I don&#39;t know what made me look up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My address at that time was very close to where the Calaveras river dumps into the deep water channel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

When I got closer I was shocked to see that there were two separate sources of light, one being the beacon and the other being unidentified. When I got to the precise area where the light was, which was about 1/4 mile from the airport beacon, I saw the object producing the light.  It was about 100 yards away from me at a position just above the tree tops.  I had a very good view of the craft.  I exited my truck and stood at the side of the road observing it for approximately 1 minute.  It was saucer shaped but had flat sides which did not come to a point. It was approximately 200 feet in diameter and had bright lights around its peerimeter and on to and bottom.  The lights varied in color from green to blue to white. It made absolutely no noise.  As I watched it I made a decision to leave the road to attempt to get underneath the craft as it was only 100 yards away.  I heard a vehicle coming down the road and looked in that direction to see if they were going to obvserve the object and slow down or stop.  I was only looking in that direction for a second or two and when I turned my head to watch the object again, it was gone.  It had made no noise at any time.  As I forgot to mention its height, which was about  20 to 30 feet.<n>

I exited my vehicle and observed it for approximately one minute.  It was only about sixty yards from me on the diagonal.  It made no noise. It was about 150-200 feet in diameter.  I glanced away for a second or two as I saw a car in the distance in my peripheral vision.  when I returned my gaze to the crafts location,  it was gone.

I saw a bright light in sky, assumed it was the airport beacon.  As I got nearer, I was able to see two distinct, separate lights, one which was the beacon.  I got even closer and could see that this object emitting the light was about 1/4 mile past the airport and somewhat in-line with the airport beacon due to my perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I passed the airport and neared the object and could clearly see it was a UFO.  I stopped adjacent to its position alongside the road and exited my vehicle to better observe it.  The object was large and saucer shaped with bright lights of different colors along its outer rim and on top and bottom.  The object was approximately 150&#39; or more in diameter, and approx 10-20feet in height, and was stationary just above tree level and less than 100 meters from my postion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a very good look at it.

We hit Sweetwater, Tx at about 11:00 pm, and we were on the interstate.  We were not the only ones to see this.  First, there were two small shapes that were shooting all over the sky.  They were red, one shaped like a stop sign and the other like a triangle.  They were everywhere.  People were stopping along the road and getting out of their vehicles to watch the show.  We didn&#39;t stop, as we were expected in Dallas at a certain time.  After about 20 minutes, we saw a huge shape covering the sky.  The little ones were red, but this thing was blue and purple.  It looked like a huge lego brick that moved very slowly and had no sound at all.  It looked like the size of at least three football-sized fields long.  It had no sound at all.  As soon as it passed overhead, the two little ones went into it and then came out.  We don&#39;t remember anymore of what happened.  We got into Dallas at about 2:30 am, and didn&#39;t speak about the event until last November 23, 2002.  We hadn&#39;t seen each other for about 12 years.  Weird, huh??<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate.  PD))<n>

Seen from the Air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On approach to the Phoenix area from the northeast aboard 57-1465,  a crew member alerted me to ATC radio traffic concerning UFO activity.  Prior to this, and for several minutes, I noticed a pattern of whitish-yellow lights in line formation, with slight variations in altitudes, in the relative proximity of South Mountain.  They were visible for at least 40NM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior to hearing the radio traffic, I was under the impression I was seeing very bright lights coming from atop the mountain, as I knew there were horseback riding trails in the area.  I can account for seeing five lights as I remember they formed a shallow W-pattern similar to the form of the Chair of Cassiopeia, however this was in the southern sky and appeared below our altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ATC radio inquired if we saw the lights, which we acknowledged, and it was overheard that the lights were visible from other aircraft and from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned to the north for an approach into Luke AFB and upon completion of that approach, turning toward the south, the lights were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In later years, I was informed they were probably flares in the MOA to the south of Phoenix, however, I am familiar with air-dropped illumination flares, and although there are similar characteristics, these did not appear the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This information is extracted from my log-book.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Reported by a military navigator.

Margareth Leite Figueira - importante advogada capixaba), minha namorada na altura. Voltávamos de uma viagem a Anchieta pela Rodovia do Sol. Estava uma tarde ensolarada e com pouco movimento na estrada. O sol começava a se pôr mas havia ainda muita claridade naquela tarde de verão.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quando nos aproximávamos de Santa Mónica, praia próxima a Guaraparí, do lado esquerdo da rodovia, por trás de um pequena montanha de, mais ou menos uns 15m de altura, estava um objeto de cor grafite, parado na vertical!  Parei o carro, apontei para o objeto e perguntei a Margareth: &#34;Você está vendo aquilo?&#34; Ela, com os olhos muito arregalados, disse. &#34;Sim. É um disco voador.&#34;  Este morro tinha uma característica interessante: era quase sem vegetação dos lados, mas tinha algumas árvores de pequena estatura no cume. A estrada fazia uma volta e continuava por detrás dele.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Desci do carro e aproximei-me do aparelho. Ele continuava lá, parado na vertical por trás do morro. Tinha por volta de uns 4 metros de diâmetro e quase não tinha espessura. Pelo menos, não conseguia dimensionar a sua espessura.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Entrei novamente no carro e disparei em frente para ter uma melhor visão quando estivesse do outro lado da montanha mas, ao chegar lá, não havia mais nenhum sinal do objeto circular e achatado de cor de chumbo. Era como se ele nunca estivesse estado ali.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lembro que quando aproximei-me da coisa, mais ou menos uns 30 metros de distância, tive uma sensação de muito medo e, durante todo este tempo, nunca consegui reportar este evento, embora tenha contado para algumas pessoas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> O tempo total em que avistamos o objeto girou por volta de uns 5 a 10 minutos, entre o parar do carro e o deslocamento até o outro lado do morro.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Dra. Margareth ainda está muito ativa em sua profissão e é titular de um importante Cartório no centro de Vitória. Com certeza ela poderá confirmar esta história verdadeira.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minha intenção ao relatar esta história verdadeira é libertar-me de uma sensação de estranheza. Sentia-me como uma pessoa escolhida e, ao mesmo tempo, com uma grande responsabilidade por ter que reportar tal coisa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Devo dizer que me sinto um pouco mais leve entretanto.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sinceramente,  Daniel Amaral  ---   Curiously, passed so many years of this seeing and, having lived one another much more strong experience than this one in a phase of the life when I supposedly was much more conscientious and more knowledge of the phenomenon, just because after what happened before , I started to read a lot about flying saucers, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never reported  what happened after the first seeing what I start to do now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt like some thing was blocking me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the times when I remembered that vision I felt a sensation of anguish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point start to tell the ocurred in 1988: In the year of 1988, I was I in company of Margareth (Dra. Margareth Leite Figueira -an  important lawyer of the Vitória, capital city of the Espirito Santo state), my girl friend that time. We was returning from of a trip to Anchieta through  the so called  &#34;Rodovia do Sol&#34;-  Highway of the Sun. Was one sunny  afternoon  and with little movement in the road. The sun set was started .<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we was near to Santa Mónica beach from the Guaraparí city, in the left side of the highway, in the  backwards of a small mountain , was an object of the graphite color , stopped in the vertical line! I stopped the car and pointed  to the object and I asked the Margareth: &#34;You are seeing to that&#34; She said. &#34;Yes. there is a flying saucer.&#34;  That mount had an interesting characteristic: it was almost without vegetation in the sides, but it had some trees of small stature in the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a curve in the road that continued behind the mount.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went down of the car and I came close myself to the device. It continued, motionless there in the vertical line for backwards of the mount.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about 4 meters of diameter and almost did not have thickness. At least, I did not obtain the dimension of its thickness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I entered again in the car and I went off in front to have one better vision when it was of the other side of the mountain but, when arriving there, I did not have signal of the circular and flattened object of graphite color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seems like was never had been there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember that when I came close to the object around 30 meters of distance, I had a bad sensation of fear  during all this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d never thought to report this event, even I have told for some people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total time of the sight was around 5 to 10 minutes, between stopping of the car and the displacement until the other side of the mount.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Margareth still very active in his profession as a titular of an important Notary&#39;s office in the center of Vitória City.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She certainty will be able to confirm this true history.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My intention when telling this true history is to free me of a strange sensation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometimes I feel like i am a chosen person and, at the same time, with a great responsibility for having to report such kind of thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Daniel Amaral  500 Lights On Object0: Yes<n>
