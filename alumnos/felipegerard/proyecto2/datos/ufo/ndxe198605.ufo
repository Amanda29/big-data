I became concerned because it seemed to be a large aircraft, flying very fast at way too low an altitude. I watched as it made a turn to fly against the hillside range above my house. Suddenly I realized that not only was the aircraft NOT flying fast, but it was much smaller than I&#39;d thought. I kept watching and realized that the aircraft was sort of &#34;floating&#34; along, not following a direct path, but sort of meandering side to side, and up and down.  Sort of like a ball floating on waves. When I could make out details, I found that it had no particular shape, was sort of &#34;opalescent&#34; like a bubble, and seemed to be revolving, but in no particular direction. The strange thing is, when I realized I was not looking at a standard aircraft, I gasped and said out loud &#34;OH MY GOD!&#34;   The aircraft reacted, sort of stumbling to a half-stop, and then dashing away full speed. I dropped my child into her crib and raced out the door, 3 seconds tops, and it was already out of sight when I got outside. There were no discernable lights on the craft, yet we had no lights that would reflect on the craft, so the lighting must have been interior.  For years I would have a vague memory of that night in the back of my mind, but it was not until my daughters and I saw another strange shape over the San Joaquin Valley and started talking about it, that the memory and all the details of that evening long past came flooding back.  Almost as tho a dam had been unleashed.  It was the strangest thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Structure underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amature  astronomer. It was after Halley&#39;s Comet was a good viewing object but was still in the sky or possibly when Halley&#39;s was behind the sun. I was in my  backyard but not looking through my scope when from the southwest moving toward the northeast an L-shaped or triangle shaped &#34;craft&#34; passed directly overhead. It moved slowly and with no sound. It was generally flat underneath but had structures underneath that looked like I-beams and large circles. It had a dull, flat metallic look. It was as big as an airliner,if low but it was bigger than that if it was higher in the sky. It had no bright lights or any lights. Later when the Stealth aircraft were shown i thougt it resembled a large one of  those but it was silent and slow moving.<n>

It moved across the street above the houses. I could see a metallic base with some sort of tubing or piping.It was a dark grey colour or nearly black. It was about 60 feet in length. Something just made me look up and there it was. This is my second ufo encounter and I am really creeped out about it all. The silence of the thing is the thing that sticks in my mind. It eventually moved across the houses out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/15/86 20:30|Winona (Canada)|ON|Chevron|45 sec|overflight of strange (stealth) craft|12/19/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33920.html|4|ndxe198605| overflight of strange (stealth) craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stargazing with my Scout troop, at the local high school. We were observing constellations that were visible. It was a very clear night. I began scanning the sky for sattelites as I had seen one the previous summer. I saw an object in the sky travelling east to west overhead. The object was difficult to see as it was black against the night sky. It was a thick chevron type shape, visible in silloette and left a vapor trail behind it. there was a slight orange glow at the rear (I assume) of the craft that was emitting the trail. I attempted to point out the object to my fellow Scouts and my Scout Leaders, but no one else was able to pick it out of the sky. The Scout leaders called me a liar so I shut up about it. I would estimate that I was seeing a sizable object at an altitude comparable to that of commercial jets. In later years I was struck by the similarity of what I had seen to the shape of the B2 stealth bomber, although the craft I saw was bulkier looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

She yelled for me to come quick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got there, I saw her looking out of the window and she said that there was a ufo in the sky.  I thought she was mistaken, that perhaps it was a kite or she was kidding around until I reached the window which is on the 6th story bldg and saw a brass colored V shaped object floating in the southeastern sky.  The thing was slowing rotating around w/o a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shocked, not scared but intrigued.  I ran to get a small telescope to see it closer.  The object had a circle-like large porthole in the end part of the V.  It did not look like a window and it was the same color as the brass metal.  The UFO turned and rotated over and over.  As it did, the V would become an L and then cigar and back again to an L and a V over and over.  It was a clear sky with a few clouds and the object was just around cloud level or roughly 2,000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mum said that they were communicating to her, saying that they were friendly.  I just looked at her and disbelieved her.  She said that she asked when are they coming and that they replied soon, very soon.  She also said that it had a haze around it which I didnt see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mum actually liked the episode, I felt a little creepy but not frightened.  My dad arrived and we told him to go look.  He did and was fascinated also, almost amused.  He kind of looked happy and he was not the type of person to smile easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This UFO was affecting my parents moods into being jovial I thought.  We all looked silently until the craft flew out of our line of sight towards the Northeast which I didnt want it leave.  I told my parents that I was 100% sure they knew we spotted them and they may have trained their visual aids on us, maybe even photographed us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a strong sensation that our images were captured to be shown in their world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

5/15/86 08:00|Jefferson|CO|Sphere|2-3 hrs|saw a bright red sphere moving slowly from west to east on the north of our campsite.|9/13/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05238.html|6|ndxe198605| saw a bright red sphere moving slowly from west to east on the north of our campsite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere was blinking on and off in an odd fashion, as if it was phasing in and out of this dimension , very jerky motions, then slow steady progress to the east then more jerky motions etc.  After about five minutes the object went behind a mtn. to the east and circled around to the south of our campsite and hovered silently about fifty feet off of the ground and seventy five yards away. It was about three hundred feet in diameter and bright redish orange.  We felt a strange calmness and after what seamed like only a  few minutes it went away at a very high rate of speed, it coveredat least thirty five miles in a split second and was bouncing eratically over the mountain range to the south west of our campsite. since then i have had the feeling that it was not just a few minutes hovering but a few hours, but at the time of the incident we didn&#39;t realize how much time had elapsed. There were four of us and we all had seen the same thing.<n>
5/15/86 02:00|Midwest City|OK|Unknown|approx. 3 minutes|This object was seen at night hovering over a building at a local Air Force Base in Oklahoma|3/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35493.html|7|ndxe198605| This object was seen at night hovering over a building at a local Air Force Base in Oklahoma<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1986 I used to be a civilian police officer working at a local Air Force Base in Midwest City, Oklahoma. We worked rotating shifts and different areas of the base and this particular night I was assigned to work the &#34;South 40&#34; area, which was campsite area on the south side of the base. There were no campers in the area but I sat at the perimeter fence at a gate house with my engine off, lights off observing the stillness of the night. It was completely dark in the area but in the distance you could see lights of other buildings on the base. I was looking in an east direction toward a building where they worked on aircraft inside the building. Just south of that building was a building they tested jet engines at times during the night time. As I was setting there I noticed a lighted object over the top of the mile long building where they worked on planes. This particular building was approximately a mile and a half away from me but you could see the top of the mile long structure. Like I said it was dark and I KNOW for a fact the only lights the building ever had on top were the lights on the four corners of the building. In the center of the building I noticed a variety of lights but NOT blinking like the red flashing lights on the corners of the building. These lights were red, green and blue. I can remember there appeared to be about a dozen lights on the object. I could not see the size or shape of the object. During the night time you could always hear planes taking off or landing. You could at times hear helicopters in the area but this night I couldn&#39;t hear any noise at all from that direction. I kept my eyes glued on those lights and after about 3 minutes the lights disappeared. I was totally freaked out. I wondered to myself, &#34;Did I actually see a UFO?&#34; I didn&#39;t report it to headquarters because the police dispatcher would think I was crazy. After seeing the object I sat there staring at the building and couldn&#39;t see the object anymore. About 10 minutes later the police dispatcher called VIA 2 way radio and told me to call him. I was setting at the guard shack and used the telephone there to call. The first thing he asked me was where I was. I told him I was setting in the South 40 area at the gate shack. He, along with the other officers that worked that area knew when you worked nights there wouldn&#39;t be any noise. The dispatcher asked me if I had seen anything unusual just recently. I told him no but I asked him why and when. He then told me the residents in the Midwest City, Del City area had witnessed odd lights over that particular building and had called their respective police department who in turn called my police dept since it was on the Air Force Base. That is when I told him I DID see something and the object didn&#39;t make any noise at all. That is the only time I had ever witnessed anything like that but since others actually had seen the same thing I did I now DO believe there are UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

5/12/86 20:45|Dade City (near)|FL|Triangle|04 minutes|While camping in the late 80's we had several encounters with a silent triangular object 300-400ft above our camp site|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44674.html|8|ndxe198605| While camping in the late 80&#39;s we had several encounters with a silent triangular object 300-400ft above our camp site<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I did a lot of camping near Silver Lake State Park just outside of Dade city in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s. All but a few of our sightings took place usually just after dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was just the first time that we saw something in that area. After that on many occations we saw the same type (shape) of object. Also there was a round or oval object that we would see sometimes The triangular object was about 50 to 75 yards from tip to tip. I am 54 years old now, and at the time we were both employed at a hospitals in St. Petersburg, Fl I (we) didn&#39;t want to sound crazy to everyone, specificlly to the places that we worked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a respiratory therapist and he was a LPN. We were both reciently divorced and did a bunch of camping during that time. We told very few other friends about our sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although after the first time it seemed that for about the next aprox. 2 years nearly we saw something that neither one of us could explain. Anyway each time we saw these crafts they moved almost directly over our heads and made no noise that we could hear. But it seemed that one could feel like a presure or something when they were directly over head. I really don&#39;t know how to explain it. They almost always moved from norhwest to southeast very low no more than 300 to 400 ft off the ground. We were both into model rocketry when we were younger and kind of used to judging height. We even tried shinning a spot light at them a few times but it didn&#39;t seem to do anything so we only did that a few times. The bottom of the triangular craft was smooth and kind of (roundish). The round craft went bye much faster and was harder to make out. For a while we were camping sometimes 2 weekends a month and for that period of time we saw something almost every time we went up. I wish I could tell you more but thats about it. After about 2 years they just stopped showing up. We both remarried and stopped doing so much camping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said. I am 54 years old now and dying of liver disease so I really don&#39;t care what anyone thinks about me anymore. I was a very interesting time i my life and at least now someone else knows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t have any photography but I will try and draw then scan and email the shape area map and direction to you. We did take a few pictures but my friend has since gotten very religious destroying the photos saying that it was the work of satan. I was his camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was maybe 75 to 100 feet in the air. I was talking to a friend across the road and it was heading toward her house. Iwent outside on the porch to get a better view of it. The object did not emit noise. I went back in the house. Then the object shot down a blue beam of light down from the craft. The object itself was a white light. It did not pulsate.After it shot the blue beam down it moved very slowly back toward the north.<n>

I am an amateur astronomer so I looked up all the time and I didn&#39;t ever remember seeing a star formation like this one over the woods across the way.  I lived on a dead end street that only had three houses on it.  The woods were the 4 acre wild backyard of a catholic high school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects looked like stars but were brighter than polaris, they were colored white. I thought it was strange but didn&#39;t really notice anything odd until I looked out again an hour later and they had moved.  At that time the triangle was rotated to point left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Originally the triangle pointed down, then an hour later it pointed left then an hour after that it pointed up. At first I thought they might be helicopters, but they were bright enough that I should have been able to make out the other lights on the aircraft if they were aircraft, and they had been flying too long in the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The star-like objects were each at least a degree apart, I&#39;m an amatuer astonomer so I can judge distance in a night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After two hours I noticed that the objects began to rotate faster and faster then after 15-20 seconds of fast rotation they shot off in different directions so fast that I could not follow them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has to have been the most amazing thing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

5/1/86 19:00|Jefferson (near)|CO|Sphere|unknown|Red sphere low to the ground moving slowly and erratically.|2/16/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05370.html|13|ndxe198605| Red sphere low to the ground moving slowly and erratically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have made this report several times at a few websites and I decided to make it into a works file so I can paste it instead of rewriting it.  I am not sure of the year or month but I think it was either spring or fall in the mid 80s. Anyway  there was a small amount of snow on the ground and we were near Jefferson Colorado.  There is a road that runs from Jefferson past Tarryall reservoir and we were camping a few miles from the lake.  It was just before sundown and my wife saw a red ball down low to the north of our camp. It was to the north east at first and it was traveling east. It came across us to the north about 1\4 to 1\2 mile away. it took about 5 to 10 minutes to travel by and disappear behind a mountain that was to the north east of  us. It appeared to be pretty big (100 ft dia) but it was hard to tell because of the distance it was from us. I remember thinking that I wished it would come closer so we could see it. A little while later it came around the mountain it had disappeared behind. It was coming back towards the west on the south side of camp.  This time it was only about 75 yards away!!! It was 300 feet in dia (approx) and it stopped directly to the south of us and hovered with its bottom side only about 50 feet  off of the ground.  It was bright orange about the color of metal that is 1600 degrees or so.  I know what temperatures look like from working with tool steels and furnaces.  Anyway  I’m not saying that it was hot but that is what it looked like. It hovered there still and totally silent for what seemed to be a few minutes and then it went away from us so fast that it traveled about 35 miles in a split second and was bouncing erratically over the mountains to the south west of us.  I looked at a map and the distance is a estimate from what I saw that night. Since then I have remembered a little more about that night and I think that it was more than a few minutes that it was hovering and that we  just didn’t realize the time.  There were four of us and we all saw the same thing  through the whole experience.  Three of us had drank a few beers but one had not ever drank any alcohol in her life. we were all in our late twenties or early thirties. I know this is an old report but I think it is important to be posted. Thank you...<n>
