We talked for about fifteen minutes then she brought to my attention a glowing light up in the sky.  Her first comment was, &#34; it looks like a helicopter&#34;.  I  said no it is moving to fast. Then I noticed there was no noise and suggested it to be a falling star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it went over my house we both thought it very unusual.It came out of the sky from the southwest and was traveling to the northeast.  We watched as it went out of sight.  Then she through her hands up and pointed to another one.  The first five came in a steady stream.  All at the same; altittude, direction and speed.  At this time I went into the house and got my room-mate whom has been flying since he was fifteen and was a commercial pilot for over fifteen years.  Then another light appeared and soon after another.  Then a moment later a third.  The first two took a path a little off from the first five and the third cut to the north.  My room-mate commented they were a diamond shape.  Then with a pause the final glow went through on the same path as the first five.<n>

10/31/08 22:40|Hermosa Beach|CA|Triangle|10 minutes|Two lighted objects dancing in the sky above Los Angeles on Oct. 31, 2008|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66624.html|5|ndxe200810| Two lighted objects dancing in the sky above Los Angeles on Oct. 31, 2008<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do not really know where to start so I will just begin at where we were.  At the beach on Halloween smoking cigarettes.  I went back to the house to get a sweatshirt and when I came back my brother was yelling at me telling me to hurry up.  When I meet up with him, he and my other friend were watching these two objects in the sky.  They were pretty far away, looked like they were above Los Angeles.  They did not move like planes, or helicopters.  The two objects were dancing in the sky, like kites, or Devil Rays in the ocean.  It was too spectacular so I ran to the strand to get another witness.  A Hispanic man wearing a cowboy hat walking with his son of about 8 years old, an Asian man, black woman and a group of people walking down the strand all saw it.  The man and his child, watched with me for what seemed to be about 5-8 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after we began watching, we saw a stream of light stretch across the sky.  It looked like a shooting star, but we figured it was too much of a coincidence and it probably was another UFO entering into the atmosphere.  We never saw it join up with the other two objects.  We watched the two dancing, lighted objects for about 10 minutes, until they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it all was happening, they were shaped like kites.  Not really sure of how many lights there were, but they changed from bright white, and the occasional single red light.  From our view, they looked like they would dive down to the ground and float back up above the clouds.  They never traveled in straight lines,  more random directions, again they looked like they were dancing or playing with each other.  This is my story and this morning I have looked on the net to see if they were other witnesses of the event.  Have yet to find any report of it.  This is surprising to be because it was over Los Angeles which has one of the busiest air traffic area in the country.  It did not appear that any helicopters were following the lighted objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My friend mentioned it, like, &#34;WTF IS THAT?&#34;, and we ended up pulling over to look at it. What we saw was 3 bright white lights in a triangle shape, extremely close together. It was obviously at a very high altitude. None of the lights were flashing, and the object was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ended up going to 2 liqour stores, we saw it before we got to the first one, at the first one, and at the second one, and after we got home. It was at the same place in the sky each time I checked for it, but when I was looking at it at home, it started descending until I couldn&#39;t see it over the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We ended up at our local park’s Haunted House, and waited in the car for the kids to go through. We were parked facing North, and as we talked, I noticed a green flash of light streaking low across the sky. At first, I thought I was seeing fireworks, as the color was bright emerald green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I realized it was ball shaped, and looked like a shooting star. Unlike a shooting star though, it seemed much lower in the sky, very close by, like fireworks would have been; and it was  moving horizontally through the sky, rather than the falling arc one usually sees with a “shooting star.”  There seemed to be some sparks coming off of it also, as if it were burning up in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it just disappeared. My friend did not see this, although she was facing in the same direction.<n>

Colour was a constant orange glow. With no flashing or colour change. There was no noise as the objects moved through the sky and moved slowly about the speed of a light aircraft. The objects moved in formation all in single file. Three first, then a gap then two more close together. They stayed straight and level on the horizon. The sighting took place over a time period of about 10 mins. The objects moved from the North East to the South East in a wide ark.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66619.html|12|ndxe200810| Pulsating/Oscillating Sphere or Orb spotted in Metro Atlanta<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night around 8:45 to 9:00pm; I went for a walk after one of my friends had left. I walked south down out of the Cul-De-Sac on which I live, and down the street. I was about halfway down the road when I decided to stop under a streetlamp, and do what I always do on cloudless nights.  Scan the Skies.  I called my dad to ask him something as I began to look around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began to scan intently and saw a few planes in the distance, but when I looked in the western sky, I noticed an Orange Sphere/or Orb.  It was oscillating/pulsing as it drifted off to the north.  I told my dad I saw something weird in the sky and he must have though I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began to feel very startled and almost freaked out by the experience, yet at the same time exhilarated. The object was following a direct flightpath of most planes in our area, but I assure you this was no jetliner.  I have seen many planes, jets, and helicopters; military and civilian in this area but it just didn&#39;t meet the description of any earthly craft I have seen.  Panic set in as I realized this definitely wasn&#39;t something I could not readily identify.  I began to review stories in my head of people being taken while on a stroll in their neighborhoods after dark.  That was when I decided I wasn&#39;t just going to just stand there and watch it.  I was still on the phone with my dad at this time I so I told him that I would be home in a few minutes, and hung up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then seeming ran for dear life as fast as I could back to my house and watched from the porch.  The craft flew almost directly overhead and just then the Orange Light turned off and gave way to what looked like airplane lights but there was no green or red lights on the wingtips just bright yellowish-white ones, and there were no flashing lights at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside the house; my heart pounding.  I sat down and reviewed what I saw.  It was then that I noticed the craft also made no noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After calming down I turned on the TV and began watching Ghost Hunters Live, and all the while I couldn&#39;t get the thoughts out of my head of what in the hell had I seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple hours I began to get tired so I walked up to to my room, and jumped in bed.  Surprisingly I slept very soundly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD))<n>

The lights had the appearance of a flare that seemed to defy the logic of an airborne flare. The lights started to descend over a distance before starting to climb to 30 degrees above horizon and possibly turn to the North before fading out. The lights travelled at a constant speed. These lights were in view for approximately 3 minutes. 4 witnesses saw these lights from the same perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

We passed through it because we saw a sheriff and headed north on Riverview Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then turned west on Snowville Road, but turned around to go back to &#34;Helltown&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon turning southbound on Riverview Road, we looked behind us to check for traffic.  In the sky, hovering was a black triange, about a couple thousand feet off the ground.  It had 4 lights that were a bluish hue, 3 in the corners and one in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to take pictures with our cell phones, but nothing came out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned off the radio and the car for a moment to check for sound, and there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or so, we got scared and decided to leave.<n>

We were proceeding down the street, and my friend and I were looking at the stars, because the sky was especially clear that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking into the sky, when I noticed a light that seemed to be moving like a plane would, but was not blinking.  It was moving at a fast pace through the sky, then stopped dead in its tracks and shot directly into the darkness and dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend just so happened to be looking at it at the same time and witnessed it as well.  We started freaking out because we both had never seen anything like that before.  We started discussing what we had saw and that it could not have been a plane because it was not blinking, couldnt have been a shooting star because they do not stop before dissappearing into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a skeptic before that night and now belive in UFO&#39;s.<n>

It kept doing this for a duration of at least ten minutes till it disappeared into a cloud bank east of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very dark out at the time and it was the bright orange that caught my attention.  As the object moved it appeared to get smaller and almost disappear but it would then appear at it&#39;s full size and color intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am retired from the USAF and have a background as a criminal investigator.  I have worked on many &#34;restricted&#34; projects and have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife who also saw this also has a law enforcement background and spent 8 years in the USAF.<n>

She decided to jump in the shower. I went out front to see if anyone else was coming to our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up in the sky, as I always do; I am an amateur astronomer.  I was looking towards SWS at Jupiter.  That&#39;s when I noticed a green solid light, about the size and brightness of Jupiter.  I noticed it was moving towards ENE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about a minute, then ran in the house to tell my wife.  Unfortunately, she was in the shower and could not come out and see it.  I then ran into the backyard and I could still see it, moving in the same direction.  I watched it moving ENE until I could not see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked around, not expecting to see anything else, when I saw two more green lights, fairly close to each other, moving in the same direction.  I couldn&#39;t believe it. I watched them move in the same direction, until I could not see them anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was trying to come up with a reasonable explaination for myself.  There were no other lights, like a red one, or a strobe, like on a small airplane, which fly aroung the area frequently.  Since it was Halloween, I had a strong feeling that maybe a kid tied one of those green glowing light sticks to a helium ballon, and it was just floating in the wind, since there was absolutely no sound coming from the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later checked the NOAA website (weather.gov) to check the wind direction that night.  They reported at about 7pm and 8pm.  At 7pm they reported calm wind, no direction.  At 8pm they reported a south wind at about 7 mph.  I do not know what I saw, but they were not going in the direction of the wind.<n>

As I turned around toward the street my eye caught a red light in the Sky at about 2 o&#39;clock high.  This red light was approaching slowly toward me.  At first I thought it was a plane however it was moving too slow to be a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped off the porch to observe the light as it was passing over my house.  It passed straight over my house at a height of I would guess to be several thousand feet.  Looking at the object straight above it had no flashing marker lights as a plane would have.  The object appeared to be round and it glowed orange/red.  As it passed over the brightness of the object suddenly changed to a faint red dot.  I could track this dot as it proceeded North East.  I lost it as it passed behind the neighbor’s house. The object made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my Father at 6:58pm after the object left my field of view.  He lives about 20 minutes in that direction and I asked if he would go out and look west.  Hoping he would see this object as it approached.  My Father noticed a white light moving slowly but didn’t think anything more of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While on the phone with my Father I looked up and another Orb was moving on the same trajectory.  I disconnected the call and managed to take one photo with my camera phone. The orb faded out as the first one did and I could track a smaller faint dot as it moved North East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second Sighting was at 7:00 pm, shortly after two older teens were walking in front of the house.  I asked them if they saw anything and the teens indicated that they saw what looked like a flying pumpkin.<n>

Its behavior was strange because it did not move like a helicopter or plane and there were no lights of any color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object stood out like a blimp but it was not shaped or colored like one.  It was too high up for a kite and if it was a kite at that height it was too large in size.  The object was very dark black and it moved in a somewhat hovering manner almost like a large bird but at that height and distance from us it was too large in size for a bird.  The object shape was somewhat like a boomerang, normally after seeing such an object I would be writing it off as something natural but then after 10 minutes there was no sign of the object in any direction from where we first observed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that maybe if anyone else made a report to you that my information might help, I am sorry but I had no observing or recording equipment with me at the time.<n>

It appeared and disappeared within 3-5 seconds.  I categorized it as probably another jet with the sun reflecting off it&#39;s fusilage as it banked, although there was no contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several miles later I saw another one (or the same one again) also for just a few seconds.  I still didn&#39;t think much of it, until minutes later when I saw three helicopters: two flying east about 1000 feet apart at 5,000&#39; 1 yellow 2 seater, the other navy blue/white ~6 seater, and the third flying north -I couldn&#39;t see the colors too well through the trees, but it was a dark color and small.  About 15 minutes after that, I watched a military jet (F16?) flying very slowly at around 12,000&#39; - 15,000&#39; southwest to northeast.  I wanted to report this in case someone else saw more than I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for running this site despite the immature youth making it difficult!

I ventured off to look for a stick.  I looked up in the sky and called to my friend. In the sky were 5 oval shaped things with 100 feet long tails.  The color of the craft was white with red flaming tails.  The distance apart was at least 20 meters appart.  Planes have to be 100 meters apart so we know it can&#39;t be airplanes.  When we sat back down we saw another one. They were all heading to the same spot.<n>

It was an absolutely beautiful fall day with no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were in the front yard we were asking our little sister (who is 3 years old), if she could see a plane (it was a Northwest Airlines 747 because it was low enough that you could see the red on the tail) that was flying into the airport in Flint, MI about 40 miles to the east.  As we watched the airplane, my sister asked, &#34;Do you see that thing above the airplane?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around the plane and then finally I picked out what she was talking about.  It looked like a metallic sphere that was flying at an incredible speed to the north.  It was much higher in the sky than the airplane, and was traveling at a much greater speed.  All we could see was this sphere that reflected light sometimes as it traveled northwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the craft for anywhere from 10-15 seconds before it eventually disappeared out of view.  Then my sister claims that she could see a second metallic object identical to the one we both saw, but I never was able to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I both looked at each other and immediately agreed that there was no way that was a plane. There was no way it was a satellite, helicopter or a blimp. This was an object like I have never seen before. I am very interested in a UFO and go sky watching at night many times, but I’ve never claimed to have seen a UFO before. This is the first time I can honestly say that I can not identify the object, so it IS a UFO by very definition. In no way am I jumping to conclusions and saying that it was an alien spacecraft. All I am saying is that it was an incredible event that I won’t soon forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A quick background of my sister and me would prove to be very normal.  My sister is a certified elementary teacher and I am a full time college student in pursuit of my degree in elementary education. We both are interested in UFO’s but both of us claim to have never seen anything that could be called a UFO in our lives, until yesterday.<n>

There were 6-8 lights in the v formation. It looked like a flock of geese the way they were flying. We watched for a few seconds and then the 2 lights that were toward the back of the v went out of formation, and did a &#39;zig-zag&#39; around the lights at the very end of the v. As quickly as the lights moved out of formation, they quickly moved back in the v. The formation didn&#39;t seem to slow down when this happened and kept traveling to the south. The lights seemed to be flying higher than a plane, appearing as little white dots in the sky. This lasted for 8-10 seconds, because they never disappeared into the sky, but kept traveling until they were out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Large, bright, silent object seen going SSW<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on my second-story windowsill having a smoke with the windows open. It was a cool, clear night and I was stargazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A triangular craft, nearly as I could tell an equilateral triangle, flew above me and travelled till out-of-sight in a straight line.  The bottom had a dull-lit half-sphere on the bottom at each point.  Three yellow lights (line-shaped) went from orb -to -orb and in the center there was a blue &#34;swirling&#34; light, fairly dim also. It flew directly over my location.   The Object appeared about as big as my fist at arms length.  It seemed to be maybe 750 feet above the tree-line, flying from NNE to SSW at perhaps 300-400 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One detail.  The orb-like lights at the bottom corners looked odd. They looked just like a ping-pong ball, cut-in-half with the amber light shining evenly through it.  I don&#39;t know how else to describe it.  The center &#34;blue&#34; light seemed to be different, as if in motion, like water down a drain.  Weather was around 35-40! degrees, clear, light wind.  The object did seem to make a faint &#34;jet&#34; sound but after it left the area the sound stayed. I noticed an airliner so I think the object was silent.  Very, Very quiet at least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness<n>

We went to the front porch to see what it was and instead our eyes were drawn to a fast moving semi-circular set of 3 blinking lights on something that was moving VERY FAST, horizontally,  in the southeast sky.  The blinking lights appeared to be below the craft.  It was pitch black outside and difficult to see above the blinking lights. We were spooked when it dropped sharply and vertically below the tree line.  We went back inside and again heard the roar of the jet engines.  I spoke with my neighbor about it and he said military jets were in our neighborhood last night.  He&#39;s an airplane mechanic at a military base nearby.  He did not come out to check it out because he recognized the jet engine sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/30/08 19:50|Palos Verdes|CA|Circle|2-3 minutes|Circular Flying Craft with glowing tube of light around perimeter seen less than 1000 yards away.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66644.html|40|ndxe200810| Circular Flying Craft with glowing tube of light around perimeter seen less than 1000 yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 30, 2008 I was driving up into Palos Verdes, CA, on Palos Verdes Blvd. coming from Redondo Beach, CA at approximately 7:50 PM to pick up some food I ordered. When I got up into the beginning area of Palos Verdes just passing the shopping center on my left I saw a circular object, straight ahead and slightly to my right that had a tube ring of light that wrapped around its perimeter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way to describe this light was if you were to take a straight tube fluorescent bulb and bend it to wrap around into a circle. This was around the perimeter of the object and was glowing powerfully, with a slight blue hue to it. There was also a square shaped lighting tube that was off to one side of the object that was the same color and intersected with the round shaped tube of light but was much smaller in overall size in comparison. The second I had caught view of the object it had made a very quick, smooth flight pattern that I would say was a 60-70 degree angle straight upward in the sky but still in my view. The instant I saw this I couldn’t believe what I was seeing because it was so close. I could easily say it was less than 1000 yards away at its farthest point during my sighting. As I saw the object make that quick flight pattern, I was continuing to drive straight when I glanced to my right to see a couple that was off the side of the road, standing beside their car, already trying to take pictures of the craft. I thought, “my god they are seeing it too and who knows for how long before me.”  	 After stopping at a stop sign immediately after and continuing to drive forward I see the craft lowering itself from the point it had stopped from the previous flight pattern. I then pull over the side of the rode where there are houses lined on the street. My eyes are staying focused on the object the whole time. I’m staring at this craft object through my windshield off to my right which is slowly lowering itself while making a flight pattern quite strange. I get out of my car trying not to loose even a second of looking at the object. The craft is swaying back and forth from right to left, to left to right. Then it begins to simply lower straight down very slowly and smooth until it is out of vision, below the elevated plateau I’m standing on. The area it was flying over and eventually lowering itself was over the ocean as Palos Verdes is a town with several layers of elevated plateaus and oceanside cliffs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then quickly get back in my car to turn around to see if the couple I saw was still there but they weren’t. I’m not sure if they would have seen the lower flight pattern it took  because from their position you can’t see over the ocean and there are trees that possibly blocked their vision from their angle of view. I then try to drive down to a lower area to see if the craft was still hanging around beyond where I could see. I got down very close to the ocean, cliffside, but I saw nothing. The object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was completely baffled and couldn’t believe what I had seen. The fact that it was so close and could see it so clearly felt unreal to me. I tried to rationalize during and after the sighting what it could have been. There was only one thing I could come up with other than it being some “other worldly” craft. I thought maybe some talented guys had built a circular, remote controlled craft and were flying it. I then thought that this was not likely true because the lighting of the craft was simply too magnificent and the craft likely too large. That powerfully glowing tube of light around the perimeter was a light like I’ve never seen before. The couple that was taking pictures must have been awed enough to stop and take pictures. Also, that beginning flight pattern of the craft shooting straight upward at a 60-70 degree angle was too fast. Conclusions I came to were as follows:  - This was a “flying craft” of some sort that was being “controlled” somehow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - The object was obviously circular shaped - I have NEVER seen anything like this - The size of the object was estimated to be about the size of a car or larger considering the relation to the landscape and how close I it was to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - The craft made no sound that I could here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget what I saw. I would love more than anything to know exactly what it was. I feel strange that I saw this so close to me. It was not just some point of light in the distance. I don’t know what to do with my experience as it was so “baffling” and feel incredibly unsettled about it. The thing I’m most intrigued about was the lighting. I’m not a 100% believer in UFOs and this lighting was like nothing I’ve ever personally heard reported in peoples sightings.<n>

I tried to speed up to get a closer look because it seemed to be far a head of me off to my left towards Philipsburg. It didn&#39;t look to be that big ,but it was pretty high in the sky.  While I was getting closer the thing just shot straight up and disapeared in seconds . The sun made this thing shine pretty bright. I never told anyone in fear they would think I&#39;m nuts.  I know it was not a plane. It was oval and nothing I know of we have that can fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up and saw a bright chrome object moving throught he sky. I almost disregarded it till I noticed it didn&#39;t have wings. It was shaped like a cigar and towards the back instead of being chrome it looked almost as if it was gold. It didn&#39;t fly straight it sort of floated in my direction then floated in another direction while still moving forward. There was no vapor trail. It also somehow grabbed the attention of my two dogs who watched it with me till it disappeared behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/30/08 06:50|Apex/Cary|NC|Triangle|5 Minutes|Spotted: a triangular shaped object hovering slight above treeline level at the border of Apex and Cary.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67602.html|51|ndxe200810| Spotted: a triangular shaped object hovering slight above treeline level at the border of Apex and Cary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were on our way to school when we approached a stoplight. I noticed two bright lights on what appeared to be a very large, low-flying plane that, based upon the light positions, seemed to be making such a turn that its wings were vertical. In specific terms, I would estimate that the object was no higher than two hundred yards above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, as we turned right from the stoplight, and I was able to get a better view of the object, I noticed that it had not been turning, and that the effect of vertical wings had actually derived from the positioning of two of the lights with one closer to me than the other. As I looked attempted to observe the object better, which was difficult considering how dark it was, I noticed a third light, completing a triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I exclaimed to my friend, who was driving the car, about the object. He took a very quick glance, and assumed that it may have been a bomber plane. As unlikely as that would have been, what completely ruled out that possibility was that fact that the object had not moved throughout the two minutes that I had seen it at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we continue to drive, while I am watching the object, waiting for it to move and at the very least do away with certainty that it was a non-human object (I knew as a fact it was not a helicopter). However, as we approached yet another stoplight between a mile-and-a-half and two miles from the first stoplight, my friend decided that he would have a look at the object himself. He took a quick glance back, and said something to me, at which moment I took my sight away from the object to respond to him. We had a very brief transaction of words, and upon looking back at where the object was we found it no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area that the object was over was that of a neighborhood, which was bordered on one side by a construction zone. At first I thought that maybe the lights were from a crane or construction lights from the frame of a multiple-story building that was being worked upon during the early hours. However, returning home that evening I noticed that not only were there no cranes, but the building that was being built only had about five floors. Large cranes for such a small building would be unnecessary, and the building itself was not tall. At least, not tall enough to match the height of the object I saw in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

This object appeared to be a planet like light in the sky, which moved, over a period of about 4 minutes to the South-West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object moved from North-East to South-West, the lights became more defined and appeared to be the landing lights of a commercial airliner.  However, the object had no flashing beacons.  It appeared as though the object was several hundred feet in the air, as it passed quietly overhead.  In it’s passing it’s white light appeared to change color to an orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After passing directly overhead, the observer noticed a conventional airliner approaching  the object, on a near intercept course, but obviously at a much higher altitude.  Neither object appeared to take make any noticeable course changes, or take any notice of the other.  The object continued to the South-West until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observer, of the above mentioned object, is employed as a Staff Engineer, working in the Communication Technology field, with over 20 years Information Technology experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were also light &#34;bars&#34;, vivid yellow in color running between the amber lights at the corners. It was as large as a pack of cigarettes held at arms length and flew quickly over my house in a southerly direction. There was no sound. It was bigger and brighter than anything else in the sky. It would have covered a full moon. The structure was slightly visible and gave me the impression of a triangular raft. The points of the triangle were rounded. I was hanging out of the window as it passed so I got a good look but it was traveling quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light rose out of the field and two more lights became visible in the shape of a triangle. There were some smaller red flashing lights right close to the first light. There was also a beam of light projecting across the sky in the direction the object was flying. It proceeded to fly over our house heading south. As it went over, we heard a low rumbling sound.

The sky is and was completely dark. If I had to take a guess, I would say that the object was the size of a small car. It was traveling at a very fast speed. It was fast and close enough that I was expecting to see some sort of explosion or hear some sort of explosion come from the woods, but nothing. Almost immediately I drove my car through a path in the woods, but I saw nothing. I got a bit creeped out so I didn&#39;t give a big investigation! Haha. The bad thing is that I am the only one that saw this object (as far as I know) and it is just another sighting that doesnt provide much hard evidence! - I plan to go out tomorrow morning to see if any evidence can be found.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At approximately 8:00 PM, I took the Jermyn/Mayfield exit, and I was driving up the ramp to head into town.  As I was driving up, I saw an orange light in the sky, surrounded by two aircraft, possibly helicopters, but I was not sure.  I decided to keep driving until I got to my house, which took roughly five minutes.  I parked my car, got out, and went to a clearing to get a better view of where I saw the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I thought there may have been some sort of accident, as the two aircraft were still circling the sky, but the orange light was gone. I kept staring, trying to figure out what was going on. After about 30 seconds of looking, the orange light reappeared between the two aircraft. It streaked across the sky, leaving a trail, and disappeared. This event happened in less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Under normal circumstances, if I had not seen the orange light earlier, and the light didn’t streak through the sky between the aircraft, I would have imagined it was a shooting star, but with the events adding up, I believe it to be a UFO.<n>

Six trangle shaped crafts with no noise, bright white lights, a few red lights, flying and hovering over NE Ark.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66616.html|62|ndxe200810| Six trangle shaped crafts with no noise, bright white lights, a few red lights, flying and hovering over NE Ark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> November 1, 2008<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 29th around 8pm, my 17 year-old daughter and her 15 year-old friend was driving on highway 63 near Walnut Ridge, Arkansas, when they saw five UFOs.  The first one came up out of a field and hovered above their car.  (There were other cars on this dark highway, but no one seemed to notice or stop.)  They assumed it was an airplane, but it made no noise, had rows upon rows of white lights and a few red lights, and was &#34;huge.&#34;  It was much larger than three passenger planes put together.  It was shaped like a triangle only it was rounded at the back.  The sides and front were curled inward. The bottom had a pinwheel of white lights with a red light in the center.  The UFO flew about ten feet above the car for a short distance.  The UFO flew away at an uncreditable speed.  Two miles up ahead were two more UFOs which flew towards them and then away.  Then one more came toward them and it also flew swiftly away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter called her boyfriend on her cell phone after the first encounter.  He was less than ten miles away.  He and his friend were lounging on the back of his friend’s pick up truck, listening to CDs and looking up at the sky.  While he was listening to her on the phone and not understanding all that she was reporting, what they thought was a star came towards them.  &#34;It got bigger and closer and was so fast that it was almost instantaneous with no noise in the engines.  It had rows of white lights, and some red lights.  It looked like it was made up of shiny chrome steel with a slight blue tint.&#34;  It flew over them and then instantly disappeared.  He said it was about half the size of a football field, triangular in front and round in back, slightly curled sides and curled tip and resembled a sting ray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I interviewed all four of these teenagers and they each told the same description except for the estimated size of the aircrafts.  My daughter drew a picture of the underside of the UFO and they all agreed that it was what they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the girls had reached the well lit parking lot at Wal Mart, an odd looking man, about 30 years old, wearing a green pullover top and blue jeans, approached their car.  They locked the car and rolled up the windows.  The man seemed to scan the car from the front, sides, top and back and even looked through the back window of the SUV.  He had a bulging forehead (a very large bulging forehead).  After a full scan of the car, the man suddenly disappeared from behind the car. Inside Wal Mart, they encountered a family of four blonde people.  The children looked to be 15 years-old and the younger one about ten years-old. All had the same exact shade of blonde hair. The girls were at the trash bag isle when the family approached. The family was asking questions about the trash bags. The mother spoke without an accent.  The youngest boy had a distinct British accent, and the father and eldest son had deep southern accents.  The girls felt like they were cornered by this family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they got back home, their computer wouldn’t work.  It kept saying “Resend” when there was nothing they were sending.  After a while, it began to work again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four agreed that they felt light- headed after seeing these UFOs and very groggy in the morning as though they had been drinking the night before.  The girls said that after the sightings, they seemed to have less and less memory of it even though they had talked about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides little contact information.

This is what I can tell you:<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 7:50 PM, my friend and I went outside to smoke a cigarette. We were looking at an unusually bright star, concluding that it was probably a planet. We were discussing what planet it might be when I looked above it and saw a flashing light. I thought it must have been an airplane, but when I looked a bit higher, I saw two more. What was very strange is that none of the blinking lights were moving. They were very far away, so I couldn’t tell for sure if they were just moving very slowly. Then, the highest one started to rise upwards, and we realize that it was coming towards us. We watched, and the weirdest part is that it was completely silent. There is a small-craft airport in town, and we are used to hearing planes. This object made no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It kept moving towards us until it was finally above us and then past us. We looked up and noticed that it was shaped like a triangle with a light blinking on each end, one light red. I thought they might be government planes since Palin was in Bowling Green today. But they were so close together that it just seemed off. The one traveling above us kept going, silently. We looked back to the other two- one was gone, the other (the lowest one, the first I saw) was still in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept watching the moving one and then the third reappeared (or a fourth appeared, I can’t be sure) coming from a completely new direction. They were less than an inch away (from where I stood, it looked this way), slowed down a bit, and then kept traveling on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for 4-5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside to turn on the news and fire up my computer, but of course nothing was mentioned. I have never looked up anything online about UFOs before, and this was the first site I came across.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back outside about 3 minutes after I stopped watching- the first object that I saw was gone, the one that moved over us was very far into the distance, and the third was also gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am correcting the date on my previously submitted form- I wrote that it was the 30th when it is, in fact, the 29th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

Harbor/San Pedro area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my return trip home from a night-school class, and was most certainly sober and of sound mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was, “it’s a shooting star”…I’ve seen many of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But this was only about 200-300 hundred feet above the ground…certainly less than 1,000 feet…and it went parallel to the ground; not downward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second thought was, “it’s a meteor”, due to its incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to have traveled a distance of several miles in less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> here was a very light, low, pre-frog haze at that time, which made the light look fuzzy; and again, due to its speed, left a tremendously long light tail.  No discernable shape other than a lightbulb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It all took less than one second, to my best estimation; too fast to have been the light of any normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not suspect that it was any sort of “craft”; but it was something very out of the ordinary, and I would like to know what it was; or what caused it; or if anyone else may have seen &amp; reported it.<n>

It startled me because it was in a &#34;high&#34; window (we have vaulted ceilings) and therfore was not a car or motor vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood up to go and see what was outside in the sky and as I walked towards the window and looking up through it to see outside I witnessed a bright object that would estimate to be between 2-3 miles to the east of my home at approximately 5,000-7,500ft &#34;rocket&#34; at incredible speed in a due South trajectory.   I listend very carefully to hear a potential sonic boom as the object was traveling well above mach 1...  If I had to guess, then I would say that it was traveling at least mach5 - mach7 as it easly covered a mile or more in 1 second.  There was no sonic boom.  There was no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not a meteor as it was not &#34;falling&#34; or losing altitude.  The object seemed to have a yellow/orange/white glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting was very close to Selfridge ANG and I am accustomed to the flight charactertistics of the F-16s and tanker/transports based there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also have private pilot flight experience and I am a physicist.<n>

Soledad in La Jolla, California.  It traveled in a straight line at a constant rate of speed.  There were no jerky movements. There was no sound.  The altitude was hard to judge but if it were at 3000 feet I estimate the “wingspan” to be equal to 7 Boeing 737s parked tip to tip.  As it crossed the sky it appeared to “warp” space sort of like heat waves disturbing light waves.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I saw it, I first thought it might be a plane, but some strange green and red lights were flashing on it.  But I don’t know how my brain got frozen, it was a strange thing which was moving slowly at first and then suddenly disappeared in a nano second I think.  It was moving towards west, towards Saudi Arabia, because it is located on west of Bahrain, from the sight I was viewing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it disappeared from the scene I suddenly realize oh God I witnessed a UFO. I am not saying that exactly it is a UFO, but it might be. Unfortunately I was not having any camera at that time so I couldn’t capture any picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The place I witnessed this strange object was deadly silent area where no one reside. It is between two hill towns.  Called East Riffa and West Riffa in Kingdom of Bahrain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing on top of a hill in West Riffa and I noticed this object on sky.  I don’t know if anyone else witnessed it.  But it was not too late at night, so I guess there might be someone else as well who might witness it.  It is a busy town, of Kingdom and around 6:30 pm  (This is not exact time when i saw the object, it might be few minutes different, but when everything ends i noticed it was 6:30 pm) during evening it becomes busier on roads.  I know, there were none around where I was standing, but it was too high in the sky, so it might be seen from far too, as Bahrain is a small country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will also try to draw a picture of the object, which is still in my mind. I will never forget that moment. One more bad luck of mine was I was carrying Sony Erickson Z800, the camera of this phone is not that good, that I can capture the object photo clearly, and as I said I was out of my mind for few seconds when I saw the object. So I didn’t even realize that I am having something to capture this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am shocked and a bit scared to see such a strange thing flying over our heads and no one can notice it. I know this is hard to believe without any evidence, but I feel my brain was frozen at that time and then start functioning after it disappears. I just need to ask a question here, is it possible that UFO can freeze human brain? If YES, then I think that happened to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It might not be a brain frozen, because if that was the case then how can I remember the movement and picture. But I was not moving I was stand still like a poll. I am not sure what happened to me but only I can see at that point was a really weird object flying over my head and moving towards west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will draw a picture and will send to NUFORC as soon as possible.<n>

This was around 11:53 PM and I was 12 and I was helping putting stuff in our U-Haul in our driveway and I felt this weird sensation to look up and I saw this ufo disk/ saucer and it was 7-10 feet above my driveway and it made no sound just hovered.  The UFO had 3 lights on red, white, and blue. The object was black and had a black tinted window.  It was really weird looking underneath. I&#39;m starting to think there were line patterns underneath that almost resembeled circuit boards. The light  frame was  a bit bigger than a watermelon, but were ovaled shaped.  It was all black underneath, but it&#39;s hard to rember if there were other lights on which I think there were. This took place on Chase Oaks street. I think the line patterns were going from straight lines to curved lines and were connected to little bright lightbulbs. I&#39;m uncertain how long it was there for at least a few minutes and I don&#39;t know if I was abducted or not! , but I think if I was I wouldn&#39;t have remembered so much detail from this encounter. I remember running inside to tell my dad and I went back out their by myself and a minute later it was gone. I didn&#39;t see it take off. It was in Chase Oaks off of Baird RD. I&#39;m not sure if there was missing time are not, but I remember going back inside around 12:40 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At Ohio Wesleyan University the campus is split in half, almost, by part of Sandusky St. As I was waiting to cross the road, I looked up above Slocum Hall and saw a little red light. I got really excited at first, because I thought that I may be looking at a planet. Yet, all of the sudden it was gone. I thought that my eyes might be playing tricks on me since it was so early in the morning, so I rubbed and blinked my eyes and then tried to find it. But, it was gone. About 30 seconds later it showed up again in the same place I first saw it in. However this time it got really bright, faded until it was almost gone, and then got really bright again and disappeared again. Almost instantly, it appeared again but this time about 50 to 100 or 200 feet to the left, now over University Hall/Gray Chapel, and then it disappeared for good, almost as fast as it had reappeared. I was wondering if anyone had anything to say about this mysterious sighting. Note that there was no noise which accompanied this sighting. Also, the light was small, redish white to red in color, orb shaped, and moved at a high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

10/29/08 01:00|Diamond|OH|Sphere|3 hours|A color changing point of light in the sky turns out to be a whole lot more.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67036.html|74|ndxe200810| A color changing point of light in the sky turns out to be a whole lot more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of October 28th, 2008, I arrived home from work around midnight.  I got out of my car and stood in the driveway as I took the last drags of a cigarette, gazing into the clear night sky as I often do.  Looking in a southern direction, I noticed a point of light that seemed to be changing colors.  The light would change from blue to green to red to yellow with no apparent pattern or timing to the change of color.  As the color changes occurred, the point of light seemed to retain a brilliant white color throughout, seemingly intermeshed with the colors mentioned above.  The color of the light struck me as quite peculiar, and I thought to myself jokingly, “what if it’s a UFO”, but because the light was stationary, and because I was skeptical of extra terrestrials, I finished my smoke and dismissed the light as a strange star or planet and headed inside for bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following night (10/29/08) I arrived home at the same time and again looked for my strange light to the southern sky.  The light was there but seemed closer than the night before.  It loomed over my neighbor’s property along the wood-line, behind his cow pasture, approximately 300 yards from where I stood in my driveway.  Separating the light and myself was (in order from me to the light) my front yard, the road, and the neighbors cow pasture that ends into the wood-line where the light occupied a space above.  The night was relatively clear with the exception of a very small group of clouds that hung just above the strange light.  Once again I brushed off the lights appearance and headed inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later I went back out to my driveway to have a smoke around 1 a.m.  I again looked at the light but this time its position had noticeably changed.  I was quite confused by the apparent change of the light’s position, but became dumbfounded when I watched it move with my own eyes.  The light shot towards me with incredible speed, but maintained its previous altitude.  I was shocked by the light’s ability to accelerate and stop so rapidly.  The light was much closer now.  It hung motionless in the sky above the road separating the neighbor’s property and my own, but not for long.  As I watched, the light began to move in a circular motion in the sky followed by a square pattern.  The light traveled the outline of an imaginary square in the sky, accelerating with great speed and stopping on a dime at each corner only to repeat the process until the square outline was complete.  About that time I had seen enough to become thoroughly frightened. My heart raced as did my mind.  I discarded the half smoked cigarette and ran inside making sure to lock the door behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the light from my bedroom window, noting its movement by looking at its relation to near by stars.  It glided across the sky moving closer and then farther away and the closer, in no particular pattern and at slower speeds than before.  I watched the light from my bedroom for approximately half an hour until I gathered enough courage to go outside for closer inspection with a pair of binoculars.  Upon looking at the light I realized that it was not a single light but many.  I can only describe it as a gyroscope.  It was a series of three rings, arranged inside each other with the largest on the outside.  Each ring had a series of lights around it, and each ring seemed to have its own distinct color; blue, red, and yellow.  The rings were moving inside each other on multiple axes in no discernable pattern.  I watch this self described gyroscope through the binoculars for about ten minutes until fear got the best of me.  Back inside the house I watched the strange light.  Around 2 a.m. two other lights approached the U.F.O. but passed it taking no notice.  Judging by their speed and flight path, these two additional lights were jets of human making.  I watched the U.F.O. until approximately 3:30 a.m., at which time I closed the blinds, took some night-time sleep aid medicine, and fell asleep fully convinced that the strange light outside my window was a U.F.O.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My opinion is changed.  I am no longer a skeptic, but a full believer.  My encounter with the U.F.O., in my small farming community of Palmyra, cannot fully be explained by words alone.  I only wish I had a video camera to capture the spectacle (cell phone cameras don’t work very well).  The feelings I felt that night are unexplainable.  In my twenty odd years of existence I can’t remember another time in which I felt such fear; fear of the unknown and the feeling of being watched, closely watched, by someone or something I can’t explain.  The most interesting sight in the whole experience was the gyroscope-like mechanism that composed the whole point of light.  My best guess is that the gyroscope-like mechanism was an advanced propulsion system, but that’s just a guess.  Overall, my encounter with that strange light was an eye opening and frightening experience that has forever changed my opinion of life and the universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter were quite prominent in the southern sky, at this time.

It favored a blimp but I have never saw a blimp with a flat bottom and it was very high in the sky and flying very fast.  Too fast to be a blimp.  It was in the eastern part of the notthern sky when I first saw it and only took about 45 seconds to a minute for it to get in the western sky then turn north and in a few seconds it was out of sight.  I ran inside the doctors office and ask a lady to come out to see this thing before it dissapeared so I would not be the only one to see it.  She said it couldn&#39;t be a jet because it had no vapor trail but was flying even faster than any jet I have ever seen.  It was silver, almost white on color.  One could tell it was a matalic objeck.  Also there was no sound comming from this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what I saw. I believe it to be a UFO because I am 59 years old, employed, and retired, from a army depot.<n>

The positions would change of each individual light, as well as a together as a whole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved very slowly and not in a straight line.

It was after 11 pm CST but not yet 11:30. My dog was lingering in a parking lot so I looked up as I often do to observe the stars. I saw what I thought was a plane taking off from Love field, north of Dallas, without its bright landing lights on. I thought that was strange because I expected the dimmer lights to be red and green for port and starboard. The lights were square, orange and made a perfect triangle. The craft never made any noise at all! It moved in a straight line over downtown Dallas at an almost due south direction; slightly east. I watched for 20 minutes for other crafts or for it to return and saw nothing. It was relatively larger than the little dipper which was also visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At sometimes it seemed to be just a bright dot in the sky; I know that what I saw wasn’t an airplane or an aircraft.

Then it disappeared in plain sight as if it had gone into some sort of teleport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Because of the October 21st sighting, we have been very alert and scan the skies nightly. On the evening of Tuesday, October 28th 2008 I went out on our back porch to give a treat to our dogs. I looked up in the South West sky and observed a large glowing orange/red object. It was not as bright as the stars and much bigger to the naked eye. It had no blinking lights like an aircraft so I called out to my boyfriend to come outside and take a look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He came out, took one look and said to record exactly what time it was (8:20 PM), he then went inside and retrieved a rifle with a high powered scope and we began to watch this thing through the scope. We live on a ranch so we have open views and dark sky. This object &#34;floated&#34; or hovered for 13 minutes before descending or headed away so that we could not see it, although with our naked eyes it looked like it descended somewhere in the Jewett Mine area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching it through the scope, we saw that it was emitting a faint white or bluish glow at varying times. It was very strange. We are now convinced that something is going on over the Central skies of Texas. Please, please investigate and do not let this be explained away by military testing etc...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this sighting to MUFON and was contacted by an investigator.

When I turned my head it was in the middle section of my window and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pattern of which it dropped looked like a meteor, but I know meteors don&#39;t glow green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped up to look out the window and didn&#39;t see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the light was about the size of the street light on the street behind our house, probably about 4-5 inches in diameter (with the glow), in an oval shape.  We have one of those honeycomb see-through shades which was down so I have no idea how far away it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t be certain of course if it was a UFO, but I have never seen anything else like it.  The length of time from it dropping from the top corner of my window until it disappeared behind the neighbors house was probably 3-4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time it occurred was between 7:45-8:00PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this to see if anyone else saw anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  I believe that some meteors are green, if they contain copper.

Right when she stopped the object i saw in the sky elevated directly upward in the sky 50-100 feet which made it not visable to me anymore due to the amount of clouds in the area it was in however the glow was still huge and there... there was no laser beam type stuff hitting the ground or anything though it was just a glow surrounding the entire object but it was really bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, after she started driving back to my home (about 5 seconds later) it lowered it self back down to its original section i saw it in (50-100 feet back down) and the glow was really bright, i can see it clearly and i can see the clouds details so good because of its glow it had. Once it went back down 50-100 feet it vanished as if it was never there, i dont know... i might have blinked??????????!??!  Either way i beleive in UFO&#39;s and i have watched a lot of documentaries. I beleive 2% of the sightings i have read about or seen in documentaries and i beleive 1% of UFO sighting video tapes or stories however i DO beleive they exist due to science, nature, common sense... ANYWAYS i am mentioning my beleifs and disbeliefs for you guys to know this is REAL!<n>

While that object &#34;burned&#34; the first object reappeared to the left of the 2nd object and then the 2nd object flashed out, followed by the 1st object and then the 2nd object reappeared and flashed out and then nothing.  My room mate saw the last flash, because he couldn’t see what I was looking at, until he stood up.  Because this all happen right above the horizon of tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression was a plane was on fire and then when the 2nd object appeared and looked to be on fire.  My impression was a dogfight of some sorts.  I am not sure what it was. It was interesting to say the least.  I cannot tell if it was over Waco or not, It may have been passed Waco.  I cannot say how far away it was, but all I can say is it was as big if not bigger than an American Eagle jet.<n>

October 28th and 29th 2008.  Me and my friend ((name deleted)) set out to the ranch in Sidney to do some bow hunting.  After the hunt Tuesday evening we met up at my stand and were talking when these three bright light&#39;s came out and were hovering over a large oat field!  Then they went out and a single light began moving very quickly across the sky turning on and off.  There were several commercial airliner&#39;s in the area and these light&#39;s were 5 times faster.  Then we took a couple steps back to see over the trees as the 3 light&#39;s had come back out and were hovering over a different area a little more to the north east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got in the truck and rushed back to the ranch house and called the police to see what was going on and they had no clue.  I just got home from hunting only to find out that there were dozens of sightings, new&#39;s coverage, and even a few video&#39;s from Dublin, Stephenville area and other part&#39;s of Erath and, Comanche counties.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live next to Carswell Air force Base in fort worth so I see planes and jet&#39;s everyday! I can say this was nothing man made and I have never seen anything like this in my 25 year&#39;s of life!<n>

Facing the East North East around 19:35 we all saw three lights suddenly appear.  I instantly saw them because I was turn toward the North East sitting on the West side of the stadium talking to my mom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared and did not move and stayed stationary for about 10-15 seconds.  I laughed and asked my mom, wife, sister and brother law if they see those lights.  They said yes and my mom asked what is that.  The only thing I could imagine it to be would be a single engine jet in a formation with two more jets going directly away from us for a few seconds and we must be seeing the firey glow of their engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all laughed when it went away and then another three lights appear 10-15 seconds later farther to the south a little lower in altitude and they stayed stationary for about 10 to 15 seconds.  At that time I grabbed my phone and opened the camera.  The third set of lights appear 10 seconds after the second set and I could see them in my phone with it being dark and with the stadium lights on in front of me.  You could still see in the sky the three lights in my phone pretty clearly. I noticed they were dimming away and I took a picture at 19:43.  (It&#39;s on my phone and I&#39;m not sure how to get it off).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next few seconds there was a single light to the north and lower from the first three lights we saw. Then there was a single lights to the south of the first lights we saw.  Those only appeared for maybe 3-5 seconds.  And had the exact same color and brightness the first three lights had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With in 30 seconds after seeing the last light my mom noticed a plane flying toward the area we saw the lights.  It was coming from the west north west at approximately the same altitude.  It was noticeably how the lights on the plane stayed lit and had one blinking light and that those lights were not the same intensity or color of the three lights earlier and where not near as bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to leave a voice mail early today but was interrupted by my boss so I thought I would send you this. Thanks<n>

I was at milepost 204, near the town of Medanales, when a large chartreuse green fireball appeared to my right, to the east of me, about halfway up the night sky.  This fireball was trailing a trail of orange sparks.  If I were to use my thumb and hold it about 4 inches from my face, and squint with one eye, the fireball was the size of my thumb, and the orange trail of sparks was twice the length of my thumb.  This fireball suddenly appeared.  I was driving 60 miles per hour, and it was zooming on by, traveling horizontally in the same direction as I was, proceeding northwest at what appeared to be 100 miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as soon as I said, &#34;Good God!  What in the heck is that thing?&#34;  The fireball suddenly vanished as soon as it appeared.  The entire event was over within two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a two-colored meteor, and this thing was whizzing along horizontally, going parallel to the horizon, which is odd behavior for a meteor, in my opinion.  As I say, this thing appeared to be halfway up in the night sky, suddenly appeared, and suddenly disappeared.  It did not  disappear by burning out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very strange!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, just a few minutes after the event, and we found her to be an exceptionally good witness, given her ability to report the facts surrounding the event in a mature, objective, and factual manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because the object appeared to the witness to be &#34;shedding&#34; sparks, we assume that the object was a typical, bright meteor.  However, we are uncertain what the object was, given the other sightings that were reported from across the U. S. on the same night.  PD))<n>

I thought it was a strange constellation and they weren&#39;t blinking and suddenly I realized that they were moving directly away from me flying to the southeast. After about five seconds, they faded away from my view. Conditions were about half an hour or so after sunset, and mostly clear with just a bit of haze. The two lights appeared to be moving away in tandem with what I can only describe as a &#34;gliding&#34; motion, not fast, but not really slow, either. The courtyard is lit with orange vapor lanterns. I would describe the brigtness of the object or objects as being of medium intensity, and they were unblinking. My friend was facing toward me, so he didn&#39;t observe them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A small plane flew into the immediate area of the sky about a minute or so later, and looked quite different from what I previously saw. I would estimate that the objects were at about a 45 degree angle in the sky from my position and fairly high as I observed them over a two story apartment building. I could not hear any sound from either the objects or from the small plane, as there was traffic noise coming in from the busy street that we reside on.<n>

I drove home from work at 1800 hours along 1-70 interstate highway from Topeka, Kansas to Manhattan, Kansas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1850 hours I saw six bright yellow lights in the sky in a backwards &#34;L&#34; formation.

My husband said it could be helicopters (he was not with me).  I’ve been around Army sikorsky UH-60 helicopters and numerous types of aircraft in my 13 years of military experience and never saw such perfect still lights in the sky that simply faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else saw this on the night of 28 October 2008, I-70 Interstate Highway near Manhattan Kansas, please input your entry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you all for reading this entry.<n>
10/28/08 17:55|Iowa City|IA|Unknown|1.5 - 2.5 minutes|Late-Afternoon Object Not Depositing a Vapor Trail Unlike Several In-Vicinity Airliner Jets|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66535.html|96|ndxe200810| Late-Afternoon Object Not Depositing a Vapor Trail Unlike Several In-Vicinity Airliner Jets<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday, October 28th, while walking my bike in a large meadow immediately north of I-80 I sighted a single object at about 1755 hours which was traveling westward in a sky with perhaps 35% to 50% broken high-cloud cover.  The air temperature at ground level was between 40 to 49 degrees Fahrenheit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was observed for approximately ninety seconds to two minutes thirty seconds. I was about twenty yards east of a fairly-high treeline, but was looking through a gap in the canopy (for at least the final part of the sighting).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object demonstrated the following characteristics:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1) The size of the object appeared similar to that of airliners at high altitude (30,000 ft approx.).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) The shape of the object seemed to differ from that of airliners however (it seemed lumpish, as a large grain of sand).  This characteristic is what first caught my eye. High-quality IS binoculars were needed to clarify and I didn’t have any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) The color of the object was at first darkish, then further along it became highly reflective (due to solar reflection).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4) The altitude of the object was perhaps 25,000 ft to 35,000 ft as during part(s) of the sighting it seemed to be passing through high thinish cirrus-type clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5)  The speed of the object appeared to be similar to airliners at altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6)  The object maintained a straight course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7)  A striking and much more clearly distinctive (vs. the indistinctive shape) characteristic was the lack of any vapor trail whatsoever. Several airliners in the vicinity [traveling in various directions] were all emitting heavy vapor trails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally the object seemed to pass into a thin and narrow cirrus-type cloud and I didn’t see it emerge (It may/must have but I was mildly frustrated by not seeing that).  It was about this time if I remember aright that I noticed two eastbound airliners (one trailing the other by possibly several minutes) approaching the vicinity to the south of the object. I waited a minute or two then continued on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps the lack of vapor was attributable to a propeller-driven aircraft and/or the altitude being rather lower than estimated(??).<n> <n><n> <n><n> To give an inkling of the general location of the object in the sky I sighted it not directly overhead, but angled down 10 to 15 degrees to the south from the zenith, then up 60 to 80 degrees above the western horizon when initially spotted, then 30 degrees or so above the western horizon when visual contact was lost.  Admittedly I’m best-guessing here in retrospect with respect to these aerial measurements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In conclusion the incident was mildly strange.<n>

It looked circular and not very tall, more roundish and it wasn’t a small craft either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reflection  was very, very bright, there was a hazy attribute around it because the sky was 100% clear with no clouds but only 1/2 of the craft could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was closer than what a plane would be flying over a city and it was very visible.  I didn’t see any markings or lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was NOT moving, it was completely stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned left onto Taft Street and was able to view it again.

It happened again right around the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were trees close to blocking my view, so I moved past the trees so I could see clear skies.  Lower in the horizon, I saw it again, only in a different spot.  3 orange lights, 1, 2, 3, taking turns to flash one time before going completely dark.  They were orange circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this happen 5 times total before I saw an aircraft that was surely an airplane of some sort flying through that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I stood around looking for about 20 more minutes, saw a few more planes and that&#39;s all, nothing out of the ordinary!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know for sure that the orange lights I saw was NOT airplanes.<n>

I was driving west towards downtown Azle on Highway 199 A.K.A Jacksboro Highway. I was looking to the left out of my driver-side window. About 2 Miles away, there was a giant gold glowing object. I could tell it wasn&#39;t a oil rig, nor gas rig. The object never moved. It wasn&#39;t on the ground or supported by any other object. The object was all one piece. At the top it appeared to be an elaborate antenna of some kind. Below the antenna, was a saucer/square shape. Below the saucer/square portion of the object was about 3 to 5 more antenna-like objects. I estimated the object to be anywhere from 250 feet to 300 foot tall. Let I remind you that it was one whole piece. I didn&#39;t stop to get a closer look, nor had a camera of any kind. I drive on that part of the highway at least once everyday, and at least once every night. My car radio&#39;s frequency was fuzzy at the time. I looked at my cell phone at that time as well, and had no service. In the same area, their are 2 cell phone service Antenna&#39;s about 3 to 5 miles apart from each other. When I made my way back to that area, I looked in the same location the object was in, and it was gone. This was about a 10 minutes after seeing the object, and returning from downtown Azle. This is the best description I can give you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We both asked if the other had seen what we thought we&#39;d seen, agreed, and headed home.  The craft itself was in the shape of a disk, it had eight lights on the bottom part of it.  The crafts upper part was a gray color, and the bottom part with the lights appeared to be black.  (It was late at night so it might be another color, but I was unable to see what it was).  The experience wasn&#39;t very long, the craft moved to the right from it&#39;s original position, made a small circle, moved left, then seemed to disappear.<n>

The sky was dark when suddenly I noticed what looked to me like a single bright round white light in the sky moving at a very high rate of speed, faster than anything I have ever seen, in a North West direction.  It was difficult to tell the altitude because it happened so quickly, but because I was able to tell it was a high rate of speed, I had the sense that it was between one thousand and two thousand feet.  My first thought was that it was the afterburner of a jet aircraft but I could not see any trail and the light was traveling parallel to the ground, not moving either up or down. Also seemed strange to see something like this in an area of relatively high commercial aircraft traffic to both OIA and Orlando Executive Airport. My location at the time was approximately eighteen miles NE of OIA, and approximately nine miles due East of OEA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((initials deleted))  Orlando, FL<n>

I slowed as much as possible to get a better view.  If I had to do it over I would have pulled over and gotten out to at least take a photo with the camera in my phone.  I observed them for as long as possible through my side mirror.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then turned to the east off of Hwy 35.  I drove the one mile to our subdivision.  As I turned into the subdivision, I saw at the end of the street another of the large circular objects low in the sky, just above the tree line.  I was frightened at first thinking that one of the three had followed me home because I had observed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I very slowly drove down the street keeping my eyes on the object in the sky.  As I came to the end of the street, I stopped and stared up at the object through my windshield.  After about 30 seconds, the object suddenly moved up over and behind the trees, as if to hide from my view.  I could see it through the trees and very slowly turned towards my street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I came to my street I had to turn my back to the trees where the object was positioned.  As I drove down the street I turned to look behind me and saw the object very quickly coming over the trees behind me.  I stepped on the gas to get as much distance as possible between the object an myself.  I arrived home and got my husband from inside the house to accompany me to the street to see the object.  He too saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that day I have been more aware of the movements in the sky and have seen many more things that would not have been a plane or helicopter.  But no others came as close as the one that appeared to have followed me home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another incident: Two years ago on my way into Alvin early in the morning, I had to stop behind a school bus picking up children.  As I was waiting, it appeared to be a shooting star or meteor coming out of the sky from the west to the east.  It suddenly stopped in the air and the debris that followed it fell past the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as possible, I passed the school bus and hurried to see what it was that I had observed.  I could still see the object in the sky ahead of me.  I suddenly found myself underneath the object.  I rolled down my window and stuck my head out to get a good view.  It was shaped like nothing I had ever seen.  It was sort of an hour-glassed shape with lights on either end and a light on the underneath.  I could hear a hum and the pitch would change as the object would light up on one end and move in that direction.  It changed directions several times.  Then it slowly began to move to the west away from the highway.  I drove to the Kroger parking lot and watched it until it was out of sight.<n>

I couldnot believe my eyes what just happened last week. it was around 8pm  night time when i was having tea in balcony. half of the sky was covered with black clouds and sound of thunder was easily heard but it was weird that rain didn&#39;t camedown.  As i love to watch thunder, i was watching sky than suddenly i saw 8 big bright lights came out of thunder. they were travelling in V shape and were travelling towards south. i couldnot believe what i just saw, and a very strange thing happened. just after about 3 minutes around hundred small lights appeared from the black clouds and were travelling towards south too. there speed was almost 3 times the speed of a commercial aeroplane as i used to watch aeroplanes frequently and i can guess their speed w.r.t these weird lights. that day onwards i am watching skies everyday but didn&#39;t see them again.<n>

From my view point it was about 30 degrees above the horizon.  It seemed to be coming from the west arching downward.  I would disregard it as a shooting star, but its was very bright and very large for a shooting star.  It was large enough to recognize that it seemed to have a triangular shape.  It was a blueish white color. The light from the object faded as it fell, until it simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During high school I was an amateur astronomer.

I could hear it was that big, because some strange sounds came from as it was on the &#34;floor&#34; and the sounds where like when spit is released in the mouth!! I have heard those electronic sounds once before, and it was on a radio program that clamed it was the way the stomach sound when it has got food and work with the food.!!  The sounds where extremely loud, but also extremely clear, with an amazing sound quality.. I can tell because I have been working with music and sound studios.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sounds came from everywhere and not the best surround system in the world could make a surround like that. And the stereo in the living room could NEVER have made such a sound. Beside it had grounding problems so I would have heard the humming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BUT: Somewhere higher up in this huge room we then heard a voice. (male I guess) It sounded very demanding, and it spoke very slowly. But who can tell how many bits it came from the sinking and rising voice pr. Second?! The voice were very deep, and I can not explain, BUT the voice could never come from a human being!!  If I would guess it was a large entity , more than 7 foot tall !!  I would have kept it for my self, if I had been alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have sayd that it was something in my brain, and nothing real. But two persons heard the same, and two persons can`t have the same hallucination!!  These ten seconds is for me my second  &#34;meeting&#34; with UFOs and ETs.  In my childhood my mother and father and five children saw five UFOs. It became headlines in local news, because other people had seen them as well, and UFO Norway took reports.  When they disappeared the speed was outstanding, and that’s an understatement! This was around the mid 60s.  I now know that they were hanging over a certain mountain, because they were scrutinizing the NATO northern flanks radar facility in North Cape. I have heard that they are very interested in radars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I have been married for a little over 10 years to my second husband and a little over 8 years to my first husband. I graduated high school in the top 10% of my class. Over my lifetime I have spent a lot, or more than average amount, of time looking at the stars at night because they have always fascinated me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I have observed I started noticing about two weeks ago but I cannot tell you when the events actually started. While going outside at night to smoke, I ovserved some bright lights in the sky. These lights were brighter than any I have ever seen. They were also closer to the ground than any I have ever seen. Upon seeing the first one, I scanned the sky and I noticed that there were more and they were all doing the same things. I guess what caught my attention more than anything was the pattern that they were moving in the sky and that they strobed a light which at first glance reminded me of a plane in the night sky. So, because some of them were so close to the ground and moving erraticly and flashing funny, I started watching them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then observed that these lights were not and could not be planes. They seemed to be moving back and forth and up and down and sometimes in a circle pattern and flashing a red, blue, white, and green lights. They were fast moving as well. Faster than anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a week of seeing them I mentioned the matter to my husband. Later that day I mentioned it to my 15 yr old son. That same night, I went outside about 1am to smoke and my son was still up. I can inside and got him. He came outside with me and I pointed the lights out to him and he sat outside for more than 2 hrs watching them with me. He observed the same things I noticed. I had him tell me the specifics about their movements before I told him what I was seeing in detail because I wanted to know that I was actually seeing what I was seeing. He also noticed the exact movements and flashes of light that I was and he also observed that they could not be planed due to the fact that they were moving too fast and not in patterns that a plane makes or even could make. I laughed at first because I thought I was dreaming or just was not seeing what I thought I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could draw a picture of the shape of the objects but typing or trying to put it into words just doesnt do them justice. They are beautiful and seem to change shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They are in different areas of the night sky and seem to be operating in pairs. For everyone I see I will see another one close by making the same erratic movements with the same flashes of light. And sometimes they just disappear and reappear in the same spot in which they vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That about sums it up. I could keep typing but I would just seem to be repeating myself, so I will stop. I would like to know what these strange lights are. They have me worried about what is going on and at the same time fascinated as to what may be going on. I know what I see and I know that it is different from anything I have ever seen before.<n>

I find astronomy very interesting and have been observing and studying the constellations in the night sky for about the past year. I even subscribe to an astronomy magazine so I am familiar with things in the night sky, but had never seen something like what I saw in the early morning of October 26.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with my husband and we had just parked out in the country to look at the constellations. We were facing east when I saw a red light, not blinking or leaving a tail, come up from the southern sky and head north. It looked like it was going in a straight line. I could not tell if it was in the sky where plains fly or in outer space. It basically looked like a red star but moved across the sky like a plane. It took about 30 seconds for it to go across the sky. There were actual planes flying around that night and this did not look like any plane I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this was not a meteor because it did not have a tail and stayed in the sky longer than a meteor would. It did not have any other lights on it and I couldn’t tell what it was, I just know it was a red light that flew across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Louis.  We were watching street races as I noticed this object just hovering there at the end of Hall St.  I told my buddy to look at it and he thought it was just a plane  because Lambert airport is near.  15 minutes later I told him to look again.  He said it was just a helicopter.  45 minutes later as we were leaving when the cops came, all cars scattered, that&#39;s when my buddy said that things still there. As we were driving down the road it started to move near where we were.  As it got closer it was about a football field high.  The craft appeared to be like a square/triangle and big, about the height of a one level house.  The length of about 50 yards.  It had three blinking red lights on the side, a blinking red light at the top, and a big spot light in the front. As this description sounds like an airplane, it wasn&#39;t. The craft was swaying back and forth as to where you can see the reflection of the metallic looking bottom look square.  I have a video of it. I had three people in my car that were going crazy.  The craft made no noise.  We left the pack of cars (which normally we wouldn&#39;t do), we jumped on the highway to follow the craft.  We were driving parallel with the craft.  You could see it clear as day.  It started  to veer off over highway 70 toward Illinois. We got off at the Bellfontaine exit and made a right.  The object was on the western side of us starting to travel quickly and we were following it for about 3 miles, then the object disappeared.  All four of us were freaking out cause this was no  aircraft that we have ever seen before.  The object had no propeller, no wings, made no noise, and had a square shape to it.  I have a video on my phone of this object. It&#39;s not the clearest video but you can see the square shape and the lights.  I have four witnesses that seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were flying about 1000 to 2000 feet above ground. i watched them until they vanished. all four were heading south. this was my first time seeing something like this. i now know we are not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft stayed from 2-5 minutes; It then lifted off and smoothly flew back up to clouds towards the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It was as though it were trying to hide in the stars above us. When it past over our heads, you could see through the center of it. You could put three large full moons easily inside it and still have room left over. It was Huge! There were three points to its shape. There was some kind of illumination on each of the points. There were no lights coming from it and it made no noise. It took about 8 sec from when first saw it to past over us. It was traveling very fast. It was very high in the atmosphere. It looked like it was up with the &#34;stars.&#34;<n>

It stayed still momentarily, but then rapidly moved in all directions. I went inside and got my parents, and my little brother came outside, too. We then noticed that there were 2 more objects, all 3 forming a triangle. My Mom and I have seen a large triangle fly over us before(did not know about this, it was about 3 months ago), so we thought it was that. But, the 3 objects were moving in turns, meaning they were &#34;taking turns&#34;, almost as if they were communicating. It was not our eyes, because my dad brought out a pair of binoculars and they were moving while stars behind them were not. The objects were moving very oddly, going west and instantly stopping and going east. Therefore, it was not a airplane or helicopter. No meteor has ever moved like that. And, if there was a human piloting it(top secret aircraft), they could not handle the g&#39;s of the weird movements. We also saw some blue and red beams shoot out of the main one(brightest one) and disappear within half a second (there were about 10 beams, 7 blue, 3 red)<n>

I traveled east on Roxanna New Burlington Road turned right or south on Pence Jones Road, I zipped around the first turn and caught this light off to my left. I slowed my car down, the light was quite a ways away but it was hurting my eyes so I brought my car to a stop. On the west side of Pence Jones Road is woods, and the left or east side is an open field of harvested soybeans. The light rapidly came closer to me and hovered over the field, it hurt my eyes so much I was holding up my hand to shield my eyes. It hovered maybe a 100 feet in front of me for maybe 2 minutes like it was looking at me, its light pulsated many times, my car shut off like the battery died. I could feel heat coming off the light. There was no sound, I started getting scared and it abruptly shot up into the sky and was gone. It very much scared me and I have not been able to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And some flashing red orb shaped lights in the background<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok, so the first sighting was a very large aircraft which headed towards me from the far distance which I at first thought was an unusually large star, but as it appraoched, I saw that it had lights, and then at the same time there appeared to be unusual background activity also going on in the sky. I saw flashing red orb like lights that seemed to almost come together and then moved quickly away from eachother, meanwhile, in between there appeared to be a falling star! Now, (and I know this sounds too outrageous), but while the large craft was meanwhile approaching overhead, and it seemed to be possibly a half a mile in width It had at the front of it a horizontal line of yellow lights, and at each end, two red lights. It flew overhead as I watched from my balcony, and was then out of view. I kept on trying to tell myself that it must have been an airplane, but I didn&#39;t know what the other orb lights were all about in the distance. And if that were not enough!!I then heard what sounded like another approaching plane or craft overhead, flying in the opposite direction heading towards the west valley, which was a huge, triangular shaped craft ( as I saw that it was indeed a solidly shaped triangular craft ) with maybe three lights. But as it was gliding over the valley away from me, it appeared to have onlt two white flashing lights, that then dimmed one the lights as the other light kept flashing on and off. I watched this craft until I could no longer see it gliding away in the distance. Now I have NEVER seen anything in the sky unusual except maybe a falling star only once in my lifetime. I have no idea what these were, but i reported the sighting to the ArizonaRepublic newsroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am pretty familiar with the night sky, and Jupiter was to be expected.   But I quickly notices a pair of “stars” to the left of Jupiter by about 15 or 20 degrees.  If this pair was two marks on a clock, I would say they were at 10:30 and about 4:30, separated by the width of my little finger at an arms length.  These two lights were bright, as it was not totally dark yet, but they were clear to be seen.  They were low to the horizon, maybe just lower than Jupiter’s relative height above the horizon.  Being a bright pair was unusual, and after staring at them for about a minute, I just felt like they were moving faster than…stars move due to earth’s rotation.  So I tried to mark their position to a tree branch, and I do believe they were moving away from me, to the SSE, getting closer to the horizon.  The one at 4:30 position faded out first, and then the one at 10:30 faded out.  Probably satelites, but the pair is unusual for me to see.  I have seen three satelites moving together in the past, in the mid to late 90’s.  So I know it happens, but like I said, I just wanted to post this little piece that I did observe, in case somebody saw more of it, for verification purposes.  I checked for ISS passes, and I couldn’t find one during this time frame.  There was a listing for Cosmos 1408, but…I think I saw this pair prior to when Cosmos would have passed over as a single object.  Oh well.  Still waiting to see the one light that stops and takes a left!  PD...just delete this post if nobody else saw anything interesting.  I just wanted to give witness to the &#34;pair&#34; of objects.  Possibly two satelites that faded out near the horizon due to atmosphere.  I just don&#39;t see pairs or multiple satelites that often.<n>

I didn&#39;t see anything but looked up at the sky and noticed how clear the sky was and how pretty the stars looked.  But I looked over and noticed a brighter star that twinkled a lot more than the others and almost looked like a bluish color.  It was at the top of a tree so at first it was partially hidden.  Then all of a sudden, it moved up in the sky, then over to the side.  It did not move in a straight line and did not stay in one spot.  I kept watching it and it looked as if it were swaying side to side.  It moved like someone had a star on the end of a string and was moving it up then sideways then back over then way up.  I noticed a bluish light twinkling around it.  I tried to get my camera out and use the lens to zoom in but I couldnt see it any better.  I have never seen anything like this before.  An aircraft went by and it had a red light blinking on it and the object did not move at that moment but looked like a star. Once the aircraft was gone, the object moved to the side quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I’ve always wanted to see a UFO and tonight I got the chance to see 4!! I’ve seen things in the past that were questionable. But in my mind I could never say for sure. Tonight I finally have no doubts!! The first sighting occurred around 1:30 am and it was one UFO (strobe like) flashing across the sky heading in a slight southwest direction (a lot more west than south). At first I thought it was a shooting star, but it never burned out as I watched it fly from east to west. As it was dawning on me what I was seeing, it then quickly changed directions and turned around and flew south east kind of like what a fish would look like in water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, I was stoked (still am)!! About 10 minutes after as I was about to head in, I saw three more headed in the same direction flying in formation. Right before they would have been out of sight I saw both side UFO’s split up left and right at the same time with the middle one flying straight. It was truly amazing!! I know what I saw was not birds or jets because they made no sound and flew way too fast (8 seconds across the sky). I don’t know star formations, but all four (both sightings) flew between the 3 straight up and down stars, and the cluster of stars (4 total I think) with one in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So yeah, I’m very stoked!!! Finally after 33 years of being on this earth, I got to see it with no doubts in my mind, no one can ever take that away from me!!! Thanks for putting this sight up!!<n>

Two formations - semicircular &amp; v-shaped. 1st moved from north to south. 2nd moved from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Starting at 11:53 as I lay on the porch of my four-story townhouse in downtown Dallas. I was looking up at the night sky and I saw a semicircular object moving from north to south. The shape looked like an incomplete circle of lights that was missing about 1 or 2 lights that would have completed the circle. The single lights that made up the incomplete circle were blue-white and circular, and there were probably about 7 of them. It was moving across the sky at about the same speed that a plane would but it was moving in very sudden, subtle movements and it wasn&#39;t exactly moving in a straight line. It also seemed like it would stop on a dime and then continue as it was. Also, when I looked at the formation it looked as if I were squinting my eyes and looking at a streetlight (it was blurry), but as I looked at the stars near the formation, I could see them clearly. They continued on their path for about 2-3 minutes until they disappeared on the other side of my roof. After that I saw another formation moving from west to east. This was probably at 12:30-12:45. It was in a V-shape and it wasn&#39;t as blurry as the first one. Again it was moving at about the same speed as an airplane. These could have been jets in a very precise formation heading somewhere but it was completely inaudible. This formation seemed to move in more of a straight line but again they had some sudden, subtle movements that lead me to believe that they were not airplanes. There were probably 7 circular white-orange lights with one in the front and even amount of lights on either side of the &#34;V&#34;. I am the only observer that I know of. I am 14 years old and I go to a private school in Dallas that requires greater than average intelligence. I wasn&#39;t fatigued at all as I saw these formations and I&#39;ve never had any mental hallucinations or anything before. I have experienced floaters (in eye doctor jargon) but I&#39;m sure that the objects I saw were not them. The wind was going from north to south, so they weren&#39;t flares if the! y went f rom east to west. To conclude, I have never really strongly believed in aliens or UFO&#39;s or anything of the sort, but this seems very extra terrestrial to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In a split second, I saw this HUGE flash of light shoot vertically down the sky, but it was so bright and big that I know it was not a comet or meteor. It was too much of a perfect circle. It happened so fast that I didn&#39;t get Tyler up in time to see it. I cant comprehend it, because I sit out all the time and look at shooting stars, and this was no shooting star. I have never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed it when I saw the shape come over the top of my windshield and it moved a brief distance ahead and disappeared instantly, perhaps not even 1 car length to 2 car lengths ahead of me.  It was just to the right of the interstate road lights that were in the median of the expressway. The height of the object was slightly above that of the interstate lamp poles and to the right slightly of the extending lamp unit itself.  It was odd as I was speaking to my passenger when this occurred and I said nothing and kept talking when my passenger said &#39;did you see that?&#39;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was convinced we saw an anomoly that was not explainable such as shooting star or aircraft.<n>

It had a very high altitude I would say about the same height as a commercial jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time seen the night sky was very clear with only stars in the backgroud no clouds at time seen. However there were two other aircraft in the area.  One had to be a airliner or jet I could hear that and it was far behind the red light moving at about half the speed of the red light.  The other aircraft I would say was a Cessna type craft, because of the engine I knew this and its altitude was lower than the other two.  Proably on approach to the small Marion airport (mainly for crop dusters).  The two knowns had the navi lights on so I knew they were known plus the noises they make to tell the difference.  I had seen falling stars around 21:00 looking straight up moving to the west and came back outside around 22:30 so I was keeping my eyes on the sky, I saw the brightest one I&#39;ve ever seen at that time falling to the east this time so I stayed outside to watch the show looking east when the red unknown caught my attention.  It could not of been a sattelite to low an orbit. Then what I hope was a Common Barn Owl schreeched at me several times and scared me back in the house.  I smoke cigarettes outside only and is the reason I go out side so often.<n>

I live on ((deleted)) ave. in Marion,Oh and was walking to my dads house the next street over on patterson st. I cut through the patterson street park and I felt a really deep bass coming from the sky. I looked up and noticed a triangular craft way up in the sky. At least 60,000 ft. It had green lights on each point and a whiteish blue flame coming out of the very center of the craft. The reason I knew it was&#39;nt one of ours is because it was way way up in the sky and a jet or plane would of looked alot smaller at that altitude. It was heading west but the way it looked it was going strait up. It flew up until I couldn&#39;t see it any more. The lights did&#39;nt blink they stayed lit. I found it very curious when I watched unsolved mysteries and some police officers in bulgaria or something seen triangular crafts floating really low to the ground and they had red lights at each point. They said they were huge in size as well. I know for a fact this is the same thing I seen. I haven&#39;t told anyone about this because they will think I&#39;m nuts. I just thought this should be noted. B.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

At College Avenue,  I saw 4 orange fiery lights in the sky.  The lights were headed north/north east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned north on College to follow the lights which were hard to track because of trees.  I turned east on 91st street and pulled into an apartment complex to get out of the car and watch them as I called a friend to come to meet me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was dark.  The UFO’s appeared as orange fireballs and moved in complete silence.  The four fireballs were headed north/northeast toward U.S. 31.  (We were about 80 miles south of Grissom A.F.B.).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the four U.FO.’s were out of sight, I looked back and saw four more come from the same direction.  They were not flying in formation, but all proceeded north/northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend caught up with me in time to see the last U.F.O. which is he said hovered and lowered and then took off fast enough to disappear before his eyes. I didn’t see the last U.F.O. because a tree was blocking my view.<n>

I thought it was peculiar that a helicopter was so close to the ground and to the freeway.  I thought it was a helicopter because it was hovering in one spot.  I rolled the window down to see if I could hear anything but there was nothing.  I thought the helicopter was low due to the size of the lights, but then a light cloud passed between me and the object and I lost sight for a second or two.  I then realized that the size of the lights and as high as it must have been to be above clouds on a rather breezy and clear night, it must have been huge.  By this time, I had just started to pass and could not keep an eye on it while driving.  About a mile further, I was nearing my exit which is next to Wheeler Army Airbase and noticed some helicopters (blackhawks) in the air and started to wonder if they were going to investigate.  Over the next few weeks, I would drive by and look to see if there were any towers, poles or any other structure that would be a cause or reason for something to be there but there is nothing.  I then Googled  the months of October and November 2008 along with UFO and noticed that another person had posted something around the same date and time that my experience occurred.  I don’t know the exact date but it was around the 20th or 26th of October and around the 9:00pm time frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am rather familiar with helicopters due to living on or near a military base my whole life and hearing them on a daily basis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was standing on my front porch talking to my husband on the phone. As I was talking to him I casually looked up at the stars since it is perfectly clear and calm tonight. I was looking at what looked like a group of stars almost directly above me when I noticed two stars at the bottom moving. Now I know the eyes play tricks so I looked away and looked back lining them up with the top of a tree to make sure they were moving. Sure enough two balls of light were moving perfectly with each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They slowly traveled to the East, too slow for shooting stars and to fast to be an airplane that far up. After about 45 seconds the one on the right got extremely bright, about 5 xs brighter and almost looked like it had a haze or fog around it. The one on the left started to get brighter a few seconds later but never got as bright as the right one. As I was telling my husband about it and getting a little uneasy, they went back to their original brightness. They kept traveling to the East for a few more seconds then stopped. They stayed in the same spot for a few more seconds, and slowly disappeared. I’m assuming they were traveling away at this time because they faded away so gradually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m no astronomer or anything fancy, just a 27 year old wife, mother, and manager at a large company. I have seen satellites and shooting stars and airplanes that look like a UFO but end up not being one. I’ve seen odd things in the past; I know what’s explainable and what is not. This defiantly was not explainable or usual by any means.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft were going south in the sky above the Sea of Cortez.  Some appeared to crash into the ocean.  Other appeared to skim the ocean then recover into the atmosphere.  Distance from viewing might have been 300 yards.  Some shapes when enchanced on the computer appeared to be in the shape of &#34;Z&#34; as you will note in the attached photos.  We did not know wheter this was a common phenomemon or not but the wait staff that also observed were just as surprised and puzzled as we were at the time.  We watched and photographed this event for approximately 15 minutes before disappearance.  Some objects seemed very slow, others were very quick in their exit of the area.  Too small for commerical or private aircraft, or balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were traveling south on I-80 in Davis. The object was traveling north. It was at first about 11:oo in our direction but moved over to the 1:00 position. It seemed to hover at a stand still without moving for a couple of minutes. I am sure other people had to see this as there were many people on the freeway. What shocked us into believing that this was a ufo, was the fact that suddenly from a hovering and still position it seemed to dive rapidly staight down,just dropping,maybe a thousand feet,that is when we saw a strobe like tail behind it. Then it stopped and hovered not moving once again. Then it began to fly in a sepentine fashion towards us, zig-zagging back in forth at a slower speed, very rythmically like a snake as if it were putting on a show. At this point it was much closer and very bright white light!.The lighted strobe like tail was very evident as it was doing it &#34;s&#34; shaped manuever. Then It suddenly picked up speed again, rose a little higher and then dove quickley.It was headed at a slant toward the trees that were at the 3:00 position from us and it disappeared. It was very dramatic ,and very close. I would describe it as a stingray shape and the whole object was lit up. It was illuminating bright white light. The compass, milaege and temperature navigator in our jeep went a little goofy for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My tree blocked the view so I don&#39;t know what happened after that.About a month ago I saw the same type of thing except it did go in a straight line but then turned around in a hair pin turn half way back on it&#39;s first path then stopped and faded out that was about 8:00pm I believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as &#34;teacher.&#34;  PD))<n>

I iniatially observed 3 lights spaced pretty equally apart, but at slightly different altitudes.  Because of the downtown horizon I was unable to ascertain if they were coming up from the ground or just a slightly lower altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights appeared to be coming from the northeast east quadrant of Marion County (about 10 miles away from me).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After noticing and watching the first three lights, I observed 3 or 4 more about 20-30 seconds behind, ascending in the same manner as the first 3. I then observed approximatly 6-8 more of these objects floating or flying upwards from the same area.  After getting so high into the sky the objects disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a cloud cover on this night, as we did have rainfall off and on.  I am not sure if the lights or objects just burned out or I was unable to see due to the clouds.  The puzzeling thing was that the clouds were going from west to east, and these objects were floating upwards from east to the west, into the wind, but only at a very gradual change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because these objects were going into the wind rather than with the wind, I quickly dismissed them as balloons of any kind but I could be wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before but there could be a legitimate reason for them.  I am just curious what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did watch the 6am newscast when I returned home from work and did not see any mention of the lights for legitimate or unknown purposes.  I did email the Indianapolis Star to see if they knew what the lights were, but so far I have not received a response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also observed what appeared to be a commercial aircraft heading towards the lights, but the lights had cleared its path by time the aircraft arrived in the area.  I would suspect there was a good possibility the aircraft pilots observed these lights as well.  The aircraft was going from the west to the east ( I assume leaving Indpls. Intn. Airport).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several hours later when I returned to that spot (where I sit until a run comes out) I did observe what is mistakenly called a &#34;shooting star&#34; in the area.  This one appearred to be closer and brighter then ones I have seen in the past, but this could just be coincidence.  I just figured I would report it in case anyone else had seen it and no explanation could be found for the lights presence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also attempted to take cellphone pics and video of objects, but on review you can not see them due to poor camera quality on cellphone<n>
10/24/08 22:00|Edmonton (Canada)|AB|Light|15 minutes|Balls of lights dancing in the clouds.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66424.html|158|ndxe200810| Balls of lights dancing in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter age 29, and myself age 58, went outside for a smoke.  It was night time and our attention was drawn to lights moving around in the clouds overhead.  There were three lights, all of circular shape, having a blueish-white color and being somewhat brighter in the center.  At first we only noticed two lights and thought they must be search lights because the lights appeared to be going in circles.  But then as the clouds, which were closely bunched together and overlapping each other, started to seperate, the pattern of the lights movements changed and that&#39;s when we noticed a third light.  We then realized the lights didn&#39;t have a particular pattern. Their movement went according to the shape of the cloud it was in.  If the cloud had a tail the light moved out to the tip, then retraced it&#39;s path, then moved along the outside parimeter of the cloud.  All three lights were doing the same thing with the cloud it was in.  They were following the outside parimeter of the clouds no matter what shape the cloud changed into.  Then the lights started to jump from cloud to cloud.  Two lights didn&#39;t remain in the same cloud at the same time though.  One would immediately jump to another cloud when another light came into it&#39;s cloud.  It was so awesome to watch this.  My daughter and I couldn&#39;t believe what we were seeing.  It was like each light was a ball of electricity moving around in the cloud.  But there was no lightening, no thunder, no dark clouds, no storm at all.  The clouds started to loose their density and their individual shapes.  The clouds were thinning out and started to join together into one ball of mist when we noticed the lights were starting to run into each but would bounce off in opposite directions as soon as they touched.  It was like they were magnets with the polarities repelling each other.  We have no idea what we were watching but we were both very disappointed when the lights stopped.  They didn&#39;t fly off they were just gone as the clouds became too misty.  I! t was li ke someone just flicked the light switch off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving my usual route on the edge of the Dismal Swamp. My favorite route, Old Mill Rd, is a lonely dark curvy road, with no traffic lights. The sky was a beautiful dark blue. I think the moon was full. The sky was patched with large fluffy white clouds. It&#39;s close to deer mating season, and deer run across the road, so my eyes were closely following on the road. Above a clump of Cyprus and Oak trees, I noticed what I thought was an oddly moving jet airliner. I say odd because it moved much slower than a helicopter and emitted no sound. It was also to low to be an airliner. It wasn&#39;t a blimp either. The aircraft displayed about 6 or 7 large lights on each side of the chevron or triangular shaped craft with a green light on my left as I looked up. As I stated before, the sky was bright, but it was night. The last time I saw something strange like this I was around 12, 1973.  My brother told me to wait while he went in the house to get Daddy. Heck, no!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went with him, when Daddy came out it was gone. It was shaped like a shallow bowl on top of a saucer. The aircraft had many windows and lights all around and red lights on top. We saw this aircraft two more times the summer 1974 with my eldest brother and a neighborhood kid. I live 20 miles from Norfolk Naval, Oceana Air Naval and Langley Air Force Base. I have lived within the proximity of naval and air force bases all around me all my life. I have seen plenty of planes, jets, helicopters, Stealth Fighters and jets that take off straight up from a aircraft carrier, but I have never seen something like this and what we saw when I was 12.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It appeared to be getting larger as if it were an approaching aircraft.  Then it dropped altitude gained rapid speed and came to a stop approx. 500 ft. over the 101.  It was at this time that I noticed it had no aircraft beacon or navigation lights but was giving off one intense light that seemed to change color from yellowish to a bright white.  As traffic approached cars were slowing and pulling off the freeway, others were speeding up and trying to flee the scene.  As I travelled under the object I looked up and saw a dark circular edge around the light.  The object then accelerated vertically at which time the color turned a redder hue.  After reaching a height of approx. 3,000 ft. it headed west out over the ocean changing shape several times before dimming out as a foggy white light in a coastal low cloud layer.  I pulled off the freeway at the Avila Beach and there were other people pulled off the side of the road trying to figure out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

10/24/08 19:29|Pismo Beach|CA|Changing|about 4 minutes|Orange ascending light on California Coast, stopping, moving, disappearing 10-24-08|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66422.html|165|ndxe200810| Orange ascending light on California Coast, stopping, moving, disappearing 10-24-08<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 20-year-old undergraduate student of a California state University studying physics.  On the 24th of October, 2008 I and two friends were driving back to our hotel in Pismo Beach, California on California highway 101 southbound about 6 miles north of the town of Pismo Beach.  At 7:29 PM, a bright orange light arose from behind a hill ahead SSE of our position.  It initially put me in mind of a helicopter pointing a searchlight directly at us because of the intensity of the light.  After about 20 seconds of  watching and guessing as to the nature of said light, I pulled out my cell phone (while driving, so the video is not only poor, but shaky) and filmed a short video.  The light dimmed as it rose making me initially think it was a flare, so I watched for telltale signs.  It did not seem to accelerate (as a non-propelled projectile at -9.8 m/s^2), it seemed to be rising at a constant velocity.  I was unable to watch it with the attention it deserved until I was able to pull off the highway at the next exit.  So the next paragraph will be the event as described by the passenger sitting in the rear right seat between its initial rise into the air to the time we were able to get out of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend driving the car pointed out a flying object ahead of us. It seemed to be to close to be an airplane and didn’t look like one either. We traced it as it seemed to get farther away from us until it was just visibly the size of a bight star. We kept our eyes on it as we pulled off the highway, there we watched it for another minute or so before it abruptly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking quick glances up at the light as it rose higher and became dimmer and more angled.  The light seemed to be becoming more triangular (isosceles with the most acute angle seemingly pointing northwest).  It seemed to be traveling more westward over the ocean.  Eventually the light became a single point and was only distinguishable from the stars around it because it still had the characteristic orange color that it had when it first came into view over the nearby hill.  We pulled the car off the freeway at around 7:32 PM, immediately parked and got out of the car to pay full attention (we think it was Spyglass Drive, but we weren’t focused on the name of the exit at the time).  The light was suspended in the same position from our perspective and compared to its original size was at least a factor of 4 or 5 times its initial distance from us (just a size ratio and some simple trigonometry).  And that being the case, I’m able to determine that it was not descending (unless moving towards me simultaneously, which is easily verified by intuition or vector analysis).  That being the case, the light remained at the same intensity as we discussed what it could possibly be.  I was looking very closely and it seemed that it was getting slightly brighter.  But just about as soon as I made that realization, the light “turned off”.  It looked like it either burned out or went very quickly away from us.  I started writing this record of the event at about 7:50 PM and have now finished it at 8:58 PM, making sure to be as clear and accurate as I possibly can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a side note, I just had a friend read this just a few minutes after I finished writing it.  He was driving another vehicle with another of our friends with him.  The report from them is they saw it as well and one reports seeing another similar “object” in the northwest direction during the event described above.<n>

The craft was seen on the east side of I-5 traveling North, at a slow rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, we thought it was a 737, but upon watching it, we noticed right away, the object was black, had an unusual white light traveling from right across to left side and back across-left to tight all the way across, right to left, all the way across.  It was the size of a dime, at arms length, guessing about 3,000 ft altitude, having once been a pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 3 minutes, it had crossed from being south of us, to traveling north of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we pulled off the freeway into a field, got out to observe.  The triangle was traveling with a wide face forward, pointy part in back.  The most beautiful amber orange light, and red light were on the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, about 3-4 minutes into the sighting, the rear of the craft lifted noticeably, and suddenly vanished as though it changed dimensions.  We watched in all directions, thinking the UFO detected something, but nowhere did we see any other air craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Threw ((sic--through)) the entire sighting, we watched others driving by, and it was as if no one else even noticed, or cared.<n>

As we were getting ready to head to bed I noticed a small light slightly above the horizon. I pointed it out to my friend to make sure I was not seeing things, as I had seen this light before but a different color and slightly more to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He saw it too; we both stopped and watched it for several minutes.  We turned out all the lights and TV to make sure it wasn’t a reflection, and since I live 13+ miles from town and 2 miles from the nearest person, I knew it wasn’t that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 4 minutes in we saw the light slowly move back and forth in a half circle motion. We both realized that we were seeing what we were seeing and freaked out and went into another room to see if our buddy who was sleeping would see it. We woke him up and took him in to the room to see if he could see it but the light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not the first time this object was seen. I (the one writing this) have seen it outside my house in a field across from my window.  The only thing different is it looked like it was a yellow-blue light when my friend saw it,  but white-yellow when I saw it (about 4 days earlier and 13-14 days before that one).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This may sound like a lot of BS but its not and my friend and I would like to know if anyone has seen anything like it in my area (De Soto, Missouri). This is the my first time my friend and I have seen that we cannot explain in any way<n>

It was yellowish-white and somewhat bright (est. magnitude -2), so I thought it was the planet Saturn.  I observed it for approximately 30 seconds; it exhibited no movement or change in intensity, and it &#34;twinkled&#34; slightly.  So I shot at it with a violet laser (power output 111.9mW and spectrographically measured wavelength of ~407.5nm).  After shooting at it intermittently for ~10 seconds, the light started to diminish, until ~5 seconds later it had totally extinguished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I discounted phosphenes pretty much at once because the light remained in a fixed position in the sky when my eyes were moved, and discounted a terrestrial aircraft for the same reason, and because no strobes were seen (I would have certainly *NOT* hosed it down with a laser if I had even the slightest suspicion that it was an aircraft!).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions at the time of this sighting were clear skies, calm winds, and a temperature of 47°F (8.33°C).<n>

The &#34;arms&#34; of the V seemed one solid mass, as opposed to a string of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I held my hand out at arm’s length and the sides of the V measured just slightly less than my forefinger.  The shape was symmetrical, and the object did not change course or speed.  A very quiet whine was heard, low pitched, and barely audible, and in truth may have come from another source other than this object as there is a busy road not too far away.  The object seemed to be at a high altitude, and seemed very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I purposely observed how stars were blotted out by its passing, and as it passed directly in line of sight to the star cluster commonly called the Seven Sisters, I could see that there was no central structure, but one of the object’s side legs did completely blot out the stars of this cluster as it passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the object for approximately 20 seconds until it passed out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it could have been a reflection within the rooms however the two light sources are static and would have not moved. Another possible reason I thought was that it was a light shone through the window however the building I live in is the highest and largest building on campus and in Morehead, not to mention that I live on the 11th floor. Therefore it is impossible for something to shine in perfectly horizontal as if it were right in front of the window. The only plausible conclusion is that I witnessed an UFO, possibly 3 separate ones one 1 with 3 lights. The lights were around 2 feet in diameter and were golden in color. The objects flew quickly and when I ran to the window and peered out they had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is most likely a flare, though it really seems to move faster than that...a fast drfit.  If it is a flare, it isn&#39;t too wise, given the wildfires here.  Saw object in sky, watched it drift at good rate of speed and flicker, then flicker out for a solid four or five minutes.  Snapped picture with video camera.

We simultaneously asked each other what the heck they were?  At first I thought they were well-lit hot air balloons, but hot air ballons don&#39;t maneuver like these objects did.  I parked my car about 50 yards from the house, asked her to go get someone to see this--she went next door, two other women joined us-also wondering what was happening.  The objects were moving in a kind of &#34;chase me&#34; pattern (in a circle) pretty much above our heads (hard to tell how high), there was absolutely no sound.  The objects seemed to occasionally give off a thin beam, first one, then another--no pattern to it at all.  They moved slowly, then sped up, turning effortlessly.  They appeared to be roundish, somewhat &#34;glowing&#34;, and sometimes stood perfectly still,  sometimes gliding for a short distance, then coming back around to where the four of us stood.  After about 12 minutes, one of the objects went south, very very slowly...the other two went in a northwesterly direction, sometimes stopping and dropping what appeared to be large sparks from either the top or bottom.   The object that was headed south, kind of pulsated for about 7 minutes, then was simply gone.  The two headed NW would stop, start, ascend, descend, appear to come back, then go NW again.  The way they maneuvered was not like anything I had seen before.  After they &#34;dropped&#34; the sparks, they moved farther away at a very slow rate, then one blinked completely out, and about a minute later, so did the last one.  I had not ever experienced any sighting this close, this clear in my life.  I enjoy watching tv shows about UFO&#39;s but never really saw something I could not explain.  My sister, who is very down to earth (excuse the pun) and rational,! was als o mystified.  I was a bit scared, most likely due to the unknown nature of whatever it was.  The other two ladies that saw these objects were good, solid citizens, not taken to drinking (none of us had anything stronger than lemonade prior to this sighting), and pretty reliable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I keep thinking, we couldn&#39;t possibly be the only people to see this phenomenon!<n>

Myself, the ranch owner and his wife saw strange lights/object on Thursday night (10/23/08) from the ranch between 8:30 and 9:00 PM in what appeared to be mainly over the Stephenville area, although the first time I saw the lights/object it was far west of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights/object appeared five times over the thirty minute period. The lights were very bright orange in color, large and appeared to be rotating along a very large edge of a disk-like object. The ranch owner commented at the time that he could see or make out the curvature shape of the object, stating that it looked like a huge &#39;saucer&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object was in the Stephenville area (direction), we could clearly see the blinking lights of aircraft surrounding or chasing the object. We assumed these were military craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also heard what sounded like a sonic boom after the lights/object disappeared at one point, but it was far away and fairly faint. It may or may not be related to the lights/object we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the lights/object left the Stephenville area around 9:00 PM, all the aircraft in the area left also.<n>

The white lights were about the same size as the nearby stars but much brighter. They didn’t move at all, the brightest one was top left the other was bottom right about half inch apart, 45 degrees angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This isn’t the first time I’ve seen lights in the south east sky over El Paso. About a year ago ( November) around the same time 8 to 9 PM. I’ve seen a very bright light about the size of a green pea, flared out with a black object in the middle.The light lit up the surrounding night sky and shrink down to a very small round white object streaked off .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I should file a report..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time.<n>

Overly bright. I was also on the phone with a friend, trying to explain what I was seeing, and she told me to go get my camera, which I did and took a great pic of this object in the sky!  I also used my cell to call my neighbor who is very much into astronomy to see if it was perhaps just a planet, when I showed him the object in the sky, he said NO that was not a star or planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The excitement was confirmed the next morning on the radio, when they talked about the Stephenville lights, seen roughly an hour later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can you imagine what I thought?

It didn’t make any sound at all that I could hear I watched them lower from the sky straight down at a very slow, steady rate until they went behind a hill.  I rode my bike down the road and down a backroad where I thought it might have landed.  I went a few miles until it rose back up at the same steady, slow pace about ½ of a mile away.  I could still not hear any noise.  It started moving steadily to the northwest, and so I turned around and chased it some more.  I followed it for a while, with little luck catching it.  It went over the hill and out of sight, in the direction of Lexington, Kentucky.  I tried to get a picture with my phone, but it showed up as only a light that is indistinguishable.

I was writing outside when I caught sight of a glowing sphere. High above the sea there was a large green ball that glowed, with a further ball of yellow/orange in its interior.  It &#34;fell&#34; straight down from the sky and moved much slower than a shooting star, absolutely glowing.  The odd thing is that there was a cloud below this &amp; then a clearing.  I should have been able to see this &#39;thing&#39; right down to the sea, it having first passed through a cloud.  It never happened.

The sky was clear and there was a 3 -5 miles per hour wind blowing. I was sitting on a bench seat under a tree and happened to look up. I noticed an object in close proximity to the Sun which was behind a tree limb, and I thought the object was reflecting the Sun Light. The object floated into view, and did not appear to be move very fast.  At first I thought it was something caught on the wind, but then it stopped and hovered for a several seconds.  The object appeared to be solid at this time, and then it moved quickly to the side, and then I followed it as it rapidly moved up into the sky and accelerated away at an extremely high rate of speed. I was able to follow it for few seconds, before it accelerated up at what I estimated to be a 60 degree angle and out of sight.  If the Sun had not been behind the tree limb, I would never have seen it; it would have been lost in the glare. I am sorry, but I do not want to leave contact information.

Visibility was excellent and there were no clouds. I looked up and saw a UFO at the zenith. It appeared to be as high as a jet plane and was traveling rapidly in a westerly direction and stayed in sight for over a minute but not as long as two minutes. There was no vapor trail visible but there seemed to be some very faint black smoke behind it. The object looked like a round ball that was pure white, with a streamlined fuselage of some kind projecting from the ball in the direction of travel. This structure was dark in colour and about 1/8 the diameter of the ball. I thought the object was several miles up and about twice the diameter of a jet airplane. The object did not change course or appearance while visible. The children also saw it. I am unaware of any aircraft like this. The location was a farm near Hamiota, Manitoba.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reported to Ufology Research. Submitted by Ufology Research.

My friend was inside the rest stop building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stretching my legs and and happened to be looking into the sky. An object sped from the northeast to the southwest in a straight line. It covered the entire viewing area in 4 or 5 seconds. It moved so fast that it appeared to leave a trail (or maybe that was just an illusion because of the speed of this object.) It was much larger than a shooting star would appear to be. The fact that it flew in a straight line, lasted the entire length of my view of the sky, flew much faster than a shooting star would appear too, and seemed to be in our atmosphere caused me to rule out the notion that it was a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color seemed to be somewhere between yellow and orange...but not white.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we comtinued to walk, a neighbor was approahing us while also walking his dog.  I asked him what he thought of the light, he said&#34; interesting&#34; because it appeared to just stay in one place.  As we stopped and talked for a few minutes while the dogs did their thing, the light didn&#39;t move.  The neighbor eventually went his own way and my wife and I stayed until the dogs could finish.  After about another two or three minutes, we noticed the light eventually started to come in our direction. Now since we saw movement, we stopped focusing on the dogs and watched it closely.  Within about 30 seconds, it was noiselessly going right over our heads, and only about 1000-1500 ft off the ground.  No strobes, in fact no lights whatsoever.  AS it was overhead, we couldn&#39;t even see t! he original light that got our attention.  It was in the shape between a diamond, and a spade on a deck of cards, with the more pointed part being in the front of the aircraft.  My wife quickly tried to run home (which was about 7 houses down the block), to get our camera in hope of getting this before it was too late.  By the time she and our son appeared out of the house, it was dissapearing East of us towards Thousand Oaks.  It should be noted, my BS is in Aeronautics; and, I have worked as an Aircraft Mechanic / Manager in the Navy for over 23 years.  I might not havre seen every kind of aircraft, but I feel pretty confident that I have enough experience to recognize something when I see it...this was not an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Other long contrails were visible in other areas of the sky, particularly to the south.  The altitude of the three contrails seemed to be similar to typical jet contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three contrails seemed unusual to me.  The contrail lengths were relatively short compared to others in different areas of the same sky.  The two most westward contrails were relatively close and in parallel.  A third contrail was close behind.  After observing these objects for about 20 to 30 seconds, it then appeared that there were actually four contrails.  The fourth contrail seemed to be close to the forward two.  The flight paths were apparently straight and the movement seemed to be consistent with high altitude aircraft speed which I have routinely observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These contrails apparently were evaporating rather quickly.  After about 60 to 90 seconds after the initial observation, the contrails disappeared, one by one.  The last one observed was the trailing contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, my initial impression was this phenomena could have been some type of debris entering the earth’s atmosphere and breaking into three or four relatively large pieces.  I was not able to determine if the contrails were actually due to aircraft.  I did not have access to any type of optical devices or cameras.  There was no observed points of light associated with the contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was one other observer besides myself.  My background is in chemistry and radiological safety.  The other observer is a registered land surveyer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My question would be, &#34;Has any local radar station observed these objects at this location and time and made any identification?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> A response via email would be welcome if this observation warrants an investigation.<n>

The object was moving from what looked like north to south at approximateley a 45 degree angle. I&#39;d like to think it was a meteor, but the green color has me second guessing.

I watched it for a minute or so, then went inside to get a camera but I left my dog outside. When I came back out,the UFO was still there, so I turned on the camera, but by the time I snapped the picture it was gone. My dog was nowhere to be found. Minnie (the dog) always stays close by, so I am convinced that the craft abducted my dog. The craft appeared to have a relatively low altitude, probably 1000ft. There were no discernible features other than the &#34;V&#34; shape and bright lights. I did not hear any abnormal sounds during the entire encounter. I have contacted VA Beach PD and they think I am just a nuisance and will not process my report. I am left with no other options. Please help me.

I work in an environment with a lot of golden colored lights on the buildings covering the ground in that area; fairly non-reflective. At about 0123 hours on the 22nd of October 1008, I was driving North on a straight stretch of road. Clear as day, as if from nowhere, just over the refinery (where I work) a huge bright green orb dropped from the sky (I will not attempt to give a height in feet or miles, because I would more likely than not be WAY OFF!), the light seemed to come out from within the object, forming a perfect green circle. The ‘orb’ appeared, went into a straight vertical drop, hovered momentarily then shot North and slightly upward, faster than I have EVER seen ANYTHING move in my entire life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at once stricken with awe, terror and anger that I was alone in my witness. I proceeded (all the while watching the sky) to call my boss to tell him what I’d seen, as well as waking my wonderful Boyfriend who tried to convince me it was anything but a UFO.  I worked until 0900 hours and never saw it again, not that I’d seen it before in the near four years that I’ve lived here in the area, or the 25 years I’ve spent staring relentlessly at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I tried to find out if there had been some sort of falling satellite or Military activity, I found nothing. If this report prompts anyone else with better resources and know-how to do more research on what it may have been I would love to be notified of whatever can be said, or even if it’s somehow confidently accepted to be alien aircraft.<n>

It was amazing to me that 3 objects moving so fast did not make one sound. There were so light or markings or flashes. the crafts were moving in formation but seemed to change ever so slightly in formation shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We had just been in town at a business meeting, the meeting ended around 6:30 PM and we drove out to our ranch (we live 6 miles from Fairfield).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a beautiful Fall evening and we have a habit of hanging out on the back porch off our kitchen to watch the sunset. My boyfriend and I noticed 3 long streaks in the sky low on the horizon to our West (toward Mexia/Waco). At first we didn&#39;t think much of them as we assumed they were jet trails of jets flying in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to do chores in the backyard, we both noticed that these &#34;trails&#34; or &#34;streaks&#34; did not disappear. In fact, it became obvious that they were solid in shape and very shiny (the setting sun was bouncing off them and they were highly reflective). We decided to take a few pictures of the objects but we did not get much on the digital image. At the time when I was taking the photos, my boyfriend noticed two more similar objects in the South West that looked like they were traveling South to North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We wanted to get in the truck and get a closer look but we knew they were too far away and we would probably lose them out of sight. Other normal air traffic was visible during the sighting. We see planes, helicopters and satellites all the time and these were not anything we had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We told our family about this early Friday, October 24th - that very same night a news report came on from Channel 8 in Dallas/Ft. Worth about the return of the Stephenville lights in Texas. We are about 90 miles from Stephenville and felt that our sighting might be connected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I said there were 4 witnesses is because we found out that two other people here in Fairfield saw them too, we just found out about that on Sunday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> **Another person I do not know saw my report on MUFON and said they saw the exact same thing a few counties over, they wanted to contact me**** On Tuesday, October 28th we had another very strange sighting and I will report that seperately. Something is going on in Texas and it really needs to be investigated, it might be military but if so...it is technology never seen before!<n>

The sky is as clear as glass, not a cloud in sight from what I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About half way through my cigarette I see this faint light move extremely fast in a zig zag movement (a rough drawing using paint will be emailed) and as it moving it leave a cloudy trail behind it. It acted as if it were moving away from the earth. And then it just disappeared in a very bright light. The time is now about 4:54 AM. It lasted about 2-3 seconds I couldn’t believe my eyes so and then I decided to blow it off.  But as I’m finishing my cigarette I see three more faint lights zipping through the sky higher than the first one.  The other three were each in a different location all heading in different paths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first bright light I knew was no airplane, helicopter, or shooting star. The movement was completely random. The other three could’ve been shooting stars but it was too coincidental.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first bright light:  Location: just to the left of orions belt The flash was so bright that I could see clouds that I couldn’t see with the moon light; the flash was a bright white with a blues tint. The trail if left disappeared moments after the light had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I see weird things in the skies late at night that I know aren’t airplanes but this first bright light was the weirdest. This is no hoax. Possibly anything but I just wanted to report this incase I was right.<n>

I am a father.  I am ex-military.   I run a small business here in Fayetteville N.C.  I have never been a real UFO enthusiast or anything but have always been a very open minded thinker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So the other day I got a phone call from my mom telling me to contact my sister ASAP.  My sister lives in Marshalltown Iowa 1,100 miles away.  She also has to pay for outgoing long distance calls so normally we talk when I call her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I dialed and said hello she says, very enthusiastically, “brother you’re not going to believe what I saw today!”   What was it?  I asked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She proceeded to tell me how she was driving downtown towards the post office when she noticed an extremely bright object in the sky that appeared to be a floating star.  She described the object as being at least two stories high and definitely within the city limits.   She told me that she had no idea what it was but that she stopped and got out of her vehicle to get a better look.  When she got out looking towards the sky, she said the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought about this for a moment and asked her what she thought she saw.  She said she had no idea but that it didn’t make sense the object had vanished so quickly.  I tried to offer her a reasonable explanation by telling her that it’s possible for sunlight to reflect off an aircraft very brightly and seemingly disappear when the aircraft changes direction slightly in the sky.   She was not totally satisfied with this and responded by telling me that the aircraft would have been flying too low.  When the conversation was over she seemed calmed down some.  I should mention that to her credit my sister is a very intelligent and grounded person.  Not one to make up such stories.  I believed she saw something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I had pretty much forgotten all about the phone call with my sister.  My business associate and I had just finished services at one of our customer’s property.  This was on Vista dr.  We both got into the truck and as I was starting the ignition I looked up.  Immediately I was struck by what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft was big.  I’m estimating it to be about the size of a Boeing 747 passenger jet.  It was shaped almost like a blimp, “and this was the first thought that came to my mind”, but longer giving it an even more aerodynamic look.  It was very luminescent.  I could not make out any distinguishable shapes like you would expect to see on an aircraft besides the color.  The color had the appearance of mercury and I could also see some red towards the front upper portion. No tail, no undercarriage, no wings.   My mind was racing like lightning.  After about 3 seconds I yelled to my partner, “LOOK!”  And I pointed skyward.  She looked up, but not quick enough.  The craft, which was traveling at about 60 mph, had entered into the tree line overhead.  She looked back at me and I was still looking upward.  I saw it for about 2 more seconds through the trees and then disappeared back over the tree line.  I was AMPED!  I hit the gas and we began speeding through the neighborhood.  I was definitely getting another look at this thing!  I turned a sharp right at the corner and tore down the road.  We went about 7 blocks.  All the while I was looking madly up at the sky trying to see around the trees and get a better look.  It took me about 30 seconds to get to a better area.  I pulled into a parking lot and got out of the truck.  From this position I had a good 360 degree view.  It was a mostly clear sky and I could see for miles in the direction that the aircraft should have been headed.  Even then I expected to see something that made sense.  It must have been some kind of blimp or something.  There was nothing.  I was completely astounded.  Why didn’t I see something in the sky?  What the hell did I see?  It shouldn’t have been possible at the speed it was traveling to elude my range of vision when I could now easily see for miles.  This all happened at about 1: pm Oct, 21, 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my partner was looking at me like I had gone bat shit.  So I gave her the phone and made her call the airport.  At this time I spoke to Trisha in the radar tower.  I asked her if any aircraft were currently flying above the downtown area.  She asked me what I had seen and I said that I wasn’t sure maybe a blimp.  She told me to hold on and then came back on the phone.  She told me that I had probably seen one of the many military aircraft that fly over Fayetteville.  I told her, “No Trisha, I want to know if you have any communication right now with any aircraft over the downtown area and if so, what specifically?”  She said that a C-130 had been flying over the downtown area.  I told her that,” no it was not a C-130.”  I used to jump out of this type of aircraft when I served in the military.  It is very easy for me to identify.  I should also note that I have lived in Fayetteville for 7 years now.  Being local for so long, and near Pope air force base, I am very used to looking up in the sky and seeing military aircraft.  You see everything from warthogs and C-130s to Chinook helicopters, to name a few.  Also, I live less than I mile from the air force base and have seen many different types of military aircraft, in the sky, on routine training flights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I spoke with Trisha in the radar tower I was both very excited and very confused.  I thought for sure that they would have some sort of explanation that made sense.  No, they had nothing.  Later that afternoon I called the police station and spoke with a dispatcher.  She had no other reports of anomalous objects in the sky.  I’m not sure if she made a report of my story or not but I told her everything.  I also called the airport back and spoke to Trisha again.  No one else had called in at all.  She gave me a number to Pope AFB.  I called and left a message to call me back please.  No one has called.  That was 48 hrs ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no easy explanation for what I experienced.  The events surrounding this seem just extraordinary, for example; my sister calling the day before.  Interestingly enough the presidential nominee Barrack Obama was here last weekend.  McCain is coming this weekend.  Do these things relate?  I can only speculate about that as I try to make some sense of things.  Another wild coincidence is that Great Britain just released a 1,500-page batch of top secret documents that were UFO related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://news.aol.com/article/britain-releases-more-ufo-sighting-files/217434?icid=200100397x1211165486x1200734593<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I’m not sure exactly what I saw I can tell you this.  Visibly it seemed immediate that it was anomalous.  It should have been in the sky longer.  The radar tower should have known what it was.  Many other people should have seen this as it was almost directly above downtown Fayetteville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister believes she also saw something anomalous in the sky 24 hours prior to my experience.  Somehow this is all absolutely PHENOMENAL.<n>

For some reason, I don&#39;t know why there appeared to be a commotion in the sky and my eyes just naturally focused in on the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, out of nowhere I was looking at an object that I have never seen before.  It appeared to be a miniture moon with a collar around it.  It was pink and red in color and it was low, probably less than 8,000 feet.  The body of the craft appeared to be irregular as far as the texture. It appeared to be pink and some parts red like what the moon would look like if it was going the speed of light.  The collar around it looked like it was manufactured and almost appeared to be opaque with a red outline. This thing was there for only a split second and was gone.  The craft moved so fast that it appeared to dissapear.  However there was a very short, bright trail of sparks in the sky when it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Okay, now for the real kick, did you ever recall looking skyward and seeing these short burst of sparks and saying, &#34;wow, I just saw a shooting star&#34;.  You know what, its not a star its them. Nowdays if you look skyward at night for any length of time you&#39;ll see these trails of sparks often enough.  Never use to but now we do.  I had made an attempt to bring this to someones attention but instead I spoke to what can only be called the smartest person in the world because this individual didn&#39;t want to hear anyone but himself talk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((text deleted))<n>

Now we are used to jets flying at night from Oceana Air Force Base in Virginia Beach, VA, but this was no jet! The craft was very close to us, maybe 1/4 to 1/2 mile and very large in comparision to jets at that range. It was probably 1000 feet in the air, flying behind the tree lines. I watched in disbelief and quickly ran out the front door to get a better view of the lights, but the craft was lower than our next door neighbors house. I could hear engines or some sort of mechanical power grrr through the sky. I ran out back but couldn&#39;t see anything else, only the sound fading away. We quickly jumped in the car to take a ride to see if we could get another glimpse of it, but we had no luck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To describe the craft: It looked exactly like a triangle starting with 5 vertical lights, then 4, then 3, then 2, then 1. They were VERY bright lights, not typical commercial flight lights. A strange thing about the lights was, the 3 vertical lights had a red light in the middle. This was the only different light, and it also was very bright red. The lights did not blink, they remained solid. I would love to know what we saw, and have looked for it from time to time ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked up at the sky and saw what I at first thought was the planet Venus.  Then I noticed that Venus was a bright white light in the southwestern sky.  I saw a yellowish white round light, that seemed to hover, more to the northern than Venus.  It brightened a couple of times to bright white light, then dulled down again.  It floated one way a little then another.  I realized it was not a plane, as it hovered.  It was not a helicopter as it made no noise.  It moved very smoothly.  I went in the house to get binoculars and looked at it.  It had a red light that strobed and moved up and down the orb.  I watched it float around until it moved off into the western horizon, behind trees and out of sight.  Slowly and without noise.  My husband saw it also.  He is a pilot and knew it was not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Gazing east/northeast I observed a string of dark red lights in a boomerang formation travelling southeast to northwest.  The lights never changed formation leading me to speculate they were not individual objects but that they belonged to a singular object.  The light appeared to blink in a tip-to-tip sequence, alternating starting points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was occluded from my view after about 30 seconds due to a very large tree in my building courtyard, so I moved to the other side of the porch hoping that the object&#39;s path would allow it to be visible on the other side of the tree.  It unfortunately was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did however continue to gaze into the sky hoping maybe it would appear.  About 5 or 10 minutes after the initial sighting, I happened to look back in the direction I originally saw the object only to see it AGAIN or an identical object traveling in the same exact  path as the first object.  I would estimate this sighting was the same duration, my view being once again occluded by the large tree. This second object as it passed seemed to me to be followed by one or two aircraft.  Whether these were  jet or helicopter I am not certain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as judging the size of these two objects, I was asked by the gentleman manning your hotline to approximate using the full moon as my measure.  Based on this I can say that the objects tip to tip could have touched the top and bottom of a late evening full moon, if not complete wrap around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am no aviation expert but having lived in this area for over two years I am quite accustomed to hearing and seeing commercial jets and private headed for LAX or Burbank pass over my building.  Had this object been one of these judging from its size, it would have been extremely low and emitting very loud engine noise.  There was no discernible noise coming from these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife who would have normally been here is away on business so I was the sole witness to this event unfortunately.<n>

10/20/08 18:30|Greenfield|OH|Unknown|15 minutes|Boomerang ,points upright, in Greenfield, Ohio|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66347.html|224|ndxe200810| Boomerang ,points upright, in Greenfield, Ohio<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this thing this evening, the sun had gone behind the horizon, yet there were no stars showing in the sky yet, it was still like daylight, there were very few scattered clouds, but the sky was very clear above and below these few clouds, with a very light breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had gone to mailbox,( I have to drive, it is a half mile lane), on my way back I saw what looked, at first to be something dropping from the sky,slowly, or far away, and appeared slowly.  Then I thought it was something like a meteor, all within seconds, then realized it was nothing like what I thought, because it was moving to slow for that, so I hurried up the driveway, ran into house to grab my camera, and binoculars, and my camera batteries were gone, so I looked with binoculars, and saw something that looked like a boomerang, or tuning fork, since it was in a shape of, well , as if the fork was upright with the points in the air, or a boomerang, moving away from me, with points in the air, or sideways, if you will.  I then ran into the house to get new batteries for my camera, and returned to see, but it was getting lower in the sky, and so had to go further out to the pasture, and I snapped a picture of it, but it was pretty far away by then. I did get it on camera. I told my husband (as I ran in and out of the house to look and try and get a picture). He did not witness it, as he is a bed-bound parapalegic.  He is a Navy Veteran and said it was moving toward WrightPatt. Thank-you<n>
10/20/08 18:30|Fairfield|TX|Other|several sightings from 10|Multiple sightings in Central Texas (Freestone County area)|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67594.html|225|ndxe200810| Multiple sightings in Central Texas (Freestone County area)<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live on a farm/ranch in Freestone County between Fairfield &amp; Palestine near Highway 84.  We have very dark skies and are used to seeing bright stars, satellites &amp; multiple air traffic.  I am going to report the multiple sightings that we have had in the last few months.  My boyfriend&#39;s family has had this land for 4 generations and he grew up here.  He and other members of his family have seen strange things over the years but this year there has been lots of activity.  We are only about 120 miles Southeast of Stephensville &amp; 65 miles from Waco.  There are several airbases and strip mines (lignite &amp; coal) in this area of Texas. I mention the mines because lots of activity seems to occur near them.  I am going to give a description of each sighting over the last few months.  We really believe something is going on possibly military, possibly not. If it is military - it is something unbelievable and the technology is very different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10/20/2008 - We (my boyfriend and I) had just arrived home and stepped out on the back porch of the farm to look at the beautiful sunset. We noticed 3 long pencil shaped cylinder objects due West of us toward Limestone County (Mexia/Waco) somewhere beyond highway I-45 above highway 84W. At first we thought they might be jet trails. They were suspended at a 40-45 degree angle from the ground. They did not break up like trails and we realized they were solid and very reflective. You could see the reflection of the sunset in them. I ran inside and got my digital camera and snapped a few shots. They were in perfect formation. With the naked eye, nothing showed up on the camera screen but when I downloaded onto the computer we noticed you could see 3 white orbs or ovals in the picture when amplified by 200+. The strange part about this is with a naked eye these objects looked very long and solid like pencils or telephone poles in the sky but on film they were round or oval shaped. We told some friends later in the week what we saw and they admitted that they saw them too and had commented how strange they looked. They were in their car on the way to a restaurant at I45 &amp; 84. They also saw them due West/Northwest. I will try and include a picture with this report. The incident lasted over a 1/2 hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10/28/2008 - We had just gotten home and went out on the back porch to feed our 4 dogs at 8:20 PM. I observed a dull orange, red glowing sphere with a whitish glow in the center. It looked like it was hovering or floating just above the tree line in the Southwest sky somewhere between our land and Jewett (near the mine). My boyfriend ran inside and came back out with his rifle which had a high powered scope. We took turns observing the object until 8:33 PM when it either flew over the horizon or descended (we felt like it descended). The next day we saw a report on the Dallas news that the Stephensville lights had returned so I decided to send them an account of what we saw. I contacted the Stephensville paper and reported the object. They asked if they could use our description in an article so I gave them permission. The next day they published the article and there was a picture that had been submitted by an East Texas woman. Our verbal description matched the picture exactly (but we did not take any pictures that night). Others saw what we saw! 11/25/2008 - Almost the exact same sighting as mentioned previously - orange, reddish glowing sphere with white center...almost dull like a halo around it. It was in the same Southwestern area and we saw it around 9:00 PM and watched it for 15 minutes - again it looked like it descended or went over the horizon. Other air traffic could be seen and this looked nothing like the normal air traffic in the area. Since this was the second sighting of this kind we began to investigate our surrounding (helicopter landing sights etc.) but we found nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12/3/2008 - Again, almost the same description as above - we documented it at 8:05 and watched it until 8:22. We could not get pictures because nothing would show up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12/7/2008 - (This is our strangest one yet and involved three different sets of lights). This sighting started out as the one above. We had just gotten back from Dallas &amp; Waxahachie and went out on the back porch to feed the dogs at 8:19 PM. I saw the strange orange/red object and called out to my boyfriend to come take a look. We watched it do it&#39;s normal thing (descend or go over the horizon) but this time as soon as we lost sight of it this bright white light appeared above it. This came on as if someone had turned on a lightbulb. This object began to flash bright multi colors in sequence. The colors were amazing - blue, orange, pink, green, red. It was so bright it was hard to tell what shape it was. We got the rifle scope out again and my boyfriend looked at it through the scope - he said it was hard to tell it&#39;s shape. As soon as he handed me the scope the light went off, again just like a light switch. I told him something was still there - right when I said that, 3 small piercing white strobe lights came on in a triangle formation. They kept strobing back and forth as if communicating or sequencing. A high flying jet came into the airspace where this was going on and the strobe lights began to almost cartwheel over each other off to the North at a very high rate of speed. The next thing we knew, we were just looking at the regular air traffic (jets) on their route to Dallas. This sighting really shook me up. While it was happening, my boyfriend called his mom who lives in town, she went out to see if she could see anything and she could not because of the tree cover in her neighborhood (very large Post Oaks).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this sighting to MUFON ( I had reported the previous sightings to them). The MUFON investigator contacted me and said that he had received almost an exact report of our sighting from a man that was driving home from Dallas back to Waco with his teenage son (they had been at a football game).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12/11/2008 - This is our last sighting. There is a well being drilled due South of our farm and we can see the rig lighting very clearly beyond our barns. I had gone out on the back porch at 10:00 PM and saw the strange multi colored bright light about 55 degrees above left of the rig. We watched it for 40 minutes, I tried to film it but nothing appears on the video. It was not a star because we know our night sky and there has not been a star there before and there has not been one since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please consider investigating this area of Texas if you are already investigating the Stephensville incidents. We just want to know if it is military or not...I think NOT.<n>

These other lights were not found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my passenger to check it out, to see if he could make out the object better than I could. Eventually even another passenger in the back seat witnessed the object, but could still not determine its origin, nor identify what it was, except for the fact that it was very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly afterward, the object disappeared into a cloud, and as we all waited for it to emerge, the light shining through the aforementioned clouds dimmed and was suddenly extinguished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: All observers are males age 21-25 with college-level educations and above-average intellects.<n>

It just hovered in that one area for over an hour. It made NO sound either. If it was a helicopter, which is the only thing that could have stayed that still for that long, we would have heard something. It also looked to be surrounded by 2 or 3 other star like things that were also blinking, but only white.

We got in the car and drove home all the time watching it. Before we reached our home, I pulled over and got out my binoculars to look at this light. It was not an aircraft because it had not green or red obstruction lighting. It just hung there. Through my binoculars it looked like a rectangle with piece broken off at the end. Then a red light appeared on the end. It then turned into a cluster of round white lights. Then a red light appeared in it. The red light went away and a wide line appeared through the center of it. The line faded away and it remained a cluster of white lights. My daughters looked and it and said it looked like it was turning. When I looked at it again the lights went from bright white to a purple, then went out and we never saw it again. I have seen a lot of things in the sky and have dismissed all of what appeared to be out of the ordinary as some type of aviation craft that I am not familiar with. However this is just something I cannot explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was going so fast I had to jump up out of my chair and run to the wall on the other side of the room (5 feet away) to see it disappear over the treetops heading west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was completely soundless.  Like a lightbulb the glow kept you from being able to see the definite shape of the craft, but it was a solid glow (white), not blinking, and definitely faster than any plane.  The glow was oval shaped and didn&#39;t change shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t go up or down, it just FLEW past in a straight line just over the treetops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There would have been no time to call for someone else to see it if they had been in the next room.

Then while I was watching it another strobe like you&#39;d see from an aircraft. Another strobe confirmed that the duration between strobes on object was irregular, unlike conventional aircraft. Strobes were sometimes fractions of a second apart, sometimes 5-10 seconds or more. Object was dull yellow or white, nearly unnoticeable from star besides slow Northwesterly movement. After spotting it  about a hand&#39;s width at arm&#39;s length west from 90 degrees straight up, it proceeded northwest and was not visible any longer about a hand&#39;s width at arm&#39;s length over horizon about 10 minutes later. I did not see it but other witness says a jet type aircraft chased after it at about 8-9 minutes after my initial sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While watching an airplane cross the sky I noticed something flipping about below the plane.  My mind went straight to thinking it was a bird then logic kicked in on the altitude and I realized it was something abnormal. It flipped around for about 30 seconds and then shot up out of sight.  Within minutes there were 5 jets in the sky, too far away to identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the same color (metallic) and size of craft however not flipping exactly 3 years ago to the day, Oct 19th 2005.  There was 3 other witnesses and it was very plain to see that it was cigar shaped with high rear fenders like a &#39;57 Chevy!  Thanks.<n>

It was traveling at a rate too fast for any aircraft to be moving, going from directly above us to disappearing over the trees on the horizon in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a single ball of bright white light. It was not a vague bright spot in the night sky like a comet or a meteorite; it was bright like search light. Yet unlike an aircraft it cut across the sky at an impossibly fast speed before disappearing from view. There was no sonic boom, which I was expecting as a result of its extremely fast rate of movement.<n>

There was a loud aircraft noise directly above us that made us look up to see what it was. When we tracked the plane it was headed north, than we saw a metallic colored ball just in front of it. The plane flew by and the object stayed still and than a couple of planes flew by it, than it started moving south from lets say the 2 O&#39;clock to 10 o&#39;clock ,if that makes since. The object stayed there for a long time. We got tired of looking so we just ignored it. I thought about getting out of the camcorder, but I figured that I wouldn&#39;t be able to pick up the object very well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

A bright flash caught my attention in the northern sky. At first sight I assumed I was seeing an airplane. I quickly noticed this wasn&#39;t a airplane but a short stubby metallic object. This object is hard to describe, please see accompanied photos for a better explanation. The object moved at normal speed and seemed to just silently glide from the north east to south west toward the Bull Run Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object could have been a aircraft unknown to me so please see the photos to make your own assumption. I did not take these photographs. I found these when researching the object I saw. The photos where taken on interstate 95 south while the witness was stuck in traffic. He had seen this object stationary and then something smaller flew into it. The pictures shows exactly the object I saw and it was on the same day. It has to be the same object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The streak was bright white and went from high in the sky to low behind the trees (which were about 50 yards away and 30 feet high).  I noted the streak was thicker than what I thought a shooting star to be and then thought that it was a meteor breaking through the atmosphere.  The streak of light disappeared behind the trees and a moment later a large rectangularly shaped patch of light appeared above us on our right (North-west).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vehicle we were traveling in was moving about 65-75 mph and the rectangular light was obscured by the roof of my car as I got close to it and it was directly on our right.  It is then that 4 of my passengers witnessed a second large rectangular light appear next to the first and together they traveled over the highway behind us and disappeared behind more trees.  The lights were very bright white, so much so that they were almost bluish, and my back right passenger said he saw the two rectangular patches as having bulges in their centers, leading us to believe they were cylindrical in shape, like two cans of soup.  The objects were pretty low in the sky and as far as we could tell close to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were six in the car.  The driver was the only one to see the &#39;shooting star&#39; ahead of us on the left, and all but 1 of us saw the rectangles.  The driver did not see the duo of rectangles or their movements behind the car.  All six are seniors at Fairfield University and in good academic standing and have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: About four miles north east of where we saw these lights is Sikorsky airfield, where they build and test airplanes and helicopters, so this may have been something from there, however the movements, shape and color lead us to believe otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It flew my direction untill it was above me (not perfectly right above me or something) and then seemed to fade away into space. This all happened very quick, about 4 seconds. It looked a little bigger than a star. it&#39;s speed, color and brightness reminded me a lot of a so called falling star but it lasted too long for being one and didn&#39;t leave a trail , wich makes it something worthy to report for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were approximately 15 people at the party and we were all baffled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were bright white in color and looked like a ORB/sphere in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15 minutes of viewing, I asked my friends if what we are seeing were flares from the near by Quantico Military base. Most agreed and than one said &#34;Yep, I think your&#34; but before he could finish his sentence someone else said &#34;I have never seen flares move like that.  Astonishingly the lights started to move in unison in a easterly direction.  There were Approximately 10 lights, all were lined up in a straight line, from west to east, and seemed to make a noticeable outline of something HUGE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unbelievably this collection of lights started to move, from our vantage point it looked to be at least 200 feet long and flying at a estimated 300 feet over the tree line.  The lights moved slowly approximately 2.5 miles and than started to turn north. Because of this turn these lights made a dip up then gradually swept North.  This is when we noticed there was another collection of lights on the bottom of this thing. I think this is when most of us realized this was something very special and quite extraordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the lights completed their turn we were able to see the back which was comprised of what looked like eight lights, four on top four on the bottom. There also was a strange haze between the top and bottom lights, I&#39;m not sure how to describe it but it was a blurry bluish haze. It was shortly after this when the lights faded from view as it continued to head north in the direction of Washington DC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 6 months later I received a phone call from one of my friends, he was also at the November party and saw the &#34;Virginia Lights&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He explained that he had camped the night before at the property and had another sighting of the lights. This time he said it didn&#39;t turn North but stayed due east in the direction of the Fredricksburg area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I am reporting this to you now is that I had another sighting of the &#34;Virginia Lights&#34; this past weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time the lights were further off in the distance when first spotted and again headed North but in a more North Easterly direction, again toward Washington DC. Interestingly, the lights seem to be rising out of the tree line which is approximately 3-5 miles distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have done some internet research on the lights and found there has been some very similar sightings occurring throughout the Northern Virginia area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In particular, there were a few sightings in the vicinity of Dale City and the Woodbridge Va area. The description of these sightings were so eerily similar and since this was the direction we saw the lights heading makes me think we may have seen the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s all I have for now. You are welcome to contact me if you have any additional questions about this sighting. I hope this report helps you in your research.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, The Virginia Lights<n>

10/18/08 20:00|Indianapolis|IN|Light|1 second each|Strange yellow lights streaked across the Indiana night sky|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66346.html|261|ndxe200810| Strange yellow lights streaked across the Indiana night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday evening October 18, 2008, I was in Indiana driving on Interstate 65 heading northwest from Indianapolis towards Gary.  I witnessed two similar phenomena occur twice within a half-hour or less of each other.  Not being too familiar with the area I don’t know exactly where I was located, but for the first event, I’d say I was between 25-50 miles northwest of Indianapolis, and for the second, maybe 50-75 miles northwest of Indianapolis.  For the second sighting, I’m reasonably sure that I was located no more than halfway between Indianapolis and Gary – most likely closer to Indianapolis.  Giving a generous estimation, I’d say both events occurred between 7:30 and 9:00 p.m. EST.  It’s more likely that they occurred between 7:30 and 8:30, but I wasn’t paying close attention to the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw each time a single streak of yellow light occur in the northern sky heading north/northwest.  Each event lasted about 1 second each, moved extremely fast, and seemed to travel a great distance, assuming they were as far away as they appeared.  They looked to be pretty far away, but I could not accurately guess the number of miles.  The streaks were not directly overhead, but they were closer to being overhead than they were to the horizon.  They appeared to be as long as a pencil when it’s held at arm’s length away when they completed their streak.  There was a definite movement of the light.  That is, they did not appear immediately as a solid line.  They began as a point and streaked across a portion of the night sky, as if someone had drawn a line with a yellow marker.  As soon as the lights reached a certain distance, they faded immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no stars in the sky, and that coupled with the fact that I saw it twice led me to believe that they were not shooting stars.  It was not raining, nor was there thunder, so I’m sure they were not lightning streaks.  They appeared out of and returned to nothing, it seemed.  They were both very unnatural-looking phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my first report of a sighting.  I thought these events were strange enough to deserve reporting.  I’d describe myself as being agnostic towards the existence of extra-terrestrials.  I don’t not believe in them.<n>

I just happen to be walking outside to the garden and looked up and saw three light, smaller than the moon and bigger than stars or planets.  Bigger than lights from a plane.  It was such a quick sighting due to the tree getting in the way.  I live near an airport and if it was a plane or some other aircraft i think i would have heard it easily. They had no sound.  If it were the way the moved  the speed and the formation they could not have been balloons with flairs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was such a quick sighting on my part, I just wondered if anyone else got more than I got from my sighting.

Could of possibly been a shooting star but the light pollution from Kankakee and the Chicago suburbs was substantial so this is a very remote possibility plus, the light did not seem like a naturally occurring light because of it’s brightness. There were cell towers near the road and it was not from one of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As the second balloon traveled over my head I noticed a bright white &#34;dot&#34; in the background in a Southeasterly direction.  The white &#34;dot&#34; was high in the sky and appeared to be reflecting the sun.  I immediately assumed it may be another balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon further focus of my eyes against the clear blue sky absent of any clouds, I began to notice about 10-20 more white &#34;dots.&#34;  They did appear to be stars, so I stared at them to see if they were moving.  Some appeared to be close to one another, they were in no specific pattern just sort of scattered.  I believe I perceived some of them getting really close to each other and then moving back apart.  They all were relatively stationary, not moving in any one direction but sort of holding their position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at a dog park, my and some other dogs where barking at the hot air balloon, so I kept having to look away.  When I looked back up, each time, there were less and less until I could no longer see any of them.   As I left the park I could see no stars or white &#34;dots&#34; anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 30 mins later, in St. Peters I observed 2 what I assume were military jets judging from the contrails flying in a SE to W direction.<n>

It was not an airplane, helicopter, hot air balloon, or a childs balloon or anything else of that sort.  The weather was very clear and no clouds in the sky which made the craft very visible to the naked eye. There was no sound coming from the craft as if it were a plane or helicopter.  It certainly wasn&#39;t a hangglider of any sort.  We both agreed it was some type of unidentified flying object.  My granddaughter was becoming afraid.  The object would go up and down and then it would disappear quickly and then it would go from left to right and disappear again. All that lasted about five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Off to my right, I looked through the tree line and saw an object that look out of place through the trees, up in the air.  It took a second for the thought to register in my mind and to take a second look.  Upon looking again, I caught a clear look at it through an opening through the woods.  I had an instantaneous feeling of fright consume my body because I know what I was looking at was really there.  I immediatley slowed down to try and get a better look, but another car was coming up behind me and I felt obligated to move along.  I hoped to drive along another 100 feet or so and be able to pull over and see through the trees, but when that opportunity came, I could not find the object.  The area in which the object was was about 400-500 feet off the ground....well below the two &#34;mountain&#34; tops which it was flying between.  This was not a plane or helicopter.  I think some other people may have seen this...because I noticed an unusually high number of skid marks (I could smell the freshness) on that exact spot when I went back later that day.  I only saw one object, it was metallic, disc-shaped, and probably 20 feet long.  I don&#39;t feel 100% confident in the size of the object and distance...because I only got a good look for a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

For the first minute I could not determine if it was actually moving toward the south west or if it was just a star.  After a couple of minutes it became much more visually obvious that it was moving.  Within about three minutes it was obviously moving due west across the southern sky and was not blinking, changing size or brightness.  I grabbed my binoculars to get a better view but they did not make much difference in seeing what still looked like a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I visually followed the object until it was directly south of me and was either behind some trees or no longer visible.

They also had a red light on it that would quickly blink on occasion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were moving in all directions and were able to change direction very fast. These lights would go in circles around each other and drift apart. They would go as high as the moon was and drop to behind the Mountains in about 1 and one half seconds. When planes flew by these lights would dim so much that they could not be seen and as soon as the plane was gone the light would go up and start shining. During this time my cell phone was not able to call or receive calls or messages. My friends house phone that he brought was also having difficulty calling people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The background of this scene was a California suburb with many trees and Mountains in the background.

There were patches of clouds covering the sky that somewhat resembled an old ripped and torn blanket.  The moon was slightly to our right from the direction we were walking when my eyes picked up on three lights almost directly above us moving away at a very fast rate of speed.  I immediately called out for my group to &#34;Look at these lights in the sky&#34;.  But, as I was watching them move away from us, I somewhat in an embarrassing way, said &#34;Oh, it&#39;s not what I thought it was&#34;.  But, as I continued to watch them move farther away and almost out of sight, I noticed two other sets of lights, each sets coming from the opposite direction, and joining the three lights on each side of them.  They appeared to somewhat slow down as they they lined up side by side, and suddenly they bolted away at an extremely high rate of speed and disappeared from my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the other two sets of lights came in to view, I excitedly yelled to my group; &#34;Oh my Gosh! Did you see that?  What was it? Did you see it?  What was that?  I can&#39;t believe I just saw what I saw..  My wife was less than two steps in front of me with our two grandchildren on each side of her, and my son and his cousin was less than two steps in front of my wife.  From my point of view, it appeared they also was witnessing what I was seeing, and hearing all of what I was say- ing.  But as I continued to excitedly ask them what this was, my wife faced me and asked what I was talking about.  My son and his cousin did not see or hear me also.  The other groups of people who were walking close by did not speak up or acknowledge any of my conversation, and some were less than five yards of me.  There was some noise in the background, the game was just ending, people cheering, band playing and the loudspeaker was still in operation.  Also, these lights did not make a sound as they passed over.  I initially tried to convince myself these three lights were just spotlights in the sky, only, these lights did not have a beam of light eminat- ing from the ground to them, and they also seemed to be moving independently-not fixed or attached to each other, even though they kept their distance from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived at my home around 10:35 or 10:45PM, I called the local ABC, CBS, FOX &amp; NBC television stations to see if there were any reports of strange lights in the sky, and there were none.  I also called the local airport (Harrisburg International Airport) and they also had no reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even though I did not get any validation that this occured, I KNOW what I saw, and there will be no convincing me otherwise..  I would be willing to submit to a lie detector test to validate my sighting...<n>

At approx. 10 degrees above the horizon I viewed a light in the WSW sky.  I called a co-worker to look at the light.  The light was amber in color, very similar to the mercury vapor street lights that are common.  The intensity was about twice the yard light of a ranch that is five miles from our location.  However the size of the light was three to four times larger and did not vary in intensity for the duration of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We viewed the light and noticed that it was moving.  It was moving very slowly and without deviation from whatever &#34;course&#34; it was on.  The general movement could have been east to west, but from our perspective, it looked as if the light was descending.  We observed this light for at least five minutes.  Our observation was with naked eye and with 10X binoculars.  We could not discern any shape to the object, just a &#34;light.&#34;  We observed this object until it went into obscura over the horizon, at around 250 degrees azimuth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We considered what it may have been, and agreed that it was not a conventional aircraft, nor a celestial body.  The only possible conventional explanation we could determine from our sighting was that it was possibly a satellite reflecting the sun.  Though other obvious satellites we have seen did not have the same color of light, nor did they reflect light so consistently or so long to our respective position as this object may have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses have a combined experience of 70 years in ground radar, satellite tracking, and working with military aircraft.<n>

I reluctantly followed her outside and she proceeded to try and show me two things or objects flying way up in the sky one after the other. It was difficult to see them as she told me that they weren&#39;t any sort of known aircraft. I was finally after a couple of minutes able to see them and instructed her to continue watching them as to I was going to get my camera. I ran back into our apartment and got my Canon 5D camera and switched lenses to a 70 to 200mm zoom to attempt to get a shot of them. I used the automatic settings on the camera to insure I did get some quick results if possible. Once back outside I did see them for a second time and proceeded to take a few photographs of each object. The first photograph was taken at 17:47. Neighbors of ours saw me run outside of our apartment with my camera and decided to follow me to see what was going on. They too saw the objects. Our position here in Santa Ana California was on Main St between Mac Arthur and Dyer Road just south of Alton Drive. We were facing due north looking up at about 60 degrees. The two objects flew from east to west across the sky until they disappeared. They each passed behind a high overhead cloud and then came back into view before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

NY stock market hours) and decided to go outside and walked out towards LAX which is directly next door to the South. The weather was impeccable approaching 80 degrees and very sunny and crystal clear skies. I crossed the street and went East on a small street that looped behind the local neighborhood HS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the barren street curved around back of the school I noticed an LAPD (airport police) car with one officer parked facing the same direction I was now walking (North). I passed him on the sidewalk. Continuing my walk I was looking up and noticed the typical air traffic headed East in the usual daytime flight path for approach to LAX from over the water. Suddenly I see what appear to be two large white spherical helium balloons revolving around each other in a jerky manner that I considered odd since the breeze was about 5mph from the South. They appeared low over the rooftops. I continued to watch the objects and they seemed to stop their Westward movement and began to slowly rise. They appeared to be below 1000 ft. when first spotted because I could clearly see the jet traffic well above it. The object(s) continued slowly rising in the northern sky about 30degrees from zenith still doing this strange revolving movement. I watched them rise until they were at least 30,000 feet because they were well above the air traffic at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About this time the LAPD car which was almost a block behind me decided to move on. As he passed me I pointed to the sky and pointed to what was by now a very small spec in the sky. He eventually found it and then I described what I saw. He looked at me like he didn’t know what to think and I said so long.

It took us 20 minutes from home to get there.  Then 30 minutes into our fishing my boyfriend was talking to me and my daughter about Catfishing, when all of a sudden he shouted out loud LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, pointing to something behind me.  I was a bit scared but me and my daughter both looked back.  Thats when we all saw 2 red lights slanted side by side on top of a mountain that was probably 5 miles away.  But these red lights look like a couple of Jellyfishs.  It stayed lite for 5 seconds then it just disappeared. We we&#39;re all shock because that is something we never saw before.  Two hours past and within that time we kept talking about the sighting.  But we also looked at all the stars in the sky that night hoping we would see more.  But didn&#39;t.  It was getting cold after those two hours so we decided to head on home. We we&#39;re headed towards the main dirt road but had to stop and open the gate to it.  That&#39;s when my boyfriend opened it and had my daughter drive up a bit to close it after.  My daughter parked it and looked back to the pond which is now towards the left side.  The second she turn, she shouted out loud LOOK MOM LOOK.  Thats when we both saw a orange football shape light right on top of  the pond we were   fishing.  The pond was only 2 minutes away and this light was 30 ft. in the air from the pond.  I was completely scared at this point me and my daughter were shouting to my boyfriend to hurry.  This was light was very close and big.  Like the size of my mom&#39;s dodge caravan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Odd formation of three. I saw simular balls of light  yesterday that I could not explain so I watched at night near the same time. These lights were simular, not as big or bright as yesterday. These formations only lasted seconds compaired to yesterdays 30 minutes. I have no explanation. It started with one ball of light, then another spaced close together followed by a third light. All lights were white. Then they again went out in the same order they appeared. Then they reappeared about 30 miles away in the same fashion but not a straight line. It was more angled. Then that group went out and it reappeared over the radio tower. First one light then a second to the left of it and then a third over the top of the first to shape a triangle. Then it all went out. It did not reapear. My husband and my 14 yr. old son were present.  I have contacted the local paper to see if anyone else has seen anything. I have gotten no response. During the night the lights apear in small groups but during the day looking at the distance it covers, the object must be huge. I can&#39;t imagine that someone else has not seen this. Nellis Air Force Base is about 120 miles to the south of our location. If they are doing testing of some kind I do not know what kind of technologigal aircraft could move and this speed, at the distance and angles I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared small, and grew larger and brighter before abruptly dissapearing with a few small &#34;sparks&#34; doing the same off to the side.  It covered about 10 &#34;feet&#34; of sky in such a small amount of time that it was basically a flash.  It was traveling horizontally with a slightly downward angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I and the other witness, sitting in a car, first thought that it might be a flare or other firework, but we agreed that it moved too fast for that.  Also, it appeared high in the sky and moved horizontally, so it more than likely didn&#39;t come from the ground.  It very closely resembled a meteor, except that it was much larger and brighter.  If this object WAS a meteor, it would have had to have been much larger than a house when it hit the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As previously stated, both witnesses were sitting in a moving car.  I was looking through an open side window, and the person in the passenger seat saw the object through the windshield.  Also, there were no other objects in the sky except the stars.<n>

She has a 3.6 GPA and is a very bright, mature girl.  She has no prior experience with UFO&#39;s and has been a bit skeptical of them. She is not one to make up story. Tonight, she left class at approximately 19:35 p.m EST.  I called her cell phone as I often do to determine her time of arrival for dinner. When she answered my call, she was extremely upset and crying.  She stated that when she pulled onto North Abbe Road (heading North) in Elyria, OH there was a very large oblong object in the sky that was gray in color and had red and white flashing lights.  The object appeared to be sitting still and was not very high in the sky.  She was nearly hysterical.  I talked to her from my cell phone to her cell phone her entire drive home.  When she arrived home she was still very upset and crying.  I asked why she was so scared.  She couldn&#39;t explain why, she just kept saying I couldn&#39;t understand.  She almost immediately went to sleep which is highly unusual.  To type this report, I checked her cell phone log of recent calls for the time of the incident; however, the call is not logged in her cell phone.  Finding this more than a bit odd, I then went to my cell phone and the call to her cell phone is clearly logged.  The call lasted 10 minutes and 35 seconds.  For the record, I am a professional business person.  I am convinced she saw a UFO.  My daughter would not make this up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I dismissed his request, and continued to work.  He called for me again, and he pointed to the sky where I saw what appeared to be a fireball on the end of a rope.  As it fell closer to the house, I began to back up for fear it was going to fall onto our driveway.  Then I got a glimpse of what it really was.  It was a boomerang shaped craft with an exhaust/light coming out of one end.  It appeared to be in trouble.  It appeared to be free falling until the light/flame on the opposite side of the craft re-engaged.  It stopped falling, and resumed it&#39;s altitude.  At that point it moved very quickly to the left, then it propelled itself forward and was out of sight in a matter of seconds.  It was faster than any object I had ever witnessed.  I saw the craft and it seemed to be clear or mirror-colored, that is that it looked like it was covered with a mirror like finish which made it look camoflauged.  After it left, I immeadiately went back inside with my son and asked him to draw what he had seen, as I drew what I saw.  He is only four, but our pictures matched.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I work a part-time job, in a small city. It&#39;s sort of a one in a million chance that anybody will ever see something that they might think was a U.F.O. in their lifetime. I have been extremely lucky enough to have had more than two strange sightings of lights in the sky in my lifetime, so far, and had never given thought to reporting any of them, until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, my girlfriend and I were leaving a friend&#39;s house, and we both happened to catch a glimpse of something just above the roof tops across the street. In the distance, if not just within the city limits, just outside the border, there was a glowing red light flying not too high in the sky. It was pulsating at a slow, random pace. The red light would slowly fade from bright red, to orange, to yellow, and white, then then start all over again. We do have a local airport a few miles outside of town, so usually I dismiss lights in the sky right away, thinking they belong to a small plane on it&#39;s way to the little airport. But we waited to see if the object would reveal any blinking lights that would give away the fact that it was only a small airplane, which it did not. Instead, after about two and a half minutes of observing the pulsating object in the sky, it disappeared just before it would have vanished behind some massive trees in our sight. It went from red, to orange, to yellow, and then it was gone, as if the light itself just turned off. We waited a minute longer to see if it would pop up again on the other side of the trees, but it never did. After that, my girlfriend and I got in my car and drove out to the edge of town, which wasn&#39;t that far, to see if we could spot it leaving, but there was nothing. Not even airplanes from the local airport, or commercial airliners. It was just stars in the night sky. About ten minutes later, I called my friend, where we had just left, and told him about the sighting. He then walked outside, and witnessed at least three “shooting stars” toward the same area the object was headed, within a couple of minutes time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I had no means to record this sighting. I do have my own camcorder, but it was at home, and I had my phone on me, which has a video recording device built into it, but it wouldn&#39;t pick up anything that faint and distant at night time. Normally I would only share a story like this with friends, but this sighting was just too bizarre to keep to myself. I thought maybe if I sent this story to you tonight, someone else who could&#39;ve possibly seen the object might write to you, or someone else about it. I do not expect a response from this report. Either way, I know what we saw, and it wasn&#39;t an airplane. Maybe now I will learn to always keep my camcorder on me, so that one day, I may contribute a good piece of evidence to the ever growing library of U.F.O. videos. It&#39;s just being in the right place, at the right time.<n>

When I turned around, facing east, I saw an object in the sky behind our home. I watched it, traveling south east, for about 30 seconds before the tree line blocked my view. The craft looked like a perfect square with four rectangular lights, one centered at each corner. It had framework outlining the bottom that resembled that which stage lights hang from. The object was charcoal in color and traveled point forward like an arrow. I couldn&#39;t make out any other details on the bottom nor could I see its top. I came inside sat down and started to draw a picture of what I&#39;d seen while it was fresh in my mind. My first thought of its size was about 60&#39;square after trying to sketch it to scale I realized it had to be bigger to look like what I saw. After the completed drawing I estimated it to be 100&#39;square and the framework to be 8&#39; across. This area is located less than 30 mile from Fort Knox Ky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We live in a drainage just west of Missoula, MT.  When we took our little dog out for her last potty call, we were both facing west when a single, steady brilliant white light came over the ridge in front of us.  I would estimate it was no more than 1,000 feet above our heads since it just cleared the ridgetop.  There was no sound, it wasn&#39;t going super fast, it came directly toward us easterly, and when it got just past my head it simply blinked out like a light and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried desperately to see the structure of a craft, but the white light was so intense, it was like trying to look at the sun and I could only take blinking glances.  I was unable to see any shape behind the light at all. We got the impression that once it &#34;saw&#34; us, it just poofed and was gone.  All of this was in a span of about 3 or 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimated that the craft/light was abut 20 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was as if a plane were overhead, but it was so peculiar - so unlike any plane I&#39;d ever heard - I had to step outside. My dogs were going crazy trying to get out the back screen door, scratching and barking. I let them out and walked a few steps under my gazebo, confused, and then I saw it, partly obscured by the top of the structure. It was bright blue and flashing lights of some sort. I wasn&#39;t sure if there were more than one - I saw it for an instant. There may have been an abduction - another dog barking in the background stopped suddenly after a flash of light. Then suddenly as I stepped out to get a better view, it lingered for an instant and suddenly vanished as if by magic. The noise, however, did not stop.<n>

NOT A PLANE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family was outside on our deck. The sun had gone down about 45 minutes earlier.It was a beautiful cool autumn evening. We had been looking at the stars. We  saw a strange large and very bright light to the southwest of our town. At first it was one light that got brighter as seconds passed. From the first ball of light came a second ball of light, equally as bright. From the second ball of light came a third ball of light equal distance from the other two, equal brightness. From the third ball of light came a fourth, same exact distance and brightness. The brightness became brighter kind of like a filament in a lightbulb. Then they shut off in the same order that they appeared. This happened a few times and then it was dark. They reappeared as groups of two in a distance of atleast 40 miles from the first sighting within 20 to 30 seconds.  When the lights went out, the lights reapeared at the first location in a group if two. The lighting group became brighter until it reached the full brightness, then shut off. The location switched back and forth for aporximatley 25 to 30 minutes. What we saw, if it was all connected groupings was atleast one mile long. I am not a good judge of height at night. The best way to explain it would be if you see one of the first low evening stars in the sky it was between that star and the ground level. We have no idea what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He questioning me and pointing upward in the sky asked.. &#34;what in the world is THAT?&#34;  I looked up to see a triangular craft flying overhead   It had five dim whitish lights on it. It was traveling in a SE direction at a VERY high rate of speed at a pretty low elevation.  I witnessed this event approx 5 seconds before the trees obscured my view.  My husband saw more detail than I re the lights - he saw it a few seconds longer , and will be sending you a sketch.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However, what I saw to night was either a blimp or something out of the ordinary.  I doubt there was a blimp flying over Maine tonight, and that is why I am reporting this.  The object was eithering hovering or flying at a snail&#39;s pace- too slow for a normal aircraft.  It was so bright that it must have been very close, thus movement was easy to judge (or lack thereof).  It appears to be one object, but it had two sets of lights. The configuration of the craft adds to my belief that it was something strange that I saw, but I cannot really describe that configuration here.  The lighting set up was not that of any typical aircraft (excluding a possible blimp).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One of my sons claims to have seen three small ships and one larger ship, while my other son (6) claims to have seen one large and one small one. All four kids came running home out of fear because they hadn&#39;t see anything like this before. The smaller ships were described as more &#34;pod like&#34; by my oldest son and his friend. The larger ship was described as a &#34;battle ship&#34; and was much larger than the other ships by all accounts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were described as &#34;50 oak trees&#34; high by my son -- so from his account I&#39;m estimating these were close to 500-1000 feet from the ground.  The smaller ships has three lights and the larger one had six lights. The lights were described as triangular on ships.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The small ships were were headed towards the larger ship, but had circled around the area &#34;looking for people&#34; according to my sons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The larger ship was described like a &#34;spear&#34; by my oldest son, while the other, smaller ships were more tear dropped shape.<n>
10/15/08 18:30|Loretto|TN|Oval|15 seconds|Craft seen coming through clouds at 45-dgree angle and then jetting off at another 45-degree angle.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66505.html|309|ndxe200810| Craft seen coming through clouds at 45-dgree angle and then jetting off at another 45-degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 15th, 2008 just after sunset at approximately, 6:30p.m. (18:30) I was having a conversation with my family and friends in our living room. From my vantage point, (on sofa looking through the rear door out onto our deck facing south, southeast) I witnessed an extremely large oval shaped object punch through a low deck of thick clouds. This object traveled somewhat slowly for about five seconds at a 45-degree angle towards the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I didn’t know what I was seeing and jumped from the sofa expecting that an enormous military craft was going to crash many miles away. I say this because I’ve never seen anything this giant in the sky before. To me, it appeared to be as large as an aircraft carrier and moved with that kind of ‘heaviness’ or ‘substance’. It was big, oval perhaps. Once on my feet my family reacted by asking what I was looking at and I replied that I really didn’t know, but to stay there…in case there was about to be an explosion. By this time…a few seconds later, I was throwing open the back door and was on the deck. I never lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft began to speed up somewhat, crossed behind a tree close to me obscuring it for maybe a second. Once it cleared the tree (the tree was in my yard,..not far away as the craft seemed to be) the craft stopped mid-flight…just stopped. If there were humans in that thing,…they would have turned to jelly. Then there was a flash of the reddest, red I’ve ever seen and it shot off to the horizon like a lightning bolt. This final movement was at another 45-degree angle to its angle of descent. It was a relatively clear evening with some low cirrus clouds…just before twilight. I have never witnessed anything I couldn’t identify in the sky in my life. I am an avid amateur astronomer and am familiar with objects that appear in the sky…day and night. I am also a professional photographer and have never witnessed or photographed the color ‘red’ that the craft emitted before it jetted off. None of my family saw the thing and that’s why I have not reported it. I know with no proof of fact,..it’s just a story. Yet, my family and friends DID see my reaction to it and they can tell you I’ve not moved that quickly in years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I report this now is that my wife just read today about some sightings in Stephenville, TX. I watched the amateur video footage and saw something that resembled that color ‘red’ in the lights that were recorded. My wife requested me to report what I’d seen. Hope this helps,  Scott Palmer<n>

I heard no sound and saw no lights or exhaust.  Wind conditions, at least on the ground, were dead calm.  I should mention that I live about 5 miles from Miramar MCAS.

I was going down I-15, when I noticed a huge jet going NE.  It looked like a 747, to me.  As I watched it, I noticed something unsettling.  The jet was pure white, with no markings anywhere, whatsoever.  I was looking for a Presidential seal actually, because Bush was a lame duck, and I thought he might be sneaking in a trip to Zions National Park, which is a short drive from Cedar City.  However, the longer I looked at the jet, the weirder things go.  I mean, it was only about 200 feet up, traveling below the line of a mesa...and, it was going about 50-75 miles per hour, AT MOST.  Also, it should be noted that the local airport there was (A) not in the area of the jet, and (B)it just looked like it was FLOATING, not flying.  It made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am posting this, as I read of someone on your site who saw something very similar.  I continued to watch it...then, thought it may be a good idea to watch where I was going.  I looked up again, and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was absolutly flabbergasted.  I know a jet when I see one, and they are usually higher than 200 feet, and they usually fly more than 50 mph, don&#39;t they???<n>

Before Culver exit, I glanced to the west and briefly saw a nearby tilted disc hovering directly over the northern part of Irvine&#39;s Preservation Area. Disc appeared reasonably large - maybe 40 feet in length, but viewing perspective made it appear very thin. The disc appeared to be very &#39;real&#39; and solid in nature; I did not see any form of glowing or radiation of bright color. Object was gray/brown - I believe. It was hovering and completely/effortlessly static. Notably, it was tilting distinctly to its southernmost side. I viewed the object from the freeway, but could not alert my wife&#39;s attention to it quickly enough before a freeway bridge and trees obscured it from my view. I pulled off the Culver exit and drove west over the freeway to attempt a better view, feeling sure that we would be able to view something explainable, but the object was no longer visible. I often question if I had actually seen the object, but cannot account for how I could imagine the length, flatness and angular titling of the disc if I had indeed been confused or subject to some kind of illusion. Date and precise time are approximate, since I could not substantiate the sighting with other witnesses and questioned the &#39;reality&#39; of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The ball moved in all directions, as well as stood still for long periods of time, before making a decent (what had to be less then a few hundred feet), and disappearing. NO other colored lights were seen on the object, and it stood out considerably as the brightest thing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object appeared to be spinning.   I was lying on a lounge chair facing west and looking toward the sky when I first observed the object coming from the north.   The northern horizon is not visible from our house due to large trees in the neighborhood.   I observed the object first as it came into view in the sky above the trees obstructing my view of the northern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not good at judging altitude, but I would guess that the object was at least a couple thousand feet in the air.  We live eight miles southeast of the Louisville International Airport.   The object did not come from the airport and was not going there-it was not in any kind of a holding pattern, and it was moving too fast to be a plane.   It was too high to have taken off from or to be landing at the Louisville International Airport.    I could not hear any noise from the object, but due to the constant drone of the traffic on my street and on nearby Bardstown Road, it is likely that any noise the object was making was drowned out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was completely clear, and the moon was full.  Visibility of the nighttime sky is never good in my neighborhood.  We live two blocks from a major Louisville thoroughfare, Bardstown Road, and the city lights make spotting even any of the constellations difficult.  Despite the completely clear sky, few stars were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching the object move across the sky, my wife opened the kitchen window and asked me what I was doing.  I asked her to come outside.  She and my 15 year old daughter came out on the deck as the object was nearing the southern horizon.  They also observed the object and were unable to identify what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be interested to learn if anyone else in the Louisville area observed this object.<n>

At approx. 9 p.m. a series of lights began to appear in the sky over the water.  They appeared white/yellow in color.  The lights changed in their intensity, shape, size, direction, and movement.  There were periods of time when no lights were visable.  When the lights reappeared they were not in the same location, although in the same general vicinity as previously seen.  The lights produced no apparent sound.  Nor was there any apparent physical structure around the lights.  There was a full moon which brightly lit the area.  The lights did not reflect off the water, nor did they emit any beam, or surrounding glow.  The lights were observed over an approximate 2 hour period of time off and on for very brief durations at least 5 or 6 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The moon was full and extremely bright because there was no cloud cover. When I was approaching the Williamston exit I notice two lights in the sky. I assumed that they were just landing lights from a commercial airliner, but as time passed I realized that it wasn’t moving towards me, but hovering in one spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s hard to recall how high up it seemed to be, but it made me think of how a helicopter would hover when doing a traffic report. I rolled down my window to see if I could hear anything from it, but there was no sound that I could tell. If it had been an airplane or a helicopter at that altitude it would have definitely been heard. After I passed underneath it, I noticed that it had begun to move off fairly quickly in the opposite direction. It seemed to me that other people on the road had witnessed this as well because some drivers were slowing down, and some were even pulling off the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three extremely bright blue-white lights on the front tip and on the end of each &#34;wing.&#34; There were also no hints of metal on the object.  Since the moon was very bright I would assume that it would have reflected off the surface, but all I saw was a black mass.  Its shape was a little hard to explain.

We were heading North, so we would have seen the objects in a easterly direction from where we were. We were on a long, dark road, and there were no other cars around. I immediately told my cousin to pull the car over, and we watched the objects for about 2 minutes before they disappeared. It didn’t seem like they flew away, they just vanished. While we were watching the objects, they seemed to stay in an ellipse formation, but one of the globes tended to move around. While we were on the road, we pulled over in front of a house and observed these globes at about a 45 degree angle. Although upstate NY is very hilly, the area we were at was surrounded by fields, and we could see forever. There is no doubt in my mind that this/these objects were in the sky and not on the ground. The objects in the sky were red, or giving off a red glow, were it was the most red on the outer part, and it seemed to get lighter in the middle of each little ball. Besides the red globes, we couldn’t make out a defined shape of object, just this little cluster of these 5-6 red balls. I don’t know if it was a coincidence or not, but as soon as we saw the objects, I tried to make a phone call, and my phone wouldn’t work. The area always has service, so it wasn’t a dead spot, but my phone wouldn’t connect. The sky was very clear that night, and the moon seemed to light up everything. Central NY seems to be a high traffic area for airplanes, as they are seen flying over all the time, and at the time we saw this, there were a few planes in the air. There is no possibility that what we saw was an airplane.  These red balls were much bigger that any plane lights could have been, and based on the distance we approximated, there is no way a plane could be that big or move like they did. Although it didn’t seem like the whole group was moving, like I said earlier, it seemed like one of them w! as movin g.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We saw it for about 10 seconds. It was very low, lower then any other meteors witnessed in the past. My initial reaction was that it was possibly a meteor and we just dismissed it as such. However, 15 minutes later when we got to my house I noticed two black objects approaching directly under the almost full moon. As the objects got closer we noticed that they were black helicopters. We also noticed that they both had only a small red light on their undersides. They moved quickly over head and went west. It took me about twenty seconds to realize that they were heading in the same direction as the meteor like object that we saw just 15 minutes before. We put two and two together and concluded that the helicopters were probably looking for that object/meteor. We immediately got back into the car and tried to follow the helicopters but without success. This all occurred between 7 pm and 9pm. I did not look at my watch at the time.

Watched for about 10 seconds and at the split second it seemed to vanish it changed direction, almost a reverse motion, perhaps 145 to 160 degrees, and continued in a NW direction at the same rate of speed it had been traveling and then disappeared after about another 2 to 3 seconds.  Scatterd clouds in background but otherwise bright and sunny.  Saw the object clearly.  Appeared to have one or two vertical ribs in the upper half and possibly one horizontal rib in the lower half. Estimated speed 500 to 1,000 MPH but most difficult to guess the distance.  Appeared to be the size of a baseball but impossible to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Somewhere between 8:00 and 10:00pm I got up out of my seat and told my girlfriend the UFO is here(completely random, makes me wonder because 2 days before I felt the UPS man about to ring my doorbell, 30 seconds later my doorbell is ringing!)  We went out on my porch, and sure enough we saw a huge object near the moon.  The egg shaped craft seemed to blink colors, possibly green red yellow maybe some orange?  I took binoculars out of the house looked at the object again, and it was just too eerie, it seemed to have some black lines wrapped around the object.  Stars were visible that night, but this object just seemed impossible to be a star.  Clouds came in and blocked my view of the objects.  Everyday after that night I&#39;ve looked outside and have seen nothing like this object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared as 25 to 50 lights.  The peculiarity of it was that they resembled stars but I could tell they were flying in unison up and around a larger object which I could not see, but the way the star-like objects were flying around, it outlined a larger craft. I was so bewildered that I went over to my neighbors house and asked them to come see it. (a man and woman, ages 61 and 65, I am 36)  Neither of them could make out what it or they were. It was NOT anything we are capable of producing in a military sense. It lasted for about 10 minutes as they made their way eastwardly. They started north, migrated west then east and disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about a week later, a linear like silver line appeared in the same vacinity, breifly then disapeared. The next day, the very same thing. Then, tonight myself and that same neighbor lady went to the store and seen in the sky a very bright and radiant red streak in the sky which looked like a possible contrail accept, it was abnormally verticle in the sky. From our sight and distance it was about 3 inches. It disappeared along with the alleged contrail. There were no clouds in the sky, it was a clear sunset sky. It looked like a star-like object ahead of it flying upward. A contrail would have lasted longer in the sky, this just vanished! There is a lot of strange things going on the ksy around this area and I wanted to report it.<n>

I was talking to a fellow worker, he was sitting in the work pick-up truck on the driver side the truck and the door was opened. The truck was facing east and we were on the right hand shoulder. I was standing next to the driver door facing east as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what appeared to be a flash in the sky just a little to the right of me (2 o’clock). The flash wasn’t like a normal flash in the sky, i.e. lightning, or an explosion it was contained to a small portion of the sky. Then a bright star (in the same area of the flash) began to bulge and seem to be moving or stretching before I could wonder what was happening to the star a streak of brown came from the left of me (11 o’clock) it was like the streak you see when you’re watching a shooting star. The streak began just above us and to the north and turned into three very fast moving crescent shaped objects then swooped down heading south and turned to the south-southeast. The three objects were almost sliding through the curve in the same manner in which a race car slides around a corner. The objects were a brownish-orange and were shaped like a half moon or crescent with one black window in the middle of each side. The objects didn’t fly like a plane they were flying vertically. The rear of the object had a blackish circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were flying in formation: side by side, the two on the right had made a smooth curve and the one on the left came close to the one in the middle and had to swerve to avoid hitting him, it also increased the speed faster than the other two and pushed himself ahead as if playing a game with the other two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crafts seem to come from this weird electrical haze and left short gold orange trails behind them. The crafts disappeared as fast as they appeared and they also made no sound and had no lights. The craft were no more than 800 feet off the ground (very close). The whole thing lasted nearly 5 seconds, not even long of enough to fully comprehend what just happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It made a left turn and shot twice, the brightness of the flash illuminated up the entire inside of the craft. I am sorry I never reported this, I only thought... Hmm.... so they do exist. I have come to learn more about them. they come from the Ulosha, or Nebula behind the orions belt. they will be coming back if God calls them to. There is no blue beam, it will be all wicked. only purple and a blue at the bottom. If they shoot it in the atmosphere, the beam would split up a bit but nothing will stop it. I got images to display, please email me at Billyaguilar1@yahoo.com Please call me at 760 590 0840 as they have also sent other things to the earth.

Im estimating the distance from my location to be around two to three miles. It looked like they came from the area of Wapato, Wa. It looked like they twsiting and wobbeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were scattered horizontally behind the light signals, it looked like they were above Union Gap, Wa. a suburb of Yakima city. It looked like there was four but i could be wrong, one or two of them were fading in and out like mirrors twisting. The light turned green and i proceeded east on Nob Hill blvd until i got to the college parking lot areas turned off in a north direction and stoped, got out of my vehicle, looked up and then noticed there were more above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then got on to stewart, it is the first street that runs along side Nob Hill blvd on the north side it. I then went to my place which isnt very far from both those locations, after parking i got out then looked straight up, i then seen something that was much bigger and non metalic. It was odd shaped, looked sort of like a bunch of objects connected in a mass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hurried into my place and found one of my sets of binoculars, by the time i got side and back to that same location, i couldnt find it, so im thinking it was lower then i thought i seen. There are trees in this area all over, its hard to say what it did. I then looked for the other ones that i had seen before, on my way home. I did observe two of these metalic ones, to the north. They were very far away, and it looked like they were changing there direction back to the east, towards Selah, Wa. which is another suburb of Yakima, Wa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes of trying to identify these, they just disappeared, it was like they had split up and went up higher in oposite directions. The lower bigger one that was non metalic, im not sure where that one went. I was wearing sun glasses, up until that last few minutes, then i couldnt see them anymore. It seemed like these sun glasses helped me to see them better then with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This could have something to do with the light spectrum, it seemed like they were more shiny with the sun glasses on, when i took them off and looked i found it harder to respot them. This could be a hoax, even thou the lower jet stream usually goes in the opposite direction. One of these looked like it could have been a transparent weather ballon with an instrument hanging under it, another one almost looked like it was a parachute out of control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of these objects i cant explain, the big one disappeared, the other two that were metalic, they looked like smaller connected clusters making it look like one object. There could have been as much as six or seven objects, all doing different things. Its hard to say exactly what the sizes of these things where, i was able to spot them better, then a jet liner. I dont want to be contacted, i know you can find out who i am. Everything that i witnessed and reported about today is true and correct to the best of my ability.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

She spotted unusual white and/or amber lights and got my brothers attention.  They watched as hundreds of lights passed overhead, silent, in different shapes and sizes, some changed direction while others rotated effortlessly. They were transparent but were outlined with what appeared to be similar to rope lighting with uniform spacing.  They were heading from East to West and turned toward the Southwest.  They appeared to be about a mile in altitude.  Some seemed to be about a mile in circumference.  When looking through binoculars, I saw a craft that had wavy edges, another that looked like a backwards P.  We watched as they changed direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live near a park with flood lights.  A police helicopter flew overhead around 10:00 pm, and the stadium lights went out and we could not see any after they went out.  There were birds and bats flying around for comparison reference as well as cobwebs hanging from the stadium light posts.  These lights were not birds or debris. There were also airplanes in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From West to East 2 reddish orange circles came flying at a high rate of speed in the sky directly above my apartment.  They were almost side by side at first, then they came to almost a complete stop for about 3-4 seconds before moving apart from each other a great distance at a slow rate of speed.  After that they got really close to each other as if they were in sync and moved extremely fast (way faster then they flew in at first) to the east again and then slowed down before going into the tree line behind my apartments.  These objects were silent, no noise at all.  I have a very clear view of the sky from my balcony and have never witnessed anything like this in my life here.  I live about 5 miles Northeast of Detroit Metro Airport, in Wayne, Michigan.  There were numerous planes in the sky at this time of incident as I seen them all over after they disappeared.  This is a very high traffic area and is really close to a major airport for the United States (northwests main hub) so it should be on their radar reports somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

That object changed it&#39;s shape several times within a few seconds.It was not visible in the lens to me at the time. When I went to look at the pictures I could not see the stream on the hp image zone so I looked at the image with the picture tool feature that adds light. It showed a changing &#34;plasma&#34; type thing along the jet stream. I am emailing the original and the enhanced versions of these two images.I have a few more.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Last night while washing up and listening to my Ipod, a strange noise came out of the speakers&#39;. I thought this was odd as they aren&#39;t even wireless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then when I proceeded upstairs a relative told me &#39;The internet&#39;s gone out again&#39;. This does not usually happen, and it happened last time just after I filed the report to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rushed to the window, realising what was happening. And, not to my surprise; I spotted another UFO, just like my last one, flying across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing else happened, it dissapeared from view and I continued with my life. However, we got a phonecall which my other relative answered only to find no one on the other end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now- this is quite a common occurence and we all thought it was an internet machine trying to sell stuff, or get some sort of details&#39;.

I ran out in the yard, and it was dark at this time.  We saw an orange light, maybe 1,000 to 1,500 feet up in the air.  It was very slow-moving.  It looked like a Roman Candle fireball, but it was too high up, too bright, and too slow.  It seemed to stop at certain points, and proceed toward in the direction that the Narrows Bridge is in.  What was strange was that the craft seemed to backfire several times, or it was shooting little sparks or flames.  We could see these fall down from the craft.  As it got further from our sight, it appeared to pick up speed.  It lingered about 5 minutes or more.  I still couldn&#39;t find my camera in time.  We lost sight of it in a blanket of clouds.  It was unnerving.  My husband is a full-time laborer, I am a part-time retail clerk, our two children are 9 and 7.  As we were watching it, a neighbor came out and saw it, too.  He just stood there, quietly.  We are fairly new to the neighborhood, and don&#39;t know our neighbors well enough to properly describe them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Commercial airliner performs extremely steep climb and then circles to apparently investigate .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving at about 55 mph on highway 690-east going by the NY state fairgrounds .  I noticed a commercial airliner performing an extremely steep climb which started fom a low altitude .  This caught my attention because I&#39;ve traveled this route my whole life and have never seen an airliner flying that low in this area .  The airport is on the other side of the city .  Anyway the terrestrial craft climbed till it was about an inch in size by my veiw .  It then leveled out and circled .  Thats when I suddenly noticed a cylinder directly above the centerpoint of the of the circular pattern that the plane was flying in .  This thing was just sitting there or hovering or whatever .  It was still higher in the air than the plane was .  If this object was the same size as the airliner, it would have been pretty high above the plane like a few thousand feet .  It looked like a polished silver beer can sitting on it&#39;s side .  With no writing or lable on it of course .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked away to share in the excitement with my girlfriend who was in the seat behind me and with my father who was driving .  I looked in the sky again about ten seconds since the last time I was veiwing and the object was nolonger there . Or just may not have been visible .  I do not recall seeing the plane either during this second look . My girlfriend witnessed all of this incident as well and I doubt that the plane got zapped away .  Just want to share this experience and see if anyone else reported this same incident to you guys or to the air traffic controllers at Hancock international airport .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanx for your time .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There were several potted plants on the front porch that we were taking to the cemetery. While I was loading the trunk of the car my wife was attracted to a moving object in the sky. She told me to look at it, but I have hearing problems and did not hear her. She said it was a cylindrical shaped object with a bulge in the center. Why she did not insist on me looking at it I do not understand because I could have easily obtained photos at that time. The object was vertical and she could not determine the altitude. It was moving slowly from the north. It did not have a glow at this point. We entered our car and left for the cemetery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving east on East Luzerne avenue in Larksville, PA.  Coordinates (41°16’27.52”N) by (75°55’07.68”W) (Our location) I looked to my left through the open window and saw a flying object and immediately told my wife to look at it. It appeared to be 20’ in length and was cylindrical in shape and moving horizontally. That is when she told me that she saw the vertical object in the sky when we were in our front yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was bright silver (unpainted like shinny stainless steel) and had no visible windows, doors or wings although it seemed a little wider at the back and less in the front and had some contour. It was silent and was traveling at about 50 mph. Very slow for a craft this size to stay aloft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a blue white circular glow at the rear of the object that was twice the diameter of the craft being so bright you could not tell were the craft ended. The glow looked as if the sun was hitting a mirror and reflecting at us, the only apparent means of propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be 200 ft high at this point and descending. It was between us and a small mountain range. The elevation of the northern horizon at that point is 340m and our elevation was 215m. The distance to the horizon from our location was approximately 800 meters. I could see the detail of the craft clearly and at our line of sight it was slightly above the horizon so I estimate the distance of the craft to be 200m or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling east and was obscured by the trees for several seconds At this point I believe it was no more than 100 ft. above the ground. It reappeared about ½ miles away. It flew over the boroughs of Larksville, Courtdale, Luzerne, Forty Fort, and due east until it was out of sight. The last thing being visible was the bright glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total time of this sighting was approximately ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Co-ordinates and some elevations were obtained by using Google earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I started to record them as they went into a V shape and came to a stop.  They held this position then formed into a line. The objects then started to form together and get brighter.  They then just disappeared and where gone in seconds.

My cousin and I were taking a walk.  I happened to look up at the clouds and that’s when I saw it.  There was a metallic silver saucer moving slowly through the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly told my cousin to look up.  And sure as heck, I wasn’t imaging it. He saw it too.  I quickly took out my phone to try and get a picture, but right when I pushed “TAKE” the UFO disappeared into a cloud bank.  It looked as if it sped up to get away or something.  Later that morning, I was doing something in the living room and looked out the window.  There moving slowly across the sky was the same looking UFO that my cousin and I had seen a couple hours earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figure it was probably the same UFO craft we’d seen two nights earlier. We had been watching a movie and glanced out the window.  Slowly moving over our yard was a torpedo shaped figure with glowing lights.  The lights were red, yellow, and green.  It was too close to the ground to be a plane.  Besides, there was no noise at all.  It took about one minute for it to finally disappear over the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Onch it slowed down it made a sharp right then sharp left turn and then hovered above the city and the tree tops. The object appeared round with an orange color. It made an arch as it entered the atmosphere. There was only one vehicle noted.

It was well after dark between 8:00 and 9:00 PM.  As I was driving, I observed (at about the eleven-o’clock position on the horizon as I peered out the driver-side windshield) what looked like a very bright and low-hanging star.  It was positioned curiously and directly above a cellular tower.  It was much higher in the sky than the top of the tower, but what I remember was how directly above the tower that it was placed.  I began to watch it more closely.  It grabbed my attention, and I began to sense that it was just a little bit too large to be a star.  I observed this light for approximately 2-5 minutes, and it seemed to drift higher (not obviously noticeably) into the sky as I drove closer to the tower and I eventually passed the tower.  And then, as I was looking directly above at the light, it just blinked out and disappeared.  This was VERY unusual to me, and left me talking to myself in disbelief.  After I saw that, I said to myself that for the first time in my life, I had really seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very short time after this event, I noticed another light which appeared larger and lower to the horizon, and it was located directly to my right, out through the passenger window of my pickup.  I had an even stranger sense that it was something not normal due to its size and location.  It was like it just appeared out of nowhere.  It also appeared like a giant star, and much too close to the horizon to be so, and gave me a weird feeling—like it was menacing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A short time later, while still watching the light to my right, I could see two or three lights up in the two-o’clock position (through the passenger side upper corner of the windshield) and these were much higher than the one on my right.  At this time, it became too dangerous to try and drive and look at all of these lights, so I pulled over to a well-light service station and got out of my vehicle to try and take some photos with my blackberry (which were inconclusive—lights too small and too far away.)  By this time (approximately 15-minutes since I first saw the light over the cell tower) the largest light to my right had gone away, and I was observing the 2 of 3 remaining lights high above from outside my truck.  One started blinking and moved off, almost like the speed and distance of a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw nothing else similar to these lights for the rest of my drive home, and arrived in Houston on time around 10:00 pm that Saturday night.<n>

As I gazed out over Long Island sound, looking southeast toward Port Jefferson, NY, I noticed 6 bright lights hovering over the Port Jefferson area. The lights resembled glowing orbs, and appeared to be about 500 feet above the horizon. These orbs were fading and then glowing, moving up and down, and from side to side. I watched for over 1 hour as the orbs lined up to change position to set up different formations. After about 1+1/2 hours, 3 of the orbs faded and disappeared from view. The remaining 3 orbs formed a straight line, and then 1 more also faded from view. After about 20 minutes, the last 2 lights faded away as well, leaving a clear sky, and only the stars remained.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was clear and visibility good. I noticed a white light moving from the northwest towards the east. I first thought it was a satellite, but soon noticed it was much larger and brighter than any satellite I have ever seen. It was brilliant white, brighter and larger than Venus which was also visible in the southern sky. The light’s speed was similar to a high altitude commercial aircraft, and it changed it course slightly several times while I watched, finally arcing towards the southeast. I watched the light until it disappeared in the distance. The light’s brightness remained constant for the duration of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Plus a history of sightings, strange behavior/time loss and possible abduction aged 3-4.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking home admiring the sunset and the beautiful clouds. I had calmed down over what I&#39;d seen two weeks ago, and didn&#39;t expect to see anything anytime soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about to cross a road when I saw something strange very very high up, up above the high atmosphere clouds. It was a long cylinder, perfectly white. I thought at first that it was an airplane making a trail, but as it came out from above the clouds, the &#39;trail&#39; suddenly stopped and the end of it moved with the front... and I realized it was a cylinder shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had to be huge- it was almost three centermetres long from my standing spot but it was very much above the storm clouds as they grew. It was white, didn&#39;t reflect the sunset like the clouds did, and I only watched it for a few minutes before it went over another big cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was heading into the wind direction, though I don&#39;t know if it had wind that high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Compared to the last sighting, this one was peaceful. I got the impression that it was indifferent to me, it knew I had seen it but didn&#39;t care either way. It was very big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can submit drawings of it but I had no camera on me.<n>

I could not see a shape to the object it was a pitch black shape form like a house it looked like the stars but it was glidding up above the houses toward and above my home area.I did not hear any noises from the object.

It was moving at a pretty good rate and flying lower than a small airplane would. The bottom of the &#34;UFO&#34; looked like it was on fire, it was bright orange in color, moving from the South East heading North West, after a minute or so it just dissapeared. We left the parking lot and on my way home I spotted it again and followed it west bound for a half hour or more. I would get close to it and then it would appear to move faster and be far away again , the whole time it was very visible to me and still looked like a burning ball of fire it would change altitude frequently and moved from the left to the right. I followed it until I was in Indiana and it was still heading West flying pretty low to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was very close to us I would say around 500 feet. Also on a side not my wife has observed this same type of UFO 3 time before this in a 2 year span. She saw it twice near HWY 30 near Fair Oaks and the other time was in Cottage Grove. We just thought it was a jet or something but after I saw it myself and didn&#39;t hear anything or see any blinking lights and as fast as the UFO moved it made me a believer and i still don&#39;t know what to think. I surprised no one else saw anything on John Nolen. I thought it would be in the news it was so obvious. The event took about 20-30 seconds and just vanished. I cant describe it well but if i were to take a laser pointer on &#34;scribble&#34; on the wall thats how fast it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else saw this please post! so i know my wife and I are not going crazy!<n>

My wife said &#34;look honey look, what is that?&#34; When I looked up I saw a disk shaped saucer with a raised area in the middle, maybe for the pilots head/body. It was over a residential area moving right to left towards homes. It had no lights on at the time but it was close enough to see that it did have them. It flew too fast to be a helicopter but too slow to be a jet. were maybe 100 to 150 yards away from it but it made absolutely no sound. It was way too big to be a remote controlled toy, I would guess it was a one man craft. It looked like the classic saucer design from old alien movies. It was dark so it was hard to make out an exact color but I would say it was a dark metal gray. As far as size I&#39;d say it was 15-20 ft. in diameter. If you have any info on this I would love some feedback as Im not a UFO enthusiast and I have no explanation for this. Im %100 sure that what I saw was real. Like I said it was very close, VERY surreal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.

I was driving on Hershel Avenue in Hyde Park when I looked up and saw three orange and red objects that were round in the sky.  I said to my female friend “what is that.”   A few seconds later another one went by and another one followed closely behind.  My female friend said “stop the car I want to get out.”  With that I looked to see if there was a car behind us but nobody was on the road.  She got out and I also got out looking in the general direction of the objects.  There was no sound as they flew by.   They appeared to be 50 or 80 thousand feet in the sky and flying a low speed.  The sky  was clear and there was a moon with no wind.   The objects were moving from the east to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got back in the car and drove west.  In the distance we could still see the objects forming a circle and following each other in sequence.  They continue to glow a orange/red color and were spinning yet not moving very fast.  As we headed down Erie Avenue towards Hyde Park Square we could still see the objects then they vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got back to my female friend apartment we got out of the car and went down to the street level.  I looked to the east and saw one more object coming our way.  The object was smaller than the rest but had a red and orange glow.  There was no sound as it flew overhead at a slow speed.  Then a second later after it passed it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went into her apartment and called Lunken Airport but they didn’t see anything or heard of any reports.  Then we called local news stations, District Two Police and the Cincinnati Enquirer.  All the news agencies said they never heard of anyone else seeing anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the UFO Center to report my sighting and Mr. Peter Davenport answered the phone.  He told me to write down what we saw and we both needed to file a separate report to this agency.  Then Mr. Davenport said see if there is anything on the news about your sighting or if anyone else saw it.  The next day I looked in the papers, and looked at all the local news and there were no reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Hyde Park there is an observatory not far from where we first spotted the objects.  I fired an email to the head person there and they respond saying they had guests in the observatory that night but were looking in the direction of the moon.   The gentleman said that there may have been a meteor shower going on at the time or what we saw may have been space junk.  I have seen a meteor shower before, but the meteor past very fast overhead.   I never seen anything that was red and orange that looked like a ball of light flying a low speed.   It was very weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So far nobody has seen anything to my knowledge or nobody is saying anything.  We live about 60 miles south of Wright Patterson Air Force Base,  10 miles from Greater Cincinnati Airport and 5 miles from Lunken Airport.  We could not hear any sound from these objects so therefore they were not aircraft related.    We both saw them and I must say it was very interesting.<n>

They came and went in no pattern, flashed in and out for the whole time the train took to go by. They were circular and mostly white with maybe a hint of red to them.

I noticed a light in my backyard and my son and I both went to our sliding glass doors.  What we saw was incredible.  It was an oval shaped craft, completely immersed in a white blue light.  It looked like a single person (being) craft.  It was gliding slowly through our yard, and came within 10 feet of my house.  It was only 5 or 6 feet off the ground.  If we had opened the door we could have touched it. We watched as it cruised past our door, past next door and towards the break between the houses.  I ran to the front door waiting for it to reappear from the break but it never came out.  It had to have gone up.  There was absolutely no sound coming from it.  What was strange was that none of my neighbors claim to have seen it.  My husband must have dozed off because he didnt see it.  My son who was 25 at the time didnt believe in UFO&#39;s until that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I then saw my shooting star, but it lasted much longer than any normal shooting star. Then about ten seconds after the object disappeared, there was a strange noise that I couldn’t explain. Unfortunately no one else saw it, and it was flying fairly far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

10/10/08 20:00|Moon Township|PA|Unknown|2 minutes|unknown rectangular shaped aircraft with bright lights seen over Rt. 60 near Pittsburgh International Airport, definitely NOT a plane|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66171.html|382|ndxe200810| unknown rectangular shaped aircraft with bright lights seen over Rt. 60 near Pittsburgh International Airport, definitely NOT a plane<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was making my way home from work in Robinson Township at approximately 8 PM, and I was traveling north on Route 60 near the Pittsburgh International Airport. I travel this road everyday, taking it to school and to work. I am used to seeing airplanes fly right over the highway to come in for landings at the airport, which sits just off the highway. I also know what an airplane looks like when it is flying at night, and am aware of the blinking lights that an airplane has on its underside and on its wings. Tonight though, on my way home, something strange happened. I was coming up on the airport like I said, and I saw a very bright white light off in the distance to my left. I thought it was just an airplane that was on its way in to land, however; at times it seemed as if it wasn’t really moving at all. Like it was almost hovering off in the distance, but the lights were very bright, even with it being a ways off in the distance. I saw it began making its way closer and closer to the highway eventually, all the while still thinking that it was just an airplane. But once I traveled past the airport on the highway, I realized that it was coming it at such an angle that it couldn’t have been heading to the airport, because the airport was now behind me and this object was traveling perpendicular to the highway, not back towards the airport at an angle. As this object got closer to the highway, and was about to fly over the highway, I was making my way underneath an overpass and I was directly under the object and I looked up and knew immediately that this was no airplane, or any other aircraft that I have seen before in my life. It was traveling directly above the road that was the overpass and continuing to my right down that road over some trees. I believe it was Moon Clinton Road. It appeared to be rectangular, but also could have been a saucer shape, due to the brightness of the lights I could not tell. The best way I can describe its shape was maybe rectangular on the sides with roun! ded corn ers. It had very bright lights coming out of it. I became very frightened by it because I knew this was nothing I had ever seen before, and sped up. I looked away at the road, and when I turned back to look at it again, it was gone. I called 911 and reported it right away because I was freaked out by it, and knew it was not an airplane, and also due to its close proximity to the airport, I did not know if it was of any harm to anyone or any other aircraft. I thank you for taking the time to read my report, and hope that someone has an answer as to what this was that I saw tonight.<n>

I live within 4 miles of the Albany International Airport. Many  takeoff’s and landings come over my house, so I have a habit of looking up to watch the planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of  October  10, 2008  at approx 6 am, I went outside on my deck to have coffee and a cigarette. It  was still dark outside but to the east I could see the sky was beginning to brighten.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There had been  times at night when I would be out with the dogs and  had seen satellites  move across the sky.  This  morning as I sat there I could see to the North a bright light moving south. At first I just thought it to be a plane getting ready to land with its lights on. As it came closer  it was moving at a good rate of speed and seemed to accelerate quiet fast. When it got overhead, it took off light a shot for a short distance and stopped dead . It then took off  north east for a short time and then went south again, again accelerating for another short time and again stopped and turned back  and then went south again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s w hen I lost it in the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the beginning it appeared to be round in shape like a star, but when it was over head, it had more of  an oblong shape to it.

It sounded like jets flying over low and they continued for several minutes so I got up to looked outside. The jet noise was gone but I saw an oval shaped object high in the sky with a series of rotating/strobing lights on the bottom. I shut the door and went to get my glasses and when I opened the door again there was a huge V-shaped object, very low in the sky, huge, moving silently and slowly across the sky. Moving North to southwest directly over my backyard, then over my neighbor&#39;s house. I stared at it for several minutes. I was so scared I just shut the door again. I decided to open the door again and when I did, the other oval shaped thing was back in the same place in the sky and the V-shaped thing was gone. This happened this morning. I live near the Expressway but I have not heard of any news reports of anyone else seeing it. This V shaped thing looked as big as a warehouse or bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I will try to research and contact the trucking company I used to work for, to get the exact time that I was there. I do however remember intimate details of the craft that I saw. At about 4 am on this night, it was a clouded sky, as I pulled into the pilot travel center off of 10th street, next to the comfort inn. I began to park near the end of the lot on its north side. Something told me to look up and I did.  Above the cab of my truck about 50 to 75 feet up was a large saucer shaped craft.  I know it was not a hallucination, because it passed over a street lamp and the glow of the light illuminated a sort of upside down bowl depression on the bottom of the craft. I estimated its speed at around 5 - 10 mph moving in a northly direction. the craft was at least 100&#39; in diameter. with a row of small lights around the central bowl depression which had a lip on the bottom o! f the craft, on the outside of the lip of the bowl were about 10 or so lights spaced evenly.  There was no sound at all. I am terrible at drawing but I will try to get someone to work up a sketch of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do you know of anyone who saw anything similar around the time i did in the same place?  I will try to get back to you with more informaiton and a sketch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know if this was an abduction or not, but I have felt like it was without any explaination, I have no memories of dreams of the like<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

They live north of Stacy and South of North Branch proper, approximately half-way between. Just a mile or so east of Highway 35. They live out in the country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Woke up sometime during early morning hours on Oct 10, 2008 or late Oct 9, 2008. Around the edges of my front window blinds seemed very light and I thought it was morning. I looked at the blinds from bed for a minute or so. I fell back asleep, woke up some time later to see that all was dark outside, so it was obviously not morning. Looked out my side window blind to see one patch of what looked like fog about 50 ft away in the brush.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was curious about the light I had seen earlier, so I peeked out the front blinds. Saw a single bright diamond-shaped light suspended about 10 ft above my car, shining inside the front windshield. I watched it for about 30 seconds. Couldn&#39;t tell if there was any object there as my niece&#39;s garage was blocking my view where I couldn&#39;t see anything else but the light. I got up and walked in the dark to the large windows upstairs, but the light was gone. I went down to the front door and noticed light coming out from around the door that leads into the garage. The garage door seemed to be moving or making noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was frightened so ran back down into my bedroom and locked the door. Was able to eventually go back to sleep - not believing this incident was real I guess. I swear I was awake through all of this. I asked my nephew-in-law the next morning if they have motion-sensor lights on their garage; they don&#39;t. He said he was up during the night but if I remember right he said he had not been in the garage.<n>

I have to know what it was because it was an incredible sight we witnessed. It was very large and I know that the two of us could not have been the only ones that saw it.

I noticed what I thought was a plane flying lower than the other two planes I had seen in the sky and it was also moving at a slower speed.  After watching for about a minute it dropped straight down out of my view into the hills.  It had a red, blue and an amber colored light and was in a triangle/circular pattern.  It dropped at such a fast speed the lights left a trail for a second.  I expected to see a possible explosion or smoke from a crash because I have never seen something drop at that rate of speed from the sky.  Once the object went out of site I did not see it again.

Please see below.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> From 9:46PM until 10:22PM, 2 unidentified objects were witness by myself seemingly &#34;dancing&#34; in the cloud covered night skies.  These 2 objects were circular, with lights ringing the outside perimeter of their circumference.  Their movement was eratic, ranging from hovering, to then quickly darting about while flipping and rotating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the objects flipped in abrupt directional changes, the top of the disk appeared to be a dark metallic.  The lights surrounding the craft would ocassionally flash brightly.  It appeared as if the objects were ringed with 8 white lights, and 1 larger red one; which by watching the movements of the objects, would indicate being the &#39;front&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were visible this entire time just barely under the low slung clouds.  They would dart in and out of the cloud cover, and then stay for extended periods below the clouds.  It appeared that their relative distance from the observers did not change that much, only altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photos will be forthcoming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observers were:  Myself:  Corporate President My Girlfriend:  Mathematics Teacher  (Irvine High School) Neighbor:  Custom Home Developer Neighbors Wife 2 Visiting Relatives of Neigbors 1 Other new neighbor, apprx 25 yrs of age, name and occupation unknown<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparently, this report is in all likelihood a false alarm.

However, the are reasonably certain that this is probably the source of our observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the late hour, I will not press my neighbors to compile the photos and video tonight, however, will retain the information awaiting you verification of this mundane event.

Visibility was good with high cirrus clouds. From our vantage point, we could see the flight pattern of planes on their final approach to O&#39;Hare Airport (about 10 miles due west of us).  The planes were coming in low, at approximately 2000 feet, at 1:30 min. intervals.  The fireball was clearly well below the cloud ceiling, roughly at the same altitude as the approaching aircraft.  The fireball had a long blue-green streak trailing behind it as it dissipated in the SE sky toward Lake Michigan.  We also noticed the flight pattern of the planes seemed to change after our observance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tom Skilling, weatherman at WGN TV, also reported during his 9:30pm weather segment, that there were several calls to the station reporting similar sightings.

I just happened to glance skyward and I saw a bright flash with a tail travel rapidly across the sky in a roughly west to east direction. The object&#39;s brightness grew in intensity to a bright blue-white light and rapidly faded out as it travelled across the sky. From what I can recall (I haven&#39;t had a chance to post something until now), I believe the object was slightly below the moon at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a casual aerospace/astronomy enthusiast and have seen lots of shooting stars before, but this seemed bigger, brighter and more prominent. It appeared to travel slightly slower than a usual shooting star as well. I don&#39;t think this was an alien spacecraft; but could it have been some space junk re-entering the atmosphere or perhaps an iridium flare? The only reason why I&#39;m not sure about an iridium flare is because it did seem to have a flaming tail to it, but it could have been an illusion.<n>

Playing with Dog in yard.  Dog suddenly looked up in as if following something moving quickly.  Already facing SW I see this light (completely white) as bright as a star rapidly and silently traveling NW to SE.  The forward part shaped like a half sphere and the trailing end almost cone shaped.  Not like a meteror where trailing end is like a tail.  This seemed like a complete shape sort of like a teardrop. I live by Midway airport and any aircraft landing is so close you can read the markings on it.  This was not an aircraft in any sense, made no sound and traveling more at the speed of a missle and not in any flight pattern aircraft in region would make.  It disaappeared into a cloud which was actually far below a commerical plane traveling east to west.  It never emerged from the other side of the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live in a condo building on the 5th floor out of a 7 floor building.  My wife and I were watching television and we were engaged in conversation so I was looking her way which was in front of a window.  That is when I noticed an object come over the building and trees rather quickly.   I was looking south and the object was traveling south east.   First, I noticed the color which was very bright and green, almost like a neon green.  In my opinion I thought the light looked like a green stop light color but much more intense.  Also, the light was slightly pulsing big to small repetitions at a steady, swift rate.  Second, I noticed it didn’t have any trails like a shooting star or meteorite plus I had never seen anything like this so close .  The angle was about 25-35 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lastly, the object traveling in a perfect straight line in that approximate angle, progressively got smaller and eventually vanished (all taking place in about 5-7 seconds).  This is the first unidentified flying object that I have ever seen.  I know that it was not man made, it was just to fast and the above description makes it impossible.  It was fast but not fast enough to be a comet or some type of space rock in my opinion.  I have not been able to not come up with a logical explanation for something like this.  I immediately told my wife to look out the window, and she saw the last couple of seconds and was speechless.  Given the above characteristics makes it hard for me to come up with what it could have been.

The lights appeared white, with no blinking lights to indicate an airplane or helicopter. The lights were stair-stepped, going from the bottom left to upper right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We exited the turnpike at Custer Road, and proceeded to do a U-turn to head South on Custer Road in the direction of the lights. By the time we had turned around (approximately 30 seconds) the object appeared noticeably close and the lights appeared to have changed formation.  The object was now moving towards us rapidly, and the lights had changed to be almost on top of one another, the largest or closest at the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved very quickly from South to North-Northwest, passing almost directly overhead and slightly in front of our car. The object appeared now as a long, dark, pencil shaped dark against the night sky, with 3 lights evenly spaced along it, one at each end, and one directly in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the object appeared to be flying lower than the local flight traffic approaching Addison airport. The object then kept moving to the North-Northwest at a very fast speed, and we eventually lost it behind some trees. By the time we got to a patch of open sky the object was gone.<n>

The object in question appeared to be a white light whose intensity matches that of a bright star. The object moved relatively fast however not so fast that this factor in and of itself made me suspect that what I observed might be of unknown origins. The most significant detail of this experience was the absence of any blinking or otherwise red/green lights on the sides of the object as would identify a passenger jet. Furthermore the object made no noise yet it flew at an altitude that seemed to be characteristic of that of a plane that might be leaving or landing at DFW International Airport (relatively low). As the object flew from the northwest to the southwest it became smaller and smaller and dimmer and dimmer eventually to the point that I could no longer see the object in the southwestern sky. The object seemed to maintain a relatively constant speed throughout the sighting and flew in more or less a straight line. I would also like to add that McKinney has an airport that is used primarily for smaller personal/privet aircrafts. My mother also witnessed the object with me and see believes she saw a second moving object in the west that matched the description of the first, however, she lost sight of the object and was only able to watch it for a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had a oblong dot in the center and what looked like wavy lines changing shapes inside, the lines looked like electricity they changed color from violet to white and then dissapeared. The spot in the center was the only constant. I am not sure the object was spherical as it seemed to change shape, the lines were the only thing I could see making a shape. I could see no outside edges. The object moved slowly as if drifting.I lost sight of the object when it passed the horizon of the roof of the house. I ran to the other side of the house but could no longer see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

10/9/08 10:36|Asbury|NJ|Cigar|10 seconds|a white cigar-shaped object very high in the sky|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66138.html|407|ndxe200810| While I&#39;ve always had an interest in UFOs and such, I&#39;ve never seen anything strange in the sky, until today. Here&#39;s the story...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside to smoke a cigarette and enjoy the scenery as I do each morning. The sky was a clear blue with just a few thin clouds passing by. I looked up to the sky for no real reason and that&#39;s when I saw it - a white cigar-shaped object very high in the sky, probably at about 20,000 feet in altitude. The object was heading south/southeast and clearly had no wings. It was just a plain white cigar-shaped image with what looked like an aura of light around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the object for about ten seconds it occurred to me that this was not a normal aircraft I was seeing so I grabbed my cell phone to see if I could take a picture of it. At this time the object had traversed only about a quarter of the visible sky and I thought it would take another 20 seconds or so before it would be out of sight. I looked down to pull up my cell phone camera and when I looked back at the sky the object was already gone! This was only a few seconds later and I wondered at how the object could have disappeared so quickly since it was still in the middle of the sky when I&#39;d looked away. It should still be there, I thought. Either way, the object had vanished completely and was seen no more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute or so later a commercial jet was seen heading east. Even though I could see only the profile of the jet, the wings were clearly visible. This is the part that made me think that I really had seen something strange because when the other object passed directly over head, any wings on it should have been easy to see against the open sky, but there were none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was daylight when this sighting took place and no flashing lights were seen on the object, but the same could be said about the jet that followed. If the first object was a blimp, what was it doing so high in the sky and how could it have disappeared so suddenly? Beyond that, the object was moving much too quickly across the sky to have been a blimp or similar known flying object. Call me crazy if you must, but I think I just saw a UFO!

I did though contact the local police department to inform them of what I had seen as well as to inquire as to if anyone else viewed this activity. On the evening of Thursday, October 9, 2008 I was on my way home from the store and noticed in the southern sky 3 white lights in a row. I immediately called my father and he informed me that it was most likely a blimp as one had been seen in the area earlier in the day. Assuming that was the case I pulled into my driveway fully expecting to see the outline of the blimp as it was a clear night and the lights were very close to the ground. In an instant the lights moved westward and then seemed to disappear in the western sky. Due to the speed in which the vehicle reached a blimp is discounted. It is important to note that there was no sound when this happened yet the movement was quick and fluid. I was fortunate enough to get this on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pulled over in the parking lot of Lagrees grocery store to get a better look and the light was gone. While driving west on Hwy 50 I witnessed all three of the lights to the north and then they disappeared at a high rate of speed. I don&#39;t know if there were any other witnesses, I have been watching the local news and reading the newspaper but have not heard anything about it.

But I really can&#39;t rationalize what I saw and feel like I should report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at my house and I wasn&#39;t getting good sleep. I happened to wake up around 4:15 am and moved because the spot I was in was uncomfortable. I moved to a spot next to a big bay window over looking a lake. While laying there before closing my eyes, I noticed a really bright light. I cannot tell how far away it was, it seemed to be a couple of miles, but it was so bright that there was a reflection of its light on the lake. The bright light alone drew my attension to it. The object was not moving which seemed odd. The color was white and red with the white being much brighter than the red. Then, the white light began to dim but the white light was still brighter than the red. This oject then made a slow move to my left and then to the right before stopping. The movement was strange, it moved like a a puck on an air hockey table (and was very agile), I have never seen any type of maned craft move in that way. The object then stopped for about 4 seconds and then made a progressive move in one direction (the speed was not alarmingly fast)moving behind a mountain ridge and I didn&#39;t see it again. It wasn&#39;t a hellicopter, I would have been able to hear it if were a hellicopter and it wasn&#39;t a plane or star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was dark in whatever room I was in, but surely it could have been a dream. I remember yelling at this being, while I was laying down. Further, the being looked like an insect, but stood upright. It had antennae coming from its head. The idea I got after I woke was that it was a locust being. I compared it to a locust for some reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I woke, whether dream or not, I recall a loud humming noise above my place outside. The sound was subtle, but noticeable. I hear these sounds above my house after waking up all the time (always in the middle of the night). Generally, I will go to the bathroom after waking, and hear this sound of some craft, plane, etc. before or during my trip to the bathroom. Many times, I hear this, but do not feel any other strange symptoms or problems after waking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing for sure is: I have never been harmed,, to my knowledge, in any way.

So i belive it was triangular. At first i thought it was a airplane untill I noticed it was not moving or flasing. I was driving west bound now with the red light I assume that is the front then that would say it is facing north east. at that angle I would not mistake it for a slow moving airplane at an angle that looks like it is staying still. after about 10 seconds it started moving about 60 mph then I lost track of it. But I know what i seen. even if it was an airplane appering to move so slowly that there is no movement to all the sudden be moving at a steddy pace. Id say it was at an 50 degree angle from me and i could tell that the red light was  on the bottom not the front and there was no green light or any other light near the red one no light were flashing.

Just sitting talking, I noticed that these objects were in a strange tumbling appearance and no sound, no blinking, just red lights that moved in a strange silent geometric pattern.  We see plenty of aircraft, both military &amp; civilian, and this looked like none of that.  Neither of us could make out just how these lights were attached because of the way they &#39;tumbled&#39;.  The other witness thought the lights looked like they were rotating in a circle, but I thought they looked sort of like tumbling cubes with each red light at the cubes corners.  We could not see any body, just these slow moving silent oddly tumbling lights crossing the sky.  It took several minutes for the lights to go out of view in the SW sky.  They moved very steadily and with no obvious perpective (like wings or landing light).  They were very large looking together, but with no sound at all, it was difficult to tell how far away they were.  They moved so slowly we had time to discuss what we were looking at and over the course of minutes, we couldn&#39;t figure what it was we were lookint at.  From top to bottom there was a large span and from side to side as well, but they looked like they were equidistant from each other at all times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

My younger kids and neighbor kids could not see them.   It was a clear day without wind about an hour before sunset. There was no sound emitted, lights or exhaust trail observed from the object.  I viewed the object moving from west to east directly towards STL at about half to a third or maybe at the height of jet airliners that fly over that path.  I contacted my wife and a couple of neighbors after i saw another object. They also saw about 8 -10 more objects intermittently for about a half hour. They appeared to go over the same path but not exactly, some higher some lower but not too different, but at a similar velocity and straight line path west to east.   The last object I saw was higher up which I pointed out to my neighbor.  About 30 seconds after that last object was seen 3 stealth fighters appeared in single file formation but spaced out, were directly behind the  path of that last object.  There was also a jet airliner  elavating toward the south that flew very close right underneath the stealths.  The last object I saw flying ahead of the stealths was moving about 2-3x the speed of the military craft.  It was a very clear day. Four adults and a teenager saw them and cannot ID them as birds, balloons in a jet stream or any aircraft we have ever seen.  They were fast, you could only view them for about 15 seconds until they faded to the east, whereas the stealths were visible for about 4 x as long and easily identified. The last object seem to be about a third of the size as the stealths and a little less elevated but on a similar path.  The stealths were barely audible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stared at this object, at about 2:00  clock on the horizon, just above treetop level.  The sun was above my head. The object was Oval shaped, and very shiny. It seemed strange to me.  It had no tail, wings or windows.  It almost glowed. I could make out the reflection on this craft from the sun’s light.  One end would be shining more than the other end, as it pitched and dipped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be a craft in trouble.  I compared it with a large tree in my yard, that it had just passed over.  It was about ¼ the size of the treetop. This tree is a 200+ year old oak.  It was so close, yet never made a sound.  It vanished behind the trees and out of view.  I felt ‘strange’ afterwards.  I went back to work building.  I have drawn the object that I saw below.

On the underside of this object there were two equal-sized, circular openings, which seemed to be filled with a swirling, phorphorescent vaporous substance of some sort.  It looked to be both vaporous and energized in some manner.  It was not like anything I have seen before.  These were definitely not lights; not in the sense that we think of lights.  The object had no other lights or energy sources which I could see.  These two &#34;wells&#34; took up about half the area of each side of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutelyl no sound associated with this sighting; not even the &#34;woosh&#34; of the air being disturbed by its passage.  It was totally silent.  The object crossed directly above me, headed on a general south-north heading, and then disappeared into the pre-dawn darkness.  The total time I observed was probably between 3 and 5 seconds.  Long enough to get a good look and discount any possibility of swamp gas, weather balloons or an early-morning stars or satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent over 20 years in the Army; almost three years in combat.  I have observed a wide assortment of aircraft in a wide assortment of applications, under a wide range of circumstances and conditions.  I have extensive exposure to many types of military aircraft, including, AH1, UH1, CH47, OH1, C113, C123, C130, C141 and C5A types.  I have observed night-time air strikes and close air support operations both day and night, and in all kinds of weather.  I have flown in and am familiar with CH47, UH1, C113, C123, C130, C141 and C5A aircraft. While assigned to Fort Lewis, WA, I lived in military housing directly under the approach paths for aircraft incoming to Grey Army Airfild for over eight years.  My point being, this observation was well outside the range of my experience and significantly enough to warrant my making this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What could this have been?  Why was it here?  What was its mission? Where was it going (and where did it come from)?  And, most weirdly of all, why did it allow me to see it??<n>

Then the light in the middle seemed to have been shaped as a can like shape really although stubby it had a flat top at one point but it seemed that the light was off for a few minutes and then kind of flickered almost as if their were problems with it but as a few minutes passed the middle bright light was back on and remained on as I was video taping a segment that was 15 min long. As this was taking place the object in the middle was moving quite rapidly and then had seemed to at one point stand still as if it was looking at me as well. (a little creepy to say the least!) the colors were mostly a orange hue or red hue but not much more than that as the 3 white lights were really what stood out and that&#39;s what got me to look up and wonder what the heck... I was outside in the front of my house at 4 am EXACTLY as I couldn&#39;t sleep for some reason so I stepped out to have a cigarette and as I was lighting it I just glanced up and noticed these 3 bright lights that seemed to be either attached to eachother or following eachother in perfect formation. I always take my cell with me even for a smoke as once I was locked out and as I say ONCE I was! So O got my cell out and turned it on to take a video of what caught my attention. This was a little exciting<n>

I had been driving for about 6 hours and wasn’t paying attention to what city I was near, but I do know I was in mid Oregon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of the top left of my windshield I saw a bright light and thought a general aviation plane was flying really low with an extremely bright light brighter than I had ever seen on a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for 10 seconds and realized that the light would appear but be still, then move at a fast speed then stop, the light would then go out and the sequence would repeat.  That’s how it traveled, it was on a straight plain going north along I-5.  It appeared to be 1200 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the 10 seconds previously specified, I told my passenger to look at what I was looking at and he immediately looked to his left and saw it.  I kept on driving and looked at the light as frequently as possible.

10/8/08 01:30|Las Vegas|NV|Disk|4 hours|Multi colored, lighted spinning craft with greyish brown cloud surrounding it and bright white light over Henderson, NV.  ((Star??))|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66216.html|433|ndxe200810| Multi colored, lighted spinning craft with greyish brown cloud surrounding it and bright white light over Henderson, NV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 10-8-08 at approximately 0130 hours my girlfriend and I were walking our dogs at the park and I noticed what a clear night it was. I looked towards the South East over Henderson, NV and observed a bright white light which seemed to be moving slowly from side to side. The object was approximately twenty-thousand feet up in the air. I told my girlfriend to look up at the lights and we observed blue, green, red flashes as the object appeared to be spinning. We observed the object move very slowly in various directions almost as if it was floating around the sky over the Henderson urban-sprawl. The object had a brownish-grey cloud around it at all times and the light it emitted had illuminated the cloud around it, which seemed to follow it wherever it would go. We stayed at the park for approximately an hour, and marveled at what we saw and the changing lights. We decided to drive in the direction of it and ended up at a housing development near Silverado Ranch and Eastern. I believe it was called “South Fork” off Eastern Avenue. We parked in front of  various houses that were in the South East area of the housing development itself and it appeared to be very close to our vehicle compared to when we were at the park. It made no sound itself. We both stared at the lights which were still green, red, white, and blue at times, but it was mostly white and the colors would come and go. At one point a red laser type light emitted from the craft which seemed to be a smaller light than the others and a different color red that circled around the craft which was spinning. I told my girlfriend looking at the lights was becoming difficult because they were so bright it hurt and she agreed. I flashed my hazard lights, as we were in my vehicle, and when I did this on two occasions the lights became more active and the small red laser light would almost answer back to us and seemed to shine in our eyes directly! The dogs with us were whimpering and whining. The unidentified craft seemed to be getting c! loser to our vehicle. I was looking at the clock the entire time in the quiet neighborhood and I never lost any time during the sighting. At one point my girlfriend says it &#34;looks like a disco in the sky!&#34; She also described the white portion of the lights as “like a starburst“. I could make out the shape of the craft in only one instant and it appeared to be bell shaped, however the lights made the craft appear to be disc shaped and spinning. The cloud cover around the craft did not look like normal clouds almost as if the cloud was emitted from the craft. At the housing development we could hear helicopter sounds but we did not see any helicopters and I thought this was suspicious. This object was not a helicopter as it did not have small red flashing lights on the tail but large multicolored ones. During our sighting, we both agreed about what we observed and we shared the exact same reactions to the UFO at the same time. We drove up Easter, a little more South up towards the “Anthem” area, which actually is up the mountains of the Valley and parked. We could still observe the UFO from our vehicle however it appeared to be more East of us and also appeared to be rising in altitude slowly. We came to the agreement that we had actually driven around the UFO, which made me to believe the object was large however not very high in altitude. Other things about the sighting were we observed several shooting stars during this sighting in alternate areas of the sky than the UFO. At one point in the sighting we observed white beams shoot out from the craft. We also observed several smaller orb craft around the craft during the sighting. Because I did not know the exact distance of this craft it is difficult to say the size but I did get the impression it was possibly a mother ship as at about 0530 hours it was high in the sky and only white light when we got back to the house with the smaller craft possibly following it up. This craft seemed to be a pyramid shape at times as it gained altitude. This is my first UFO sig! hting an d we shared it together, as it was her first as well. We felt like we had a connection with it and hope others saw it that very early morning. We did not have a camera in the vehicle and we did not want to run back home to get one in fear we would lose track of the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up and saw 3 triangler UFOS. They were red lighted with yellow dots on the corners. They were over my car. And they drifted along the area I was at. The ghost ships all drifted to the east over the Holiday Inn in the area. And then they all got under a cloud. And I saw one of them then had changed to yellow lighted with red dots on the corners and it disappeard and I saw it no more there was no sound and I didn&#39;t see the other 2 no more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was on October 7, 2008 on a Tuesday night at 10.00 P.M.  It was cloudy and hazy that night.<n>

Just about a minute before seeing this light I saw a small propeller plane flying very low passed the same area where I saw the light. At first I thought it was the plan crashing because the light looked like the tail lights/night lights of the plane but because there was no noise (where the plane just before this was very loud) and just a greenish white looking streak I ruled that out. It looked like a firework to me but since it was coming down at a extreme angle and I heard no noises, and it looked very close.. I ruled that out too by driving around the neighborhood looking for a possible crash site or perhaps people launching off fireworks in some kind of celebration. Nobody was out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just got a weird feeling about this, it was so random.. Using google to try to find some similar reports lead me to this site, which was really surprising.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at this check list of characteristics below, I did too notice there were a few planes in the same area of the sky where this object was at.. Gives me goosebumps now I think about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They both seemed to flicker orange and brighter on the outside and darker on the inside.  As they came directly over the top of our Apt. they made no noise so my girlfriend and I knew it wasn&#39;t a plane or helicopter.  The 2nd orange ball seemed to actually speed up a little to catch the ball in front of it just for a moment.  Then it appeared that both of them started shooting &#34;flares&#34; several at a time out of the orange balls.  The lead ball started with maybe 2-3 balls and then the 2nd ball did the same.  It seemed as the &#34;flares&#34; were falling from the orange balls that the orange glow became dimmer and also it appeared that they were brighter from the &#34;front&#34; of the ball then the back side.  As they continued in the sky towards the south they seemed to keep the same altitude but eventually left our field of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear with no clouds on a brisk cool night.  Between 50-60 degrees out.  We both stood there in disbelief as to what we actually just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We didn&#39;t hear any sound and the light was a interesting one. I can only describe it as a circle with a reddish light on the bottom that slowly glowed brighter as the light sped away in a westerly direction. The light was moving at such speeds it&#39;s hard to describe it accurately. I estimate it at approximately 100 feet off the ground and covering 10-15 miles in just seconds, I would assume there has to be regulations against such speeds at these lower levels. The light was moving from east to west and in a flash it was out of sight over the Bull Run mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If that wasn&#39;t enough excitement for one night we encountered another light just minutes after seeing the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we proceeded on from the first sighting, approx 3-5 miles, heading toward the Manassas Battlefield, we encountered another light. This light was also moving east to west but was neon green in color and noticeably much smaller. The light was also close to the ground, it couldn&#39;t have been higher than 100 feet and again moving at a speed faster than anything I have ever seen. As with the earlier light, it was headed toward the Bull Run Mountains and in a flash it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a avid astronomer and know this wasn&#39;t a Meteor or any other type of natural light phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also a very practical person but I quite can&#39;t wrap my head around what this was. I wanted to report this to you in hopes maybe someone else in the area saw the same thing we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It seemed stationary at first, then it started moving very slowly side to side...as I kept looking, I could see what first appeared to be an airplane coming in from the left, but when I looked at it closer there were a series of white and red lights that were flashing side to side - it was small from my angle, but I could still tell it wasn&#39;t a plane. It came in fairly near to the first bright light and stopped in mid air, then started getting brighter and brighter like someone was turning on a light switch. They both stayed stationary, and alternated between dimming and getting stronger. Then, out of nowhere, a light just flickered out of the darkness and appeared, creating a triangle - one that started moving slowly in formation, all of the lights together. Then it changed shape a bit as each light moved, and a couple of them flickered out...weirdly, though, the one bright light was still there (it never went away until the very end). For the next hour or so, more and more ships or whatever they were would come in...at one point, there were five of them, all really bright and at all different levels of the sky. These ships, again, looked like airplanes at first - but they would change direction, go directly vertical in the air, and also stop completely and become stationary. Many times, the lights would also descend below the trees so that I couldn&#39;t see them, making them too close to the earth to be a plane. Occasionally they would all go away and I would think that it was over...only to look back out a minute later and see another triangle. About an hour and a half into this, I went out to the hallway of my dorm and called 5 more people in, all of whom saw the same thing. So with me and my roommate, that makes 7 witnesses that I now know of, and I think they were going to! tell mo re people as well. The climax was near the end, when there were actually five lights that made a large V-formation, two on either arm near the top and one in the center. It very slowly rotated, and then the lights went out. This just stopped happening about five minutes ago...actually, wait - I just looked back out again and there are two more lights back in the sky, with the same pattern as before. Overall now, this has been going on for two hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then started looking at it nonstop for about 5 minutes. The object was about 2 times bigger than a regular planet appears. It also flashed red and silvery colors.It was a fairly slow moving object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had about a 30 second chance to look at the object in my binoculars before it dipped below the horizon.

When I looked again it was this small flat disked shape orange light with orange rays coming off it, which were more faded than the ball. I then told my mum and when she looked around to look as we moved further away, it was higher in the sky and bright orange and looked like a star. I saw it flash once and as a plane neared it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I checked the J-track website to see if a satellite was what I was seeing.  There were no visable satellites at that time. I called my mother who live 30 miles west of me and made her look at it. She could see that it was NW in the sky from her and was blinking slightly from red to white. It moves across the NW sky on long Island (north of the LIE)for about 90 minutes then is gone. Tonight I showed my husband and we looked through binoculars. It is egg shaped and has a series of lights flashing red-yellow-green and white around the perimeter. The center is black. I would love to know what this is. As stated it has been there every night to date from 9-23-08. I am sure it will be in the same spot tomorrow night moving the same pattern. Planes are also passing this object as there are 2 major airports in that direction. I am outside every night at that time with my dog I would have seen it prior to 9-23-08 which is the very 1st sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD))<n>

As I was returning to my car, I noticed a flower pot on another small deck which juts out from the living room of his house about 12-15 feet above the driveway. The flowers hanging over the pot looked pretty against the bright blue cloudless sky, so I shot four pictures in a row of them, from about 20 feet away, using a telephoto lens. (The first shot was a &#34;single;&#34; the next three were a &#34;burst.&#34;) The shots were aimed up toward the sky, slightly north, but mostly to the west. Cloudless sky, no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed an &#34;spot&#34; in photo one (of the four I shot of that scene) when quickly scanning through the photos as I transferred them from my camera to my computer. Since I hadn&#39;t noticed anything in the sky when I shot the photo, I thought maybe the &#34;spot&#34; resulted from a &#34;glitch&#34; in the camera. I made a copy of the photo at full size and enlarged it in Photoshop, then enlarged the section with the &#34;spot&#34; in it again and &#34;enhanced&#34; it using the Photoshop Unsharp Mask filter at the following settings: Amount-500; Radius-25; Threshold-15. In the enlarged enhanced view, the &#34;spot&#34; appeared to be a solid object, and not the result of a camera malfunction. The object appears appears golden/golden-red in color and to have sled-type runners or pontoons attached to its underside. It I checked and rechecked the other three photos of the same scene and found no trace of the object in any of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mentally retraced my activities to determine the time when I shot the photo and then did test shots with the same camera to determine the amount of time which elapsed between the first and last photos in the scene (five seconds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Camera: Fuji S100, 12 megapixels. Setting for all four photos: automatic. I have saved all four original photos<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe obj. is flower petal, or butterfly.  PD))<n>

PD))|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66218.html|447|ndxe200810| Twilight Fly-by Of Triangular Craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tuesday, October 07, 2008 05:50 EST Working on paperwork at my office for a meeting with a vendor that afternoon, I went outside to grab a pack of cigarettes out of my car.  Afterwards I began to scan the sky, as it was an exceptionally clear night.  I saw the usual streaks across the sky from debris hitting the atmosphere.  I remained scanning for quite some time that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 06:03 EST Looking out at Orion, I noticed a star-like object moving through the constellation.  As the object approached the Belt area it got brighter and brighter; To the point that it was brighter than Jupiter or Venus, for that matter.  It stayed that way for 10 seconds or so, then it began to dim in luminosity as it cleared the last star of the belt of Orion.  It became as dim as it was when I first noticed it in the sky moving in the same direction.  I watched this object for some two minutes in total, as it faded towards the horizon.  I figured that I just saw a satellite.  It got brighter when the Sun reflected off of it…Or so I thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 06:12 EST Like the first object, there was another.  Following the same path as the first.  Only this one did not increase brightness.  Note:  These objects did not follow the usual air traffic flight paths through the Pittsburgh area.  The sky was clear enough to see strobes from aircraft at 60,000 ft.  From my perspective, these were not aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 06:23 EST With daylight approaching, looking up facing the southern sky, a triangular shape flew overhead at incredible speed.  It was as fast as an incoming meteor, but this thing changed direction from southwest to west.  It headed towards the horizon where the first two objects faded away.  It made no sound.  There were no lights of any kind.  There was enough light from the twilight of morning to ID its shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just thinking about how big it had to be boggles my mind.  This thing was 2 to 2-1/2 inches from my perspective.  If it went by in space; Isn’t that close to 160 miles up?  That means it had to be more than a mile wide or more.<n>

It woke me up from my sleep. When I went to look outside my window all I saw was a mark on the grass in the shape of a circle about 76 inches in diameter connected with a straight line on one side. The circle was not complete.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The grass around the circle is green. The grass that makes up the outline of the object that landed is completely brown (killed) to the root. It doesn’t look like its burnt, it looks like something pressed from up above against the grass. It is well defined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please contact me at your convenience.<n>

The object was roughly the size of a BB when held at arms length relative to the surrounding environment. It behaved like a shooting star but the shape stayed too consistent and there were no trails of light behind it suggesting that it could be some kind of &#34;shooting star&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was sharp neon green in color and we were traveling northbound on Slide road toward the mall right before the intersection for loop 289 when we sighted the object. I could not have confused this with any other color and the green light was even glowing through street lights and I could clearly distinguish between the white street lamp and the green object.<n>

We watched the light for approx.  5min.  When I went to get some binoculars and returned. the light was gone. This was on the west side of the Rio Grande in the Albuquerque area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about ten at night and the night was clear.  The intersection is lighted brightly by the rosy bright highway lights.  It looked as if it was daylight at night.  I was the first car at the light waiting to turn left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked straight ahead, I saw an object sort of hovering about four feet off the ground.  My first thought was, “Wow, what a big dragonfly!”  It was flying like and acting like a dragonfly, with the same zigzag, stop-and-go movements.  It flew toward my car, approaching the passenger side hood.  When it got this close I could see that it was a small white ball.  It looked like a ping pong ball!  It seemed to have something sticking out of it and moving, but I cannot really say what it was.  It paused near the top of my hood and then came to the passenger side window.  It stopped, “looked” at me for a second, and then continued past my car. I really felt like it saw me.  The light turned green so I turned because there was a car behind mine. I did not see where it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went home and told my 14 year-old son about it.  I told him it reminded me of the Quidditch ball in the Harry Potter movies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is so unbelievable that I can’t comprehend what I saw.  It could have been some kind of probe.  Someone suggested that it could have been a toy, but this was an isolated area at night and, after seeing it up close, it did not appear to be something that has been developed yet.<n>

They remained completely stationary for about 10 or 15 minutes because I left and returned several times to check and see if they were still there, and they were. They appeared to be in the formation of a chevron.the last time I went back to check they&#39;d vanished. Very curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The only &#34;stars&#34; visible some minutes before eight were the planets Venus over the Western horizon and what I think was Jupiter near zenith, close to the Moon. I took my eyes off the sky for a while. Some minutes later, I searched for additional stars in an already darker sky. I again looked at the area where Jupiter and the Moon were and I saw two really bright objects which at first I took to be stars, when one of them gave a really bright flash and then the two of them started fading until they completely disappeared from the dark sky. I kept staring at the area of the sky where this happened for several minutes, but the objects did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To the east we noticed a bright blob of light that was rapidly changing colors. Brighter then any airplane light I have seen. We continued to watch it for approx a minute or so, at one point the light went dim and had very rapidly blinking lights of all colors, it then got bright again and then simply vanished. Also during all this there were planes in the area lining up for McCarran airport, this was nowhere near the line. I also was able to get a short video of the object. It was not great quality.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On the front (assuming by the direction it was headed)  it had a little yellowish/white light. In the Center of the object there was a tiny white light and then a red flashing light right above it. At the end of the object there was a green light on one side and a red light on the other. It was much to long to be a plane and it was going way to slow. It toke 10 minutes for it to get out of my sight range. It was also making a low buzzing sound from what I could here, it was very quiet. I couldn’t see anything else but the lights, and I could tell that it was a huge object. It was extraordinarily  long, I couldn’t even believe what I had seen. The whole time I was thinking what is that? I thought maybe a blimp but it was to long and what would a blimp be doing out at 9:00 at night. I called one of my friends and explained the object to him and he had no idea what it was and told me it could have been a UFO and to report the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were 3 white lights that seemed to hover in a particular area, they then each dropped several large very bright orange lights that fell straight down and then disappeared.  The white lights then took off to the northwest at an extremely high rate of speed.  The speed was way faster than any military aircraft. Within a few seconds you could not even see them anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Never hitting the ground it leveled, off hovering, like a huge oval rounded at the top flatter on the bottom, no longer looking flat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the cornfields behind the Connecticut River known as the &#34;Honey Pot&#34; (dirt road area). The object was east to slightly Northeast seemed to be above UMass Amherst area. It was at a 45 degree angle from where I was less than a mile up (even though it had several hundred feet higher up) and easily 4 miles away. I have never seen such a thing in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I made my friend pull the car over he couldn&#39;t see it.

After the fourth attempt I looked up and it was gone I will be going out there again to see if it shows up again. I am not a believer in this sort of thing and I am not crazy or stupid in anyway. We do NOT live anywhere near a city, I know this area well and I use Google earth and this was happening far behind people’s backyards in the sky.

There was a large building behind me, so I did not see the trajectory until the object was directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it was a meteorite, but there were two lights spaced a small distance apart.  Also, Albuquerque has a high amount of air traffic, and I was looking at planes at the time.

The object appeared to have a saucer rim, which surrounded a sphere on the top and bottom of the object. This object performed several different aerobatic maneuvers that are impossible for any type of fixed wing aircraft. It hovered for periods of time, some ten to fifteen seconds. It moved on all three axes. It would move to the left and to the right, as well as up and down and backwards and forwards. I am a student with a passion for aviation, so I know that this could not have been anything civil or commercial. This object also emmited lights. It would be white for most of the time, but it did change several times, most notably in the spherical portions of the craft. IT would turn to like a purplish-pink color, and then back to white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first observed this object when driving my car to the gas station, but never made it there. When there was a break between houses, and there was n a clear line of sight, I noticed a lighted object hovering near the South Point casino.  After a few moments, I realized that it was stationary. I pulled my car over and began to observe it for several minutes. It then started to move slowly to the left, then to the right. It began to fade, but then its color intensified. At which case I drove home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From there, my mother and my two cousins were outside, startled by the fact that there was an Unidentified Flying Object in our presence. It continued to change colors, and then fade as if it were shrinking. We continued to observe the object for ten minutes before it moved out o view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a nineteen year old college student attending UNLV. I also have a knowledge of aviation and astronomical phenomena. I do know that this was neither a civilian aircraft or an astronomical event. Also, this is not the first time I have observed a UFO. It has occurred two previous times, once in New York about eight years ago, and the other was back in March of 2008 by the UNLV campus.<n>

The moon wasn&#39;t visible at all and the road was pitch black except for the light of my headlights. No cars were insight and we were the only ones driving on the highway at the time. I couldn&#39;t see anything in my rear-view mirror for miles then all of a sudden an orange oval fireballish light appeared. I assumed it was a motorcycle pulling onto the road off an adjoining dirt road. I watched it for about a mile in my mirror then all of a sudden a second light appeared stacked on top of it. I looked at my passenger and asked her to look back and see if she could see it too, because no vehicle has lights that are stacked like that. She looked back and saw it as well so I knew I wasn&#39;t crazy. The top light went out and the one light was left as we kept watching. As we kept driving we watched it and it seemed to gain immense speed and seemed to be 20 feet (MAYBE) behind my car and then backed off really fast and kept playing this chasing game for a few miles. Then as soon as a car approached in the other lane it would go dark. Every five or ten minutes it would reappear after another car passed in the opposite lane, but only 3-5 cars passed in the other lane our whole 3hr. trip. When other cars would pass by us I asked my passenger to look back and see if she could see something in the headlights of the other cars...but nothing was ever seen.  I was completely alert this whole trip, took no drugs, and had a passenger who saw everything I have expressed above. I would really love an explanation or at least some insight if possible. I know I&#39;m not crazy, and this was the first time I&#39;ve ever been approached by something that seems to fit a supernatural category.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a perfectly clear nite, the stars were out and there were only a few clouds, if any. I happened to look up, and directly in my path of vision I saw 3 oval lights flying closely together. I alerted my boyfriend, who also observed the objects. I proceeded to point and shout, but others around us did not bother to look. The objects were visible for approximately a minute, and then disappeared into the nite.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/4/08 22:00|Montreal (Quebec)(Canada)||Other|1 minute|3 eight shaped UFO  and  and a bright light guiding them.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66793.html|470|ndxe200810| 3 eight shaped UFO  and  and a bright light guiding them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> me and my son were in the balcony on our 9th floor app. building, in montreal ,canada. it was a grey cloudy skies and dark. we suddenly noticed an object that appered out of nowhere,not far across from us at about 15th floor level. it was in a shape of the number eight, translucent, and moving slowly from south to north. i noticed that it was trying to climb higher, so i looked up and saw a very bright white light moving in the same direction. it was as if the eight shaped object was following the the bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the bright light was bigger then a star in size and was moving slower then an air plane speed. you could see that the two object are connected to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> after about 30sec. a second eight shaped object appered out of nowhere, it was moving in the same direction as the first one and the bright light. except the second one was moving in a diffrent motion (the first one was moving in a wave like motion, while the second one was moving more like left and right motion) at this point i told my son to go get a camera, but he was frozen and like me was watching the whole thing and trying to figure out what are these things. (it was more important to watch every second of it, rather then go inside to get a camera and come back to see that its gone.) while the 2 objects are moving away up and to the north ,following the bright object that was on top of them (i would say that the bright object was about 500m higher and 100m forward.) i turn my head around scanning the sky to see if there are any more objects. i was looking to my right and in front but didnt see anything. i looked again up to my left and saw the the 2 object and the bright light are gone. when i turned my head back i could not belive my eyes.... a third eight shape object just appered out of nowhere, right in front of our eyes. this time the object was a &#34;standing&#34; eight and moving in a fowared backward motion, it was moving much faster then the other objects as if it was trying to catch up to them. we watched it moving up and to the north until we could not see it no more. this whole thing took about 1 min. there was no sound or lights on the eight shaped objects. you can only see the outline of this thing. my feeling tells me the the bright object was the guide to the other 3 eight shaped objects. as if it was showing them the way. my feeling also tells me that the eight shaped objects were some kind of a living organism. i did some search on the net to see if there was anything similar witnessed or reported by others but did not find anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the phone with him, he is witnessing a total of 12 lights in the Northern sky that are in groups of 4, dancing around in circles, then they meet (become one)—and the then solitary light moves to a different location in the sky and repeats the process.  Their destination points alter around 15 to 20 degrees.  They can be seen through the clouds (the temperature is 60.9° with the threat of rain).<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said he was watching a movie about a tornado in New York and preparing a late dinner when, ironically--the wind suddenly picked up which alerted him to look outside.  He said he noticed that the wind was blowing so hard that the tops of the trees were almost touching the ground—that is when he said he saw the orbs and called me: Ok, he’s going out onto his balcony, he said he sees an Air Force jet plane moving at high speed that just disappeared at the point in the clouds where one set of the lights came together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He says that he can definitely tell the obvious difference between the plane and the orbs because of the landing/strobe lights on the bottom of the jet—the orbs do not have such lights.  Plus the jet has an obvious light pattern as opposed to a solitary point of light like the orbs. He continues to watch until. . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9:45pm—Ok, now there are only 4 lights left. . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10:27pm—all the lights are now gone. . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are finally able to discuss this sighting and have come to the conclusion of the possibility that the lights might be something sent up by the Air Force to seed the clouds. . .?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We all looked up into the Western sky. It was at about a 45 degree angle from us. The distance was hard to judge. It was night time and there was low cloud cover as well. The object seemed stationary and appeared to be burning Orange / Reddish in color. It was below the cloud ceiling. It began to move slowly across the sky from West to South East. It moved in a slow jerking motion at first,  It began to burn less bright as it flew. It traveled like this for about a 4 minutes. It didn&#39;t appear to travel very far,. Then it went out. The object than traveled the remainder of the skyline at a rapid pass. Even though it was dark you could still see a dark egg shaped object flying under the cloud ceiling headed in a southeast direction. The entire time there was no apparent sound from the object.  The whole event took 4 - 6 minutes. After retuning home I looked up this sighting on your webpage. It is very similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred : 8/3/2008 23:00 (Entered as : 08/03/08 23:00) Reported: 8/3/2008 9:01:53 PM 21:01 Posted: 8/12/2008 Location: Sterling Heights, MI Shape: Circle Duration:30 seconds large star-like object becomes red and vanishes  A few people were outside my house when we noticed a bright light that looked like a star. It traveled across the sky under the clouds, then it slowed down and turned red, it became smaller and smaller until it vanished. (It made no sound)<n>

They kept going and going straight,<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were NOT a falling star because it did no arc in a curve or fade / burn out. it kept going until I couldn&#39;t see them any more.

While no reports are in your database for this area I did read an account filed on 6 October from Chagrin Falls that was very similar to my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 Oct 2008 approximately 2135 hours local (Eastern Time)  Large V shaped object was moving away from my position to the West-Northwest.  I was able to see the object over the tree tops.  There appeared to be a second object to the right of the V shaped object, but due to the trees all I could see was a blinking light.  Both objects were moving slow and I did not hear any noise.  The V shaped object was approximately the size of a quarter if held at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am filing this report due to the following inconsistencies:  -The object had a lot of lights and was at a relatively low altitude (note the local airport is almost 10 miles due east of my location.  I would not expect an aircraft to have it’s landing lights on that far from the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was large.  If it were a conventional aircraft it would have been in the 747, 777 size.  The local airport only supports smaller aircraft (turbo props, regional jets).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be producing no sound.<n>

It was dusk, around 8pm.  Beyond Barometer mountain a very brightly glowing amber light, as bright as a sodium commercial fishing light, caught my eye.  I guess I thought it could be a plane at first but it struck me as odd so I kept an eye on it.  The light was motionless against (on? Hovering above?) the top of a mountain where I knew there were no houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I blinked my headlights and pulled over at Speedee Kraft, closer to the foot of this mountain, to watch the light be joined on the same horizontal plane by two red lights and a very faint white one, then alternately blink off, then reappear seconds later at the TOP of the mountain as one light (it struck me as one light/source for some reason, not separate).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate the light to have been maybe 200 feet in the air at its lowest point, and less than half a mile away from me.   I know there were no sounds associated with this sighting since I got out of the car and watched it for fewer than five entire minutes, then drove home where I was expected.  The lights blinked off whenever I framed the scene with my camera phone. The lights continued on when I got in my car.  I noticed oncoming drivers on the road going very slowly and some pulled over, possibly watching what I had witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights traveled too fast to strike me as a light attached to people on foot.  It could have been someone plaing with a toy helicopter, but it was so quiet and I think I was close enough to hear it if so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are no houses or structures on that mountain.  It is clifflike-steep and is carpeted in thick, 6 foot and taller bushes.  I went to the mountain the next day and did not see any trails or structures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides just telephone number.

It looked liked the brightest thing we have ever seen in the night sky. My older brother who is 28 years old said he saw something similar about 10 years ago. He also pointed out that if it was a plane we would have heard it and it didn&#39;t make any noise from what we tried to hear. My younger brother tried to take a video of it with his cellphone and didn&#39;t get any image from it. I also want to  point out that we couldn&#39;t see the reflection of it off the lake. Then when my brother tried to get closer to the lake and get a picture of it, it  went from where we could see it to a farther distance in a matter of seconds. Then it went to where we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It caught my attention because of it’s brightness. It had a straight path across the sky, no zig zagging, no falling and it did not streak across the sky. It just looked like it was on a straight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other lights on it and there was no “tail” like a comet. I continued to watch it until it literally faded out. It became almost a translucent grayis/silver color then faded and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> October 6th Monday night about 7:10pm, I was out in the yard with my dogs and I noticed another light. It was a very white light, round and it appeared as if the light were on a craft facing me, however it didn’t appear to be moving in my direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling more North to South, and appeared to stop and go, it did this twice but very briefly. I looked at a star that was by the moon for comparison, and it was about the same size. I watched the light for about 2 minutes, then it just got smaller and smaller  and was gone. As it was getting smaller, it did not appear to be going faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I’m checking satellite positions for this region and time periods. There is a small airport nearby, but no sound was detected. Colorado Springs Airport’s flight path it near the area depending on weather, but the airplanes taking off and landing would be noticeably larger for this area.

It &#34;passed&#34; the other body and then disappeared.

We were getting ready to get on the interstate to go to Harrisonburg. They noticed something strange in the sky. It was hard to see at first because it was just above the mountains and other buildings on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it wobble and hover and discerned that it was saucer-shaped and has red and blue flashing lights. The lights went up the sides of the craft instead of along it, like an airplane might.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to take pictures with my digital camera, but it didn&#39;t really work. Although when looking at the pictures on the computer, there are orange streaks where the saucer should be. Interestingly, the saucer was grayish and had red and blue lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the stoplight turned green, we drove away and the saucer continued its slow wobble to the northwest. We are still not sure if this object was truely a UFO, but there seemed ti be little else it could be.<n>

The object appeared out of nowhere and out first thought was that it could be a helicopter.  The object made no noise and just sat there with objects &#34;wings?&#34; on the side of it moving in a constant slow wave like pattern. It sat there for a long time (5 minutes) and slowly was changing color. After about five minutes the object darted towards the south at a high rate of speed.  The objects on the side of the craft “fluttering wings” started moving more rapidly before the craft darted off.  It changed colors constantly and was very creepy.  I personally was a little scared not knowing what it was and had the feeling that it was watching us since it sat there for so long.  I didn’t believe in these objects until I actually saw one.  The object looked like a fat cigar with fluttering wings and had a light blue haze cloud surrounding it.  We were all a little creped out after that and laughed it off.<n>

Mohonk Mountain is located in New Paltz, New York in the Catskill Mountains. While I was there I took several pictures with my cell phone camera of the beautiful country and the surrounding mountains along the Hudson River. When I got home and started to view the pics I had taken. I noticed that one of the pics appears to have something strange captured in it. I figured I would send it to Ntl. UFO and see what you guys think. This picture has not been altered in anyway. I took this picture, uploaded it from my cell phone to my email account, and when I got home downloaded it and several others. The picture that I&#39;m sending you appears to have three red objects and a plane or jet chasing it. I know this sounds crazy, but please see for yourself.

It was moving at a quick rate of speed and I only saw it for approximately one minute because the trees were in the way.  At first I thought it was a search light, but then I thought I saw what appeared to be fire on one side of the circle.  It was a very cloudy morning and I do not believe it was the sun.  I noticed in my rear view mirror the car behind me was driving in the middle of the road and down the road on the left was a Colonie police officer blocking a side street.  When I arrived at work at approximately 8:25 am I told my coworkers of the experience.  Less than 40 minutes later my coworkers and I saw a fighter jet took off from Albany International and it circled around and headed in the direction where I had the sighting.  The article in today&#39;s Times Union newspaper (October 4, 2008) states that a Hornet fighter jet did take off from Albany International and circled around RPI in Troy, New York.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides little contact information.

10/3/08 02:00|Panoche/Mendota (between; on I-5)|CA|Triangle|less than 10 minutes|Bizarre triangle UFO with three lights hovers over Interstate 5 in Central California|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66083.html|491|ndxe200810| Bizarre triangle UFO with three lights hovers over Interstate 5 in Central California<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 2 a.m. on Friday, October 3rd I spotted a UFO while driving on Interstate 5 in Central California. The GPS located that we were between Panoche, and Mendota. I was sitting in the passenger side of the car, while our car headed north on the interstate. There were only 2 passengers in the car including myself. From afar, we both noticed some kind of craft that appeared to be a helicopter or crop duster. At first the craft would pulse light similar to an airplane, then the whole thing would light up, followed by the appearance of three distinct separate lights. This light pattern: pulsing light, to sustained bright light, to three linear lights, continued for about a minute, each individual stage lasting a few seconds. The craft made incredibly low figure eights over the interstate; its’ distance above the ground roughly tripled the height of an overhanging freeway exit sign. At that point I still could not make out the body of the craft, as all I could see were incredibly bright lights. The craft kept making figure eights over the interstate, flying over both north and south lanes, making low and sharp turns over the fields that surrounded the road. As it continued to figure 8, it no longer followed the light patterns, but was simply three linear lights. I thought &#34;Wow, what a cool plane. This is something,&#34; up until the point when I looked to my left as the craft made its turn back towards the interstate and the three individual lights began to interchange and rotate, changing its linear form into no form; disconnected and spontaneous. Each of the three lights seemed to act independently. As I witnessed this, I knew it was not a crop duster, or helicopter, or normal airplane. This time when the craft came back across the interstate and into the surrounding fields it sank so low to the ground that I thought it had disappeared. I thought it was gone, but out of no where it rose up to my left directly above the car, this time it&#39;s three lights made the shape of a giant triangle whi! ch we we re able to clearly view through our front windshield. While the giant triangle flew over us, the three lights that composed it’s shape shifted back into three linear lights, transforming the craft and changing it’s direction from straight up, to straight out towards the east as if the pattern of the lights controlled and shifted it’s movement. Shocked, I rolled the window down to see if I heard any noise, but we were driving around 70 mph and there were so many cars and trucks on the road that we could not hear anything.  As we continued driving forward, I turned around in my seat to watch it fly away. It appeared to look like a normal plane now (pulsing and flying steady) with an exception of the occasional bright light that would be sustained for a few seconds. Overall, what shocked me about this craft was the way it flew so low and turned with such ease. It did not appear to be flying, but almost floating. In addition, the interchanging, shape-shifting lights that initially appeared as three lights in a linear pattern did not calm my suspicion that this craft was not a normal airplane or helicopter. By the maneuvers that I witnessed, it would have to be one ridiculously talented and daring pilot to be able to pull off such stunning acrobatics in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This wouldn&#39;t be the first time a glowing light has grabbed my attention before because i&#39;ve spotted this same craft three times already. It was dark outside, but you could definately see the distinct shape of the ship- a triangle. It had two white larger lights glowing on each side of it, and four white smaller lights in the direct center.  I watched it for a good 30 seconds and it shot up right, paused- hovering, floated a little more to the right, then shot straight up into the air and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My father was outside our house having a cigarette and he spotted these lights flying above our house. They were in clusters, flashing green and orange and were moving quite quickly. They came in groups and followed each other and it lasted around 5 minutes. We cannot figure out what they are. We are pretty sure they were not balloons or anything as they were moving too quickly and they were definately not planes as there ware too many lights close together. I promise you on behalf of myself and my family this is not a prank. I also captured some of the lights on mobile phone. The quality is not great but you can see the lights and their formation, and it was not edited I can assure you. Please could you take this seriously as we would like to know more about what they were if you could find any information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My email is ((deleted))    If you would like my house telephone number for contact please email me, or if you would like the video footage which I hope you will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also watched the Jamie Maussan  UFO conference 2005 and a lot of the video footage is very similar to mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you do watch the video, please can you ignore the video commentary as my mother was claiming it was some big scam as she did not believe they were UFOs, but maybe it was a scam I do not know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, please believe me on this one, I promise you the video and this story is 100% true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many thanks ((name deleted))<n>

To my left, (east) moving slowly from left to right (north to south) a black triangular shaped object was flying over the Hy Vee Store.  There was a single row of 5-6 round green lights on two sides of the triangle, underneath the object, forming a V pattern.  The lights were not pulsating or rotating.  I could see the object&#39;s shape clearly, as the glow from the Hy Vee parking lot lights illuminated the object from below. It was a dull black against a clear black sky and the stars were visible.  Although I could hear noise from the air conditioning system and traffic noises from Center Street, I did not hear any noise from the object.  Within 4 or 5 seconds, we lost sight of the object behind the trees near the theater.  I asked the actor if he had seen anything and he answered in the affirmative.  I asked if he had seen anything like that before and he said he hadn&#39;t.  I asked him to describe it to me and he did, much as I describe it here.  We were too stunned to run out past the trees to follow it further.  Neither of us had ever seen anything like it before, although we both agreed it was similar to the Stealth aircraft we had seen on television programs.  I am a community college professor and am rather skeptical of UFO sightings.  I like proof.  I do not know what this object was, but would like to find out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had sliding glass doors out of our living room that went directly into our backyard.   Suddenly our yard was filled with a bright bluish white light that got the attention of my son and myself.  When we looked out the door, a glowing egg shaped craft, that could only have held one or two beings, was gliding silently through our yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in the city so we do not have a huge yard.  After it passed out doors, I ran to the front winidow to see where it would go....but it never came out from between the houses, which leads me to believe it took off after we saw it.  Strange to me was the fact that although he was sitting with us...my husband did not see the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Without listening to each others account, my son and I gave a description of what we saw to my husband.  We both saw the same thing.  I am an armed security guard at Independence Hall and have been trained to observe and report things that I see.  I dont think 2 of us could be crazy at the sametime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why didn&#39;t my husband see it?  I have no idea!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I&#39;ve decided to report this now is that about 2 weeks after the sighting, on Oct. 14,2008, my husband was hospitalized with a very rare brain fungal infection.  His doctors had no idea how he  contracted it...as it appeared nowhere else in his body, as it normally should.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was in a coma for 2 months before they could figure out how to treat it.  My husband died this past August due to this infection.  I cant help but wonder if this sighting, that he said he didn&#39;t see, had anything to do with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It appeared to look like a star but much larger and brighter, it was moving at a normal speed around 20,000 ft.  It did not look like a commercial aircraft because it was only glowing white light as it headed east towards Dallas.  Then it shut off like a flash light would do, there we no other lights to indicate where is was in the sky.  I heard no noise and even though it was high there was no indication of engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Lasted 5 mins long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time of event was 10/02/08 0545 hrs. There was a hovering light on top of the hill (Poinsettia Lane &amp; Black Rail Road) which lasted about 5 minutes long. This sighting was the 2nd time. The 1st was last month between 2400-0030 hrs. by my colleague in which we both have the graveyard shift security in the church at Poinsettia Ln. He had told me about his sighting &amp; therefore I kept a watchful eye on the exact area. Behavior of the object was identical as was observed by my colleague.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The top of the hill is about 400 yds  from my location  In which Poinsettia lane intersects with Black rail Rd. There are 3 street light posts which illuminate at the top of the road/ hill. I noticed a bright light half the size of the street light hovering, circling around 200 yds to the right side. It changed to a blue &amp; then red blinking light. It would just circle from on top of the street light to 200 yds  to the right where there is a tower, it would dip down back of the tower &amp; then go back &amp; forth to the top of the road where the street lights were. I walked to the parking lot &amp; informed the pastor who had been parked waiting in the car for a couple of minutes as he was early for the day. I pointed to where the UFO was hovering, we both watched it then I proceeded to walk closer to it about 75 yards to see if it had a sound. There was no sound. It was more like a small object as if it could be a remote control toy.  Its behavior was similar to a firefly hovering around. I noticed it couldn’t be an airplane or a helicopter since there is an airport in the left far side of the hill.  Airplanes often land &amp; take off but I could later hear them. I later lost sight of it because I attempted to walk to  another person at the parking lot which slopped down. As I went back towards it the object was gone.  This took place just before sunrise, it was still quiet dark. The hovering speed would be around that of a remote control plane.  I now have my camera handy hoping to catch it again.<n>

One large in the middle and 2 smaller balls on the sides, the lights was orange. I couldn’t tell if the lights were jointed together or if they were separate. The object was large with about 1 mile away over a cliff and water. When we saw the orbs in the sky my girlfriend saw the three orbs but I think and not certain but I saw a small white light above the three orbs. Well we were going down the hill and I saw these orbs, and within 3 seconds they had vanished. This was out in a barren field with no street lights and no city lights. The first thing I said was “Look it’s the lights from Preston’s drive way. Oddly enough about 2 years ago I saw a large orange orb in the sky that glowed in the exact same way but when I saw them back then it seemed as if their light was bleeding across the sky.  Well that’s It.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As there are several airports nearby, I usually ignore aircraft passing overhead. However, this object was unusual in that it displayed a very erratic sequence of strobe lights, which appeared to flash in quick sequence as a cluster with an irregular outline, go dark for about 5 seconds, then start up again. I saw a irregular outline of this object as the cloud level reflected city lights around the object, subtending about 1 degree in diameter. At this altitude and lighting conditions, I can normally see wings and tail on aircraft. That said, I would completely dismiss this &#34;sighting,&#34; except for one odd detail. As I tracked the movement of this object, the cluster of strobes would sometimes appear clearly outside the previous location of this object, giving the impression the object was quickly darting from one position to another. I thought this was a perceptual illusion until this odd behavior repeated 6 times, but I&#39;m still baffled.  The nature of these strobes appeared as a very quick, erratic sequence, no geometric arrangement appearing to change color almost too quickly to register. These may have been orange, blue, yellow—and quite different from the static red/green position lights seen on wing tips, and I normally don&#39;t see strobes darting around on aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had enough time to wake up my husband and show him before it disappeared behind the tree. He thought it was a blimp but it was not shaped like one. There was no writing on it and there was not an area to fly the thing below it like a blimp has. It was lit up like a Christmas tree. The red lights blinked but the white lights remained constant.

Could see constellations very clear on both nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Viewed by: Myself, wife, daughter and our neighbors next to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could see with the naked eye and binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Appearance: a domed pyramid shape with an array of colored lights (blue, green, red, white and yellow).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was in the same area of the sky both nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Movement: mostly stationary with every once in a while a short jog to the right and then back to the left. Would stay in the same spot for approximately a half hour and then would finally disappear over the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unusual circumstances: normally you would see maybe a couple of airplanes, at night, and be able to hear them. Both nights had approximately 20 to 30 other aircrafts in the sky with only a couple that you could hear their engines running, the others made no sound. The aircrafts would head in the direction of the suspect UFO and would go above and below it and circle around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday night after the suspect UFO was out of site, 10 -15 minutes later the sky grew very cloudy (like an upper fog had moved in) and it started sprinkling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On both nights after the suspect UFO was out of site the aircraft traffic dissipated to only a couple visible.<n>

As I looked out side I saw a trail of light go over my roof top, much like that of a shooting star only it extended back beyond the rooftop so that I could not see the back end. The object was heading in a northerly direction, seemingly straight away over my right shoulder. It reminded me of a glowing ember emitting sparks until it disappeared much like an ember burning out. I can&#39;t guess how high, though it was below the clouds and I had a sense that it was closer to the rooftop then to the clouds. I also could not detect any noise though the TV was playing in the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light then faded and disappeared. It did not emit an audible noise (military fighter jets typically flew over the area and were very loud), nor did the red glowing light blink and did not change color.  The sky was clear and it was night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Sometime there are two lights one up high the other low. It looks like that they move  or they sit there then the light just goes out ,but they come back then go away again it really weird this has happened several times thru the last couple of years and drove me crazy. So I am telling someone at last,  thank you  very much ._  karan angle<n>

The stars seemed very bright and a soft yellow color.  After visually inspecting the stars for a few minutes a fourth star appeared.  I do live  near Sea-Tac and Renton Municipal airport and considered if these were oncoming planes but the objects didn&#39;t seem to move for more than five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Considering my suspicion I fetched some binoculars.  When I came back one of the objects had started to move in a northern direction and it had turned on a  red and green light which one appeared on each side of the bright yellow light.  After a few minutes another object turned on the same type of light and took  off in the same general direction.  And this repeated until all of the objects were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a bright light that I first thought was a star, then it started to move, what looked like, towards me.  I then thought it was a plane, but could not hear any noise as the object got closer.  I called to my daughter to come look.  She also noticed the light.  It moved slow, in a straight line.  It would then speed up a little and then slow down.  It also seemed to quiver (move side to side) in small spurts.  It then turned, what looked from the ground, to move striaght up in the air as it turned the color changed from bright to pinkish then redish and disappeared.  I called a good friend of mine to tell her what I saw and she saw the same light.  She was coming home from the airport in East Wenatchee Washington.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Oct. 1 2008, 8:03 MDT. While watching the ISS fly over I observed two bright lights near the track of the ISS, As the ISS neared them they dimmed and dissapeared. The ISS was at 18* up, so the lights must have been at 28-30*up,, The lights were at approximatly 30* east of north arranged verticaly with the seperation of a pencil width held at arms lenght. The intensity of the lights were as bright as a near Venus when I first noted them and had dimmed to nuthing in eight seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sky conditions were a bit hazy to the north and the ISS did dissapear behind a cloud at one time to the west of where I had seen the lights and it was somewhat hazy below the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It nevered moved.  Kept checking on it until approx. 22:00.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watched thru binoculars and could clearly see flashing lights.  There was a street light below the flashing light so we could easily see that the object was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

10/1/08 20:00|Wilson|NC|Circle|10 minutes|Star shaped light blinking and rotating - then two of same lights after cloud went over and began to move|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66019.html|518|ndxe200810| Star shaped light blinking and rotating - then two of same lights after cloud went over and began to move<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last evening, October 1, 2008, at approximately 8:00 p.m. I was walking my dog in the Country Club area of Wilson, NC (40 miles east of Raleigh, NC).  The sky was semi-clear with a few occasional clouds.  As I  looked up a saw a light hovering – not overhead – but in front of me, probably about the height of a airplane midway down to landing.   The thing that caught my attention was that this light wasn’t moving – it literally was hovering.  As I walked along and got focused on the light it looked like a star-shaped light (individual lights in the shape) at the bottom that were blinking/rotating.  I thought it was odd as I have never in my 52 years seen something in the sky that resembled this kind of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes of staring at this light a cloud went over it.  When the light reappeared it then looked like there were two sets of star-shaped lights that were blinking and rotating.  After the second set of lights appeared the object began to move southward in the sky at a much greater rate than I have ever seen an airplane.  I watched it for a minute or so and then the lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I telephoned the non-emergency 911 number but was told no one else had reported seeing this light.  I am sending in this report just because I know this was not an airplane.  I have Googled all morning what kind of object would have this type of lighting on the bottom but all I have come up with are unidentified flying objects - -<n>
10/1/08 20:00|Marysville|WA|Circle|aprox 30 minutes|2 unidentified objects above highway 2 in marysville washington|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66016.html|519|ndxe200810| 2 unidentified objects above highway 2 in marysville washington<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting inside my friends truck that was parked in my driveway when I saw what I thought might be the planet mars.  My friend and I were talking when I saw this object.  I looked away to continue the conversation, and when I looked back there was another object of the same size and color right next to the first object.  They were both a hazy red color and circular in shape.  The first object was stationary the whole thirty minutes I was watching, while the second object was clearly moving to the right away from the stationary object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the distance I was at it looked like the second object was about 6 inches to the right, when it reached that distance it started to move farther from me.  In about 6 seconds the moving object was out of sight.  The first object was in the same position that it was in when I first noticed it.  As soon as the second object was out of sight I continued my conversation and stopped looking for about 2 to 3 minutes at which time I checked to see if it was still there.  It was no where to be seen.  Neither object left any sort of trail that I could see.<n>
10/1/08 20:00|Texas City|TX|Other|2 seconds|very strange, unexplainable sound|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71497.html|520|ndxe200810| very strange, unexplainable sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I were in my car leaving texas city on palmer highway just passed under I45 a few minutes before. It was dark out and there was no other cars or buildings around. All together the road has four lanes two going one direction and two going the other with feeder roads on both sides. We had just left a pretty busy area but now there was nothing but thick trees around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving for a few minutes in the darkness with our windows down without talking or listening to the radio when we heard a weird sound shoot through the car behind us.  It sounded like a sound effect you would here in a pink floyd song.  It sounded very sharp and fast like a lazer type noise cutting threw the air. It went from the passenger side where I was to the drivers side behind us and then made a &#34;ding&#34;.  When I explain it, it probably sounds like something flew in a hit something.  My mom asked, &#34;Are you sure someone didn&#39;t shoot at you?&#34;  Not only is the highly unlikely but a bullet does not make that sound.  A bullet sounds like something cutting through the air, yes, but not like a weird lazer type sound effect.  And the strange ding at the end sounded like something hitting hollow metal...or tapping a glass with a spoon or something.  Also, I looked in my car for any type of object that could have came in through the windows or any kind of damage from som! ething flying in and hitting it and found nothing.  Nor could I find anything that would have made a &#34;ding&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I heard it I thought to myself &#34;what the hell?&#34; because it was so unexplainable, something I never had heard nor thought I would hear in such a place. I said to my boyfriend, &#34;Did you hear that?&#34;  And he replied, &#34;You heard that too?&#34;  I said, &#34;Yeah what the hell was it?&#34; He had no explanation either.  So of course we went home and told everyone we came across.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still really confused by the noise, I&#39;m not saying it had anything to do with aliens or whatever but I do know for sure that what I heard was so strange that my boyfriend and I can not even register what it was in our heads.   To me it was like a crazy sound wave cutting through the air with no object or anything just a crazy sound. Something you would hear in a Pink Floyd song.  I have thought of seeing UFO&#39;s and ghosts and all the other unexplainable things but I never even dreamed of hearing an unexplainable sound. I could go on all day and never be able to give someone a good mental thought of what it really sounded like because its hard to understand if you didn&#39;t hear it.  I never even knew i could hear something like that until that night.  I would love to know if anyone else has ever heard and unexplainable noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There was a foggy haze around the spacecrafts. They were silver and they reflected lights from the houses in the neighborhood. The spacecrafts lights flashed twice, it changed colors quite a few times, and they made beeping sounds before they flew off. I haven&#39;t seen anything like that since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

At which we stopped the car in amazement not only of what we saw but that we were the only people stopped to watch these figures. They to me looked like two orbs of light with an even stronger light in the center of the orbs. Then once we were out of the car looking for a moment one of the orbs just took off at a slow rate of speed at first but then sped up and was out of sight while the other one remained. We watched it hoover for a couple minutes as if it was watching us watching it then it startied decending at a slow rate of speed slow enough for us to follow. So we got back in the car and followed an it stopped a quarter mile up the road at a hill which was the highest point in the area which we then stopped and began viewing again while I! took pictures on my old phone which I still have. Then it started blinking on and off slowly for about ten seconds all the while hoovering upward then quickly vanished.All the while we felt that it most deffinitly knew we were watching. I decided to write this report after seeing a similiar one reported on tv. That&#39;s my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It might have been an airplane, however, do to the altitude I&#39;m not sure.  Another reason I&#39;m skeptical it was a UFO is because it was moving at incredible speeds. If it was at normal airplane altitude it would be going as fast as a stealth bomber.  It seemed to be white without any wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I looked straight ahead at the road.  I never look at the sky.  This day was different than any other day EVER.I saw an oval shaped ufo like I have never seen before not evan on T.V.  It was moving very slow I was doing 55 and it was moving alot slower than that.  I  could not believe it.  It crossed in front of me on the road it seemed to be around 15 foot up and passed over me moving so slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped dead still in the road and was amazed I thought this would never happen to me.  I didnt believe in ufos but I do now.  The ufo passed over and all I seen after it was around 50 yards away from me and around 15 foot in the air was a very bright light in the sky then it just dissappered   I have never in my life seen anything like that.  I used to never look up  into the sky, but now I do.  I told my love ones they didnt know what to think and I dont either.  I know what I seen.  The ufo had NO windows in it so I was wondering how they could see where they were going.  The ufo had no sound at at all that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/1/08 06:20|Lynchburg|VA|Light|30 seconds|I was walking my dog this morning when I saw a very bright orange light approaching from the south.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66002.html|529|ndxe200810| I was walking my dog this morning when I saw a very bright orange light approaching from the south.  At first I dismissed it as an airliner since it was close to the typical flight path of passenger jets I often see flying overhead.  What caught my attention however was that I DID see an airliner and at that point I could compare/contrast the two.  The bright orange light had no blinking navigation lights, no spot lights, and was easily traveling 3-4x the speed of the jet – on which the blinking lights were very evident.  There was no evidence that the orange light was aware of the jet or visa-versa.  The light traveled from south to north-east crossing the night sky in about 30 seconds at about a max of 40 degrees elevation.  The color was a very distinct orange that never wavered.  The flight path seemed constant, but the distance away was hard to determine.  There was a faint sound of jet engines but since there was another plane in the sky I could not pinpoint the source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next thought was that this could be the ISS which I have taken time to spot a few times with my son.  So as soon as the light passed behind the tree I did a quick online check and verified there are no ISS sightings for our location for a few more days.  And since the shuttle flight was canceled yesterday, there was no need to check its flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So all that said, I still cannot dismiss it as satellite or even a very high-flying advanced aircraft of some type.  It did remind me greatly of other ISS passings and being about an hour before sunrise, a satellite makes sense.  However, the speed, brightness, and orange hue were unique enough for me to submit a report.<n>

It had two silver cyclinder shape object side by side with what looked like some kind of bar in the middle connecting them together.  It was heading toward the Ohio River. There was no sound. It had no wings. There was a small plane following behind it. We watched it until it went out of our sight. There were no lights on the cylinder shape thing and it and the plane were not going very fast and they were low in the sky. We can&#39;t be sure of what it was but it was something we had never seen before. The weather was really nice outside and people were in the pool swimming. I wouldn&#39;t mind talking to someone but since I have only a cell phone I can&#39;t except collect calls on it so if someone would like to talk to me I&#39;ll be glad to talk with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were just riding around and we noticed a large metallic disk with a rounded top just hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound emitted from the object. We saw it for about 5 seconds and then at gold beam shot down from the bottom of the object and then the object shot off as fast as I’ve ever seen anything go. It was like it disappeared completely in a flash. We never saw it again and we called 2 of our other friends to look for things like broken twigs or burned things. We took 4 cell phone pictures of the area were it was seen which we can not upload.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

10/1/08 00:24|Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia)||Disk|5mins|A huge "creature" built up with a line of bright line with a red light at the middle top of it, appears in the dark clear Malaysia sky!|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65983.html|533|ndxe200810| A huge &#34;creature&#34; built up with a line of bright line with a red light at the middle top of it, appears in the dark clear Malaysia sky!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is dark at night, sky is clear and dark, not even a single star can be spotted.  There is then this huge source of light appears middle of the clear dark sky, with cloud around it.  The size of this &#34;creature&#34; is unbelievable huge, never seen such big thing in the sky from such far high up distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where i am standing (23rd floor), it looks like a line of bright colourful light and in the middle on top of this line, a very clear red light on it.  I pulled out my ridiculously small and cheap binocular, i can see vividly the bright line and the red light in the middle on top of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second later, i can see a real aero plane (it might sound coincident, but it is real) flying across it, and i can now see relatively how BIG is that thing, is like 100*times of that small little aero plane just flew through it!!  I tried to snap a photo of it, my stupid iphone camera can’t even capture it, too dark!  Whoever out there in Malaysia witness the same thing, please posts it here and share with us, and please proof me that i am not seeing things, it is real!<n>
10/1/08 00:00|Conway|AR|Triangle|10 minutes|Massive/low/silent black triangle cruises back and forth over downtown Conway|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97711.html|534|ndxe200810| Massive/low/silent black triangle cruises back and forth over downtown Conway<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside on the patio smoking a cigarette around midnight stargazing as I usually do. I noticed some changes in my peripheral vision, and when I focused my eyes to that area in the sky I could see a MASSIVE black triangle. No lights. No sound. No vibration. The only way I could tell anything was there was that its shape blocked the stars behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Either this thing was big as a city, or it was flying incredibly low, because it cruised across the sky slowly. Faster than a blimp but much slower than an airplane. It traveled north to south in a straight line. The line of travel wasn&#39;t directly overhead, but slightly in front of where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I were extend my arm out to the sky, it was almost as big as my hand. It was a perfect equilateral triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I eventually lost sight of it after it got further south. I ran inside and told my roommate what I had seen. I told him I was going to go back out to see if I could see it again later. He was receptive, but understandingly skeptical. He told me to let him know if it came back. I wasn&#39;t expecting anything, but maybe 5 minutes later it came back. I ran inside as fast as I could and got my roommate, praying it would still be there when we came to look. And it was! We both witnessed the object move back over its previous path (this time going from south to north) until it was out of site (behind the trees and buildings).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
