I saw 5 of the lights that were that orangeish streetlight colour but very bright. by the time I&#39;d walked up the road home and showed my father there were only 3 left then they soon winked out. I called the airport and national guard base and of course they were probably weather ballons according to them. I knew it was not from this planet that is why I wrote it down that night and seeing that show I said hey I saw some of those. So this is probably a little late but what the hell, it can&#39;t hurt.<n>
2/15/85 00:00|Hinesville|GA|Sphere|30minutes|It was the unusual movement that made all who were observing the object consider it a UFO.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51177.html|2|ndxe198502| It was the unusual movement that made all who were observing the object consider it a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While on Field Training Excersise with the Georgia Army National Guard at Fort Stewart Georgia I witnessed this event along with a number of other soldiers.  We were firing artillery that night and I was on the Observation Point along with a number of other soldiers.  I cannot remember how many objects we saw that night but I am sure of one.  The object appeared at a high altitude.  It was a crisp winter night with little or no moon.  All of the stars were quite clear.  I am used to looking for satellites in the night sky.  I was a COMSEC Officer with the 1/230 Field Artillery Battalion.  Along with Forward Observers on the OP were a number of Active duty evaluators who were assigned to our unit for evaluation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object caught someones eye and soon we were all viewing object.  Each of us trying to find an explaination.  The object which appeared as s small star in the sky just kept moving in very bazaar movements.  It zigged and zagged but it seemed to stay overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course we were on a very important military base and all considered it some kind of spy satellite.  It seemed to looking at us.  The movements were so unusual that we had to call it a UFO.  Some thought it might be a weather balloon.  No balloon would stay in a pattern such as the object that night.  It was not a flight path of any known flying objects I have ever seen nor my fellow soldiers many of which had years of active duty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was about the size of a three story house, It looked like the moon but was sitting in the field. I pulled my car up beside the house jumped out and was standing in the road looking at this thing when my wife came to the door and asked what I was looking at. I told her to come out and look, as I said this the ball of light begain to move away. I motioned for her to come quick! She ran out just in time to see it as it was leaving. It moved very fast and was gone in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
2/1/85 22:30|Portland|OR|Light|15 mins|multiple points of light hovering? over the west hills of Portland that could disapear one at a time while I was watching them|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17553.html|4|ndxe198502| multiple points of light hovering? over the west hills of Portland that could disapear one at a time while I was watching them<n> <n><n> <n><n> while walking home that night saw in the clear night air 5 objects or points of light seemingly above the radio towers of the west hills. Their color was that of an amber colored street light but more intense. they moved slowly from my vantage point while I continued to walk home. As I stopped and watched to be sure of what I was seeing one disappeared then a miniute or so later another disappeared and so on for a couple of mins until they were gone . That same night I called the airport,the National guard, OMSI and a local news station (I don&#39;t remember which one). Heard back probably heliocopters which is total B.S. &#39;cause heliocopters don&#39;t fly like that.    Who knows? except that it aint just us in this chunk of space I&#39;m pretty sure of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate; source is anonymous.  PD))<n>
