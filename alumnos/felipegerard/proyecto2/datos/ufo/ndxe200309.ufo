9/30/03 22:34|Poplar Grove|IL|Light|10 Minutes|TWO brightly lit UFO's spotted near Poplar Grove, IL|10/7/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31971.html|1|ndxe200309| TWO brightly lit UFO&#39;s spotted near Poplar Grove, IL<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading East on Rt. 173 toward Poplar Grove, IL. When I reached the vicinity of Caledonia, IL I witnessed two objects or craft that appeared to be planes with their landing lights on. As I continued driving I realized that the objects were not coming my direction. I thought they may be heading East also but yet the lights should not have been facing my direction.. (??) As I continued and reached Poplar Grove, I realized I was closing in on the craft as they appeared larger and much brighter. I continued past Poplar Grove East and the craft was fairly large and bright and appeared to be stationary (Hovering). I assumed it was Helicopters. I turned right onto Beaverton Rd, and shut the headlights off and got out and looked up. The objects were to the South. I saw two planes flying in the vacinity and suddenly the two objects shot straight up to the sky and within 5 seconds or so became as distant as the stars themselves.(Very faint light but visible). The distance traveled in time was incredible. It appeared that the craft flew 200-250 miles upward in a matter of 5 seconds. (I know that this must defy our most current-to-date physics????) The Craft that I saw did not have blue or red lights on them as far as I could see so they did not appear to be planes at all. As I said, there was two other planes flying in the vacinity which circled around and flew South-West toward Rockford Airport direction. I would find it hard to believe that the pilots did not witness this also but I can&#39;t prove or dis-prove that. All I know is what I saw, which I cannot explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were resembled the effect a strong searchlight would make on an overcast night sky, but there were no clouds, no haze and no smog and there was no light beam as there would have been if we had been observing a searchlight.  There was no noise.  Their speed seemed faster than any low flying conventional aircraft could possibly attain.  We were in a sparsely populated point of land that extends into the Atlantic Ocean and there were no known nearby cars or headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/30/03 19:45|San Francisco|CA|Unknown|30 seconds|Bright light with a long tailing streak moving Westward|10/7/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31957.html|4|ndxe200309| Bright light with a long tailing streak moving Westward<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saw a very bright light with a very long streak behind it heading East to West. My guess is that is was a piece of space debris burning up in the atmosphere. It was moving faster that a a jet would move but much slower than a shooting star. The light was quite bright. Mostly white, possibly slightly blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/30/03 19:30|De Kalb|NY|Fireball|3 hours|Multiple orange balls drifting slowly downward apparently over Fort Drum, NY|3/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35258.html|5|ndxe200309| Multiple orange balls drifting slowly downward apparently over Fort Drum, NY<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving to my farm from Ogdensburg, NY travelling South East on Rt. 812 about 5 miles from De Kalb at about 19:30 when an orange ball suddenly illuminated directly front of me and just as suddenly winked out after a few seconds.  About 2 miles father along it, or another, reappeared and a second appeared along side it and after about 30 seconds they winked out one at a time.  Within a couple of minutes I turned right onto COR17 and then left onto the road my farm is located on which runs South West probably a bit more south so SSW.  As I cleared the hill at the beginning of the road another pair of orange balls were visible which also winked out again within 30-45 seconds.  I arrived at the farm about 19:50 and as the dogs and I exited the truck 2 or 3 orange balls illuminated to the SE in the direction of Fort Drum, NY.  These stayed illuminated for some time and I was now looking at them through a pair of 7X50 and 12X50 binoculars.  Even with he binoculars they looked round and I could see the lights of what I assumed were helicopters near them.  About 20:20 or thereabouts I called my neighbor and asked him to look in the direction of Fort Drum and tell me what he saw.  At first he said he didn&#39;t see anything but then I heard his wife say that she could see them and she redirected his gaze so that he also was seeing them.  The balls of orange were now staying illuminated for a considerable time, 10 to 15 minutes.  I called a friend of mine who lives in Governeur, NY and asked her if she could see them, she could not.  I talked to her for quite a while telling her when they were illuminated and when they were not but she never saw them.  The orange balls appeared to drift slowly downward very slowly.  While looking at them with my high powered binoculars it appeared to me that I could see a vertical smoke trail above them.  I re-called my neighbors who had seen them and asked it they could see the apparent smoke trails; they also saw them.  We then decided that they were some sort! of flares that the Army was dropping.  I watched them on and off until about 22:30 when they winked out for good.  As I recall it was a clear night and the moon came out full or nearly so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The apparent size of the balls was such that it would have taken 4 or 5 to cross the moon.  The apparent brightness was about the same as the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today whilst I was perusing your files I came across the report by the young man from Parishville, NY who saw similar orange balls over Drum in mid Sept 2003.  I started reconsidering what I had observed and although they may well have been some type of flare I could see no parachute canopy.  The apparent smoke trail was vertical which had there been a canopy above the flare one would expect that the smoke would have been dispersed or disturbed somewhat.  I have had experience with  USAF ground illumination flares; they were not orange, they were the brilliant white of burning magnesium.  With all of the night vision optics used by the military today I would not expect them to be using flares.  I spent 10 years active duty in the USAF 2 of them as a weapons mechanic 2 in college and 6 as a an Astro/Aero Engineer working space track radar for a year and 5 years as a flight test instrumentation Engineer.  After leaving the USAF I worked for a pyrotechnics company for a couple of years then as an Electronic Engineer for the Navy, Air Force and finally the Army from which I retired in 1995 as a DoD civilian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the witness for his submitting such a thorough report.  We have invited him to attempt to perform triangulation on the location of the flares, and to contact local military facilities, to determine whether they might have launched flares on this date.

It had to be moving very fast because it was only visible for 10 to 12 seconds. I am a locomotive engineer by profession, I was sitting in a Union Pacific Railroad siding called Hestes, located btween Hutto and Taylor, Texas. I had pulled in behind another train and was waiting for an opposing train. I walked out the back door of the engine and was standing on the walkway. Hestes is rather remote and is a good place for star gazing, that&#39;s what I was doing when the object caught my eye. The lights on the object gave it an oblong appearance, sort of like a domino with the corners rounded off. Some of the lights on the object appeared slightly oblong also. The lights were white, but not a brilliant white, they did not appear to shine downward and there were no blinking lights visible. The object appeared about 1:15 AM. It was a clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife thinks it&#39;s a plane but I told her you should have seen it&#39;s movement, It flew off really FAST and was out of sight!  I was home from work this last Tuesday , 9-30-03, the time was about 11:45 to 12:30 p.m., not quite sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first noticed it, it was just hovering and slowly moving sideways a bit, just west of our house, maybe about 5-8 miles,and  I would say somewhere between 2000 to 5000 ft ?? Not sure, when I rushed back outside with my cam, it flew off after 10 or so seconds, in a north, northeast direction ( there is also a small airport in that direction too) VERY high velocity also, in a few seconds it was gone!  This is the second time I have captured something strange on film, the other time, I caught on film what looked like a B1b bomber at high altitude. but I never saved it though. If I would have thought of it at the time, I would have put the cam on record, it takes short 30 sec videos, oh well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for allowing me to post the report and pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To view pictures: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/yukon_ufo.htm  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

As I came into town, I watched for a policeman to stop but there were none, my son watched the object as I drove.  It remained stationary altho a couple planes were also in the sky.  We went into the store and when we came out about 45 min. later, it was gone.  As I drove home, watching to see if I could spot it again, I saw it, originally in the western sky, now in the northern sky, same height and still hovering.  We are 30 miles from an airport and I see planes all day and night but this was not a plane nor helicopter.  I tried to find our telescope to see if I could focus it, but it was unavailable.  After about an hour of checking back and forth, the object was no longer anywhere that I could see.  But the entire time I did see it, it never seemed to change altitude or position, when it was in the west or in the north.  There are  many planes here and in the morning and early evening, the sun reflects off them and they shine like a bright orange cigar traveling across the sky.  This was not the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/29/03 20:35|Yellowstone National Park|WY|Sphere|2 - 3 seconds|Saw a 6" red ball flying from south to north about 3' off the ground on US 20 in Yellowstone National Park on September 29, 2003.|10/15/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32225.html|16|ndxe200309| Saw a 6&#34; red ball flying from south to north about 3&#39; off the ground on US 20 in Yellowstone National Park on September 29, 2003.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving west on US 20 approximately 10 miles east of the west entrance to Yellowstone National Park. My wife was in the front passenger seat. The time was 20:35 (8:35 PM Mountain time) on Friday night September 29, 2003. The sun had already set, so it was quite dark. This is a wilderness area that we were in, no lights what so ever for miles. No other vehicles were in the area. The skies were clear. One could practically reach up and touch the stars. The landscape on each side of the two lane road had new pine tree growth with a height of 4 to 10 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were traveling about 30MPH with the windows rolled down so we could hear the elk bugling in the not so far distance. Suddenly and without warning, approximately 3 feet off the ground and 30 feet in front of us, a red sphere darted across the road from left to right (south to north). The color was that of a lit tail light lens, but not bright as if brakes were applied. This completely circular object, about 6&#34; in diameter, flew straight for the short duration that we saw it. Sighting was lost as it entered the trees. This was not a flash of light bouncing off an object and again, no other vehicles were within sight. Nothing was said to each other until I stopped at a pull-off a couple of miles down the road. We then looked at each other and I asked my wife, &#34;Did you see that back there?&#34; Her reply was, &#34;I wasn&#39;t going to say anything until you did. What was that red ball?&#34; We compared notes. We indeed did see a 6&#34; red ball flying from left to right about 3&#39; off the ground. No sound was noted.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to have an orange yellow tail with a bright white center. Both my wife and I saw it through the widow of our car.  We had just been prompting our children to look at the moon as it was very clear in the sky tonight and the area we were in was very dark...the stars and moon were very visible. The streak started just in front of us and tailed downward. We both commented on how strange it was to see a streak last so long and move so slowly....either a very large meteor and very high?  we immediately commented on the incident in India<n>

Seen from 280 freeway going south by my husband...he called me and I grabbed my camera jumper in the car and viewed them (orange) driving north. Sadly no film in camera. I saw them orange...my husband white. Maybe because sun was setting and viewed from different directions 20 minuets apart. copters and planes near ...many people must of seen as cars were slowing on the freeway and people were out of there cars on side roads viewing.

I live just West of Arlington airport.  It may have been a balloon but it would have to be very large because of the altitude,  I am guessing 30,000 - 50,000 feet high.  I could barley see it with my naked eye.  I got out the binockulars for a better look.  It appeared to be tear drop and looked as though the bottom was moving around.  I have never seen a weather balloon,  it was to high to be an ordinary hot air ballon,  and it was deffinetly metalic because the sun was reflecting off of it.  It moved slow from my vantage point,  it took about 5 minutes to go from 11:00 high to 1:00 high.   One other thing I noticed,  at the time I spotted this thing,  the birds all around we cherping loudly every where.  At about the time I lost sight of this thing the birds stoped as well,  maybe just a strange co-incidence.....  Did any body else see this thing??<n>

It seemed almost translucent but it really was not. It was really beautiful to look at for the few seconds that I saw it. I was driving and there were mountains in the area blocking my view after I came around a bend in the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We both witnessed a very bright light at about a 70 degree angle from the ground dance around in the same general vicinity for about an hour.  This object was much bighter than the planet Mars and any other object in the sky.  It appeared to be closer to earth than any other &#34;light&#34; in the sky.  We watched it as it seemed to skip around, sometimes moving up and down, sometimes moving sideways, and it even moved in a circular path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please someone tell me that you know what this is and saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Ordinarily, we would suspect that the witnesses might have been looking at a &#34;twinkling&#34; star, but there are no twinkling stars that are brighter than Mars is, currently.

So then we came out to watch it and at first the light was really visible and seemed like it was moving slowly to the right and the left for awhile and then would remain stationary.  When veiwing it through the binoculars or video camera it would just bebop all around the screen even though the camera was steady.  we watched this for about 4 hours.  The video tape is amazing.  we have the object changing colors from green to red to blue and then all of a sudden stretched out and then disappears into a cresent shape and then it took a couple minutes to find it again.  then it was back doing the same thing again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable &#34;twinkling&#34; stars, we suspect.

I witnessed an object in the sky that was brighter than Mars.  I grabbed a low powered telescope that I own and took a closer look. It had a short round tear drop shape with five distinct trails.  The longest trail was the center, and immediately following the center trail was, what I thought to be a moon.  Several observations lead me to believe this was more than common siteing of a planet.  The first was a bright &#34;D&#34; shape in the middle extending from the top of the tear drop.  An arch extended from the center of the straight part of the letter &#34;D&#34; downward toward the bottom of the raindrop.  The other thing that grabbed my attention is the fact that the darn thing was moving.  It was everything I could do to get four good looks at the thing.  I drew a couple of pictures of what I saw, but when I went to take another look at the thing it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have had several similar reports from NM, AZ, and TX recently, which makes us wonder whether there may be a high-altitude, helium-filled research balloon in the skies above those states.

WE WANT 1<n> <n><n> <n><n> This night was the last night of archery hunting season for Oregon. Myself and my friend of twenty years took our time coming down off the mountain. We stopped at a privately owned piece of property towards the bottom to bugle (call) elk that are frequently in the area just for fun. It was dark by this time. My friend bugled a couple of times out of the passenger seat and something caught my eye. I don&#39;t know how to explain why , it just didn&#39;t move right it seemed to zig-zag in a way that was so smooth and precise that you wouldn&#39;t notice easily. The objects view was blocked by a tree for a couple of seconds when I told my friend to check it out when it appeared again and let me know if it was zig-zagging. He confirmed it and we both grabbed binoculars and exited the vehicle. The object was a light-blue panel of light emitted in a almost fog like way but the panel itself was clearly defined. We were not able to see any shadows or parts of the object that you would assume would have to be above the panel. It zig-zagged from the west to the east for about a 45 degree amount of sky and I can&#39;t tell you if it stopped but I noticed a twinkle off to the side and what appeared to be below the object. The object then went up and it did it QUICKLY! There was never a sound or a streak trailer or anything. We are positive that the light didn&#39;t just go out, it went away from earth at a speed that just does not make sense. We stood in awe talking about it for 5-10 minutes when the first of 6 or seven jets or planes showed up. They had red bue strobes and seemed to be patroling the same airspace the light was in only minutes before. We do not have any airforce for a few hundred miles but they seemed to come from both the southeast and northwest. We did not notice the speed of the light until we saw how slowly the jets/planes movement across the sky was in comparison. Altitude looked relatively the same. We are not sure but the jets/planes seemed to slowly gain altitude and take up positions surroundi! ng the area very high up. This was all seen in a matter of 1-1 1/2 hours. Baker county is very near the 45 parallel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM SAME WITNESS, SUBMITTED JANUARY 15, 2005))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lessons learned<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am your 9/28/03 eastern oregon submitter. I Just wanted to drop a few thoughts on the subject after honestly having faced the fact that there are no rules or limits. I have spent a great deal of time &#34;looking up&#34; over the past year and will continue to &#34;sleep under the stars&#34; every once in a while but I refuse to let what I have seen absorb so much of my life. I have since had a cowardly object &#34;look my way&#34; on two seperate occassions. My opinion is that these objects move in a friction-less pathway(vacuum?)that is somehow created in an open environment. I can&#39;t help but feel like however and whatever is going on up there gives me a feeling of &#34;trouble on the horizon&#34; and short of grabbing a .50cal or whatever I can get my hands on and trying my best to &#34;get some&#34; or have &#34;my effect&#34; on their lives. I have decided to have faith and &#34;keep on keepin on&#34;. You really do get what you look for.-((initials deleted))<n>

We saw a large egg shaped object (too big for a planet)about 35-40 degrees up in the eastern sky.  We stared at it and wondered what it was and it changed colors from whitish yellow to red and then back to white. It was reflecting (we think) the sun as it set. It moved a little but nothing erratic. It gradually faded.  We went out to dinner and talked to several other people who saw it.  Then we asked the local police and they laughed and said it was a weather balloon and they had alot of calls on it.  I contacted the national weather service and inquired about any possible weather ballon launchings.  I received an email back from a weather rep. and he stated that they certainly did not launch any in that area (also the object was far too large) and that he had seen it also as did hundreds of others.  Possibly miliary, NASA, private or what.....no one knows.  So, in conclusion I think it deserves to be reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received several reports from the CA/AZ/NM area recently of what we suspect are high-altitude helium balloons.  This may be one of those reports.  PD))<n>

We turned the corner of the building and right away I saw this object in the sky. It was silver and was reflecting the sunlight. As soon as I saw it I was sure it was not a airliner - it had no wings or tail. It was traveling at a slow steady speed in a straight line traveling basically from North to South. I called my neighbor out and we watched it for a good three minutes. It would at times appear to me as a disc or a saucer and at other times it looked like a cylinder. There was no sound. Nothing. It continued on it&#39;s way at the same speed on the same course across the sky until it went out of sight. It was flying a little higher than the level of commercial aircraft in our area but it was clearly not high altitude. It wasn&#39;t an incredible experience but I would like to know how something like that could fly without wings or a tail. Or Sound. Oh and one last thing there was no wind and it was traveling to fast to be a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On this day I happened to look up and I do sometimes to watch the aircraft play dogfight. Most days you cannot see anything because of the haze but every great once and a while you can... On this day I spotted 3 spheres together... they were in a cluster... I never saw them make any irradict moves nor did I ever see them separate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had a metallic look to their finish... since all of the jets were about 10k I can only assume these were somewhere in the same realm.

It was the 24th and I saw for the second time in a year an unusual black void in the sky above my home on Cape Cod.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were  no stars within the black phenomena even though it was a particularly starry evening. It was as if there was a jet black blob that changed shape from an oblong to a kidney shape up above. My dogs were trembling as if there was a thunder storm in progress. It was the strangest thing I had ever seen and to see 2 similar occurences in the same year that effected my dogs the same way each time was really weird. OK!! Now it&#39;s getting creepy because less than an hour ago I saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time it was moving very fast as it crossed the horizon. I was alone(no dogs) and it was most definitely the same object or whatever it is , as the 2 times before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is not a starry night at all and it is overcast. This time it stuck out like a sore thumb against the clouded sky. The object was traveling Southwest and was moving at a fair clip, which is totally different from the way I observed it the last 2 times, when it was barely moving at all. This is a strange thing and I would love to know what it is. I know that there is an Air Force Base less than a few miles from my house but it&#39;s no plane that&#39;s for sure, because it is a massive area. I can&#39;t estimate the size because I have no idea of how high above it is.  Anyway, any ideas? I&#39;m stumped and determined to get a picture worth sharing with everyone. Has anyone else seen this before? I would be grateful for any information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again ((name deleted)), MA<n>

It hovered for quite some time making quick erattic movements from time to time (up, down, left,right - which ruled out it being a star, plane or helicopter) but overal stayed in the same location. Could not see visible shape, determine altitude or location over which it hovered - could have been Puyallup area.

It just didn&#39;t make sense to me why I would be able to see it for hours while most reports lasts a few minutes at most. If it hadn&#39;t looked like it was moving I probaply would have just thought of it as a really bright star - and your explanation on why it seemed to move makes sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reading up on some of the other reports on  the board, someone mentioned the sirius star which I think would&#39;ve been in that general area at that time.

We wonder whether he might have witnessed the three satellites that &#34;fly&#34; in formation, and which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy &#34;NOSS&#34; satellite surveillance system.  We have corrected the time to 01:28 hrs..  PD))<n>

There was no sound coming from it at all and it did not seem to be moving very fast but fast enough to be gone when I tried to find our camcorder. It had lights that just seemed to glow, not beam like a normal aircraft. There were 10 or 12 lights on this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a ufo. I spent time in the navy working on aircraft on the flightdeck of the USS Eisenhower and have seen planes flying in formation at night, and this was definitely not normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guarantee you that I am not the only one that saw this.

We first observed from in our home through the window and ran outside immediately. We noted that there were no other flashing lights of any kind or color, and it made no sound. We live in Burien, WA., a few miles from Sea-Tac airport and are used to seeing various aircraft in the sky. We also see King Co. police helecopter Gurdian One, frequently. We both noticed this object as it was so different in appearance from anything else we have seen. When we ran outside, my neighor was talking to her daughter and son in law who were about to depart. I called it to there attention and they witnessed it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared as a bright green glowing light about the size of a pea at arms length. It seemed to zig-zag some as it traveled and to be going faster than typical aircraft. Perhaps 30 seconds total time we observed it. It made no noticable sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This object of intensive white color did have a saucer shape and the outline was in light red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object must have been only 35-40 meters, or even closer,  away AND it was not sitting still but moving up and down. I got very scared and my heart started pumping like crazy..I am still shaking.. The whole scenario lasted for only 15 seconds before the saucer became invisible.. There was some heat coming from it and it stank like rotten eggs...sulphur like smell but somehow different!!

I was standing down near the ocean in Myrtle Beach,South Carolina with some friends and we saw a large light in the sky. A large white light turned red and split apart into 2 red lights in the sky. The red lights would stay there for about a minute and they would disapear. The same thing happen again down the beach, big white light went out while smaller red lights shoot out, the large white light disapeared again! We saw jets (military) Aircraft coming from the area of Shaw Air Force Base out of Sumter,S.C. go out to the location of where the lights were, as though they were searching for what I had seen in the sky. This has happen several times a week in the sky and almost the same spot. The jets would fly out circling and I&#39;m sure they was sent out for that purpose. The jets had weapons on them as if they were on a misson! I have seen these lights off and on the whole month of September. I saw the UFO&#39;s over the ocean and the jets landed at Myrtle Beach airport, every time the jets showed up the lights never appeared! The Jets stayed at the Myrtle Beach Airport 4 days and no lights! It was like the (UFO&#39;s) knew when the jets were around because they never showed back up until the jets left.  I surf fish almost every night in September and October (The fall months) because the fishing is the best, These nights were clear and I could tell what was stars and what was not. These things (UFO&#39;s)that I saw was not Stars!..not any that I&#39;ve ever saw! I have seen serveral UFO&#39;s over the past 15 years, There was a write up in the Myrtle Beach News Paper about these lights and a lot of people reported seeing them, I will try and get the news paper about the reports of sightings. There are UFO&#39;s in Myrtle Beach, S.C. Thank You, Ed<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/27/03 20:50|George|WA|Light|10-15 seconds|Object observed from Gorge Amphitheater on September 27, 2003.|9/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31911.html|50|ndxe200309| Object observed from Gorge Amphitheater on September 27, 2003.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the above noted date and time, my wife and I were attending a concert at the Gorge Amphitheater in George, Washington 98848. The artist, James Taylor, had just returned from intermission and was beginning the first song of the second set when I looked upward to the stars. I noted the location of the North Star to the right of the stage, then looked over my right shoulder and noted the location of Mars. I then lay back in the grass and just watched the sky for several minutes while the artist performed. As I was looking upward, I observed a satellite rising from the Southeast, to the east of Mars location in the sky. According to the NASA Liftoff website, there were three satellites visible to the East from this zip code within this time frame: Cosmos 1340 from 20:32:34 pm to 20:45:16 pm, Lo 19 from 20:37:59 pm to 20:52:37 pm, and Cosmos 1674 from 20:40:32 pm to 20:54:04 pm. I only observed one of the above listed satellites and it rose from the left side, or East side, of Mars: the only satellite listed above that matched the trajectory of the satellite I observed is Lo 19. I am listing this information for the following reasons: I was not wearing a watch and have only an estimate of the actual time of the observation; The second object I observed from this location was on a similar trajectory and was approximately the same observable size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes after Lo 19 passed, I observed the second object, approaching from approximately the same area of the sky. It appeared to be approximately the same size as the first object I observed. Although it was red in color, I assumed it was another satellite. As it moved North across the sky, I noted the velocity of the object was considerably greater than the first object and I called my wife&amp;#8217;s attention to it. I pointed out the object to my wife and we both observed as it continued in a straight trajectory for approximately 2-3 seconds then turned right, to the east. It continued on to the east then began to turn randomly to the left and right, finally turning back toward the area where I had first observed it. It moved in a straight line for a few seconds then began turning randomly again, moving farther South East and disappearing on the night horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was red in color with a light aura or haze around it that extended out approximately twice the width of the object itself, becoming somewhat brighter at the edge, which created a &#34;ring&#34; effect around the object.  The object moved in what appeared to be perfectly straight lines with no observable arch. The turns were rapid and precise, never less than 90 degrees as I recall, and the object neither accelerated nor decelerated before, during or after each turn.<n>

I took the N.Y.State Thruway home.  I was traveling alone. Somewhere between the Catskill and Coxsackie exits I saw a triangular-shaped object approaching from the north-west.  It moved very slowly and hovered over the lane I was in.  It had 3 red lights along it&#39;s points that did not flash.  As it moved over my car I looked up through my windshield and saw the body of the craft.  It was a matte gray.  My windows were closed so I could not discern if there was sound or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A mile or two before this occured, I noticed a police car along along the left side of the Thruway.  All traffic slowed down because of this.  Once this object appeared,  all cars accelerated to speeds of 80-85mph.  I know others saw this and I want to find out if anyone else has reported a sighting on this night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a public school teacher in New York.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft then made an abrupt change of flying quickly towards the north-north-east direction until it passed behind a building near the horizon. The craft was one single color of white-yellow.  No windows could be seen.  It was not a plane since it lacked the blinking wing lights.  Like I said, it was farther up in the atmosphere than planes fly, but still lower than the ISS or satelites that we watch go by.  When it moved in the beginning, I had taken it for a star since I was staring at the part of the sky for quite a few minutes.  It moved across half of the sky in only 1 minute-90 seconds, stopped for 10 seconds, and made a 120 degree angle turn.  What aircraft do we have that can pull this off? None!  Circular and cylindar craft have been seen in this are many times recently.  When will this be researched?  I a middle aged professional, do not take drugs, hardly ever drink, and have no psychological problems.  It just seems funny that people in the Southern Tier of NY report all of these craft, but never make it to the newspapers or TV stations.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My daughter and I had just stopped at McDonalds and were heading home on Main Street in Sumner, Washington. As we reached the traffic light at Wood Avenue, the light turned red. We were stopped behind one car and had a view of the down town area. I looked down the street and up to the sky and seen a silver sphere high in the sky. It was gleaming cuz the sun was reflecting off of it which had caught my eye. I&#39;m not sure if it was rotating but I got the feeling it was. I am not sure of the distance but seemed to be close to the flight pattern the airplanes travel on their way to Sea-Tac International Airport. Just as I was going to bring it to my daughter&#39;s attention - it disappeared. One minute it was there, shining brightly and the next it was gone. This is the second time I&#39;ve seen a bright silver, sphere disappear in the skies but the first time was in August of this year while we were in Dresslerville, Nevada. At that time, my daughter seen it too however it disappeared to me but she swears she still could see it at which time we turned left away from the object - that day was also clear, no clouds and around 90 degrees. I&#39;ve had many questionable sightings but one amazing sighting in June of 1975 in Bonney Lake, Washington coming down Highway 410 into Sumner. That also was a bright sunny day without any clouds. This craft was silverish and saucer shaped but with a dome on top. At the bottom of the dome was huge bright lights that reminded me of strobe lights, blinking around the bottom of the dome. My stepdad (non-believer) brought it to my attention and as I looked out of driver&#39;s side window I was totally astonished to see this. This craft stayed nearly parallel with us as we almost reached the 2nd exit to Sumner. It sped up and was over the Rivergrove apartments when it just vanished. This sighting lasted about 10 minutes and I&#39;ve been searching the skies ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of five reports from same witness.  PD))<n>

At 5:00 a.m. on that day  they noticed and filmed blue lights close to their home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses watched the blue lights travel from the east and then stopped  near their home as seen in the photos below.  The  lights stayed in the area for approximately 20 minutes. I asked the folks if they knew which direction the lights went and they were both unsure.  They may have looked away for a minute or two and then when they glanced back the lights were gone.  Then on the same morning, two hours later, they  saw  more some strange objects and took photos of them as well.  I found the pictures to be very interesting and beautiful with the rainbow as a backdrop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A number of objects can be seen very clearly in the pictures. The witnesses said the objects stayed in their area for approximately an hour, and told me this event was extraordinary.  They watched them flying north and maneuver themselves as if they were lining up one after another.  They also would change positions, spreading out, and coming back together once again.  At one point the witness said they seemed to  leap frog over one another..  It was a strange and exciting experience for the couple.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the witnesses said someone else must have surely seen this event as it lasted so long and was so very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would really like to thank the couple for sending me the pictures and report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pictures can be found here: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/minnesota_into_canada.htm  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

The brightest object appears in the SE sky closest to the horizon and cannot be made out with a novice&#39;s telescope or binoculars.  It is bright and is blinking the whole spectrum of light, almost like the sun is reflecting light off of something.  They are moving very slowly.  They appear to stay in the same place looking at them with the naked eye, but viewing through a telecope, the position has to be changed like a slow orbiting planet.  We have been viewing them for about an hour now.  Even thought they look like they are hovering over Renton or Tacoma, (Maybe even farther South &amp; East), you can deduce that they are along ways away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is this some sort of a beacon or satellites that are reflecting light.  I see purple, red, blue, white, orange, etc.  The light is almost blinding looking at it from a telescope.  You cannot tell any kind of shape because the light is too bright.  It looks like a police car hovering in the sky at a great distance.<n>

9/26/03 21:00|Richmond|KY|Light|~1 hour|Long duration sighting, likely at least 10 miles distance, but undoubtedly strange behavior.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34143.html|64|ndxe200309| Long duration sighting, likely at least 10 miles distance, but undoubtedly strange behavior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking my dog West, on Ole Daniel Boone Road, toward I-75. I had been watching the sky quite a bit because Mars had been close to Earth and this is also the first I have lived back out away from city lights in about 10 years. There was what I thought was a star, cradled in a dip in the tree line. It looked large the way Mars had, so I was particulary interested, though Mars at this time of night was SouthEast. I thought it might be a larger planet or something, but when my dog stopped to go to relieve himself, I realized that it was moving. There were powerlines that also ran through the dip in the tree line that gave a point of reference and it was moving in relation to that, most noticeably. I figured that it would be gone shortly, so I stood a and watched it a while. I didn&#39;t think it&#39;s movement was anything a helicopter couldn&#39;t do, but I also knew, from a figure I&#39;d just heard that it costs about $500/hr. to operate a helicopter and that helicopters are typically going somewhere. What point would there be to just bobbing and drifting side, after dark? I was basically white and oval and some times seemed to shade to having a blue-ish halo. The center never changed colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept expecting it to dart off as they supposedly do, but after a while, I decided I wanted to see if I could get some witnesses, so I could talk about it to somebody without them thinking I was making it up. So, we ran back to my fourplex where we have a second floor apartment, where my wife, sister-in-law and nephew were. I breathlessly  (I&#39;m overweight) told them to come out on the balcony, hoping that it would still be there. It was a little harder to see, because there&#39;s a big orange security light behind the building, but it was still there. We stood back there and watched it and talked about it for a long time, and we all were kind of waiting for it to dart off, but it just bobbed and weaved. I actually knelt down and put my chin on the heels of my hands to make sure my head moving wasn&#39;t making it look like some fixed object was moving because the treeline was only about 100 yards away. I saw on FOX that a lot of people watching Area 51 thought they were seeing a UFO weave side to side, but that they were seeing an airliner, bringing people to work there, correcting itself, as it was approaching a runway. So we talked about that for a while and decided that if we were watching a plane from head-on that it would eventually make some progress, but it never seemed to. My nephew didn&#39;t really understand what it was and was starting to get bored and acting up a little bit, so we actually all just finally went inside and the clock showed it was 10:10, but my wife sets it up a few minutes so she won&#39;t be late for work, where there&#39;s a fast clock. When my sister-in-law left, about 30 minutes later, we looked again from the parking lot to see if it was still there and we didn&#39;t see it, but she later told us that as she was driving home she could see it, West of I-75, but South of where she lives in Lexington. If I had to guess, I believe the light was between Richmond and Nicholasville, KY. I would not have reported this, normally, but I have just read the story of what happened in Morehead, KY and the c! rop formation in Flemingsburg. Though this may not be a particularly interesting UFO story, it may be significant that there was a certain level of activity in Central and Eastern Kentucky, within a certain time frame. I am going to e-mail an animated gif I have created in photoshop to demonstrate, in a very simple way, how it behaved, though it didn&#39;t move quite this jerky and had no particular pattern of movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have altered the date above to 2003, which we believe is what the witness intended.

I asked if I could call to see if I was able to get anymore details on the sighting. Everyone agreed and I called. I talked to her husband, the witness who watched something fly through the sky. The witness said the object would have been seen both in Wa. State and in British Columbia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between 8:30 to 9:00 p.m. the fellow took his dog outside so it could do it&#39;s business. It was a clear night and he was looking up at the stars. The fellow saw a strange light fly across the sky, which he first thought might have been a satellite. The object/light was traveling west to east. He said it was just a little smaller than the planet Mars, but very bright. The witness mentioned it traveled on a straight line, but the strange thing was, it moved from side to side as it moved across the sky. His thoughts were of a Jet Ski bouncing up and down over the waves, but in this case the light was moving from side to side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was a faint blue/white in color. No tail was noticed following behind. The man also described the light as being spherical in shape. Although it was rather high up, the witness did not believe it was as high where one would find a satellite. No sound was heard, no response from his dog after the light passed overhead. The light was extremely bright and as it moved towards the east and it just faded out.

The object appeared at roughly 35-40o above the horizon.  I have seen satellites and airplanes traveling in the night sky before and this did not look like one.  I did, about an hour later that evening, see satellites and planes flying.  The object in question was as bright as a star, did not have any blinking/flashing lights nor make any passing sound.  We watched it for about 5 min before it disappeared behind trees and we lost sight of it.  I could not tell if the object relected the light or if it made it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first it looked like the shape of a blimp because it was rather large and it couldn&#39;t have been a plane because it moved slowly. I&#39;m just curious if anyone else in Seattle saw this. I was at a distance, without binoculars, so it could be something normal like a blimp, but it seemed rather odd at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A blimp has been reported in the Seattle area for the weekend of September 27/28, 2003.

There was a storm coming in quickly to my right. My area of view is blocked to my left from my roof and trees block my view to my right leaving me a large patch of viewing sky in the middle. From my left a massive object appeared into my view and moved at a rapid pace towards the storm on my right. I got a great look at this object. It was shaped like an Indian arrow head. The front part of the triagle had 4 rod shaped glowing flourescent lights in a wedge shape and 2 on the back corners. The lights did not project. The center of this object looked transparent as it passed. For 15 seconds it sped across the sky without a sound. I held my hand up at arm&#39;s length and the object was slightly larger than it. I thought because of the massive size that it was flying by at a low altittude but when it reached the storm to my right I saw it go above the storm out of my view, not through it. I have a video camea with night vision and I&#39;ll be ready. I should of known better being a UFO enthusiast and neck kinking sky watcher. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The night was clear, no rain for weeks, no clouds in the sky. Temp was perhaps 9-12deg. Stars could easily be seen. I don&#39;t recall wether the moon was out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object Movement : Moving southwest. Approx 100-200m off ground. Travelling slowly and an airborne object, perhaps around 100-140kph. After it had passed to perhaps 1km south west of us it seemed we could only see a static red light(not flashing or any kind of strobe effect). Once we saw the red light we continued seeing it for another 40 seconds before we had passed it(on our left) and it was obscured behind the Motorway walls travelling south approx above the Cumberland Highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description : Perhaps 3 Egg shapes locked in to a tight structure. no connecting structure was seen but they remain at a constant distance and in the same formation. We saw the bottom of this(these) object(s), so what we actually saw resembled the bottom fifth of an egg. Initially it looked exactly like three white helicopters in a very tight formation. The objects appeared lit from below by a weak light. There didn&#39;t appear to be anywhere the light was coming from. Not the ground and the was nothing beneath the object. While the object(s) was at it&#39;s closest we saw no lights flashing or static, just the three weakly lit egg surfaces. At no point did we see anything above the three surfaces. The three surfaces that we saw were equally sized, perhaps the 4-5m across each 6-7m long and perhaps 10m apart. This did NOT look like a commercial airliner from below, the closest object we could associate it with would be three large white helicopters in a dangerously perhaps impossibly tight formation, again no flashing lights you&#39;d expect to see on aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife travels this route nightly at the same time, Mon-Fri. Never before has this appeared nor any following nights. There are no nearby airports. Helicopter reports of the Sydney Motorways\highways are seen in peak hour only(morning \ afternoon.) and generally fly 3-4 times higher than this object. Traffic on the roads at that time is sparse yet constant car \ 100m). There was no acidents or unusual traffic events. There would have been a number of cars facing this object as it passed before us. It looked extremely &#39;out of place&#39; like seeing a jumbo 50m off the ground, very wrong in the context of the medium density built up residential area. My wife mad a comment that it looked like an object &#34;poking out of the bottom of a cloud&#34; or &#34;out of some fog&#34; to describe the way only a few slightly curved surfaces could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [Feel free to contact me for more info.

9/25/03 22:20|Marstons Mills|MA|Unknown|@5 minutes|The sky above me was solid black, no stars ,no light of any kind and the black void changed it's shape.|9/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31841.html|82|ndxe200309| The sky above me was solid black, no stars ,no light of any kind and the black void changed it&#39;s shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time in the past year that this incident has happened. When it happened last time I reported it to another UFO web page I came across on the WEB. I came across this web page a few weeks after the first occurence last Feb/March or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well this is the strangest and most eerie thing that has ever happened to me. A short while ago as I was walking my dogs they started to pace and hide behind me, much like they do when there is a storm w/lightning and thunder. And almost exactly as it happened before, the area above me turned pitch black. I mean it was as if the sky had been painted over. The area was huge from my vantage point.Well put it this way it was either huge and far away or it was closer than I thought it was. I mean there were no stars, no clouds, no light of any kind. I could see a defined edge but the shape changed from oblong to kidney shape and then to a distorted sphere of some kind. There was no noise of any kind, and the black shape moved at a pretty slow pace. It covered very little area in the 5 or so minutes that I could see it. I was determined to get a picture of it and I walked over to my car and grabbed the binocular/digital camera I bought myself a few weeks ago to snap pictures of the birds around my yard. I started snapping like mad and took at least 50 exposures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of them ended up looking like anything except a shot of BLACK and nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would be pretty hard to get a good picture of it unless it was a crystal clear night loaded with stars.( unfortunately tonight was a bit mixed with clouds and pockets of stars) I am so excited that I was able to verify to myself that I wasn&#39;t going crazy. Last time I was all by myself with the dogs and I had to keep telling myself that I saw what I saw and that it was OK. But tonight I saw it again and this time it hung there in the sky for a goodwhile. The creepy part of the whole thing was that last time I only saw it for a few moments maybe 1/2 a minute but this time not only did I see it on approach to where it stopped but I saw it leave as well. It just picked up speed and within a few seconds it had risen into the night sky and I could see stars taking the place of the object as it rose and then it was gone out of site. It was awesome and I wish I knew what the heck it was and who the heck they were. Well that&#39;s it. The whole truth and nothing but the truth. Thanks for keeping such a great resource site for those of us who have been fortunate enough to see such an amazing phenomonen. Thanks to all! ((name deleted)) Marstons Mills, Massachusetts<n>

I noticed a bright light that flickered on the surrounding cars aad drugsore parking lot, and immediately looked up.  It was a quarter moon shaped object with the horns either pointing upwards or to the west (hard to tell vertical/horizontal orientation at night).  The object was a brilliantly lit white, with two slighlty darker spots about 1/3 the way in from each end.  The lighting remiscent of the glow of a neon light.  It traveled from south/southeast to north/northwest, at a very high rate of speed, which I would estimate to be 2 times that of an airliner, maybe 600-650 mph.  It must have been low in the sky, because I first notice that it lit up the parking lot somewhat, however, it was above the low clouds as I saw it disappear behing a cloud; it did not re-emerge.  No sound at all.  Direction appeared to be a straight line.  I&#39;ve seen plenty of meteors and other objects in the sky before, but I was always able to satisfy myself that they were normal occurrences.  This was not a normal aerial object.  I also surprised myself with the amount of detail that I was able to recall from such a brief sighting.  No tail or trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> V shaped Formation  over Newport, AR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was travelling west on AR Route 14 towards Newport, US Route 67 interchange was about 5 miles away, traffic was light.   I noticed a light that was changing in color from red to blue to yellow to green and back to red.  At first, I thought it was an aerial applicator, but drove past 2 other aerial applicator aerodromes on AR Route 14 back towards Harrisburg, AR where the planes were grounded.  Perhaps this was an aerial applicator heading home, but then again on a Thursday night?  Then I saw another light changing colors in the same sequence as the first.   The lights were moving parrallel from North to South and were now both south of AR Route 14.  I turned on to the on ramp to go south to Little Rock, AR on  US Route 67.  Then I realized that there was formation of these flashing lights moving to the south.  There was a total of 7 lights, placed the thumb of my Right hand over the central light, approximately  1 foot measured from the light formation.  As I travelled south on US Route 67 towards Little Rock, AR the formation kept going and suddenlly a shooting star greenish in color shoots in front of me.  Then out of nowhere another greenish shooting star comes from the SW.  The formation has picked speed and noticed that these lights were at a higher altitude.  Then all of the sudden they were gone.<n>

I saw a bright white object (plane) on the side of the freeway. It was bright with several lights and looked like an odd lobster shape. The lights were at varying intensities of white light, sometimes becoming more intense and then a lighter dull and changing (very slowly). It was flying at such odd pace (kind of stopping and starting and very slow). Then as it made it&#39;s way over the freeway it turned and came towards the cars on the freeway. It stopped and hovered over the freeway. It was very close! with bright white and red lights. Then I saw it was triangular in shape. It was very still as it hovered the freeway and then I passed underneath it, the red lights were illuminating the entire bottom of the triangle and at each corner of the triangle was a bright white light. I saw directly underneath it as I drove underneath this hovering triangle and after I passed underneath it I turned around to look back at it and it disappeared. All that I saw was one bright white light that became bright in intensity and then flickered out. Also there were many other planes (objects) in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/25/03 20:45|Pensacola|FL|Fireball|10-15 seconds|A bright Green, almost flourescent in color decending down from the sky at a constant speed to only vanish not vaporate.|9/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31844.html|86|ndxe200309| A bright Green, almost flourescent in color decending down from the sky at a constant speed to only vanish not vaporate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 8:45 pm when I went outside to take the garbage out when a bright green light from the sky caught my eye.  I looked up and saw a bright green, almost flourescent in color, fireball descending down from the sky and knew from the size of it it was to large to be a falling star.  It lasted for 10 to 15 seconds before it vanished, not vaporized or breaking apart but just vanished.  The more I sit here and think of the occurence the more I realize that it was not going at an incredible speed such as a falling star shooting into the atmoshphere, but more of a constant speed, then accelerated for 1 or 2 seconds then to only disapear. .  The fire from the rear of it looked as if fire does on the back of a jet thrusting forward or faster, this is the only way I can think of to describe it. Also if it helps I was off of Gulf Beach Hwy near Perdido Key and it looked as if it were descending down towards the intercoastal waterway. It was the size of possibly 2 softballs put together. I plan to try to draw an illustration of the object and send it in if I am able to reproduce the same image on paper. I can only hope that my description helps in any way and to wish that I knew what it was that I saw.  I know it is an experience that I will never forget. Be it a meteorite or an unidentified flying object, I truly believe that we are not alone nor have we ever been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite credible, and to be a good observer.  No other reports from this area of the U. S..  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to let you know that I have found 3 other witnesses from that night, but they said they would feel crazy calling a ufo hotline. And then a few nights ago my neighbors called me and said they were watching the green fireballs in the sky and they were so excited to see them. It was 2 from my understanding. I was going into surgery the next morning and have not talked to them since but I am sure they would call, I am going to call them and give them the hotline number and her husband was in the military here in Pensacola so he would know more about the latitude and longitude than I would. Thank you for the response hope all is well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

It was a sort of pinkish-purple color with a greenish az around it, and it shifted from that color to blue, and back again. It moved eastward rapidly, leaving a scattering of white specks behind it, like more, smaller craft. Then in a flash of light, it vanished. I had the distinct impression that they had been trying to mentally contact me, because I seemed to have been hearing a sort of haunting music that was coming from no external source during the whole incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The dramatically bright, &#34;twinkling&#34; star, Sirius, is just to the left of Orion&#39;s Belt.

Although the sighting only lasted for a split second or so, he was still able to observe the light doing some very unusual things. The location for this sighting was at around Kitsilano at 4th Avenue and Maple. The witness was walking west on forth Avenue on the north side of the street when he just happened to looked up and caught sight of what looked like a star, white in color. The fellow did not want to make any assumptions, but he thought it may have been reflected sunlight. The object was rather high up in the sky. The light was traveling from north to the south and the sighting lasted approx: a second. He also mentioned that whatever it was moved incredibly fast, like a shooting star. But the unusual thing about it, the light moved very erratic. In other words the witness said it did not move in a straight line. He also mentioned if the light had of traveled in a straight line, he would not have called me to make the report. Only because it behaved so strange, he thought he would file a report. The man felt that the sighting was so strange, he wanted to know if anyone had reported seeing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, if one looks at the last report I just posted for around the Vancouver area, there are some similarities and a day a part. Any connection, who knows but I think it is still worth noting. No sound was heard. Again his impression was that the light was very high up. Due to him being around a lot of large buildings in the area, he did not have a good field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>
9/25/03 20:00|Bicknell|IN|Light|1 hour|Star light objects strobing red then white moving at very fast speeds for the altitude|9/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31845.html|89|ndxe200309| ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been observing twinkling stars, although that is a guess on our part.  It is virtually impossible to determine whether an object is moving, or not, when the observer is moving in a vehicle.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Star light objects strobing red then white moving at very fast speeds for the altitude<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 7 year old son and I were traveling home from Terra Huate Indiana and left there at 20:00. We traveled South toward Vincennes Indiana on Highway 41. As we were driving my son said he saw a blinking star. I sang the song &#34;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&#34; and said where do you think that song was made from. He said no dad this star blinks. I started looking around in the sky and saw 4 non moving flashing stars. My son stated he saw 2 that I could not see. These stars were flashing either a red and white combination or just a plain white combination. I told him they were stars and continued driving for 10 minuits. He then said that one of these &#34;stars&#34; were moving I looked over toward the passenger side window and sure enough this &#34;star&#34; object still flashing red and white was moving. I told him it must be an airplane and continued watching it as I drove. The &#34;star object was visible at all times to me starting from the back window and flew south staying at the same distance out my windows not moving up or down. Within a minuite I watched this object go from the West side to the South side then worked its way to my East. So to make this easier to visualize picture a bug crawl at the top of your windows so you could see it at all times from the back passengers window to the front passengers window then along the top of the front window from passengers side to the drivers side then along the drivers side door window. At all times this star object kept level with the ground. Once it was heading on the drivers side window I noticed that there was another &#34;star&#34; object and they stopped moving fairly close together they stopped making their red/white combination flashes and just started flashing white at a slow speed while not moving. The white flashes sincrinized flashing beep   beep   beep at the exact same time. This occered for several minuits still driving 60 mph with these object not moving to us. The objects then moved to appear to form one object and started their wild flashing again. This! happened for another minuite or so and then they moved again toward different directions. They did have a different magnitude of light one a bit softer than the other and I watched the same one fly back to its original spot on the west side of the sky. Again flying the same way I described before but backwards. We watched these dancing stars the whole 1 hour drive and even into out drive way. I told my wife who stuck her head out the window and she saw one not moving then it did to her suprise. I do not think she has the same understanding of these objects as we do since she jsut saw a glimps. We had watched these things from Terra Haute to Bicknell. A one hour drive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no trail behind these objects. If the object is far enough in the sky that as I drive 60mph and it appears to be non moving while its stationary. My guess would be that it is very far up there. The distance that an object would have traveled at that altitude would have been emmince and to be able to travel it in less than a minuit would be impossible. If it was an aircraft such as a plane I would call detail to the hovering together and the sincrinizing of the blinking lights. Then why would it travel back to the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other lights would disapeare and reapear but never saw them move from side to side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The altitude of this object off of the ground as I saw it. Was while sitting in the drivers seat the object was visible at the top of the windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other than the things stated in this box Im not sure what else I could do except explain its flight path a bit better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you feel that this is not enough information feel free to contact me through email. But as wanting or needing to have some one contact me thats purly up to you. I just wanted to document what I saw just incase others saw it as well.<n>

We live apx 4 miles from Grand Traverse Bay on the East of us and Lake Leelanau 1/4 mile to the West of us in what is known as a little town called Bingham.  My son was on his way to the Marathon station for gas and there is this road that winds its way through a little valley and there is a cherry orchard on one side.  The craft was noted apx 45 feet in the air hovering in the valley next to the cherry orchard.  It then moved closer to the road to the point where my son could see the typical round object on the underneath and the three lights, blue, red and white.  He said it hovered there, made no sound and had a wobbling motion.  A car was coming from the other direction and the craft was so low the car did a U-turn and went in the other direction.  My son was physically shaking from the encounter and expressed to me the intense desire to get distance between him and it due to its proximity to the road.  He said it then moved south and he followed it South on Co Rd. 633 towards Crain Hill road and it then descended below a tree line to the point he could not see it anymore, leaving him questioning whether it landed or not.  This is his second sighting of UFO craft in that 1-mile radius in 2 months.  The earlier one was in June or July, can&#39;t remember which, and was a somewhat different shaped craft and was not as low to the ground.  He was on his way again to get gas at the Marathon station. My son is a college student, 2nd year culinary.  Very level headed individual.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Have been a witness to several &#39;haunted&#39; house phenomena, however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting occurred over I-485 and Johnston Road exit.  While driving, I noticed a shiny, silvery object ahead of me in the evening daylight.  It appeared to be stationary which is why it caught my attention.  Over the next 30 seconds, I approached it and got as directly underneath it as possible.  That&#39;s when I pulled off the road to get a better look.  It was a brief moment after I pulled over that the object began to move away in a very straight line at a rather moderate and constant speed.  It was small from my vantage point, but very obviously oval shaped, and silver-reflective, and appeared to be darkened in the center.  Everything about it was just odd, from it&#39;s shape, reflectiveness, the way it appeared to begin moving from a dead stop, and the way it just seemed to &#39;cut through&#39; the air in an extremely straight flight path.  It was still light outside, and I could see no lights, no trails, and heard absolutely no sound (I was pulled off the highway).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is quite a bit of air traffic over this area, and as such I am rather used to seeing airplanes in the sky.  This, I can say, certainly did not look like any airplane I&#39;ve seen, nor a helicopter.  If anything, it resembled an ovoid blimp shape, but it was quite small/high up and just didn&#39;t stike me as a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was reflecting the sun light, so it appeared silver in color. It stayed motionless for approx. 10-13 minutes. Then it proceeded to move northerly around the mountain top to the eastside of the mountain. This took approx. 2 minutes. I then loss sight of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to the girl working the drive-thru window and she also observed the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> We talked with some friends about this and they informed us that sometimes when conditions are right that the Forest Service Look-Out Tower on top of Pilchuck will reflect the evening sun as to appear as a large round light on top of the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

It immediately started going perfectly straight down and there was no trail on it..it definitely slowed down the nearer to the horizon that it went.  it never changed its appearance and it looked incredible against the twilight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no sound or any feeling of static electrictity, and the lights in the lights in the classrooms were still working. It was  just usual Florida weather (sunny, warm, LOTS of humidity). It was a nice day with no rain or anything all day. I also noticed that you had a sighting in Plant City, FL. I was wondering if there was any connections...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was PERFECTLY shaped; absolutely incredible.  (I wished I had a camera or a cell phone to call someone!)  Suddenly I saw a white light &#34;fall&#34; into the top of the cloud.  It was just a white object; kind of &#34;glowy&#34; - a little bigger than a star.  I walked on and continued looking at the mountain.  As the sun continued to rise from up behind the mountain, the lenticular cloud changed into a MASSIVE glowing white domed UFO shape - it was truly STAGGERING! Then a second white object fell into the top of the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued walking and watching.  In a few minutes a THIRD object &#39;fell&#39; into the top of the mountain; but it was about 2 times bigger than the other two.  That&#39;s it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was truly one of the most beautiful sights I&#39;ve ever seen!<n>

Off to the right was a red round shape light, off to the left was a blue round shaped light about 1/2 apart. They both were about as high in the sky as your usuall water towers. The amazing event that occurd was that I wanted to see them in this area because it was a UFO hot-spot about 25-30 years ago. In that time frame, my mom and other relatives saw craft and lights on differnt ocasions. Also there is a cattle farm right next to where I saw the crafts. The most idea I want to explain is that I mostly looked at the blue one, because It moved/floated to which ever direction I mentally told it to. It was actually kinda of friendly. They stayed there untill I left the area. My family knows I am not making this ((deleted)) up, because they all saw unexplained events at differnt times in the same area years ago.<n>

The number of holes that I counted was 37. The holes were such that they were larger in the center and got smaller as they went away from the center giving it the sphere shape. I could also see the outline of hte sphere. The center vertical row which contained seven holes, and the center horizontal row which also contained seven holes, were emanating white light. The hole in the center of the intersection had the brightest light. emanating from each end of the rows were light rays that were bright near the object and grew dimmer as they went away from it until they dissappeared. The other holes had light, but it was dimmer than the two center rows (the vertical one and the horizontal one). The vertical rows were as follows: the brightly lighted center row of seven holes, one row of seven holes on each side of the center hole, one row of five holes on each side of those rows, and one row of three holes on each side of those. The horizontal rows were of identical description. The object appeared to be stationary at around 150 degrees azimuth and 35 degrees elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have sent an e-mail to the witnesses who submitted the report, requesting more information on how they were able to see such detail, but we have not heard back from them yet.

As I watched this thing what ever it was the dim greenish grey lights moved out of its origional pattern into what I could only explain as a geese formation the V. I dont know if I was shocked by what I saw but I sat there froze till it went past the tree I was standing under.  I then asked my husband if he had seen what I had and he said no but look in the sky and there it was very far off flying towards the east like it was making a circle from the town.  At a distance it was still in the shape of the V formation but the lights then appeared to be white.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very dark as we were in an industrial area, not many street lights so we found it a little weird that the ally across the street was glowing. we went a little closer to investigate. We heard a noise that sounded like the bus so we turned around to see if it was coming. when we turned back to the ally the light was gone. We were a little spooked but didn&#39;t really think that much about it. About 2 min later we saw a light hovering about 75 feet above the building where we saw the glowing. It seemed to get larger and then smaller. It continued doing this for about 1 minute. I got large one more time and then vanished. I did not look like it took off anywhere, it was more like it went out like a candle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On the front of it there was some kind of object like maybe an arrow or something.We watched it for a few more minutes and then it disappeared.I wrote to you last year and never heard if it was a weather balloon or not.

Being an avid offshore fisherman I have seen many large fireballs when out in the gulf at night.  The things that struck me as odd besides seeing this in relative daylight, was the trajectory of the object and the fact that there was no contrail remnant.  Instead of an arching trajectory from horizon to horizon, this object was coming down at a very high &#39;angle of attack&#39; and did not fade as it approached my observable horizon which was approx. 1/2 mile away.

I was driving East on Packard St, towards Ypsilanti. Just after crossing Carpenter road, I saw a large object in the sky, just above the treeline. At first I thought it was a blimp, but when I took a second look at it, it seemed to have corners along the edges rather than a smooth curving surface of a blimp. Curious about what it was I decided to try to follow it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically, describe its physical appearance, it was dark, but it was far away so I cannot describe it as any more than a silhouette. Its size was about as long as a quarter held at arms lenght, but it was very far away, maybe a mile, but I am not very good at estimating distance. It seemed rounghly rectangular or hexagonally shaped, being maybe four times longer than it was tall. Its first appearence made me think &#34;Blimp&#34; but once again, the outline had corners and it seemed a bit too large and skinny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I headed south on Packard, the object seemed to be vertically positioned just above the treeline. It was much farther away than the treeline as it would move slightly and sometimes be partially occluded by the trees. It also seemed to move slightly South and East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer, it seemed to become more occluded by the trees so I decided to turn South on Hewitt Rd. The object  continued to become more and more occluded by the trees. Soon, it dipped below the treeline and I was no longer able to see it and by the time I reached Ellsworth, I had lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what it was. It was too slow and too big to be an airplane, and its shape didn&#39;t seem right to be a blimp.

Within one block, just over the Sand Creek Police Dept.

As this sphere rose rapidly, it started to glow to yellow and orange color. While rising the sphere was travelling towards my location.  A couple of people, co-workers, saw that I was intent on looking upwards and came out and observed the sphere travelling above our building.  We observed this object suddenly stop in the 11 o&#39; clock position. I walked into the building and one other guy stated that the object moved extremely fast to the 2 o&#39; clock position.  This took place within a few seconds of me walking into the building.  Within just the few seconds that I was away. The object seemed to be small in diameter and was completely still in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five of my co-workers saw the object at different stages of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But it moved upward and then back down.  It then hovered, it seemed to waver around in the sky.  We watched it dance around for an hour and fifteen minutes.  It was moving from the north to north north east and downward(over the full time.).  It was triangular shaped, the lights followed the sides to the bottom tips to the top tip, but none on the center bottom. They gave off different flashing colors:mostly blue/white(these were more constant-harder to tell apart but you could notice a difference at times), red, almost orange at times. the red light seemed to appear more in the middle, while white was on the bottom and blue seemed to remain near the top tip.  near 4:00 it seemed to project some weird red light.  It was not a beam, but more like a red dash in the sky.  This light would flash on and off, but only appeared about 7 times.  I almost stopped watching until i saw that different light.  and the sound, it was a dull roar, easy to dismiss, almost the sound of a helicoptor, but the sound was too constant, it just wasn&#39;t a helicoptor.  One plane flew by about 5 minutes before i could no longer see it.  It flew over the ship i was watching about 2 minutes after the red beams flashed.  the ufo seemed to almost get nervous and hovered around quicker than before. I have a tremendous feeling of fear, uncontrollable cold chills, my eyes are teering up. i can&#39;t get rid of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/24/03 01:53|Nashville|TN|Triangle|1 min 30 sec.|I saw 3 things wednesday.  2ufo's and one strange thing.|9/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31856.html|120|ndxe200309| I saw 3 things wednesday.  2ufo&#39;s and one strange thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pull security at a parking garage in the the heart of downtown.  I pull watch on 2 connecting garages, both 7 levels high.  I generally have to walk through both levels periodically every hour.  While working I generally like to star watch, so over the 2 mth period that I have been working, I have learned the star patterns for that area.  This particular night wasn&#39;t all that different than any other night.  The night was clear and the stars were out.  Because this was on early Wed. morning, downtown was pretty empty.  Let me begin by stating I saw 3 different things that night, also I am a black woman early 30&#39;s and in all my life I have never seen anything out of the ordinary.  I am also a gulf war vet, who has pulled a lot of guard duty outside. Let me repeat I have never seen anything out of the ordinary until now!  The 1st sighting wasn&#39;t a vehicle, it was a thing.  It was reddish-brown, had a tail,  moved like a jelly-fish to elevate itself higher &amp; higher in the air. After clearing the building it than went sideways to the right and after something shot out at it, it faded away. The 2nd sighting happened 15 mins. later.  The was a triangular shaped vehicle that a light at each point, this one is commonly seen in magazines.  The ship appeared from nowhere stated to take off in mid-air and disappeared again.  By the way there was no sound with any of these events.  I then went down to the first level to take a break.  When I return on one of the rounds, I saw object number 3.  It appeared from nowhere, floated away from me then disappeared.  At first I thought it was a plane, because of the blinking night,  but there was no sound.  As close as it was, if it were a plane it would have made sound.  Then I thought that it might be a blimp.  But there was no larger upper body.  Also, the direction of the way if floated, a plane or a blimp would not have been able to move that way.  I also thought that it could have been a helicopter, but the lights weren&#39;t right and like I said, there! was no sound.  Well that&#39;s my report. tj.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked south to see how bright Mars was was and saw a bunch of tiny stars I thought.  Istood there thinking what constallation is that?  The longer I stood there I noticed it was moving!  It looked like a thousand stars in a concurve line, moving south.  It was between me and Mars because for a split second Mars was gone.  I went to work and asked people if they saw anything but no one did.  The best way to describe it would to be as if I was watching a thousand ducks in a flock with lights on them and instead of a v in a concurve line with an aura around them. What ever it was it was beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We ran out to my back porch to see if we could see what it was but it was gone. Then we saw another, what looked to be a fireball, light up again and then disappeared. When i got to work the next day, i told my story to some co-workers then i found out that two other people that i work with saw the same thing. I have no idea what i was seeing that night.

I sat &amp; watched them for at least 20  seconds. They seemed to be in a perfectly horizontal line, spaced evenly &amp; at tree top level. They did not move, nor blink. No downward illumination appeared or nothing lit up in the treetops but the lights were very bright &amp; clear with no haze. From my pickup truck, they appeared to be about the size of a soccer ball. The tree tops were slightly moving from a breeze (I assume) &amp; I started to back up in order to get a better view---the lights immediately went out &amp; or dissappeared. Due to darkness I could not see any image or outline of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 65 years of age &amp; never saw anything like this. Personally, I am very skeptical of UFO&#39;s or aliens but I know what I saw &amp; I must assume it to be a natural phenomenon.

The object was a bright green color and was solid green along the entire bottom. I saw the object in the sky approx. 75 feet in the air over Highway 101. Being so high in the air I would say that it was about 15 feet long and 7 feet wide in the biggest areas. This stretch of 101 has hills on both sides with no buildings or homes. The object caught my eye out of the front windshield and appeared to be going the same speed (70 mph) as the car for about 3-4 seconds. Then it shot off straight out leaving a white trail behind it for about 2 or so seconds and completely dissappeared. I was on the cell phone at the time and was unable to speak to the other person on the line because I was in such shock at what I had seen. There were no cars in front or behind me for atleast a mile both directions. This object was definatly something in the sky and not a reflection from another car or object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife and I were eating dinner at the Himalayian Inn restaurant, in a courtyard off the town square of Sonoma. All of the lights went out in the open-air courtyard and alley that is shared by several businesses, including an Irish pub restaurant. We would learn after dinner that the lights had gone out in the eastern half of the town. We never heard what happened or why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about dusk when we had decided to eat dinner, choosing to sit outside because of the pleasant night.  We were in the middle of the main course when the lights went out.  The restaurant owner came out and we chatted for few minutes as I pointed out a couple constellations and Mars.  He went back inside to find candles and flashlights, while I sat down to finish my dinner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after sitting down I saw a very bright light, similar in luminosity to the International Space Station [ISS], which I&#39;ve seen on several previous occasions. The light was moving directly north, roughly parallel to the town square.  Because we were under a small veranda, I only caught glimpse of the bright light when it was at about a 60 degree angle.  It moved at a speed similar to ISS, but after about 2 seconds, its light suddenly dimmed and for the remainder of the sighting it gradually faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I commented to my wife about it, but she hadn&#39;t seen it. We were in Sonoma for the Michelin Challenge Bibendum as members of the invited press. I own a small refractor telescope and have frequently observed satellites with my naked eye, through binoculars and through the Richfield telescope. Had the object not suddenly faded in luminocity, I would have concluded it might have been the ISS, which will also exhibit similar behavior when it crosses into the earth&#39;s shadow. However, since this object was moving almost due north on an apparent track that would keep it in the sun&#39;s light, I suspect the drop in luminocity would be attributable to other factors.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I looked at my daughter in the passenger seat, I noticed a bright light to the East and became curious as I watched it move to a stationary position in the sky and the light it emitted became brighter and brighter.  It was much too bright to be a star and remained COMPLETELY  stationary for 3 - 4 minutes.  It was extremely bright at its center.  A really strange thing was how the light from the object illuminated the clouds around it.  I noticed how a cloud below it was softly lit up (not glowing) as a light bulb might shine onto an object.  Then the light from the object slowly faded and the object then turned slowly toward the south and continued on.  The lights were similar in color to a planes running lights except the green was replaced by a blue flasher and the pattern was not consistent.  The lighting effect was as if the flashers circled the craft, as opposed to consistent flashers on airplanes.  The sun had completely vanished at this point and we were unable to determine what it was or the exact shape.  I have never seen anything so bright and so still in one spot in the sky for such a long period of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The lights were consistent (not flashing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I could barely see the strange lights which seemed to be heading almost straight towards me, but as it approached I could clearly see a large (150-200 foot wide) dark-colored triangle-shaped aircraft.  I estimate it passed about 500 feet to the south of me, no more than 500 to 800 feet altitude, and traveling SW at about 700 mph (estimate based upon roughly 3 miles covered in the mere 12-15 seconds that I observed it).  It did not deviate in either speed or direction.  I was within (no more than) 1000 feet as it passed just south of me and yet it was TOTALLY silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ONLY visible lights were the 7 mentioned above, across the front leading edges.  There was none of the legally required (FAA and military) red and blue wing tip lights, nor flashing strobe lights.  Both the lights AND the aircraft were easy to see looking straight at it, yet would have been just as easily missed had I not been looking right at it as it approached.  I felt like this was intentional, as if to warn close conventional aircraft, but to be otherwise relatively unnoticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a dark, moonless night (moonset 5:37pm the evening before) yet at the mid-point of my viewing the dark-colored aircraft was quite distinguishable against the starlight... and against the glow of the city lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This aircraft was definitely not a B-2 Stealth or any traditional aircraft... TOTALLY silent... unusual shape and lights, and no aircraft that I&#39;m aware of could possibly fly so fast, low, and yet completely SILENT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 3am I called the FAA Regional Control Center in Longmont, CO, and talked with a very helpful and interested supervisor.  In addition to checking their records, he checked with DIA approach (Denver International Airport) as well as Seattle Regional Control Center:  There had been absolutely no military aircraft in the area all night, and no reports of anything out of the ordinary.  I’m sure that this craft was flying below radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the suggestion of the FAA I reported the incident to the National Institute for Discovery Sciences (9-23-03) and now the National UFO Reporting Center (10-01-03).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything even remotely like this before and hope to learn more about what it was.  I’m not one to jump to conclusions, yet I immediately felt that the craft had to be non-terrestrial.  Even if I was to disregard the &#34;illegal&#34; lighting, we are clearly many, many years away from producing an aircraft with characteristics such as this.  This was an incredibly fantastic experience!  BACKGROUND: I am a male, age 51, father of 3, and a business owner in the area since 1972.

This is probably the fifth time in about three years. It is the same every time. Amber lights in the southwest sky, past the Sierra Estrella Mountains, and in the direction of the Barry Goldwater Air Force Range. But I am guessing the lights are closer to the Phoenix area.It always occurs in the period between 9:00 to 10:30pm.Two or three stationary yellowish-orange lights appear-fade out-then reappear five minutes later in the same spot. In a previous sighting the lights appeared to blend or change colors also. If they are illumination flares, wouldn&#39;t they descend earthward? . Another report once estimated the location of the lights in the vicinity of Rainbow Valley. This would seem to be pretty much on target-but hard to say for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I once saw one of these lights at a much closer distance while piloting a single-engine light aircraft between Gila Bend and Yuma. I estimated the distance at 10 miles. This time it was more like an intensely bright fireball that faded and reappeared. I suppose it could be some type of experimental flare.Thanks<n>

He kept saying &#34;Oh my God!&#34;, &#34;Oh my God!&#34;. I asked what it was, and he said &#34;I see lights&#34;  He pulled over in a local elementary school parking lot and that is when I saw them too.  They were 5 lights that would illuminate brightly then fade out, then they pulled into a formation.  We kept looking at this for a few minutes,then we decided we had to have a closer look.  We drove down Hwy. 59 to get a better view, and all the while keeping our eyes on the lights.  Soon, we noticed that a couple of helicopters from ft. chaffee took off in pursuit. They seemed to be going around in circles, as if they were looking for something. Then what my husband identified as F-16 fighters took off next. They were chasing the lights in the sky. It was rather comical to watch because it seemed like a game of cat and mouse, but the strange lights were too fast to catch. We pulled into the lock and dam to watch this spectacle for a while, and soon there were no more strange lights in the sky.  The duration lasted for about an hour at that time.  When we returned home, my neighbor asked me if we had seen any strange lights, and of course we had.  Also, this morning on the radio on a dallas station, a caller had called in reporting what he had seen.  Apparently it was seen by a lot of people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will seek other witnesses to this alleged event.  PD))<n>

I notice three lights in the sky that formed a triangle. The lights were fairly bright and if you hold your arm outstrethed, the size of the lights would be about the size of a nickel that you held in your hand.  The lights moved slowly simultaneously.

There were also strange noises heard over cell phone while trying to talk to my wife to tell her what was was happening. Some sort of interfearance or like it was picking up somthing else other than the normal.<n>

It was a white light, though it may have flickered red, travelling in a straight line at a downward angle of 10°.  I observed it for approximately 2-3 seconds, at which time it faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:18 the same day I observed two more.  The first was heading straight down toward the horizon, and I observed it for several minutes.  It was similar in appearence as the one I sighted earlier, except that it did not fade out and definitely flickered beween white, green and red.  The second I saw for approximately 3 seconds, and was similar to the earlier sighting except that it faded out, then faded in, travelling on the same trajectory before finally disappearing.&#34;  My first instinct (when I saw the first object) was that it was a bit of space debris burning up in the atmosphere.  But the two objects I observed later did not quite fit : the one object faded out then in, and the other changed only in it&#39;s color, and I only lost sight of it as it went beneath the horizon. These objects were little more then points of lights - nothing spectacular, but as I say, it was out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I object to the use of the word craft on this form - it should say object.  To call it a craft is to make the assumption that it is a manned transport of some kind, instead of being regarded as an Unknown, which is what it is.)<n>

At first I thought it was a refraction of the setting sunlight on an imperfection in the window glass of the train, but as i changed my perspective it became obvious that I was looking at something very high in altitude, directly over the hills south of Portland.  Whether it was in motion or not I couldnt tell due to the motion of the train and its apparent distance. If it was moving, it was travelling very slowly. To me it appeared to be still..but as i said, i was in a moving train.  It was close enough to tell that it was NOT an airplane, but too far and to bright to make out any shape.  Just looked like a silver object brightly reflecting the sun.  I was watching it, trying to figure out if it could be a balloon, sattelite, or some other type of high altitude craft, when it just dissapeared. Not faded, not accellerated and left...just gone. The oddest thing was that it seemed to stop reflecting sunlight and turn a creamy orange-white color just an instant before it vanished. Ive seen ufo&#39;s before, i think...but not in broad daylight over a major metro area; there is no way in hell Im the only one that saw this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This afternoon my children were playing in the back yard and pulled me out with them to show me a cool airplane they had seen.  I looked up and saw a large silvery-white jet spewing out 4 distinct comtrails.  It did not look like a commercial plane, so I thought it may have come from the Whidbey Island Air Base which is nearby.  I kept watching because the plane seemed unusual and it made absolutely no sound whatsoever, and I was also checking the comtrail to see if it would spread.  It did not, but after about ten seconds two of the plane&#39;s engines/comtrails shut off, and then POOF the plane just DISAPPEARED!  It simply VANISHED!  I was actually watching it when one second it was there, and the next, GONE.  Within a few seconds, the entire comtrail which had taken up half the sky also disippated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never see weird stuff, and this is the weirdest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.  Have you had any other similar reports?  I&#39;d love to know if anyone else saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if it is related, and this seems particularly strange, but a minute later there was a distinct odor of old, rotten fruit in the air and on myself, and a few minutes after that a new cloud quickly formed and disappeared in the clear blue sky where the plane had flown.  My two oldest children, ages 7 and 5, saw everything with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Contrails can disappear when a high-altitude jet aircraft flies into an area of atmosphere, which caused the condensation to dissipate, or evaporate, quickly.  The fact that the object of interest apparently had four engines, that were producing condensation, suggests to us that it was not a UFO.  PD))<n>

It was the largest meteor I have ever seen (by at least ten times), or it may have been a sattelite.

In the valley adjacent tour home the sky was bright white, after a minute or 2, there was a green light glowing from the ground, that lasted about a minute, then the light turned orange.  At that point I ran to the telephone to call the police.  When I returned to my bedroom, the colored lights were gone.  After a couple of minutes it looked as if a car had come to investigate.  We saw the headlights of the car aimed at the spot where the occurrence had taken place.  We went to sleep quite agitated, but thought possibly it was some sort of accident that occurred.  This morning I contacted the local police, and local fire departments, they had no reports of an accident.  I have asked others around town if they knew of what may have happened.  One other man that I spoke with said that he also saw bright lights last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length via telephone, and she sounded quite objective and credible.

I looked over towards the Pilgrim Monument and then my eyes wandered upward to the sky.  It was a clear night and there were many visible stars.  As I looked due east I saw a particularly bright, blinking star that appeared to also have red and blue colors.  I stared at it for several minutes and the brightness of it would grow and dim and sometimes fade completely only to return again.  I was very curious about what i was seeing.  i called my friend out of the house to take a look.  I pointed to the sky and asked him to tell me what he saw.  He said he saw a bright star and thought he saw some red in it.  I asked if he had binoculars which he went and got.  He gave them to me and through them could see and object grayish in color with lights at the bottom of it which seemed to move round and flash.  The closest thing I can compare the shape of it to is a hat...wider at the bottom and rounded at the top.  The object was not moving in any direction.  Without the binoculars it appeared stationary, but with them it was pulsating or moving irratically in one spot.  Without describing what I was seeing I asked my friend to tell me what he saw and his description mirrored my own.  This was the first time for either one of us to see something this curious in the sky.   I find that the thought of what it could be keeps entering my mind so I sought out a place to report it for what it is worth...<n>

I&#39;ve been always looking towards the skies, this was sighting was a bit startling and came at a surprise.  I&#39;ve always been a skeptic and keep an open mind.  When this experience occurred, I was overwhelmed by feelings of this being something out of the ordinary. I could sense and felt a presence of being monitored perhaps.  The crazy thing about this experience, is that a week prior to this event.  I had sent an email over to the folks in Oregon/Washington area who are making exceptional claims of UFO sightings and contacts.  I can&#39;t fully remember the gentleman&#39;s name but his first name is ((name deleted)). He runs a ranch in that part of the country. Peter, I think you know, who I &#39;m referring to. Getting on to the story, I had sent an email to them stating send to send the UFO activity to Northern Illinois area, primarily the Chain-O-Lakes region, which is the town of Fox Lake.  I don&#39;t know if this is connected or possibly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO sighting was quick but basically simple.  My wife and I had finished shopping at the local grocery store when we had jumped in our car and proceeded Northbound on Route 12 into Fox Lake. As I had just passed the intersection of Rt 12 &amp; Rt 134. In front of us above Rt 12. We had noticed a slow moving object with strobing white lights. From our perspective the lights we had noticed we just two white lights, unlike an airplane lights these lights were not constantly on, they were blinking on and off. So from our sight through our windshield, the pattern of the blinking was from left to right, on and off.  I had mentioned to my wife, the lights were odd because they were quite bright. In the area, we have a lot of low flying small aircraft such as single prop planes and so forth, in addition O&#39;hare has a flight path coming in from the Northwest, but our distant from the airport is 40 miles out. So this would be impossible, because we had noticed the air traffic to our Northwest at a much higher altitude.  As we were traveling Northbound on Rt 12, we were headed toward the object. I started to panic because one of the feelings of amazement and the altitude was very low perhaps 1000 ft at best. As we had past underneath the object, I had nearly crashed the car because I was checking the local traffic around me to see if they were viewing the same object. I had rolled down the window and looked up to see that there was no sound, the lights I had saw were three white lights also one green and red in addition.  The white lights were position on each end of a perfect triangle. The red and green were somewhere on the object but can&#39;t make out exactly where. The object was flying quite slow, I couldn&#39;t make out a body because it was pitch black as far as a craft. The object was flying was as a backwards triangle, meaning the third light was positioned on the back. I wish I could have pulled over, but due to traffic. I could not.  I&#39;m hoping someone else saw this event. It somewhat scared me, something is goi! ng here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My email is ((e-address deleted))<n>

I am not a good judgement of distance or speed but this was pretty high and moving alot slower than an airplane.  This light was twice the size of Mars and really a bright white.  I watched it for approximately 10 seconds and then it just faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/21/03 19:00|Las Vegas|NV|Circle|3 minutes|Videotaped disc shaped craft in broad daylight|10/7/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31964.html|165|ndxe200309| Videotaped disc shaped craft in broad daylight<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 1900hrs PST on 21 Sept 03, at the request of my wife, I walked out my front door to look at a strange object in the sky she had seen.  The object was quite a distance away (very hard to tell how far) to the WNW of Las Vegas.  It was relatively flat, disc-shaped and dark in color, but otherwise, it was far enough away that I couldn&#39;t tell what I was looking at.  I ran back in my house and grabbed my video camera, absent-mindedly not planning to tape anything, but to use the zoom to get a better look at whatever it was.  After I went back out with the camera and got it zoomed in on the object, it occured to me that taping it might not be a bad idea.  I only got about a minute and a half of video.  The object moves like nothing I&#39;ve seen before...slowly tilting side to side and front and back on a center axis.  Unfortunately, the video looks &#34;wobbly&#34; in places because of the extreme amount of zoom used, but again, you can clearly tell it&#39;s disc-shaped and possibly had either a hole or faint light source in the middle...might&#39;ve also been a reflection, as the sun was to my southwest.  Whatever it was, it slowly (relatively to me) moved off to the northwest until it dropped below my line of sight and according to my wife, faded behind one of the local western mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She called it to my attention, and after a moment, I went inside to get a pair of binoculars.  Through the 7x50 glasses, the object was very clearly visible against the sky above the mountains above Ojai.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was saucer shaped, convex on both sides, and had an aspect ratio of about 1:6.  I watched it for several seconds, during which it wobbled at a rate of one cycle per three seconds or so as it drifted toward the east.  I said that it was a flying saucer, and handed my wife the binoculars.  She watched it for several seconds, and handed the binoculars back to me as she ran to telephone a friend who could possibly corroborate our sighting.  The friend was unable to see the object from their point of view, however.  I continued to watch the object as it drifted down and toward the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it dropped below the horizon, I could see that it was clearly on the near side of the mountain ridge.  Meanwhile, my wife had found a neighbor who, unfortunately, arrived too late to see the object before it drifted out of sight behind some nearby trees, still moving toward the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never saw any unnatural light or sound come from the object.  It never exhibited any non-ballistic motion.  We called the police, hoping that someone else had seen and reported it, but with no luck.  The object did not reappear in the sky as we watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was very little cloud cover and the sky was quite clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a slight breeze, and cloud motion was generally from the north-east. I saw a jet plane pass quickly from north-west to south-east, leaving a con trail that passed through a wisp of cloud. The relatively slow speed of the object caught my attention. There was no exhaust and it&#39;s shape was round or globular - it was too small to be sure. There also appeared to be a very slight fluctuation in its brightness, as if it was rotating or wobbling. As I watched, it gradually slowed down until it was stationary. It remained in the clear sky for several minutes - I saw 3 other commercial jets fly by at different altitudes while I observed the object. It then began to drift very slowly to the west, and after a few minutes it stopping again. It was hard to determine size, but I think it appeared slightly smaller. Then it began slowly moving back towards the east, and over the next several minutes became a tiny bright dot. It was obviously rising as it was drifting. I began walking north, glancing upwards to see if it was still visible (it was), until I was nearly at Dundas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was convinced that I had seen a UFO. No plane or helicopter could have that shape or behave in the way this object had. Nor could a balloon have hovered or changed direction as the object had. The first object was still faintly visible when I noticed a bright red spherical object, about the same size and altitude, drifting in the same east-to-west direction. The appearance of this new object did not fluctuate, and it moved slowly and steadily without slowing or stopping. It looked like a balloon, almost making me doubt what I had seen before. Then I saw a low-flying jet pass quickly beneath and to the west of the red sphere, following a curved path from north-west to south-west. It was too low for a commercial jet, and it had the swept-back wings and twin fuselage engines of a fighter. It was also perfectly silent, and its underside had no markings and was painted so as to be almost invisible against the sky. Since all this took place over Spadina, I had a clear view. However, buildings prevented me from seeing where the plane came from or where it went, and I soon lost sight of the red sphere also. I vowed to never again go out without my camera!<n>

Strange. White object not unlike a roll of paper falling. It was headed downward at a 30 degree angle against a horizon line. It was not easy to see. I had to stare at the same area to actually see the object because it would seem to not be there if just glanced at. This thing wasn&#39;t falling. There was no tumbling like one would expect from something that had no wings. It had a long tapering tail and was moving in an eel like motion as if it was swimming in the air. It was difficult to track visually . If you looked away it would be difficult to locate again. There were a few more of these objects appearing centrally from great altitude. This was not a saucer of plane or helicopter. My brother said a jet from Moffett flew through the general area where these objects were appearing. The jet slightly lost control, regained control then flew off. It may have sucked one into the engine intake. Oh, these things weren&#39;t small. Couldn&#39;t determine the size as there was no reference object to gauge the size. Weird. I can still envision these things. I have yet to see anything like it. It is possible that there are other life forms out there. They may not need space craft and these may not actually be visiting. We may be running into these things as our world travels through space and these space eels live in space like fish in water.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Starting and the upper most part of the handle and coming down to the 4th. star which starts the formation of the dipper part itself, I saw a bright ball of light traveling at a fast pace from the South West , traveling to the North East. It passed what appeared to be straight over the 4th. star in the dipper and sent for about five seconds and stopped abruptly. All total it lasted for ten seconds, traveling from my left to my right in what appeared to be the same distance on each side of the 4th. star in the dipper. It stopped just as fast as it started. The night was totally claear and I could see Jet liners with their flashing clearance lights moving in different directions. The object I saw was traveling perfectly horiziontally and left no tail . It was there and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strobing &#34;stars&#34;???<n> <n><n> <n><n> For about a year or so, I have started to notice objects in sky that look like stars, but they don&#39;t &#34;twinkle&#34; like other stars, and they don&#39;t have a steady glow like planets.  These &#34;stars&#34; have a very refined, sharp light, not soft like stars. The lights have a very sharp contrast like a strobe light or laser light.  With the naked eye, one can tell that these objects oscillate between red, white, and blue colors.  With binoculars, I noticed that it APPEARS that the blue light is a steady glow in the upper left and upper right &#34;corners&#34; of the object.  The red light appears to be a steady glow in the lower right &#34;corner&#34; and the white seems to be flashing from the center. (NOTE: it&#39;s very difficult get binoculars in a steady enough position to view these things clearly.  I need a telescope) In the past couple of weeks, I have taken a notice to just how many there really are.  I see 4 of these stars in the Northeastern sky, spread pretty far apart, I see 3 in the Northwestern sky in a triangular pattern, and 3 in the Southwestern sky, in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t think these objects are geosynchronous satellites, because they are staionary like other stars.  Thier referenced positions change with the rotation of the Earth.  Because of where they are positioned, they never pass overhead with the planet&#39;s rotations, and all of them stay somewhat close to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If these are satellites, why would they have visible lights on them? I have a friend in Charlotte, who is 30 miles south of me, is able to see these objects.  My wife and my parents have seen them, as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to know how many other stargazers have noticed this, and if anyone has a good explanation, because right now, I really don&#39;t think these are stars.<n>

The &#34;T&#34; was in all red lights and flew upright, so that the crossing of the &#34;T&#34; was at the top.  It flew in past the campsite from the west, headed a mostly eastward direction.  It was quite large, possibly as large as a commercial jet, standing on it&#39;s tail.  It flew silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When the object was not reflecting light, the body of the object could be seen, but no details were vivible, no wings or any protrusions, just the dark object. While it was impossible to determine the actual height of the object, I estimate that it was more than one and less than five miles above the ground. No sounds were heard, no alterations in velocity were seen, and it moved slowly out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had alerady loaded my equipment in, and I was outside by the entrance smoking a cigarette. It was overcast, but still daylight out. I looked up and out of the clouds, coming directly towards me was a small, round disc. No lights. It appeared to be black, or at least very dark. It descended out of the clouds, and couldn;t have been very high, as it was underneath the clouds and in plain sight. I was struck by how straight it was traveling. It made no sound, and it went DIRECTLY over my head, and continued on a straight path, and as it flew away, it ascended very slightly, until it was back in the clouds and that was it. It was small. It couldn&#39;t have been any bigger than a Yugo. That was one of the weird things about it... it was very small, but it moved on an obviously deliberate path. I could almost feel a vibration, but there was no sound. That&#39;s the best way that I can explain it. I felt it, but couldn&#39;t hear it. There were at least 7 other people outside at the time, and not one other person looked up or said anything. I didn&#39;t dare say anthing... not sure that i could&#39;ve even if I&#39;d wanted to. But let me repeat this. It was very very clear. I saw it with absolutely NO obstructions to my view... none. No lights on it. Black or very very dark. Round. Small. I kept thinking that it was like some sort of probe that you would see in the movies. I actually thought that as I was seeing it. I reported this to MUFON, and heard nothing from them. Very disappointing, because I saw it so very clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But anyway, that&#39;s it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report is in response to the following sighting as it appears on the NUFORC website.  It is a &#39;comment&#39; report on a follow-up investigation done by a Michigan MUFON Field Investigator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred : 9/20/2003 18:00 (Entered as : 09/20/2003 18:00) Reported: 9/21/2003 6:45:44 PM 18:45 Posted: 9/24/2003 Location: Fraser, MI Shape: Light Duration:25-30 minutes star-like lights in the form of triangles and diamonds dancing in the late afternoon sky  My Brother was out in the yard and called to us to hurry and come look at &#34;this&#34;. In the sky directly above us were what we at first thought were hot air balloons that ascended so high they appeared to look like stars in the clear blue sky. There were 3 in a formation of a perfect triangle to the left and 4 to the right in the shape of a diamond. Then they began to dance in the sky with each other returning to their positions. Coming very close to each other but never colliding. There were 3 sets of these formations. One had a stream of light coming from it leading me to believe it was a hot air balloon but when it ascended up and disappeared I dismissed that idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nearing the 20 minutes of watching these star-like objects dancing in the sky others started to appear as dim stars and became brighter up to 50 were in the sky at one time dancing, but never colliding. They ascended and just disappeared. There was no sound, no aircraft in the area, no tails on the craft above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers ranged in age from 81 a homemaker, a police detective (just retired)51, myself(laidoff)48, retired auto worker 53, spouse 54, niece 32, Ameritech line man, 51 and spouse, 51.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ------Being Report------- Comments on - WUFOD Case 2-826 - Fraser, MI Multiple Witness Daylight Sighting  I received FI (I.e. Field Investigator) David Twichell’s photocopied forms and report on Sunday November 9, 2003.  My initial impression of this case was that it was a solid case that would produce quite an extensive report due to it being a daylight sighting.  The investigator originally included with his report a copy of the original WUFOD report in context of an email I sent him, Form 1 (2 pages), with an extra page for the spillover of the reporting witness’s personal account, a 2 page hand-written description of the object by the witness, Form 2 (3 pages), Form 4 (1 page), Form 5 (1 page) with an added handwritten page describing the psychological and physiological effects as reported by the witness, a 3 page typed report by FI Twichell, a 2 page printout of the weather conditions for Mt. Clemens, MI on September 20, 2003, a one page small printout of a map of the sighting location and two cassette tapes of the phone interviews of all witnesses involved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 8 witnesses in total however after all was said and done only 1 witness’s signature and form are on file with Michigan MUFON.  The 1-hour onsite interview was done on November 3, 2003 with R G and her mother S at R’s home.  Afterwards, R met with FI Twichell at a local Tim Horton’s restaurant, for another hour, to further discuss her possible abduction, as she didn’t want to discuss this in front of her mother.  The attention of the investigator has been drawn towards R G, who appears to be the dominant witness and whom initially filed the report.  I will summarize my thoughts on the other witnesses accounts first, then R G’ account, and finally on the case as a whole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MA D, wife of L D, described the event in a very straightforward serious manner, with excellent detail.  The time of the event as noted by M A was around 4:00 pm (2 hour discrepancy here compared to other witnesses T.L.) or a bit thereafter.  She mentions that one of the objects could’ve been a ‘party balloon’ floating upward with a spiral tail attached to the balloon.  She mentions that L, her husband, in fact said it was a party balloon.  M is in agreement with most of the other witness’s in the fact that she stated she was facing south and the objects were moving from west to east.  She suggested that she thought it may have been a ‘weather gadget’ as appears in the movie ‘Twister’, and may have had something to do with weather testing.  She mentions a 45-minute duration to the sighting.   She described the movements of the clusters of objects as being ‘like a butterfly’, no jerky movements.  She also didn’t report any physiological or psychological effects as a result of this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> L D, the witness who was first to see the objects mentions them catching his eye while he was walking up the back steps, to go in the house, around 3:55 pm.  He was looking towards the west at about 40o up from the horizon.  He stated the sighting duration was approximately 47 minutes.  He too reported no physiological or psychological effects as a result of this sighting.  He mentioned initially seeing 7 shiny ‘dots’…. 3 being in a ‘straight line’, and 4 being shaped in a ‘straight edged arch’.  He mentions some of the objects rotating around in a circle very slowly.  Most of his account matches closely with that of his wife M A and that leaves me with the question of, “Was there significant collaboration between the two witnesses resulting in some level of contamination in these two accounts?  This seems most evident in the time at which they estimated the sighting began.<n> <n><n> <n><n> S D - L’s Mother - The initial part of this taped conversation has only the voice of FI David Twichell due to the fact that his speakerphone was not turned on. After David asks her about what time [the sighting began - T.L.] there is some silence and then David mentions a time of 6:30 pm during the early part of their conversation.  I’m making what I believe is a valid assumption, based on the taped conversation, that they are speaking of the onset of the sighting event.  She mentions her friends present at the sighting location counting about 8 -10 lights. She stated they were moving around one another and darting back and forth.  She also mentions a sighting duration of 15-20 minutes.  Here we see a large discrepancy in the time of the event onset and the sighting duration as compared to L and M A’s account.  S states the objects were seen ‘overhead’ in the southeast initially and then darted to the west for a short distance further stating that she didn’t have to move her head very much to follow them.  She mentions also that the sun had set approximately 1 hour after the objects disappeared.  The sunset, as listed at the bottom of the weather data, was at 7:30 pm so her approximation of the onset of the event being at 6:30 pm could very well be correct.  She too mentions the possibility of the objects being helium balloons. She also stated she was emotionally excited and had ‘chills’ up and down her arms.  This witness has had a previous sighting of a cigar-shaped object, which she experienced in Canada but no specific information was given about this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AM G - She initially states the time of the sighting started at 5:30 pm.  She states she was initially facing south, which is in agreement with most of the other witnesses.  She mentions the objects slowly moving, or drifting across the sky and that she watched them for approximately 2 hours (a notable discrepancy in the sighing duration here - T.L.).  For the most part the description of the objects is in agreement with the others.  She states she suffered from no physiological or psychological effects, however she does mention one interesting effect and that was she saw “little white specks” like TV static in her eyes due to her head being craned up towards the sky.  She had to repeatedly look down to relieve this effect and readjust her eyes.  She believes this may have been due to her looking up in the sky for long periods of time.  She said the objects were at an elevation of approximately 80o to directly overhead. (Here too is a discrepancy in what was said to be a 40o elevation for the objects mentioned by the initial witness L. - T.L.)  J G had very little to add to this investigation.  His interview was extremely short.  He was in the house watching a football game and showed very little interest in determining what the others were viewing.  He states the sighting onset was approximately 6:00 pm.  He stated he didn’t look at the objects long enough to discern much detail.  He stated what he saw was a bunch of cluster type star shapes and then went right back in to watch the football game, not looking at them long enough to even determine if they were moving.  He stated that the other witnesses stayed outside for 15-20 minutes watching the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> M Z stated onset of sighting event was about 5:30 pm.  She stated she saw white ‘balls’ like a balloon but it wasn’t a balloon.  She states there was about 15-20 of them and the sighting duration was a good 45 minutes.  She stated that the objects were in different areas and not in one spot.  The witness says they [her and the other witnesses] were all kind of nervous.  M stated that R called [reported them to MUFON] because her and her mother thought these were some kind of thing from outer space.  She states the objects were moving in different directions, yet says that it could’ve been the wind blowing them.  She said at no time did they change color.  No physiological or psychological effects noted by this witness.  Witness, in my opinion, seemed very hesitant to give out her address, and left only her phone number with FI Twichell.  Her husband M was interviewed later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MZ stated he saw 10 whitish things that could’ve been balloons.  He didn’t watch them too long and didn’t think anything of it.  Stated it didn’t interest him so he went back in the house.  Onset of event he says was 5:30 - 5:45 pm.  To him it looked like balloons.  He stated they were kind of drifting not going any certain way.  Objects were at a high altitude.  He watched the objects for approximately 5 minutes.  Nothing unusual noticed, as they were too far away to tell.  No color changes noticed.  Very short interview…approximately 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> R G, the witness who reported this incident, was affected quite differently by this event.  She states the onset of the event was around 6:00 pm with a total duration of 25-30 minutes, which fits in well with most of the other witness’s accounts, except for those of L and MA D.  She first thought these were hot air balloons.  She went on to describe their movements using the word ‘dancing’ meaning they would move towards and away from, and around each other.  She initially saw 7 objects in two different groups.  She describes the color as being dim blue then turning brighter.  She goes on to describe in detail, as evidenced in the taped interview, many perceptions that weren’t described by the other 7 witnesses.  R’s size estimation being that of an aspirin, as suggested by the FI is quite in opposition to the starlike description given by the other witnesses.  She relates her account in a very excited way with a lot of emotion in her voice.  The other witnesses sounded much calmer when relating their accounts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> R mentions another sighting she witnessed about 17 years ago in which she called Selfridge ANG at that time as well, with no response from her message left on the automated answering system at the base.  20 minutes into her phone interview R adamantly mentions there was not a plane anywhere in the sky.  She then mentions, about 27 minutes into the interview that “after, a jetliner was by and it was higher than that”.  This point being unclear as to whether or not the objects were in the sky during the time the plane was seen.  I asked FI Twichell to clarify this if he could.  He states, “As to the plane involved in the sighting of Sept. 20th, I’m sorry I’m not making myself clear on this.  I didn’t make a copy of the recorded interviews so I can’t check them for clarity but the witnesses agree that they did not see any conventional aircraft in the sky until the very end of the sighting episode.  While the objects were still above them, a jet, coming from the direction of Selfridge, came into view and headed in the direction of the objects.  At this time, the objects ascended and were gone from view.  MA stated that the plane was visible while the objects were still visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> R goes on to mention her husband’s flu-like illness previous to the sighting and it’s complete reversal during the sighting, and then a subsequent relapse afterwards.  She feels this may be relevant.  Her husband did not mention this during his interview.  R also noticed a definite difference in local animal activity whereas the others did not, and also mentioned an eerie silence during the event.  She goes on to describe the remainder of the sighting as mentioned within David’s report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> David then sent another report to me, via email, dated October 2, 2003 regarding RG&#39;s possible abduction event.  This report brings up the question as to why this wasn’t mentioned in her initial telephone interview with David.  I believe there is some level of malleability evident within R.  I posed a few intentional leading questions to David that he posed to R.  I asked, “Was there any physical evidence left as a result of these abductions?” and she replied, “I have a scoop marking on the left lower leg learing [nearing? T.L.] the front of my shin. Also on my right leg the first night of my &#34;dreams&#34; I recall injuring the inside of my leg just above my ankle with a terrible hemotoma, as I hit it trying to run away, I believe. When I returned to my bed there was dirt and tiny stones in my sheets and I had no socks on. (I ALWAYS wear socks to bed) The hemotoma was so bad I thought I had broke my leg...I iced it for several days. Today my flesh is still discolored, but it is no longer black and blue it is a dark reddish with a slight purple tint color that you would see from a fresh bruise. It is 4 inches across by 2 1/2 inches up and down. I will say this... when my doctor saw this back in May, he said it was a terrible bruise and it would heal right up with time... I never brought it up again.”  It is difficult for me to understand her knowledge of how ‘scoop marks’ are associated with abductions without any previous knowledge of UFOs or the abduction phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another question asked was, “Did these abductions take place at the same time on each consecutive day?”  She replied, “Yes they took place at the same exact time each night consecutively @ 3:00 A.M. This is the first time I recall distinctively the time. I see the time on my clock in my room and I cannot wake my spouse. I am being pulled by my feet from my bed.”  Another question asked was, “Any poltergeist type activity in the home before or after the abduction event? She replied, “There has been an abundance of poltergeist type of activities in my home from the toilet fully flushing and the handle moving to the downward position. We have had books moved from bookcases and placed opened onto the table, mostly civil war books. I have had my college papers missing and my books only to look feverishly for them and they appear before my eyes as I could have stumble over them. We have gotten phone calls with tones instead of static and we have caller ID... nothing appeared or registered.  My sister came over and did a Catholic exorcism in my home with a tape and holy water saying prayers and Blessed candles lit. I was still in tears from the &#34;dreams&#34; and emotionally upset because I hadn&#39;t saved the baby... unable to sleep or eat, and did not want to be bothered by anyone as I felt they did not understand my emotional state. Oh yes! The radio would turn on in the bedroom and change radio stations from one to another and another and another.”  I believe her emotional state at the time of the above exorcism up until the September sighting event and possibly afterwards may be an important aspect of this case and should be looked into further, probably by Dr. T.  FI Twichell states that R claims not to have been previously interested in the UFO phenomenon prior to this event. She said that she hasn’t read any books or watched any documentaries on the subject.  If this is true then her ‘abduction dream’ is simply astounding and would correlate well with other KNOWN abduction accounts, however the question remains with me, where would she have obtained knowledge of the often reported, ‘scoop mark’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to R, there also appears to be evidence of an abrupt change in her personality.  There also appears to be other serious differences of opinion and disagreements between R and her other family members regarding the above-mentioned exorcism, matters regarding R’s mother, and her husband’s health issues that may be compounding factors in this case which would best be dealt with by Dr. T.  Again, a further in-depth background check would be necessary to confirm these personality changes as well as any family problems now existent and any previous interest she may have regarding the UFO phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Form 2, first page, under ‘Shape’ I noticed that ‘disk’ was checked off but I hadn’t heard any witness mention anything about a ‘disk’ shape to these objects.  I queried David about this and he replied, “The one object that appeared to be larger than the others, with the curly-Q tail, was described by R G as being more disk-shaped than star like. She was the only witness that made this observation.  I’m not aware of where this statement appears in the context of the material that has been made available to me (T.L.).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I completed forms 4 &amp; 5 as indicated on the forms.  These were sent by the FI, via postal mail, to the witness to be completed and signed.  Once she returned them he felt they shouldn’t be altered after her signature was placed on the form.  I added the necessary data in order to complete the forms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time R’s possible abduction event and the sighting that was initially reported to MUFON will be handled as separate entities.  WUFOD, NUFORC and Filer’s Files were checked for sighting reports that may be relevant to this report but nothing of any significance was discovered.   This sighting was also reported on September 21, a day previous to it being reported to WUFOD, to Peter Davenport’s NUFORC website.  See http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31702.html I’m not aware of any other communications between R and Mr. Davenport.  Mr. Davenport has made the original report available to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due south of the sighting location is Victor Airway 221- 464 which is on an 85o (E-W) heading.   Wind direction from ground level (329 ft. at DTX weather station at Pontiac White Lake) to ~35,000 ft. ranged from 240o - 270o (blowing from the west to east approximately) at speeds ranging from to 6 - 50 mph respectively.  From 35,000 ft. to 97,000 ft. the wind direction was a bit more sporadic, ranging from 20o - 240o at speeds ranging from 58 - 3.5 mph respectively. These figures were taken from radiosonde data from the above-mentioned Nexrad weather station located approximately 30 miles northwest of the sighting location near Waterford, Michigan.  Archived NOTAM’s (Notice to Airmen) were also checked for the date in question but nothing of note was listed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my opinion it is evident that helium balloons tied together could account for some of the movements described by the majority of the witnesses.  As far as the event time and sighting duration discrepancies are concerned I would tend to think the 6:00 pm time range is correct due to the fact that the party was completed and the cleanup had begun.  The football game (Michigan vs. Oregon) was televised at 3:30 pm with the postgame show starting at 6:30 pm.  The sighting duration discrepancies are wide ranging but all estimates are, as far as typical UFO sightings are concerned, rather long in duration.  This would make me lean even further towards the ‘balloon’ hypothesis as a possible explanation due to the objects slow and drifting movements.  There are some aspects such as the color change and ‘beam of light’ or ‘light bar’ noted by a few of the witnesses that would be difficult to explain via the balloon hypothesis, other than it being some type of reflective string used to tie the balloons together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overall, I would have to evaluate this sighting as BORDERLINE IFO due to the distance between the witnesses and the objects, the object’s ‘point like’ appearance yielding no notable surface characteristics or structure, and their slow drifting movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Currently R G has been put in touch with Dr. T concerning her abduction type experiences and she may be scheduling a regressive hypnosis session in the near future.   I feel that her abduction experiences, and their associated emotional difficulties, should be dealt with by a qualified Doctor who can separate the abduction experiences from the more ‘normal’ emotional difficulties that may have arisen due to unrelated health and family issues which R G is facing. This could possibly provide her some relief or coping mechanism for both situations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Todd Lemire Chief Investigator - Michigan MUFON December 2, 2003  ------End Report---------<n>

It is a &#39;comment&#39; report on a follow-up investigation done by a Michigan MUFON Field Investigator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred : 9/20/2003 18:00 (Entered as : 09/20/2003 18:00) Reported: 9/21/2003 6:45:44 PM 18:45 Posted: 9/24/2003 Location: Fraser, MI Shape: Light Duration:25-30 minutes star-like lights in the form of triangles and diamonds dancing in the late afternoon sky My Brother was out in the yard and called to us to hurry and come look at &#34;this&#34;. In the sky directly above us were what we at first thought were hot air balloons that ascended so high they appeared to look like stars in the clear blue sky. There were 3 in a formation of a perfect triangle to the left and 4 to the right in the shape of a diamond. Then they began to dance in the sky with each other returning to their positions. Coming very close to each other but never colliding. There were 3 sets of these formations. One had a stream of light coming from it leading me to believe it was a hot air balloon but when it ascended up and disappeared I dismissed that idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nearing the 20 minutes of watching these star-like objects dancing in the sky others started to appear as dim stars and became brighter up to 50 were in the sky at one time dancing, but never colliding. They ascended and just disappeared. There was no sound, no aircraft in the area, no tails on the craft above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers ranged in age from 81 a homemaker, a police detective (just retired)51, myself (laid off) 48, retired auto worker 53, spouse 54, niece 32, Ameritech line man, 51 and spouse, 51.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Comments on - WUFOD Case 2-826 - Fraser, MI Multiple Witness Daylight Sighting I received FI (I.e. Field Investigator) David Twichell’s photocopied forms and report on Sunday November 9, 2003. My initial impression of this case was that it was a solid case that would produce quite an extensive report due to it being a daylight sighting. The investigator originally included with his report a copy of the original WUFOD report in context of an email I sent him, Form 1 (2 pages), with an extra page for the spillover of the reporting witness’s personal account, a 2 page hand-written description of the object by the witness, Form 2 (3 pages), Form 4 (1 page), Form 5 (1 page) with an added handwritten page describing the psychological and physiological effects as reported by the witness, a 3 page typed report by FI Twichell, a 2 page printout of the weather conditions for Mt. Clemens, MI on September 20, 2003, a one page small printout of a map of the sighting location and two cassette tapes of the phone interviews of all witnesses involved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 8 witnesses in total however after all was said and done only 1 witness’s signature and form are on file with Michigan MUFON. The 1-hour onsite interview was done on November 3, 2003 with R G and her mother S at R’s home. The attention of the investigator has been drawn towards R G, who appears to be the dominant witness and whom initially filed the report. I will summarize my thoughts on the other witnesses accounts first, then R G’ account, and finally on the case as a whole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MA D, wife of L D, described the event in a very straightforward serious manner, with excellent detail. The time of the event as noted by M A was around 4:00 pm (2 hour discrepancy here compared to other witnesses T.L.) or a bit thereafter. She mentions that one of the objects could’ve been a ‘party balloon’ floating upward with a spiral tail attached to the balloon. She mentions that L, her husband, in fact said it was a party balloon. M is in agreement with most of the other witness’s in the fact that she stated she was facing south and the objects were moving from west to east. She suggested that she thought it may have been a ‘weather gadget’ as appears in the movie ‘Twister’, and may have had something to do with weather testing. She mentions a 45-minute duration to the sighting. She described the movements of the clusters of objects as being ‘like a butterfly’, no jerky movements. She also didn’t report any physiological or psychological effects as a result of this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> L D, the witness who was first to see the objects mentions them catching his eye while he was walking up the back steps, to go in the house, around 3:55 pm. He was looking towards the west at about 40o up from the horizon. He stated the sighting duration was approximately 47 minutes. He too reported no physiological or psychological effects as a result of this sighting. He mentioned initially seeing 7 shiny ‘dots’…. 3 being in a ‘straight line’, and 4 being shaped in a ‘straight edged arch’. He mentions some of the objects rotating around in a circle very slowly. Most of his account matches closely with that of his wife M A and that leaves me with the question of, “Was there significant collaboration between the two witnesses resulting in some level of contamination in these two accounts? This seems most evident in the time at which they estimated the sighting began.<n> <n><n> <n><n> S D - L’s Mother - The initial part of this taped conversation has only the voice of FI David Twichell due to the fact that his speakerphone was not turned on. After David asks her about what time [the sighting began - T.L.] there is some silence and then David mentions a time of 6:30 pm during the early part of their conversation. I’m making what I believe is a valid assumption, based on the taped conversation, that they are speaking of the onset of the sighting event. She mentions her friends present at the sighting location counting about 8 -10 lights. She stated they were moving around one another and darting back and forth. She also mentions a sighting duration of 15-20 minutes. Here we see a large discrepancy in the time of the event onset and the sighting duration as compared to L and M A’s account. S states the objects were seen ‘overhead’ in the southeast initially and then darted to the west for a short distance further stating that she didn’t have to move her head very much to follow them. She mentions also that the sun had set approximately 1 hour after the objects disappeared. The sunset, as listed at the bottom of the weather data, was at 7:30 pm so her approximation of the onset of the event being at 6:30 pm could very well be correct. She too mentions the possibility of the objects being helium balloons. She also stated she was emotionally excited and had ‘chills’ up and down her arms. This witness has had a previous sighting of a cigar-shaped object, which she experienced in Canada but no specific information was given about this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AM G - She initially states the time of the sighting started at 5:30 pm. She states she was initially facing south, which is in agreement with most of the other witnesses. She mentions the objects slowly moving, or drifting across the sky and that she watched them for approximately 2 hours (a notable discrepancy in the sighing duration here - T.L.). For the most part the description of the objects is in agreement with the others. She states she suffered from no physiological or psychological effects, however she does mention one interesting effect and that was she saw “little white specks” like TV static in her eyes due to her head being craned up towards the sky. She had to repeatedly look down to relieve this effect and readjust her eyes. She believes this may have been due to her looking up in the sky for long periods of time. She said the objects were at an elevation of approximately 80o to directly overhead. (Here too is a discrepancy in what was said to be a 40o elevation for the objects mentioned by the initial witness L. - T.L.) J G had very little to add to this investigation. His interview was extremely short. He was in the house watching a football game and showed very little interest in determining what the others were viewing. He states the sighting onset was approximately 6:00 pm. He stated he didn’t look at the objects long enough to discern much detail. He stated what he saw was a bunch of cluster type star shapes and then went right back in to watch the football game, not looking at them long enough to even determine if they were moving. He stated that the other witnesses stayed outside for 15-20 minutes watching the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> M Z stated onset of sighting event was about 5:30 pm. She stated she saw white ‘balls’ like a balloon but it wasn’t a balloon. She states there was about 15-20 of them and the sighting duration was a good 45 minutes. She stated that the objects were in different areas and not in one spot. The witness says they [her and the other witnesses] were all kind of nervous. M stated that R called [reported them to MUFON] because her and her mother thought these were some kind of thing from outer space. She states the objects were moving in different directions, yet says that it could’ve been the wind blowing them. She said at no time did they change color. No physiological or psychological effects noted by this witness. Witness, in my opinion, seemed very hesitant to give out her address, and left only her phone number with FI Twichell. Her husband M was interviewed later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MZ stated he saw 10 whitish things that could’ve been balloons. He didn’t watch them too long and didn’t think anything of it. Stated it didn’t interest him so he went back in the house. Onset of event he says was 5:30 - 5:45 pm. To him it looked like balloons. He stated they were kind of drifting not going any certain way. Objects were at a high altitude. He watched the objects for approximately 5 minutes. Nothing unusual noticed, as they were too far away to tell. No color changes noticed. Very short interview…approximately 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> R G, the witness who reported this incident, was affected quite differently by this event. She states the onset of the event was around 6:00 pm with a total duration of 25-30 minutes, which fits in well with most of the other witness’s accounts, except for those of L and MA D. She first thought these were hot air balloons. She went on to describe their movements using the word ‘dancing’ meaning they would move towards and away from, and around each other. She initially saw 7 objects in two different groups. She describes the color as being dim blue then turning brighter. She goes on to describe in detail, as evidenced in the taped interview, many perceptions that weren’t described by the other 7 witnesses. R’s size estimation being that of an aspirin, as suggested by the FI is quite in opposition to the starlike description given by the other witnesses. She relates her account in a very excited way with a lot of emotion in her voice. The other witnesses sounded much calmer when relating their accounts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> R mentions another sighting she witnessed about 17 years ago in which she called Selfridge ANG at that time as well, with no response from her message left on the automated answering system at the base. 20 minutes into her phone interview R adamantly mentions there was not a plane anywhere in the sky. She then mentions, about 27 minutes into the interview that “after, a jetliner was by and it was higher than that”. This point being unclear as to whether or not the objects were in the sky during the time the plane was seen. I asked FI Twichell to clarify this if he could. He states, “As to the plane involved in the sighting of Sept. 20th, I’m sorry I’m not making myself clear on this. I didn’t make a copy of the recorded interviews so I can’t check them for clarity but the witnesses agree that they did not see any conventional aircraft in the sky until the very end of the sighting episode. While the objects were still above them, a jet, coming from the direction of Selfridge, came into view and headed in the direction of the objects. At this time, the objects ascended and were gone from view. MA stated that the plane was visible while the objects were still visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> R goes on to mention her husband’s flu-like illness previous to the sighting and it’s complete reversal during the sighting, and then a subsequent relapse afterwards. She feels this may be relevant. Her husband did not mention this during his interview. R also noticed a definite difference in local animal activity whereas the others did not, and also mentioned an eerie silence during the event. She goes on to describe the remainder of the sighting as mentioned within David’s report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Form 2, first page, under ‘Shape’ I noticed that ‘disk’ was checked off but I hadn’t heard any witness mention anything about a ‘disk’ shape to these objects. I queried David about this and he replied, “The one object that appeared to be larger than the others, with the curly-Q tail, was described by R G as being more disk-shaped than star like. She was the only witness that made this observation. I’m not aware of where this statement appears in the context of the material that has been made available to me (T.L.).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I completed forms 4 &amp; 5 as indicated on the forms. These were sent by the FI, via postal mail, to the witness to be completed and signed. Once she returned them he felt they shouldn’t be altered after her signature was placed on the form. I added the necessary data in order to complete the forms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WUFOD, NUFORC and Filer’s Files were checked for sighting reports that may be relevant to this report but nothing of any significance was discovered. This sighting was also reported on September 21, a day previous to it being reported to WUFOD, to Peter Davenport’s NUFORC website. See http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31702.html I’m not aware of any other communications between R and Mr. Davenport. Mr. Davenport has made the original report available to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due south of the sighting location is Victor Airway 221- 464 which is on an 85o (E-W) heading. Wind direction from ground level (329 ft. at DTX weather station at Pontiac White Lake) to ~35,000 ft. ranged from 240o - 270o (blowing from the west to east approximately) at speeds ranging from to 6 - 50 mph respectively. From 35,000 ft. to 97,000 ft. the wind direction was a bit more sporadic, ranging from 20o - 240o at speeds ranging from 58 - 3.5 mph respectively. These figures were taken from radiosonde data from the above-mentioned Nexrad weather station located approximately 30 miles northwest of the sighting location near Waterford, Michigan. Archived NOTAM’s (Notice to Airmen) were also checked for the date in question but nothing of note was listed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my opinion it is evident that helium balloons tied together could account for some of the movements described by the majority of the witnesses. As far as the event time and sighting duration discrepancies are concerned I would tend to think the 6:00 pm time range is correct due to the fact that the party was completed and the cleanup had begun. The football game (Michigan vs. Oregon) was televised at 3:30 pm with the postgame show starting at 6:30 pm. The sighting duration discrepancies are wide ranging but all estimates are, as far as typical UFO sightings are concerned, rather long in duration. This would make me lean even further towards the ‘balloon’ hypothesis as a possible explanation due to the objects slow and drifting movements. There are some aspects such as the color change and ‘beam of light’ or ‘light bar’ noted by a few of the witnesses that would be difficult to explain via the balloon hypothesis, other than it being some type of reflective string used to tie the balloons together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overall, I would have to evaluate this sighting as BORDERLINE IFO due to the distance between the witnesses and the objects, the object’s ‘point like’ appearance yielding no notable surface characteristics or structure, and their slow drifting movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Todd Lemire Chief Investigator - Michigan MUFON January 5, 2004 ------End Report---------<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note: We express our gratitude to Todd Lemire, State Director for Michigan MUFON, for following up on this report.

I am 16 and male. I was in my bedroom watching TV and it was 8:39 PM in New Jersey. I live in Williamstown, New Jersey. Before I go on, let me say that for about a month before I am reporting this I have been reading older reports on this site. I always watch the X-Files and UFO documentarys. So I know how to look at odd objects in the sky. So I was watching TV and then all of a suden I heard a very odd noise. This was so odd, I got off my bed and looked out the window and saw a Traingle shaped craft with a light at each point. The lights were a whitish-yellowish color. I could also see a wierdish blue haze around this craft. I could cleary notice it has no wings. It seemed to have equal sides on each side of this triange and if anything, it looked metallic. Then it flew over my house so I left my room and went into the hallway to see out the other side of the house. Then I saw 2 triangle crafts with the 3 lights. One infront of the other. These cratfs were flying over a road called the black horse pike. This is also near a small airport called the Cross Keys airport. Theres always planes, very small ones. These were no planes and from what I could see, if I would of seen these Traingle shaped UFO&#39;s upclose they would of been VERY big. They continued flying away out of my view, and the nieghbors trees were now in my way. So then after they left I came right to my computer and reported this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you wish to contact me thats fine, my e-mail is ((e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to have his neighbors submit reports, as well, if they were witness to the objects.

Then it happened again in a different place.  There where about 50 whitnesses sense it was at a foot ball game.  That night i did some research about local sightings and on this sight i found a 2 year old report of the same thing that happened hear in Onawa!!! i coundn&#39;t beleive it!  all i can say is that theres something freaky goin on here! lol<n>

I and another officer were doing security for a high school football game, when off to the east we noticed what appeared to be a orangish light that seperated in to 4 seperate lights.  The light were in a diagnal straight line.  when the light on the right side would go out another would appear on the left, giving the appearance that the lights where traveling accross the sky.  I observed another light appear to the lower left of the set of 4. The lights were visible for about 5 to 10 min and then went out.  We observed them re appear again about 5 min later.   When the lights re appeared I was looking at them through my binoculars.  They were smaller white lights in the area that i could see, but did not appear to be aircraft lights. I am not sure what they were. I at first thought maybe they were flares from military type aircraft.  I talked with some ex milatry people about what military flares look like.  I have been told that they burn out fairly quickly, where these lights seem to stay visible for quite some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light had a slight reddish tinge and looked like a faint star or satellite.  As it slowly moved downward towards the tree line, it would would jog slightly to the left or to the right and then jog back to approximately the original downward line it was following.  These left and right shifts were irregular in terms of distance and frequency.  The greatest sideways displacement was approximately 1/8 degree.  The downward speed was not completely constant.  After a few minutes it started to fade and then completely disappeared a few degrees from the treeline.  This was observed on a very clear night in the mountains and would have been completely hidden by city lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date above is flawed.  We  believe it to be 19SE03.

The sun had just set and we have lately been looking for Mars in the sky. I first looked to the south western sky and I saw a bright light as bright as Mars but in the wrong place for that time.The light though was a redish color. It was not the light of a planes nav or landing lights as I am a pilot and know what they look like. After looking at this bright lite for a few minutes it faded away as if on a south westerly course.The sky was quite clear with unrestriced visability.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was visible and very dominant in the blue sky right before it turned dark. As the sky grew darker the light started to glow orange. It made me think that whatever this was; it was between the earth and the sun and as the sun set further it lost it&#39;s brilliance and slowly turned orange and faded. As nighttime passed the light had completely faded to a star that had to be observed using averted vision. This light/star tracked perfectly with the background stars also and rotated out of view after about 9:00 P.M. I would agree that this could have been a weather balloon had it not tracked with the background stars and faded to a very dim star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Intense glowing object changing colors<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving south on I-25 from albuquerque area to home in Belen, My husband and I witnessed a very intense glowing object southwest of Belen area. Several other vehicles were pulled over the side of the road, obviously observing the same object as we were. We drove to our home and was able to visualize the glowing object for at least an hour. The object apeared to just slightly move in the sky with no dramatic movements and changed color from bright glowing white to intense red in color then back to white again then finally to red. Then object diminished in sky. Sighting lasting approx a little over an hour. Neighborhood teenagers stating the object swayed several times during the hour. Object approx 3/4 mile away ( not quite sure on the distance against the sky ). One jet and one small perhaps cesna flew towards the object and the object did not move. I did not have a camera available and wished I had. But recently heard that channel 7 news did a story on this.<n>

I am sort-of a big UFO fan and I often &#34;search the sky&#34;. I looked up and saw what was eather an oval or circular shaped craft. Not paying much attention to the craft, I kept working. Then I started to hear strange noises. I looked up back at the craft and noticed it was sort-of joilting non-violently. And every time it joilted, it let out a very soft &#34;crackling&#34; noise. I looked back at my father, who was also staring at the craft. The lawn-mower was not on, so the noise was definetly not the lawn-mower. Where we live it is very quiet and I don&#39;t think anything but that craft made the noise. One thing to keep in mind is, the airport we live next to is south of us, and the aircraft must fly low to land or takeoff. For the airport is so small. And this craft must have been at least 2000 feet in the air. It went behind small clouds, and it soon disappeared. I know alot about aircraft, and the distance it took for the craft to get as high as it did, is most almost impossible if not dangerous for the crew and passengers. Also, dogs won&#39;t bark at airplanes high int he air. Then why did they when this thing flew over. THEY WENT CRAZY. Please e-mail me if there has been anything else like this. Thank You.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I first noticed it at , about 2:30PM when I was working in my yard. It stayed in the same spot for so long that I decided to try to photograph it.  Then I forgot about it. However when I went up to  my office later that night around 7 or so, I looked out the window and saw it was still there and very bright. It was to the left of sunset so I figure it was lit up by the sun. Then it turned orange, and sort of faded. I assumed that it was a balloon because this is an area where hot air balloons are so prevalent.  But it was odd that it stayed there for so long. Usually balloon rides are relatively short. The other unusual thing I noticed is that the bottom/sides of the thing seemed to have some sort of energy that was distorting light, as if it were engine exhaust or something like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just found out about the ufo reporting page and noticed that others reported it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I *did* photograph it and put the photos on  my web site. However, we are asked not to  enter any names or contact info in this box so I don&#39;t know how to tell others where to view the photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have altered the date above to 2003, which we believe is what the witness intended.  We believe our Online Report Form may be malfunctioning.  The object may have been a helium filled, high-altitude balloon.

While traveling through the Snowy Range area, we witnessed an object in the sky that was unlike anything that I have ever seen.   It looked like an inverted teardrop or ice cream cone shape.   The sky was clear with no clouds on the background.   The color of the object was crystalline with definite structure lines that seemed to be silver.   It was close enough to tell that it was not a weather balloon or something like that.   It was clearly rigid with a defined structure and did not waver back and forth like a balloon would.   The object seemed to float steadily and then descended to the ground after several seconds but did not descend all the way to the surface.   Rather, it seemed to lower itself below the tree line so that we could not view it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were utterly mystified at to what this object was yet we did not feel threatened at any time.   I am under the impression that this could be some sort of military application but the shape seemed so inconsistent with anything that humans build.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

9/19/03 12:30|Rancho Cordova|CA|Circle|1-2 minutes|Red-orange ball of light over the skies of Sacramento, CA.|9/24/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31639.html|209|ndxe200309| Red-orange ball of light over the skies of Sacramento, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work security on the graveyard shift where I drive a patrol vehicle around a parking area of office buildings in Rancho Cordova, California (just east of Sacramento). It was about 12-1:00am on Friday morning September 19, 2003 when I turned the vehicle to face south when something in the sky caught my eye. It was a circular red-orange ball of light that was hovering slowly east. If it were right in front of me I would have to estimate it at walking speed. The size, like throwing a golf ball straight up into the air about seven or eight feet. At first I thought it may have been a helicopter or airplane as this object was above Mather AirForce Base, which is inactive. Usually, however, a helicopter or plane is accompanied by flashing green or white lights, as I see them on a nightly basis. So I turned off the engine to my vehicle and opened the door to see if I could hear an engine of some kind ... there was nothing. This light continued to hover east for several seconds then came to a stop. It had only been still for no more than two seconds before it disappeared. It didn&#39;t fade or speed out of sight, but just vanished like turning off a light switch. I sat there for several more minutes hoping this thing would return, but it never did. I told myself I wouldn&#39;t sare this with anyone as they might think I was crazy, but decided differently when listening to the &#34;Coast to Coast AM&#34; radio program this evening with Peter Davenport. When Mr. Davenport shared his first experience of witnessing a U.F.O., my stomach sank like that first drop when riding a roller coaster. Not being a previous believer in this sort of thing, I know what I saw was absolutely real and someone else must have seen it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/19/03 08:30|California City|CA|Cylinder|4-5 minutes|"tiny" flying cylinder (not a drone, Predator, cruise missile, etc.) no wings/rudder/no exhaust/no prop|9/24/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31726.html|210|ndxe200309| &#34;tiny&#34; flying cylinder (not a drone, Predator, cruise missile, etc.) no wings/rudder/no exhaust/no prop<n> <n><n> <n><n> PREFACE:  I have two homes up here in the Mojave Desert, both aviation testing heavens for aviation buffs. One is Near China Lake and the other is on top of a hill in remote location just north of Edwards AFB (EAFB).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The EAFB place is directly under a heavily used,  supersonic low altitude corridor so we see all the military&#39;&#39;s good stuff being tested and passing directly over our house 24 hours per day.  (B2, B1, F-117, F-22, JSF, NASA-Dryden stuff, Osprey, C-17 and many other test models.  So we here are battle hardened when it comes to &#34;UFO&#34; sightings and many folks just take them for granted due to the heavy activity out here of experimental stuff going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of us &#34;literate&#34; residents of this area know our planes and the generalities and the specifics of sensitive and public projects going on at EAFB/China Lake, etc. because we work there or at Plant 42 (Palmdale) or at famous Mojave civilian airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The stuff that goes on at these three locatations is cutting edge.  In fact, the lead British test pilot testing Lockheed&#39;s version of the F-22 Raptor was over at my home one day visiting and he said they use my EAFB-area house as a marker from the sky.  That explains why we get buzzed several times a day and why our drywall nails are popping out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With all that said, please advise that I know my planes, I have better than 2010 vision, have flown helicopters, am an amateur astronomer with a Celestron C-8 (with &#34;go to&#34;) and a Cave Optics 10&#34; Newtonian telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a wife that is a pilot (we are both scientists) and we have large personal photo archive of really tight shots of just about everything (declassified) that has passed by our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, September 19 I was do my morning mountain bike ride on the I-58 frontage roads on the north side of Edwards AFB (which is west of Mojave). Three silver fighters (not white or black matte or grey) passed over headign north about 1000 feet AGL and about 10 feet off the wing of one of them was a grey flying cylinder about 4-6 feet long. It was NOT being towed and it was NOT a cruise missile, NOT a drone (I am familiar with them from NAWC Weapons-Point Magu), nor was it the Predator or Dark Star, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had no visible exhaust, no rudder could be seen, no canards or winglets, and it flew around the fighters (from front to back to side, like a toddler hands around it&#39;s mother&#39;s legs). So it was not being towed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 minutes later the three fighters returned (again heading in the same Northerly direction), but this time the little cylinder craft was gone.  .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Problem 1: No fighter plane would (to my knowlecge) get that close to a flying missile or remotely controlled object. It was within 5 feet of the planes when parallel to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Problem 2: I can&#39;t see how this was propelled. It obviously was not towed! And they were travelling 200-300 mph. A little slow for a missile. Besides there are no bombing ranges in this immediate area. They are all at China Lake (60 miles to the north).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Problems 3: if it was remotely controlled how could it fly as such without some winglets and rudder. Of course I am aware of thrust vectoring, but this one had no exhaust. New propulsion technique?  Speculation: Since this was escorted, it was clearly military, and could be a source of similar UFO sightings and reports. For example, a friend saw a small, lone  flying tube/cigar around the canyons back in Sand Canyon in Tehachapi, CA (40 mis west of EAFB) with no visible propulsion system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Summary:  I wouldn&#39;t even bother to report this one, but I think it could be of interest to other parties who have seen something like this and other military craft and think of it as extraterrestrial.  The military has some pretty good stuff that is way ahead of the outdated Stealths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For comparison, BTW, two years ago in the winter I did see the very LARGE triangular, matte black craft early one very cloudy morning flying north out of Palmdale (Plant 42). While driving on I-14 west of Plant 42 airstrips I saw it lift up into the thick low clouds in thesky so fast I couldn&#39;t believe it!  I almost ran off the road. Clearly they wanted this thing up into the cloud cover ASAP.  NO, it was not the B-2 or tiny F-117, the large tankers, nor the C-117 (or others, which are common around here). It looked like about 2.5 times the size (or more) of the B-2 with slight upturn on the tips of the manta type wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I glanced up and saw the moon which was half a moon. Looking at the moon a bright dot of light caught my eye and I thought I was watching a sattelite. It seemed strange though because it appeared to be veering off a straight line that a sattelite would travel. After watching for a minute I noticed more lights in a grouping and another grouping set apart from it. I thought that they might be spots in my eyes but I noticed that they would disappear behind some high thin strps of clouds. My next thought was that I was viewing commercial aircraft. I stepped under the soffit of my house and used the gutter as a staionary reference point and noticed that the lights moved in random directions and circular patterns. At one point two lights approached a couple of others and ended up reversing directions before they got too close together.I watched one light fly across the visible moon and was able to see it constantly as it passed.After watching for ten or more minutes I saw my neighbor come out of his house and asked him to look. I had to cross the street to do this and was unable to find the clusters I had been watching. We did see one light moving away together. It was very exciting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The orange light appeared again as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am certain that at least 20-30 travelers on the GSP saw what I saw as we all slowed down to see what was going on. There wasnt any sound associated with these lights but they were nothing I have ever seen in my 38 years of being here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the GSP has trees along its banks, it made it difficult to see what caused the illuminations but it was clear that whatever it was made pure daylight for 3 seconds for quite some distance along the NJ shore..

9/18/03 23:00|Edmonton (Canada)|AB|Unknown|3 Minutes|Two objects with highly intense brilliant white flashes moving slowly north at extremely high altitude in parallel orbit.|9/24/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31742.html|214|ndxe200309| Two objects with highly intense brilliant white flashes moving slowly north at extremely high altitude in parallel orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Wife and I go into the outdoor hottub every night and we have an unobstructed view of the night sky. Thursday night, we went into the tub and sat looking at the passing satellites going over and we noticed an extremely bright, pure white flash of light in the southern night sky at about 80 Deg. above the horizon. This light flashed and was gone. It suddenly appeared again but had travelled approximately one fist width (held at arms length) in a northerly direction. This light flash on and of at approximately two second intervals for almost 30 seconds then the frequency changed to an erratic flashing that would pause for a second, then flash, then pause for two or three seconds then flash. This continued for another two minutes or so and then it just stopped and disappeared. Then, at the same line of travel, back in the southern sky came a second flash. This one was also at about 80 Deg. above the horizon. This one continued for about one and a half minutes, following the same pattern of erratic flashes and also followed the same north bound path, but it was further to the west of the first object. It also disappeared (stopped flashing) as it passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been an avid atronomer for over 40 years and can honestly state that this caught my attention in that when I went inside, I got on my computer and hit the Nasa Site - &#34;J-Track&#34; (Satellite Tracking Software that is available to all) and there were no satellites tracking over our part of Alberta at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also been involved in Satellite Tracking of land-based assets and have also participated in the Cobalt Radiation Testing of Chips and related software for the GPS Satellite Constellation Correction and Surveillance Sats Sys that actually tracks and maintains the record of correctional data for the deliniation of the current Glonass and GPS Constellations that are orbiting the earth today. It is not that I do not know what an orbiting satellite looks like as it goes over. THese objects were not satellites or anything that we have sent up. These objects were pulsating at a timed and then erratic rate which indicates a self serving &#34;at the time of initiation&#34; protocol, not one that is programmed by any standard we use on earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen hundreds of Satellites that spin along their axis in their orbit and have witnessed their solar panels flashing as they rotate toward the sun and these flashes that my wife and I witnessed were simply not the flashes caused by the solar panels of satellites being illuminated by the sun. The lights were of such an intensity that they were similar to th star burst flares dropped from aircraft to light up ground positions......only so very much brighter. My wife says they were like looking into the flash of a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, I was travelling west on Saturday morning at 0400 and was listening to you on the radio for that hour and was taken with the fact that someone had seen the exact same lights over Seattle only one or two nights prior to my wife and seeing them over Alberta. Incidently, high orbit travel at any conventional sat speed from Seattle to Edmonton is about 11 minutes or so..............rough of the top of the head reckoning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this helps you in your project and I can honestly state that this did in fact occur and my wife was and still is, somewhat amazed and left wondering.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This would be looking southwest from my house; Pikes Peak on the left of the object. I observed what appeared to be a very bright PARALLELOGRAM (exactly what it looked like); yellowish glow, either moving very slowly or nearly stationary. I brought out my field glasses but could not make out any other lights; in fact, there seemed to be dark splotches scattered on it (not symmetrical, just random). Oddly, I could not really get it into focus (it was kind of shimmery), although I could focus on the visitors center (sharper but much smaller) at the top of Pikes Peak fairly easily. It was quite large in comparison to the visitors center so it seems I should have been able to see more detail. Trying to use my videocam and my digital still camera proved fruitless...I couldn&#39;t even see it in the viewfinders.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was visible for approximately two hours and appeared to move only slightly from right to left; at one point it was partly obscured by trees which is how I could detect the motion. It did not move up or down, just slowly side to side. It was an absolutely perfect parallelogram (I even looked up a photo of a parallelogram just to make sure). I made my husband come out and look; he saw it but kind of shrugged it off even though he had no explanation for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size-wise, using the Pikes Peak visitors center as a standard, it was at least five times larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe I have seen only one other UFO in my life and that was over 25 years ago in San Diego, CA. I called a local TV station about that one (cigar-shaped with colored lights) and other people had also called in about it. I did not call any local TV stations this time (I probably will in the AM) as it was getting late. When I went out to check on it again around midnight, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The two oval lights then appeared to &#39;double themselve&#39; and break into four at times and become two again very quickly.  In some areas of the sky it was cloudy, but we noticed that the lights would continue on, whether they were on top of the clouds or on the clear portions of the sky, so we concluded it couldn&#39;t have been &#39;lightning&#39;. We also concluded that the sophistication of the movement patterns at times were too controlled to have been spots of lightning, as the lights would go in perfect cirles at 180 degrees from each other, and then one would catch up with the other and they appeared to almost be dancing.  The colour of these objects was white and we watched them for forty minutes, before retiring.  I don&#39;t know how much longer they were were visible after that. My friend is quite a skeptic around these matters, so for her to have seen them as well proves I wasn&#39;t &#39;seeing things&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was not yet dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate the circumference of the object at about 3/4 of the size of a dime held at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on my balcony in (deleted by HBCC UFO) facing east and south watching a thick lower cloud cover get fiercely blown - roughly from west to east (possibly southwest to northeast?).  We had very strong winds that afternoon and evening. The sky was not fully overcast and there were two levels of cloud cover.  The upper cloud layer was much less dense, more dispersed, and did not move nearly as rapidly as the lower cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up between, say, +/-35 degrees to the horizon I saw a perfectly round very white object come into my view moving slowly in a straight line roughly east to west (possibly northeast to southwest) above the lower cloud cover (at roughly the same level as the upper cloud cover).  In any event it appeared to be moving in the direction opposite to the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed this object between 30 seconds to 60 seconds.  Towards the end of the sighting the object appeared to smoothly turn away from me slightly as it moved into clouds in the upper cloud layer where I could no longer see it.  It did not reemerge that I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot estimate the size of this object.  I am not particularly good at distances and my only real frames of reference are the two layers of cloud cover.  I don&#39;t know the elevations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe it shifted direction slightly because it appeared to reduce somewhat in size before it entered the upper clouds - as if it had turned away and was receding into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I won&#39;t hazard a guess at the size of the object but I will stand on the fact that it was white, perfectly round, and it moved against the direction of the lower cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone else been reporting sightings of objects in the sky around Kamloops recently?

My daughter is a very rational and academically gifted 16 year old high school student. I am a physician.  I have been in practice for 20 years since completion of training.  I also have a strong background in abstract and applied mathematics and physics and I have actively maintained and advanced my scientific side.  Rocky Mount was engaged by Hurricane Isabel at that time as we had ventured out on the road.  Suddenly, a low frequency, low intensity  hum vibrated the car and though I ducked my head down reflexively, an intense but very transient flash of green light enveloped the car. My daughter asked, &#34;What was that?&#34; I suggested it was possibly ball lightening but I am not sure.  There was moderate rain and wind at the moment and the road condition was wet but not flooded.  The sky was overcast with a thick, dark gray and relatively low blanket of rain clouds as one would expect of a hurricane.  However, I had neither seen lightening nor heard thunder during the entire day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later as I returned home, I looked carefully at all the wires and poles in that area. There were no transformers to be seen and the wires all looked unremarkably intact.  The area where this occurred is developed on one side with office buildings and has woods and high grass on the other for a space extending about 1/3 of a mile to I-64.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a cursory search, I saw nothing in the area to suggest a meteor had fallen.  I did not see any evidence of aircraft in the area.  Furthermore, it would have been extremently hazardous for aircraft of any sort to fly through Hurricane Isabel.  There was no damage to the car whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still am lacking for an explanation as to what we experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Upon noticing this, I saw it move slowly westward towards PBIA and assumed it must be a plane. Then all of the sudden it  dropped around 500 feet straight down. I reached over to get my digital camera on the seat and kept my eyes on it at all times. Right as I was getting ready to take a picture of it, the craft shot off towards the west at incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then 2 hours later I left PB and headed south to Lake Worth Pier to see how the Isabelle swell was hitting there. Right as I was setting up my camera to tape the surfing, I noticed the same craft in the southeastern sky at around 3000 ft up. The craft seemed to notice me when I noticed it and slowly turned away from me showing the rear or front of the craft. It then slowly faded to a small point and was gone in an instant. You&#39;d think with all the people on the beach someone else would have seen it but nobody saw anything most likely because the surf was keeping their attention. The strangest thing about both encounters was the fact that it seemed to know it had been noticed and sped away both times before I could get my camera ready.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It almost seems as if they were watching the surfers or the swells coming in at our local beaches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Craft was roughly the size of a commecial airliner in length, and was obviously metallic because of the glint the sun shone off of it. No wings just a smooth cigar shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something is going on in our skies as of late, and now that it&#39;s come to my neighborhood, I&#39;ll be watching the sky a lot more and next time I will get some footage for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will inquire as to whether the witness called the object to the attention of other bystanders.

Edwards AFB call-forwarded the witness to NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness reported that he had just opened a garage door at approximately between 11:00 a.m to noon., he thought, when his attention was immediately drawn to the sky by a humming or buzzing noise, which he at first thought was caused by an aircraft engine.  Very quickly, as he visually scanned the sky to locate the source of the sound, he spotted its apparent source, a peculiar looking luminous sphere, which looked somewhat like &#34;the head of a (straight) pin.&#34;  It appeared to the witness to be self-luminous, rather than reflective, he thought, and the object was in the northern sky, moving slowly to the south, and executing a steady turn to the southwest.  Its apparent size he equated to noticably larger than that of a large star in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the witness watched the object, it completed its turn to the west, and it accelerated and disappeared from his sight over the mountain range to the west of Palmdale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness spent several decades working in the aerospace industry, and in other technically oriented industries, as well.  He served in the U. S. military, during which time he flew aboard many different types of military aircraft.  He emphasized that the object he witnessed was not any type of conventional, or aerodynamic, craft, in his opinion, and the sound it seemed to come from it was unusual, something he had never heard before.<n>

It moved very slowly in the direction of the coastline,coming into view,going by,moving past,then finally disappearing.I knew it was round because the moonlight caught it on it&#39;s side,accentuating it&#39;s round shape.

These orbs of light streaked across the sky and then reversed their directions and began &#34;playing&#34; and interacting with each other as if in a &#34;dog-fight&#34;. It reminded me of those old war films where the planes would fly in formation and then break-away and engage with the enemy...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a skeptic at heart and did not want to believe what I saw clearly taking place. These aerobatics continued for some time and we ruled out all of the usual causes that may have created this illusion: 1) neither of us were in intoxicated in any way 2) the sky was totally unobstructed by clouds or Moonlight 3) they were not birds or bats due to the velocity of travel across a huge portion of the sky and the way in which they could stand completely still, They could veer off in any direction without breaking speed, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4) I woke up my roommate and had her come and see this orbs also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5) last, but not least, at 6AM they all returned to the &#34;star&#34; just before daybreak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I might add also that this occured just days before Hurricane Isabelle began its journey towards our shore. I live one mile from the Atlantic Coast and Isabelle was headed directly for us as a catagory 5 hurricane. In the last approach to our shoreline Isabelle reduced to a catagory 3 and changed course to come inland above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that these were other-wordly craft and wonder if they usually appear before catastophic events and I also wonder if anyone else in our area witnessed this same phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As our plane leveled off I looked outside of my window and saw what I believed at first to be a bright star, possibly Mars as it would flicker between white and red. About two minutes passed and I looked outside the window again and saw the same star at the same distance as i had seen it prior.  I put my glasses on to see if instead of a star it could be another plane also flying in the same direction as it seemed to be keeping the same pace with our plane. At that time the pilot had put on the seat belt light.  I didn&#39;t know why as there was no turbulence at this time.  i couldn&#39;t quite make out whether it was another plane or a star.  it wasn&#39;t above or below but ahead and to the left of the plane and eye level.  a few more minutes passed and suddenly the object seemed to make a sharp right as though it was about to fly in front of our plane.  At first i thought that maybe the plane had veered left that would account for this shape to seem as though it was going to the right, but i had been on airplanes numerous times to know how it feels when a plane veers left or right.  Maybe it&#39;s nothing but if someone else saw this i would appreciate it if they would report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

September 17th at aproximately 10:30 pm my wife and I began our nightly walk of our dog.  It was a particularly clear night and as we walked I was looking at Mars which was very clear and visible in the night sky.  At about 10:35 pm something caught my attention in the sky to the right of my view of Mars.  It was a flashing white light moving West to east, but it was so high up I thought it was a satelite (which can be seen from time to time on a clear night).  I stopped my wife so I can point the satelite out to her.  She finally focused in and saw the flashing light, however it wasn&#39;t the lights I was pointing to... she had discovered a second flashing light.  This one was stationary directly below our Mars view.  The first object was heading directly towards the second object.  The stationary object also had a red light underneath.  When the first object lined up directly over the stationary object the two then began to move.  The first object that had been going West to East now changed direction and moved in unison with the second object heading now in a south to north direction.  At that point I knew that this wasn&#39;t a satelite, because satelites don&#39;t make a 90 degree turn and change direction.  These objects were very high up in earths upper atmosphere.  We watched as these 2 objects moved northward and then in the distance we saw a third stationary object flashing...  and then a fourth.  The 2 new objects appeared to be stationary and the first 2 objects were heading directly towards them.  At this point we became very uneasy.  We tried to think of rational explanations to explain what we were seeing.  The first 2 objects now lined up with the 2 new objects and all 4 began to head nothwards.  It also became clear that the object my wife had spotted was substantially larger than the other 3 and it appeared by the flashing lights to be triangular with a red light underneathe.  The larger object also appeared to be riding point as it was slightly ahead of the others.  As th! ey began moving north the 3 other objects suddenly went black and only the larger object was visible.We debated that it might be some kind of Military project, however I doubt the military has anything that can hover in the upper atmosphere at a stand still, wait for the other objects to catch up and then proceed, and satelites certainly can&#39;t change direction or wait for other satelites to catch up to them and then move.  I consider ourselves to be a very normal American couple and not UFO enthusiasts.   We are rational people and we witnessed something that defies rational. If there was ever a doubt that there is something else out their we have now seen it with our own eyes.  My wife, a devout Christian, didn&#39;t want to see this.  It has been an upsetting encounter for her because it cannot be explained.  The entire encounter took approximately 10-15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What I saw changed direction and brightness as I watched it. I really think it was something maybe it is nothing, but I really think it was something. I heard you tonite on CtoC. Great show!  Back in &#39;63 my mom and brother saw a UFO, disc shape, right over thier heads. Telephone poles on the street kept the craft from landing on them. So naturally I am allways looking up, looking for things.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He happened to look out the window while he was sitting down using the bathroom. It was a very clear night out. He noticed an object that seemed brighter than all the other stars. Then he called me to look at it. The object didn&#39;t move like an airplane it actually stood still but we found it was moving slowy away from it&#39;s original spot. We decided to look further at this object so we got out some binoculars and went out into our backyard. The object seemed to be round but with other round objects like colored lights or something  but moving around it.The object seemed to be one whole object. They are hard to describe I&#39;m not sure if they were lights or what but they did not seem solid...At first we thought it was a radio tower light...but then the object appeared to be moving slowly...The lights were different colors blues, greens, and reds, so I thought it was weird and may not be a planet or something. The other object was like the colored object except it was all white and very bright. The white object we saw later after we decided to drive by the lake and take a better look at the colored object. We were ready for bed before this all happened but we really felt we needed to take a closer look at these objects they were strange and we normally don&#39;t do this sort of  thing...My husband had seen something strange before while hunting a long time ago but I&#39;ve never seen anything I couldn&#39;t explain. We&#39;ve decided to maybe purchase a telescope to look around and see what else is out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the alleged incident is approximate, even though she submitted the report on the following morning.

There is pretty much zero light pollution in my area so my space view is amazing.. anyway I was walking my dogs and was scanning the super clear sky as usuall when I saw a shooting star and then moments later an extremely large rectangular object appearred from the east and was heading west... I am familar with aircraft dating back to WWII and this was unlike any I have ever seen... It looked like a building on its side with many lights... I say it looked like a building cause the lights resembled tiny windows... Kind of like a skyscraper on its side... I did hear engines (unlike jet engines) and its was moving very slow almost to slow to be flying.. I did not see any wings and there were no other craft around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I was actually a triangle of 3 lights underneath and the 2 blinking side ones.  Then it began to move, not very quickly - about 50-60 mph and I followed down the road until it was going a bit faster out over a field where I noticed 3 other identicle blinking lights that went towards each other and away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a beam of light that surrounded me, a glowing white light.Several entities appeared. at the time I could not see them but could hear them.This was experienced consciously in my place of  work. ( I work for a private wealth management firm in downtown Toronto) From that point on til the present day they have performed various types of experiements and performed surgery on me. For a great of time I believed this was some sort of negative spiritual experience as I could not see any entities. There was an entity that seemed to attach itself to my head on the right side. He continued to communicate with me. He made various claims about his purpose but the main one was that I was to have a baby. I asked the entity to leave and tried various techniques to get rid of it, white light techniques, prayer. At this point the entity seemed to have the ability to constict blood flow and/or ability to breathe in some way. I was in a great deal of pain as a result of their various experiments. At this point, there were several other entities that arrived, they came into my apartment. They had the appearance of reptilians. They performed various experiments on me and would not leave. Later other groups arrived, the had the appearance of the praying mantis type aliens and there appeared to be Zeta Reticuli involved as well. The following claims have been made, they are here to crack the binary code, they are here to create &#34;free energy&#34; they are spies here to control the group mind of North America. They are here to cross bred with humans and my ovum were being used for this purpose. I need help from someone who knows how to stop them and/ protect oneself. I have a great deal of information on how to protect oneself but would like to have as many UFO researchers/ asrophysicists help and/or novice researchers help as possible. I have physical proof of my experience and have been completely MRI&#39;d and x-rayed as recommended by Dr Roger Leir&gt; An annomely was found on both &#34;pinkies&#34; it has not yet been removed. I believe there may be other implants metal and/or electromagnetic in nature. I was guven the information that they were moving me at the &#34;speed of light&#34; or in some way moving/vibrating my cells at a different speed/frequency than that of the Earth. 2 things are important here. They apparently arrive on Earth through &#34;wormholes&#34; some sort of manipulation of space/ molecular structure of space. There is information about this on the website, ET medical.com. Apparently this is also the way they are able to make themselves invisible to us. Also, my understanding is that they are able to perform surgery on us by again manipulating space/time and velocity. Again good information on this is in Adrian Dvirs book- see Et medical medical.com. After the MRIs I decided to head as far to magnetic North as I could to see what would happen. Agian I was given the information that this might disrupt the magnet, if there was one, in my body. As I approached North Bay/ Ontario on my way to Moosonee, Ontario, by train, I felt a thud and my  body seemed to increase in mass. Quite literally various parts of my body got bigger closer to the weight I had been prior to the experience. The information I have been given is that the electromagnetic energy they were using to move me at an increased velocity would not completely function in areas of &#34;rare earth&#34;. Apparently these rare earth minerals are minerals that do not exist on other planets. Many of them are radioactive. I have also been given the information that the secret to protecting the earth and/or myself lies in being able to control the electromagnetic energy they use to arrive here and in somehow using these rare earth minerals. Not completley sure how but again, the aliens were not able to move me at the speed of light in areas of apparent rare eart. I have been given the information that creating a controlled explosion and/ or using these rare earth minerals in that explosion would in some way disrupt their force field. It seems the entities were able to create some sort of energetic field arounf me at various times referred to as a parabola or an ellipsis. There are apparently several implants in body that I believe would be detected by an MRI and / or X-ray in these &#34;rare earth&#34; areas. I need help from an Astrophysicist and/ or someone who knows how to create a controlled explosion. Also, if anyone knows a way electromagnetic and/ or radiactive devices may be detectable, particularly in Toronto Canada. Also a physicist/ dr etc. this would be most helpful. I have various physical anomalies as a result of this experience. My colon is no longer in the same place as it was previously, and is no longer functioning in the same way that it had been prior to this experience. I have also been given the information that there is a spaceship above my place of work- Canada Trust Tower 161 Bay St and have seen an entity- grey about 31/2 feet tall, I did not see its face but believe it may be the commander of the mission. I have also seen entities that appear to be Zetas and Reptilians. I would welcome communication and or help from anyone<n>

Suddenly, out of nowhere a beautiful bright vanilla star about the same size and color Mars is at the moment appeared very close overhead in the north sky and started to smoothly descend towards me. It was a steady light, moving deliberately and did not seem to be a falling star or comet. There was no noise. The speed at which it decended is hard to describe as it was as if it was a controlled speed, not really fast or slow but very smooth and deliberate. It came in so close to the yard it was level with the high treetops. Although at first I was mesmerized by it&#39;s beauty, the closer it got to me, I became terrified, ran to the glassed in deck door, tore it open and backed in, never taking my eyes off it. I know this sounds crazy but it was as if the light could sense my fear and retreated backwards until it faded from view. It looked like a bright star with a hard, almost diamond-like  brilliant center surrounded by a softer glow of the same color. Also, at the risk of sounding absolutely bonkers, the reason why I got so frightened was, I felt like it would have come right down to me if I hadn&#39;t gotten out of the way. I went out later several times to see if it was still in the area, but I didn&#39;t see it again. I live in the country near Daniel Boone State Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As it’s been getting dark earlier, we decided to jog through our own neighborhood. At about 8:30pm we were heading west down Old College Way. I glanced up and saw a panel of lights almost directly overhead. It was moving slowly and silently from west to east. It seemed to be approximately 1000-2000 feet off the ground. There was no erratic movement at all. After a few seconds the lights dimmed out, almost as if they had sensed me watching. The sky was very clear and once the lights went out, I could not make out any dark silhouette. My wife had not looked up in time to witness anything, but suggested maybe I saw a shooting star. As we looked at the sky, a small private jet went overhead, heading almost due north. It was quite audible and its black silhouette was easily identifiable. It did not appear to be chasing or even aware of the lights. My wife repeated that it must have been a shooting star. However, the lights were very clearly defined. They were three horizontal rows of six lights each. The lights were perfectly round and almost looked light a panel of stadium lights floating in the sky. They were very 3-D looking. They appeared to be angled over the ground at about a 30 to 45 degree angle. There was a definite dark shadow behind the lights like a short, stubby cigar, though the lights themselves seemed to be flat on the same plane. My most immediate thought was that I was looking at the Goodyear Blimp, but the moment the lights dimmed out, the black shape vanished as well. From my experience at football games, I have been able to hear the blimp even over the crowd noise. Whatever this was, was dead silent. The image I have included is a rendering in Photoshop of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally lucid, objective, and credible.  We have invited his wife, who also saw the object briefly,  to submit a report, as well.  The witness was certain, he said, that the object was not any type of blimp.  PD))<n>

Up in the sky to the south was 13-14 bright trianglar shapes in the sky.  They were moving fast, taking turns almost into a dive.  I pulled into our driveway and watched for approx. 6-7 mins, and one by one they dived and disappeared.  The last one seemed to dive a couple of times before it disappeared.  What was strange is that the closeness and the speed of these objects.  There was no noise.  I am used to seeing airplanes and such go over our house, but these were not airplanes.  They were too close and too fast to be airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw an unblinking bright red light in the southwest sky which disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out to look for Mars during the dates it was closest to Earth. My sense of direction is bad, but I saw a VERY bright red light in the sky, about 45 degrees above the horizon. I had read that Mars is unlike a star in that it is a constant light,unblinking as stars do. Then I realized that I was looking in the southwest sky and that is not where Mars should be. I continued to look at the red light for at least 2-3 minutes when it blinked out. No movement, no diminishing, just gone. Seconds after that, a blinking light starting at the point the light disappeared and traveling in a straight line from south to north at a high altitude passed over. The light seemed to be red in the center with blue and white lights circling around the red center.I watched it until I couldn&#39;t see it any longer. I have since observed passing planes and satellites in the sky. This was definely different. I found this web site while looking for articles for a college class. When I saw a similar incident in Pennsylvania, I felt vindicated and made this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

A coworker and I were in a seventh floor conference room facing east when we observed a object in the sky that seemd to be a blinking light. We couldn&#39;t tell if the blinking was due to it possibly rotating and reflecting from the sun. The object was not moving in the sky then it moved quickly from west to east in the sky. It quickly changed directions and moved west to east. Then the object changed altitude vertically and then continued back on a west to east pattern.....It suddenly stopped and then quickly ascended into the atmosphere out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I thought no way could I have seen that but I knew I had. At this point I was a few steps from my truck where I keep a powerful spotlite &#34;living in the country it&#39;s a good tool to have as there are lot&#39;s of animals about at night&#34; I retreived my spotlite and aimed it at the exact location of what I saw for the hell of it and turned it on/off/on/off/on/off then opened my truck door and put the light away and as I stood there at the truck and shut the door I looked up and dam if it did not return and do the same thing exactly what I saw the first time and then it was gone into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sleeping the other night and was awakened at about 2am by what sounded like glass breaking outside. I went outside for a moment and looked around but saw and heard nothing from my second story deck. Since I live in a second story pent house like appartment I wasn&#39;t overly concerned about it. It was quiet and calm with nothing going on. When I went into the kitchen to have a glass of water I saw a very bright flash of light through my dinning room windows that were covered by curtains completly. The bright light flashed for one second perhaps two at the most. Since the windows are very large and tall I opened the curtains immediatly and expected to hear a clasp of thunder within seconds, the weather at that moment was steady light drizzle and no wind at all. I STOOD THERE WAITING FOR THE THUNDER BUT IT NEVER CAME. I then noticed that the bright light had knocked out all the street lights for a two block radius. After about 30 seconds the lights slowly turned back on like they do at sundown. I was so intriged by the event that I made some coffee and stayed up for 3 more hours watching from my vantage point over the city streets and waiting for the light to happen again or a laser or some kind of power ark in the power lines but nothing moved or happened. It occured to me that my neighbor about a week ago said that he saw the entire sky turn into day for a split second at about 12:30 at night, but I just said wow that&#39;s interesting and forgot about it until now. I&#39;ve had a lot of scientific training and I can&#39;t think of what the light could have been. I&#39;m just stumped on even a hypothosis on this one. The other thing I wanted to say is that I too have seen on many occasions star-like lights that make turns at super high altitudes or blink on and off in completely clear night skies. I can imagine a rotating metalic cylindrical satelyte that reflects light from one side because it is painted black on the other, so it would appear to be blinking as it moved accross t! he sky as it rotated. I can&#39;t explain in any rational way the star like objects that I see that turn and then faid out while still very high in the sky nowhere near the horizon. There is definately something going on up there. It sure is good to have a site like this available to us where we can compare notes!<n>

Maybe you have heard this before!! I was on my way to work(I&#39;m a police officer), traveling on a major freeway(I-30 just west of Ft Worth, TX), when I spotted this red light. It was almost like a helicopter or plane light, but it never &#34;blinked&#34;. It was a solid red light for about 2 or 3 minutes. It was flying at an angle as if it was &#34;taking off&#34;. I feel it was flying too slow to be an airplane. It continued flying at this angle for a minute or two, slowly, then all of the sudden it took a dive!! The solid red light just fell from the sky. I kept watching to see if it had been a plane crash or something, but nothing ever happened. I never heard of anything on the news, and have never seen anything like this again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should also tell you that this was just south of an Air Force Base.

It would move almost out of site and then rapidly zoom over ft. drum. What looked like several fighter planes attempted to follow it and more bright orange fireballs appeared behind the UFO. We could here jets going to afterburners and the object would zoom away again only to return after several seconds to be fired upon again. Truly amazing!

The object was stationary and never moved for close to an hour.  We scanned the sky and noticed at least four other such objects, also rapidly changing colors.  These were moving across the sky and changing directions several times.  At one point, two of the moving objects approached the third stationary obejct in a approximate triangle formation and then veered off again.  We are both white-collar professionals.  We don&#39;t buy into the whole UFO-thing easily, ut we do not have a rationale explanation for what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a twinkling star would be the first possibility to be ruled out.

We went inside to turn off the outside light. When we came back out it was still gone. Around 10 seconds later, it reappeared. It stood in the same area for about a minute. It then zig-zagged very fast and disappeared. We have not seen it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Four witnesses<n> <n><n> <n><n> At aprox. 20:15 hours I had stepped out onto my front porch to smoke and was looking at the stars and the milkyway when I noticed a light (what I thought was a star) start moving down through the big dipper. I watched the light for about 2 to 3 min. moving at a very fast speed then it appeared to disappear. I stepped back into the house and got my son whom is 15 to come outside. He watched with me and then we both saw the light again moving just above the big dipper area. Again the light seemed to fade away. We continued watching and it again appeared but this time moving across the sky in the same general area but from a right to left pattern. My wife had stepped out about this time and saw it just befor it faded away. We then spotted it moving through the clustered stars of the milkyway again in in a right to left pattern then aburptly making what appeared to be a sharp fast U turn then travel back to the right. The light was constantly moving rapid then dissipearing. My daughter whom is 14 came outside and asked what we were looking at and my wife was telling her when the light reappeared moving left to right then in a downward motion. We watched the light for about an hour constantly fading away then returning but always in the area of the big dipper and milky way. My house faces a easterly direction. I have seen many aircraft but none at this altitude at night that you could see any light on them at that distance nor any that could move as fast or change directions as this light did. There was no sound but at that distance you could not had heard it if there was. There may have only been one but it appeared that there could have been at least three with the appearing and disappearing in a totaly diffrent place.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I looked up at the side of the house, I noticed a round object moving across the sky at a high rate of speed.  I looked up to watch the sphere, which was a silver/gray color. At first I thought it was perhaps a balloon.  It moved so quickly overhead that I had to turn around to try to follow it. When I turned around, I lost sight of the object and was not able to locate it again.  There was no sound.  The sky was clear, with no clouds.  I still thought that it might be some kind of a balloon, but I checked the directions and discovered that the object had traveled from east to west.  I have never seen anything like this before personally, but it appeared to be the same type of object I once saw on TV which had appeared over Mexico City.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was well away from any natural obstruction, and the only nearby obstructions near myself was 1 small tree and a large dead one. The object moved off to the northwest at a leasurly pace. As it neared the area where it would be obscured by the smaller tree, I moved further down my driveway, breaking eye contact with the object for aproxx. 4 seconds. When I attempted to ovserve the Object again, I noticed that it had seemed to have vanished.Going back to my first vantage point and another, I still could not locate the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It must have been close to midnight, and the sky was completely  clear and all the stars were blazing bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked down and stood on the beach for a while looking up and watch everything. A few shooting stars had gone over head and so we were really watching closely for anything .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had looked over to the ridge of hills on the far left side of the lake and I thought there was a radio tower with a flahing light on top of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out and then we realized that the light was far too high above the ridge to be a tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light wasn&#39;t moving and there was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flashing white, red and green all lights were visable at all times, but the colours pulsed, but did not move or get smaller or larger..<n> <n><n> <n><n> We actually stood looking at it for a few minutes trying to figure out what it could be. And then to the right of the lake the full moon had come out from behind a small cloud, we all moved further down the beach to look over at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 mins later when we were about to leave the beach and go back to our camp, I looked back over to the ridge and the lights were gone completely. There wasn&#39;t time enough for it to fly away, if it was an airplane, we still would have seen it. The sky was so clear that any direction it would have gone we would have been able to track it,,, but the sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/15/03 00:00|Columbus|OH|Other|5 to 10 minutes|Large black cube shaped UFO spotted; Columbus,  OH.  Time seemed to stop!|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63700.html|255|ndxe200309| Large black cube shaped UFO spotted; Columbus,  Ohio    - Time seemed to stop!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I experienced this with my girl friend at the time, but while she admits to me that this happened it seems that this experience really freaked her out. She asked that I not include her in the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got home from work, stepped out of my car in the driveway when I heard a resonating vibration sound that seemed to drown out everything else.  I looked due East across the street and about fifty to one hundred feet above the houses was a large black cube sitting in the air.  The craft did not seem to have any lights and it did not move suddenly.   All I could do was stare; I thought of taking a picture and the camera was just inside the house, but I couldn’t move. It seemed as if time stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cube was approximately the size of two homes in my neighborhood which would be about 3000sqft total; the outer texture like a borg cube on Star Trek.  The cube began to move slowly toward the south directly above the houses and I started to see a very light gray puff of smoke coming from what had become apparent to me was the rear of the craft. There were three light gray exhaust-like openings where the smoke was coming from, but the smoke very quickly dissipated as the craft moved south. I watched until the craft was too small on the horizon to see any longer; it was weird how no one seemed to be around except the person traveling with me that day until I could no longer hear the resonating vibration sound. Then when the cube was too far to distinguish, cars began passing by like normal and I saw neighbors coming and going; it was as if someone had their fingers in my ears and quickly removed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I talked about the experience with the person traveling with me that day and their account was exactly what I had experienced. This happened about four to five years ago and I am still getting goose bumps and every hair on my body is standing up while I type this. I had never had anything like this happen before and have not since although I mentally prepare for the next encounter, hoping I can get a picture or video of this cube.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background: I was 25 years old at the time of this experience.  I am a non-denominational Christian and for the majority of my life never believed anything like this would ever happen to me. I figured most UFO sightings were either drug induced or exaggerations. I have held a full time job all my adult life, enjoy my work and am for the most part a happy person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

My report after talking to her is below also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi there,  A week before the first article came out in the Airdrie Echo newspaper about sightings, I came home from work about 11:20 pm, and I let the dogs out side and I was also watching a few northern lights off my deck , I live on the east side of  Airdrie, the (deleted by HBCC UFO) are right behind my house. So we have a hill behind my place with a walk way on that goes towards the highway, and I looked over to my left toward the west, and I know what I saw, and it was big circle of lights twirling around and hovering on the walk way and then it just went down, not up. I grabbed my dogs and headed into the house. The next week, I read the article in the paper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Report after talking with the witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing the witness said was, &#34;I know what I saw&#34; and it was really bizarre. The lady let the dogs out onto the deck of her home and then followed them out, stood there and looked to her left and just above a walk way she spotted the lights hovering. The walk way runs a good distance and eventually runs across the highway. The witness said it could not have been children twirling lights as for one thing the circle of lights was very large in size, plus she could not see anyone in the area. She also compared the size to a 10 or 12 foot old C-Band satellite dish. She explained that it looked to her as if it was a ring shaped object with a lot of white lights running all around the outside of it. She also said it appeared that there was not just one set of lights, but layers of them. As she stood and watched this strange display of lights, they started to move down over the hill which would have crossed over Highway #2 until she finally lost sight of the lights. She mentioned that it was approx: a half block away from her location and very bright. Also the lights were moving quickly, but there was no distortion, or the lights appearing to be one long string. She was able to view the individual lights and she told me there was many of them. No sound was heard and the dogs did not react in anyway to the strange lights. The witness said she wasn&#39;t frightened at what she saw, but her senses told her it was time to head back into her home. It was visible for approx: 30 seconds before it vanished. I asked if she was able to see anything in the center of the object, she said no, just a ring of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n>

9/15/03 22:15|Denver|CO|Formation|appox 2 sec|The formation can best be described as being in the shape of a "snake"|10/7/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31998.html|260|ndxe200309| I went out on my deck at appox 22:15 when looking North (at appox 80 degrees) I noticed 9 amber (pastel orange) colored lights (I call them lights because I could not see any 3-D dimension or structure to them) moving moderately fast from East to West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.  The sky was &#34;partly cloudy&#34; with cumulus clouds and I could see stars between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  The formation can best be described as being in the shape of a &#34;snake&#34; or somewhat like the &#34;number 3&#34; with each of the 9 lights appearing to be equal distant from each other from head to tail.  The lead light, or head of the &#34;snake,&#34; was the farthest North and West light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  The lights did not oscilate or change color but remained a constant through out the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.  There was no deviation in the spacing or speed of each light as they moved in formation from East to West.  They remained constant to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.  There was no silhouette suggesting a physical presence, in front of or behind the lights.  They appeared to be separate entities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6.  Holding my arm at length, the size of the formation could be best calculated as between 1 and 1 1/2 inches from head to tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7.  The formation came from the East over a large tree, in my yard, that obstructed my view of seeing them further from the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8.  My first view of the formation could be best described as at approximately 80 degrees above the horizon and at 1 o&#39;clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9.  Total view time was approx 1 1/2 to 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10.  My last view of the formation, before they disappeared above or into a cumulus cloud, could be best described as at approximately 80 degrees above the horizon and at 11 o&#39;clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11. There were no sounds either before or after they passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12. I was expecting the lights to come out of West side of the cloud at approximately 10 o&#39;clock where I could see star light. The lights did not come out of the cloud. Nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 13. After the sighting I stood on the deck, in awe, for approxmately 10 minutes observing the sky and waiting for the lights to either come out of the cumulus cloud or for any sound that would help me verify what I had just seen.  Nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 14. While my house is in the flight path of Jefferson County Airport and in close proximity of DIA (Denver International Airport) I am well aware of the aircraft lights and sounds.  These lights did not fit the criteria of any known aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: Buckley Air Force Base is East of Denver and it is unusual for F16&#39;s to fly over North Denver Metro but, in the last month, there have been several fly overs going from SE to NW at low altitude and at speeds faster than commercial or priviate planes which I can only describe as unusual or concidental.  They normally fly East, South or South East of Denver.  Yesterday (Oct 1, 2003) two F16&#39;s broke the sound barrier over North Denver which made the local news and, according to the local newspaper, is under investigation by the military.  A spokeswoman for the Colorado Guard said that two F16&#39;s &#34;... were flying what we are calling an irregular flight patrol in support of NORAD.&#34; (RMN - Oct 2, 2003 - Page 22A). Concidental?<n>
9/15/03 22:00|Lake Charles|LA|Disk|10 seconds|Disc seen with circular whiteish outter edge|9/1/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38949.html|261|ndxe200309| Disc seen with circular whiteish outter edge<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time I have submitted this report as I dont see it listed perhaps it did not go thru. In Septemebr of 2003 I was setting up my telescope to view Mars and noticed out of the corner of my eye something moving above the trees. I quickly turned and saw a craft, not a plane, bird, satellite, helicopter, or ballon. It was no more than 300 feet above me (a large 70 foot live oak tree is in my backyard that I used for reference) It was dark in color with a whitish canopy.  The craft was  2 or 3 times the trees height, and estimated to be about 75 feet across moving about 30-40 mph.  It flew above the tree and along the dividing line that separates my backyard and my neighbors backyard (my neighbors backyard abuts my backyard). The craft made no noise, had no lights, nor wings. Most decernible was a black circular bottom with a white circle on the outter edge of the botton disc, it reminded me of a &#34;white wall tire&#39; as it flew quitley from north to south on a straight trajectory.  Oddly enough there is a high voltage station and accompanying high voltage lines down from me on my street and hight voltage lines along the street behind me, the craft seen traveling along the backyards seemed to be driving right between the two streets where the lines are located perhaps &#34;absorbing the energgy field?..Is this craft some type of new military technology? If its alien why not tell us it is alien?....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/15/03 21:42|Mount Gilead|NC|Unknown|12 minutes|Craft with light too low and too quiet for a plane and too often to ignore anymore.|9/17/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31504.html|264|ndxe200309| Craft with light too low and too quiet for a plane and too often to ignore anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the third time our family has seen UFO type objects in the 9:00 p.m. hour in our area.  We live down a dead end road in the hills in between Charlotte &amp; Greensboro.  If it wasn&#39;t for our yard light, it would be totally black except for the stars and moon.  We see planes in their normal flight patterns fairly high above us every evening, but these sightings are definitely different.  The first sighting was at 9:15 p.m. EST on a Monday, Memorial Day, May 26, 2003, when he walked out to give our dogs some leftovers.  He saw a very large rectangular object hovering at tree level in the east about 1/4 mile away.  It made a strange and scary noise and he hightailed it back to the house.  It just disappeared after a couple of minutes.  The second sighting was the same.  The last sighting last night was odd and unnerving.  We were watching the Monday night game with the front door open, which faces south.  I was bored with the game and glanced out the door and a light caught my eye as it appeared to be below tree level on this side of the mountain behind it heading towards our front door.  I asked my husband what that light could be.  He looked and we couldn&#39;t believe what we were seeing.  We called to our 15 year old son and we all went out on the deck to see what it could be.  It was a square type object full of light moving slowly towards us below tree level.  Since we had seen other strange things out here, I ran and grabbed my camcorder.  With the yard light to my left and rear, I was first unable to find the object, so I moved to a dark portion of our deck and picked up the object.  It moved towards us and then turned east and was out of sight very quickly.  There was no sound and should have been as it was within 2000 yards of us.  After it disappeared, we saw a regular plane coming out of the east towards the west and heard it&#39;s sound.  My husband and son went back inside the house and I stayed out to see if it would come back.  Within 1-2 minutes, I saw lights coming towards me ! again through the trees from the south to the north and then it turned towards the east and went out of sight.  It didn&#39;t seem to be the same type craft as the first time but it could have been.  It happened 5 times ending at 9:50 p.m.  Since my camcorder ran out of battery, I grabbed my binoculars and caught the light on the fifth time.  I noticed that this time it looked like a triangle shape with 2 lights on each wing and 2 in the front center with a red light on top as it banked out to the east in a clearing of the trees.  I worked for Northrop Grumman in the past and it could have been a B2 or something.  It had that shape but it seemed different from the craft we all saw.  Maybe there is some testing or training going on here but the crafts were all silent this time. I am reporting it this time in hopes of finding out what it could have been.  We&#39;ve only been here for a year, we are originally from Virginia Beach.  Any ideas out there?  The camcorder shows the lights have a square look and haze to them probably because of reflection but comes into view like something else.

This &#39;Star&#39; was very bright, as bright as Mars is at the present time, which is what attracted me to it. I thought that this &#39;Star&#39; was Mars but I knew that mars was more to the SE, as I found on a quick look in that direction. The &#39;Star was also a bright Blue-White color. As I watched, the luminocity of this &#39;Star&#39; doubled and then tripled, all in the space of less than a second. after that it seemed to fade inward, with the center of it being the last to disappear. All of this happened in the space of 1 to 4 seconds. It looked like an explosion at an extremely high altitude. I heard no report or concussion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have checked the &lt;www.heavens-above.com&gt; website, and no Iridium satellite was visible from Omaha, NE, for the time and date indicated.

9/15/03 21:00|Abingdon|VA|Circle|30 minutes|a large, perfectly round light, much larger and brighter than any star|10/7/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32087.html|267|ndxe200309| a large, perfectly round light, much larger and brighter than any star<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside at 9 pm to make a call on my cell phone. I looked up and saw a huge golden , yellow light in the sky. At first I thought it to be a star, but then realized that it was too large for a star and that it was perfectly round. There was a &#34;haze&#34; surrounding it, like heat?? I went inside and got my digital camera, came back outside and took the first picture, The second I took the picture the light vanished. I took another picture in the same location then stood watching. A couple, maybe two , minutes later the light reappeared, it kind of grew in brightness till it was as bright as before. I took more pictures then I became very scared, terrified actually. I watched this for almost 30 minutes then i heard strange noises from inside the house. I was at my brothers home and he has 2 small iguanas in a tank. The iguanas were going&#34;crazy&#34;, running around the cage and one climbed a cord inside the cage, laced one claw through the mesh on top and put his other claw on his stomach, his head was cocked as if waiting or watching for something...maybe even listening. I was even more scared at this point and very aware of everything around me, like all of my senses were very heightened. I just wanted to be inside with all of the curtains closed. I felt like an animal that is being hunted. When I arrived back home I downloaded the pictures and I was amazed. There was not just one object but nine. The other eight I could not see with my eyes but they are on the pictures. And the picture that I took after the light dissapeared shows that the object is still there in outline. You can see very intricate patterns on all of the objects and all of then are identical.The one that was lit is larger than the others and it never moved but the smaller ones seem to change position from picture to picture. I have already spoken with a MUFON investigator and have agreed to send the pictures that I have taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have not received copies of the photos, yet.  PD))<n>

We saw one round light splint into two then disappear. The a few minutes later two round lights appeared for about 10 seconds at 12::00 high and then disappeared. The whole time this was going on we notices a light of to our right that appeared to be a very bright star. The light stayed in one place for 30 minutes which was out over the ocean also. I then got my video camera on it and started taping. Shortly after the object started to move. The camera was set on manual for focusing because the auto focus would not lock on to it. The picture does go out of focus at times. I&#39;m not 100% sure it was not a helicopter, BUT it was very strange. I uploaded the viedo to my server it&#39;s at www.movinontv.com/ufo.AVI<n>

Again, I was in the front yard playing my guitar when my dog barked to the west.  There was no moon and the stars were shining brilliantly.  In the same location as before, approximately 3 miles west of I-10 and some 3-5000 feet high, were 4 orange orbs, hovering.  They would occassionally disappear and reappear in the same location.  This went on for about 10 minutes when the one on the far left (south) reappeared even further south.  The second one from the north did not reappear.  Eventually, and I&#39;m not sure when, the one on the far south could no longer be seen.  I am not sure if it is due to obstruction or if it had disappeared.  I did get some pictures which are not developed yet, I will at my earliest convenience.  However, I was using an SLR and the film that was loaded.  At 400 and without a tripod at night, I can&#39;t imagine the photos turning out, but we&#39;ll see.  Anyway... I watched the two orange orbs for around 20 minutes while I took pictures.  At one point, it appeared as if there was a string of lights beneath the one remaining to the north.  The string appeared to be in parallel with my angle of view as they were extremely close together and slightly at an angle going from upper-right to lower-left.  I am guessing there were 4 or 5 in the string.  As in my previous post, they seemed to disappear when known man-made aircraft entered their airspace.  But when the aircraft left, they would reappear.  I ran out of film and turned my back on the lights to get my other camera, when I emerged the string was gone.  The single orb to the north was now very low on the horizon, lower than the mountains to the west so I know for sure they are closer.  I managed a few more photos using my truck as a resting point for the camera.  I also forgot to mention that at one point two of the orbs were very close together.  I&#39;m still a little excited by this, but hopefully my pictures will help me piece the order! of things together.  Unfortunately I have no other witnesses to corroborate my story.  Suffice it to say, they were exactly the same in shape, size, brightness, and activity as the orbs of my previous post.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sorry that I do not have images right now, I am actually hoping that others have seen the same and can confirm what I have seen as either man-made or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First I saw what I tried to tell myself was either a small airplane or fireworks.  Multi-colored lights twinkled overhead for just 4-5 seconds and disappeared.  I told myself, there must be a haze in the sky that caused it to disappear, but then observed the sky and noticed there wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky and stars shining brightly.  I blew off the multi-colored twinkling lights as possible small airplane or fireworks.  I traveled approx. 3 miles, turned to go south-east and suddenly an orange, brillant, glassy, shimmering light appears above the treetops looking south.  I saw it actually develope, like from nothing grew to the size it was.  Looking through the windshield, the perfect circle was about the size of a silver dollar that appeared to be approx. 3 miles away from me at about a 50 degree angle.  Suddenly the orange circle divided into two, like you see a cell divide under a microscope.  The two orange circles stay motionless for a few seconds, then suddenly appeared to drop towards each other, diminish and disappear. I witnessed this event for approx. 8-10 seconds.  There were two vehicles behind me an one honked their horn after the lights divided.  There was no beam of light, aura or haze, trail, or sound, just perfect orange circle of lights, that I tend to describe like the color of a burning cigarette, hot coals from a fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Me and my little sister looked up to the sky, when we did, the craft began to move slowly.  We just stood there with our mouths open wide.  Then all of a sudden, the craft was gone!  We didn&#39;t see any explosion, or anything.  Ever since then, if I am to go out in the dark, I always look up to find only stars.  But, no one can ever covence me there are no others but God watching us.

I had just got loaded with hay in Tacna and ingressed onto the freeway ( INTERSTATE 8 ) and instantaneously i noticed bright balls of bright pumpkin orange-colored balls of light over in the southeast part of the sky. They were maybe 10-30 degrees above the horizon and almost always under the planet MARS !!  These ships put on a spectacular light show for me. They would dim out then light up very brightly then dim out and continue doing this. I witnessed this MAJOR SIGHTING for 1 hour and 25-minutes for a span of approx. 45-miles !!!!  The most spectacular light show occurred at EXIT 78 (AZTEC EXIT ) .  I contacted Highway Patrol(TUCSON) and I was informed that multiple reports of these UFOs were being called in.. H.P. called Luke Air Force Base and was informed that the military was out in that area conducting training exercises but always remember how much we can trust the AIR FORCE, right ??  When i stopped my rig at the AZTEC exit 4 of these craft were EXTREMELY close to me and absolutely NO SOUND emanated from them and they all dimmed out in sequence. At the time I was witnessing most of this event, I was on my cell phone with a famous UFO researcher up in Wisconsin and based upon what I was telling him, he said I was seeing the real thing ( authentic Extraterrestrial craft ).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Several other reports of yellow, or orange, lights seen in Arizona.  The AZ Highway Patrol units in Yuma and Tucson have reported that their facilities had contacted the U. S. Air Force, and that they had been told that military units had been conducting exercises.  Whether the observed lights were over military facilities, or not, we do not know, but we doubt that the military would be launching pyrotechnic devices over dry desert terrain.  PD))<n>
9/15/03 18:00|Morris Plains|NJ|Formation|25-40 minutes|Four sets of four circular, white globes, in "infinity"|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61784.html|274|ndxe200309| Four sets of four circular, white globes, in &#34;infinity&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting to THIS site, years after the fact, as I had not priorly known of this particular reporting area although I have left reports on other UFO sites. It left such and impression on me, that I feel the need to get the sighting to as many folks as possible who are interested and believe there are UFOs here.  I was just watching a show on the PHOENIX SIGHTINGS, and thought I SHOULD report my sighting here (as suggested on the show and that some folks do wait months to send in sightings).<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a warm evening about 3-4 years ago, I had just put the kids to bed, and had gone to let the dog out in the yard. The sky was partly cloudy, but not completely overcast. One could see the shapes of clouds against the suburban lit night and in some directions, stars were showing through.  I looked above our house, and I could not believe my eyes, yet, it was all there as plain as day, as if it were milk, in the glass cases at the local mart. I had always expected that if I was going to see strange lights in the sky, it would be out in the wilderness, as we spend lots of time in the Adirondacks, and, I had formerly lived in the Catskills (and we have seen our share of shooting stars, etc.)  however, seeing this set of lights in suburban North Jersey, was just amazing, and clearly, very different from anything that I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formations were of 4 SETS of four lights stretching from the east (Parsipanny area) to the west (Mendham/Randolph/Shongum Mt. area). They could have been covering 7-10 miles in total. They were about plane’s altitude above the house. One set was right above my neighborhood (The Fairchild neighborhood), one set was further east perhaps Cedar Knolls/Parsipanny),  two other sets were further west, towards Randolph/Washington Valley area.  Within in each IDENTICAL set of lights were four smaller, white,  round, globes which moved in a rapid clover leaf like/”infinity” pattern - never touching each other, and always staying in the same circumference. There was not a sound coming from these formations.  All four sets had these four lights moving in the same “infinity” pattern, but not in complete timed unison with each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in the house to get my husband and the phone. I got a flashlight to “try and signal back”.  We did not have a digital camera, or a video camera at the time, nor a phone camera, or, I would have grabbed one of those items.  My son who was about 3-3 1/2 at the time was peering at them from his window.  My neighbor, a fireman,  came out via my husband’s beckoning, and they were standing on his stoop in awe.   We live near to Newark and Morris County airports, but these were most definitely not planes, as we are in the flight patterns of many large and small planes, and helicopters we are frequented by the sights and sounds of planes constantly. These sets of lights did not move. These were also not the “attention floods” used for celebrations or grand openings of businesses. There WAS NO BEAM of light coming up from the ground, nor coming down, or forward as search lights in helicopters, or a plane’s path lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each set stayed in the same spot for about 20-40 minutes.  I can not remember exactly, however it was long enough for me to call the police, call my Mom, and call one of my good friends.  When I called the police, they did say that other people had reported seeing the strange lights in the sky. I had inquired about any noted celebrations where folks might have had “attention floods” beaming up, but none could be noted. I have also seen the “flash lights” that the local Morris County Airport shooting up on cloudy nights near Rt. 24, but these would never have been visible in my neighborhood, and not in four distinct sets over such a large area of geography.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out to walk around the neighborhood to see if I could get a better view, but at this point, the clouds were clearing, and then lights were gone but, I did not get to see how they dispersed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was dark enough I could see a slight reflection from my dashboard console but still light enough my headlights were ineffectual.  I was about 15 to 20 minutes outside of Socorro, NM on southbound I-25 which is essentially in the middle of the desert.  I suddenly noticed something in the air off to my upper left.  It was close enough I could see the outlines of windows.  It was shaped like a rectangle with rounded corners and I saw no wings, props, etc.  It was proportioned like a candy bar.  It looked like it may have been indented around the middle, but I was unable to really focus on it as I was travelling at 80 mph.  The windows were rounded squares and the light coming out looked to be from an incandescent source (i.e. - it looked like the light that comes from residential homes&#39; windows after dark.   slightly warm-looking or yellowish).  When I saw it, I realised I was able to see the windows clearly, but I could not hear it, nor did I hear it approach.  It seemed to be on a slighlty disconverging path with the interstate, travelling in a south east direction.  I kept glancing back to the road to make sure I wasn&#39;t going to hit anyone, but that stretch of highway is pretty deserted, so I was able to look at it several more times as it slowly pulled ahead and farther to my left.   There are several small road cuts which blocked my view of it&#39;s location in the sky for a few seconds (somewhere between 5-10) and when I could see that portion again, it was gone.   Absolutely gone.  For the rest of the drive, I kept an eye to it&#39;s presumed trajectory in the sky.  Suddenly I saw it again MILES from where it had been.  When I relocated it, it was a tiny speck, but I&#39;m sure that was it.  It was in empty sky space (no towns, airplanes, etc.) and then it was gone again.  I&#39;m not sure if it flew out of my line of sight, if I just couldn&#39;t see the lights anymore or if it just disappeared like it did behind the road cut.  I do know it was flying in the direction of White Sands.  A bit about me:  I&#39;m a graphic designer and I am going back to school to get my geology degree, I have no history of hallucinations,  my husband is an engineer.  Every day for 18 months my commute to and from work took me directly under the flight path into and out of Kirtland Airforce Base, so I am famliliar with what jets that can move that fast sound like and look like in flight, in both day, night and dusk conditions.  One more thing I know, for 18 months, I cannot recall seeing aircraft flying the same flight path except for about a week or so after I saw &#34;it&#34;.   My final thought:  I don&#39;t know if what I saw was alien or not, but it did seem to stay close to the road longer than it need to, almost as if it wanted me to see it and get a pretty good look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

The bright shiny object is what I saw as I came into Valliant OK (Valiant is about 20-25 miles from Hugo.). It was almost, if not still. I spotted it just as I made the city limits. I tried to find a place to park where I could see the object and at the same time fumbled with my Mavica. I parked on the north side of Hwy 70, by the bank. As the camera booted up the object started to fade. It faded out of sight over about 30 seconds. I thought it might have been an airplane, but I could not see anything after it faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I try to figure the angle that I was looking at, the best way for me to tell you is that if 9:00 is straight forward and 12:00 it straight up then the object was at about 10:30. That would be about 50 or so degrees would it not? Then over about 12 or 15 degrees to the north, just over the top of the first building going down the business district. I have no way to judge the distance, or height, but it was about a .25 inch at arms length, and very, very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this is not much of a sighting, but after I read the story about the Hugo sighting the next day, I thought I should drop you a line. You be the judge.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got up ito my deer stand which was in a woody, hilly area and noticed a star looking figure that was moving around in a busy movement. I just didn&#39;t what the heck it was, so I looked up at it with my high powered scope and it basicly looked like a star. Later, another star light popped up and then the two went slowly away from me and dissapeared just as the light day was starting to appear. I told my dad this later in the day and he thought that it was wierd. I know this for sure, for those last two weeks of hunting I watched the skies and saw many more sightings of the same kind, and I have been a little scared since the incidents. I would really like to know what these occurences are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was watching, what I thought was the planet Mars, as it was the brightest light in the sky to the left of the road. I was wondering where the moon was in relation to it, as I had recently observed them together and this made me start to wonder if this was Mars?  As I was watching this &#39;light&#39; a large object, either a disk at an angle, or a cigar shape, appeared out of nowhere just below the light. It was bright blue and as quickly as it appeared, blew up? shooting out a blue light toward the ground.  There appeared to be dust or particles left in the area it had just occupied?  All this happened in a very short period of time- almost instantly and startled me so badly, I pulled off on the shoulder of the road to regain my composure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still kept looking at the light which now appeared to be pulsing and of different colors. I took out my digital camera and filmed the pulsing light for a few seconds. I took some stills that later showed orbs in the vicinity also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Vehicles on the other side of the road were stopped also, but continued on before I had a chance to ask them if they saw what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On the drivers side of the road there were two cars and two freight liners which had pulled over. Also in her rear view mirror she could see two other cars doing the same.... and a couple more which were heading north bound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness was traveling on Highway #2 going south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the lady first saw the object her thoughts were that it was an aircraft departing from an airport, but soon realized that in this area there was no airport. Actually the lady said the sighting would have been witnessed exactly 15 kilometers from the small town of Crossfield. and the object would have been traveling to the southwest. She thought it was odd that the object was departing at such a strange degree, keeping in mind that her first thoughts were of an aircraft. The object, when traveling up into the sky, made a sharp climb and once it arrived at a high altitude it came to a complete stop. It then shot across the sky towards the northwest and stopped again. At this point the lady pulled over to watch it. She said there was only one light on the craft which she described as being very lustrous as if one would look at a diamond. Also extremely bright ! As she and many others watched, the object moved side to side keeping at the same altitude and then it started to flash. The lady said if she had to put a shape to the object, it would have looked like a diamond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She rolled down her window as she watched. She wanted to hear if there was any sound coming from it. The lady also had turned her vehicle off, but no sound could be heard. The witness went on to say, there was not a sound in the area at all. Not knowing the exact height the object was sitting at, she said the size of it would have been larger than a tennis ball.  She was travelling alone and became quite frightened so decided to continue on her way. She left the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness did contact the RCMP to see if others had made a report about the sighting but no one had come forwarded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have already contacted the Airdrie Echo newspaper in search of any information they might have received. I also will be making some calls and requesting information and help in trying to find out what this object may have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

My girlfriend and her friend were inside the van. I have seen on four seperate occations U.F.O&#39;s, but never had I had a wittness. I thoght I was going crazy. This was different. I looked up seen what looked likr it could have been a Plane. After a few seconds I could tell it was different, It was about 45 degrees above the horizon line. It moved from SW to NW. I told the girls to come and take a look. We all seen the light. It was not bliking and it was bright. It zig zaged, or quivered or something. Then it stopped for about a second. Then, at a very high rate of speed, it shot out into space. ust before it was out of sight it stopped again. It stayed there and started to blink red, blue, and I think white. It sat there for 20 mins. WE RAN DOWN THE STREET TO GET A BETTER VIEW. After a while we wondered what we shold do. Then we did noting and went to bed. It&#39;s funny when you see something so amazing your brain can&#39;t get around it. The next day we talked about it, but daylight somehow made our story seem foolish. I know we seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wobbling bright &#34;twinkling star&#34; exhibits white/yellowish light along with bluish and red randomly flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Riding in the passenger seat of a car East on Hwy 40 toward Vernal, UT, I watched what I thought to be a very bright star or planet in the low Eastern/Southeastern sky to the right of a 3/4 orange moon.  As the moon rose in the sky and turned to white, the bright star remained in approximately the same position in the sky.  I observed the light intermittently as I gazed at other objects (stars, Mars, the moon, planes).  After approximately 10 minutes of this stargazing I began to think the light was twinkling quite a bit and uncharacteristic of any star or planet I&#39;d ever seen.  I was not aware the driver had also noted the odd characteristics of the light until he asked aloud, &#34;Is it just me or is that star flickering a lot?&#34;  We both began to watch it in earnest at that point.  We watched the flickering until we lost sight of it as we entered the hills, but not before deciding the white/yellowish light just might be intermingled with intermittent red flashes as well.  We anticipated picking up the sight again once we cleared the hills some 5-10 minutes later, but were surprised to find it was not to the right of the moon where we&#39;d &#34;left it&#34;.  We continued our drive into Vernal scanning the sky for the same light, possibly tracking across the sky at this point.  Instead we spotted an identical light in the low Northern/Northeastern sky.  We watched from outside the car for a few minutes noting now this light had definite flashes of red.  The other witness got the binocculars and through these I saw definite bluish light as well.  It was also apparent this light was not completely stationary.  It didn&#39;t track across the sky, but seemed to &#34;wobble&#34; in place.  After some time it became apparent it also moved from side to side at times, but maintained the same general visual position in the sky.  During this time, another identical but brighter light was spotted in the low Western sky.  Through the binocculars the red light on this object almost seemed to be circling around an object and t! he bluish light was even more visible.  This object behaved in the same way, not stationary, but not tracking or moving rapidly.  It disappeared below the horizon at about 23:00, but the light in the Northern sky remained in relatively the same position until we tired of watching it at about 23:30.  The following night of 9/15/03 as stars were beginning to appear, we located the light in the low Northern sky easily just as before exhibiting the same colors.  The light in the Western sky was not as low as the night before, but it was also earlier in the evening.  Unlike the previous night, however, the Western light blinked out numerous times for a few seconds while we watched.  We left these 2 lights in these positions to investigate the posibility of them being satelites as a family member stated he&#39;d heard of &#34;red white and blue satelite(s)&#34;.  We can not find any information or mention of these on the internet.  The only &#34;red, white and blue&#34; accounts were on this website, the most parallel account also occuring in Utah a couple of weeks ago some 3 hours drive time from here.  The account in the Wasatch Mountains above Salt Lake City dated 8/23-8/28/03 is precisely what we saw in color and behavior and location, except we did not see them moving rapidly enough in one direction to say the lights moved out of sight or below the horizon as opposed to the Earth rotating and causing the position change.  I could only surmise the light moved and disappeared below the horizon because the other stars in visual proximaty did not move out of sight during the same time frame.  However, I&#39;m unsure what effect altitude or distance from the Earth might have on an object&#39;s position in the sky and movement through the sky from horizon to horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know nothing of satelite characteristics except for the common white light tracking fairly quickly across the sky.  (We also noted 2 of these moving across the sky the night of 9/14,in close visual proximaty to the Western light.) Are these colored, wobbly flickering lights possibly satelites as has been suggested to me?  If so, could you elaborate on the cause of the patriotic colors and odd wobbly movement?  Please do not contact me except to answer the questions I&#39;ve posed or to request more details of this specific occurence.<n>

Instantly caught my attention because I was unaware of any star or celestial object approaching that illumination so far north of the ecliptic this time of year. Object was white to light blue in coloring and, initially, appeared to be stationary relative to landmarks and visible stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several seconds of viewing noticed object (very) slowly drifting downward. Initially thought object was aircraft (Arlington Regional Airport is about 5 miles South of my location) as I often see approaching aircraft displaying landing lights. The object slowly moved roughly 2deg to 3deg downward toward the horizon rapidly becoming dimmer as it moved. After approximately 20 seconds it was too dim to be visible to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not flashing, I could see no other lights of any color. The object did display a slight &#34;twinkle&#34; but it was not a prominent flicker. I could not discern a visible trail of any kind.<n>

In the western sky we saw a flashing green and red light. Besides the color and the flashing it looked much like a star. We continued to walk and above of us we could see a fast cigar shaped craft flying through the sky. It had a dull orange color to it. In continued to go through the sky until we lost it behind the trees. We went inside of the house. We told my father of the experience and me and him went out with a pair of binoculars. The green red flashing star was still in the sky, but it had moved into the north-eastern sky. We used the binoculars to get a clearer view of the colors and we what we saw was a star looking light that was green. At the bottom of it was a flashing red light. My father and I dismissed it as a plane and went back inside. I came out ten minutes later to see if it was still there. It was still there, floating in the sky. My father and I continued to watch it. Over the course of 20 minutes or so it very very slowly drifted east. We continued to watch ht for another ten minutes and went back inside. I cam back out nearly half an hour later. It was still there but it had drifted into the eastern sky. It was flashing much more distinctly now. It made a flash and then vanished. My father went out later and found it back were we originally saw it with the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that twinkling stars would be the first possibility that would have to be ruled out.

9/14/03 21:00|Coffeyville|KS|Unknown|20 minutes|Seen objects that looked like dim stars darting around sky.  Air craft scrambled..  Inconsistent blinks..  Non-Official aircraft|9/24/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31560.html|288|ndxe200309| Seen objects that looked like dim stars darting around sky.  Air craft scrambled..  Inconsistent blinks..  Non-Official aircraft<n> <n><n> <n><n> (perfectly clear sky) Looked up at sky and seen what looked like a dim star but was moving very quickly across the sky.  First one we seen moved quickly across sky then faded.  We began to see another in different location and direction, dont know if it was different or same??  We seen some that would fade in and out randomly.. You could see it then you couldn&#39;t then where you&#39;d expect it would be after continuing same path it would show up.   Within minutes of seeing all this activity of the lil dots in the sky which radiated white light,  Aircraft was popping.  So basically we didn&#39;t think it was normal for the first objects to fly that fast across sky and they didn&#39;t blink or have red light like alota air crafts are suppose to.  We also seen another that actually blinked white.  But it was very random.  It would be like blink then 10 secs later blink blink blink... No pattern what so ever.  One of the last events we can remember besides all the objects shootin around was we seen two moving that looked identical.  One stopped and the other head straight towards it then there was only one and it was moving??   So the objects moved very quickly, didn&#39;t flash like normal aircraft and if it did it was very random.  The objects would change course and path very easily.  3-5 planes were seen within 5-8 minutes of activity.  We seen what coulda been a joining of two objects, we didn&#39;t actually see em join though. Just two objects meet and only looked like one after.   And the one object that was flashing kinda flickered to it, bluish sometimes and redish sometimes, coulda been my eyes thought..<n>

At this angle I could see that there were more objects behind it at higher altitudes, one group of spheres formed a triangle. At this point I could count nine white spheres each being higher than the other except for the group of three that formed the triangle (they seemed to be at the same altitude). The object that cought my eye to begin with, the one closest to the ground seemed to be spinning. These objects maintained there formation and just drifted west at about the same pace as the clouds. The skys were mostly clear with some clouds and a light breeze.       After I thought it was all over more would appear, at one point an airplane flew near one, I wondered if the crew saw the object. As we were leaving two more objects drifted over head and another behind them, again from the skys over diamond head crater.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

That is surmise on our part.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tripod shaped object with red,  blue, and yellow/white flashing lights hovering and or moving over the east valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While visiting with friends, one stated that he had been observing strangely lighted objects in the sky over the course of the last few weeks (he observed these in Apache Junction aprx. 20 miles East of this sighting). So we went out to take a look and he didnt even need to show me, I saw right away what he was talking about. There were about five with one of them being either larger then the others or just closer. They all eminated from first glance what appeared to be three lighted orbs in a triangular shape and flashing/sometimes sparking off blue red and yellow lights, the red lights seemed to be on the sides(vs. the apex of the structure) It was difficult to make out how many there were because they did resemble a bright star or a planet. But the give away was the red lights on the tips and the fact that they &#34;seemed&#34; to move around. The important one to talk about it the closer or larger one...this one was off to the right (south east) of the others. It was bizarre, it also had the tripod like shape from the naked eye but when you used binoculars, you couldn&#39;t make out a shape, just flashing red blue and yellow/white lights, flashing quickly and it seemed to look like panals of lights, like six panels three on top and three on bottem with no shape in between, but from the naked eye there seemed to be shape that changed sometimes it looked like probes would be circulating around the object it also seemed like there was a hazey white area that would extend out of it like fog or steam but it would be just for an instant...also you couldnt tell if the craft was moving or not and at one time it seemed to be moving quickly towards our direction only a few seconds later to seem evern farther away then it was before, it also seemed to be &#34;dipping&#34; part of itself in and out of the clouds or the haze that it was producing, at one point the object looked as if it turned on its side and without a doubt I made out two wing like shapes that were very long and pointed they were shaped like long d! iamond shaped swords, they were narrow it made the craft look sort of geese like, but then out of nowhere its shape became enigmatic again. with out a doubt, what we saw was not a natural part of the constellation (i.e. star, planet) we just thought it might be interesting to see if  others had similar sightings and from what we see, it looks like whatever we saw tonight others in the area and south. cal have been also sighting these red blue and yellow white flashing things. well if there is any thing we can do to help let us know. Thanks. Oh our background is, well we are all twenty somethings with 2 of us having B.A. degrees with some grad school classes. I personally am a very overworked and busy single mother of three who trust me doesnt need more drama in her life then what is already present. The things that we saw (they are still there right now, same place) they were definantly strange and not anything that we could explaing through our experiences. We will try to video tape objects tomorrow if they are still around…<n>
9/14/03 01:20|Everett|WA|Unknown|5 to 7 minutes|Low frequency pulsing sound above house, flash of light and momentary power outage and sound instantly gone|9/17/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31494.html|296|ndxe200309| Low frequency pulsing sound above house, flash of light and momentary power outage and sound instantly gone<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately at 1:00 A.M., Sunday morning on Sept 14, 2003 I awoke due to my back bother me and the discomfort of a new bed.  I tried to get comfortable noting that the time was 1:09 A.M.. Laying and looking out of my window I noted the sound of what I thought was a helicopter approaching.  It is not an unusual occurance for medi-vac copters to have a flight path to the Everett Hospital.  The noise which sounded like copter blades creating a pressure wave vibrated my house some what.  The sound increased and then remained over head. There was not a shift in the pitch of the sound indicating movement.  I became somewhat irritated and thought to myself, &#34;why arent they moving the helicopter&#34;.  My second thought was that if may be a sheriffs dispatched helicopter.  The sound persisted approximately 5 min.  At that point I decided I needed to check out what the source was.  There was then a bright flash that eminated from outside and lit my room up and caused a temporary power outage.  At the same time of the light flash the sound instantly subsided completely going silent.  My electric fan and digital clock powered down and then came back up.  I then jumped from my bed and went to the southern window of my room and was looking east to the alley way and noticed that our alley light was at a low glow.  I assumed that the momentary power outage caused the pud alley light to shut off (or the bright flash trip the optical light sensor).  I then threw on my jeans and went to the front yard (approximately 30 to 45 seconds elapsed from the time of the flash to my being in my front yard).  Standing in my front yard looking up there was no sound, no swooshing noise or low frequency pulsing.  The neighbors dog three houses away was barking.  I returned to my bed room at approx. 1:30.  The next day I enquired of the neighbors if they had heard any unusual noises that morning.  The one neighbor remembered hearing what she thought was sometype of machine and she recalled thinking that she should go and ! check to see what was making the noise but she had her 1 year old grand daughter with her and chose to go back to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with the witness, and he sounds exceptionally credible to us.

I went out on my deck, and above my house was a large craft, spinning extremely fast. It was very fast, and there were four jets-I supposed that they were Air Forsce jets escorting it or watching it. It moved towards the north east, spinning quickly the entire time, and closely sttended by the jets, until it dipped out of my line of sight, either going down or landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside, discussed it with my husband, while flipping channels on the TV, expecting to hear a news report.

I looked where she was pointing and I knew right off the bat that this was not man made.  I saw 3 bright objects in a v shaped cluster between some trees in the sky.  They looked like orbs but very metalic bright like sun reflection off of chrome.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house to get my video camera (2 min. time)and when I came back, the objects were gone.  I asked my wife what happened and she stated that they just blinked out.  I went South 1/2 a block from my house looking West and Southwest in the sky looking for them.  I found them and they had moved several miles from the point of first sighting.  I started taping them with a Sony digital video camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects stayed in a V shape formation with 2 at the top and what looked like several miles below there was 1.  They kept blinking in and out.  I taped the objects for 12 min.  While taping them, I saw what I thought were things falling out of the sky (during replay I had caught other objects flying around the first 3 objects).  At the last min of taping, my battery was going dead on my camera, and the objects came together and formed a tight V shape and rotated counter clockwise to a line.  My battery went dead after that.  I went into my house to get my telescope to see them and the UFO&#39;s had gone when I came back.  Around 2 min time had elapsed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into my house and dubbed the tape to a VHS tape and I was amazed at what I had recorded.  I caught more then what I was looking at.  I caught objects that I did not see while taping.  What looked like flashes and falling objects were other UFO&#39;s that I did not see.  I had to jog the tape frame by frame to see some of these other UFO&#39;s doing manuvers that we as a people could not do with the technoligy that we have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I manage several high value warehouses for World wide companies.

We have reviewed the tape, and we find it to be ambiguous, with respect to the issue of the three objects being bona fide UFO&#39;s.  They could be three slowly drifting balloons in a clear, blue, cloudless sky, we believe.  PD))<n>

Sept 13 2003 in the afternoon, between 2 or 3 pm, I was laying in my hammok in my backyard talking to my mother on the phone as I was starring into the clear blue sky.  The sky was clear, no clouds.  I was looking to the east and saw an object traveling in a  north to south direction at a constant speed, really high up.  First I thought it could be a plane but I thought it was really high and the object had no wings that I could see, it was light blue in color and it looked kind of circular I was watching it with my naked eye (realiseing I couldn&#39;t see detail), asking my mother how high planes fly at. A few minutes later, traveling in the same north to south direction as I am looking to the east, a second oject, silver in color and lower in elevation, it looked like it was traveling at the same speed as the higher blue object. I told my mother that these two objects just did not look like planes and suddenly the two objects stopped and became stationary in the sky at the elevevations they were traveling at.  I ran into my house to get my binoculars, came back out and saw they were still in the same position in the sky.  I saw with my binoculars that both objects were spheres with a glow to them.  The first light blue sphere had a slightly lighter bluish glow and the silver sphere had a white hot glow with a bit of red in it.  The silver sphere seemed to change shape alittle as it  looked like it was rotating.  The sun was reflecting off the silver object the blue sphere was really high to see any reflections from the sun.   A courious situation happened soon after the two objects had become stationary, I noticed a  red balloon that had come loose from one of the car lots by my house, it was traveling up to the position of the silver object.  It was almost like the object had seen the balloon too.  The balloon went close to the silver object and as it passed I saw that it never went higher in the sky, the silver sphere seemed to stop it from going higher.  I&#39;m guessing now but silver! sphere seemed to grab it because the baloon was not visible any more.  I watched the two spheres for what seemed to be a good 20 to 30 minutes.  I noticed the objects seemed to getting smaller but they were still in their stationary positions.  Then I lost sight of them, but remember I said courious about the balloon?  The red balloon was comming back down towards the ground,  then I lost sight of the baloon behind some houses.  I kept looking in the sky hopeing to catch sight of the two objects again and to my surprise I saw that the blue shpere (the same one or different) was now in a more northern position in the sky, still about as high as I saw it earlier.  I saw it, then it was gone again.  I could see these object with my naked eye still.  Then as I was laying on my hammok again starring stairght up into the sky,  I saw the silver shere again straight over my position flying north to south at a lower elevation then I had seen it earlier.  I don&#39;t know if it was another sphere or the same one but it was silver with the same red white hot glow.  I could see it better the second time even with my naked eye but used my binoculars too.  I was watching the silver object for a few minutes then I lost sight of it.  I know what I saw was not planes, hellicopters, balloons, swamp gas, or any other man made object.  I even entertained ball lightning but these objects acted like they were in flight and also were stationary.  My mother is a phone witness that I was seeing the objects because I was talking to her when it all started and I almost had a second eye witness, my neighbor was in his back yard while I was watching the two objects but he couldn&#39;t see them, it was about the time they were becomming even too small for me to see.  My next door neighbor said he saw a blueish sphere across the street the week before from our houses, he said is was hovering below some power lines and caused them to spark.  I looked at the power lines and they are blackened and scortched where the sparking happened.  He thin! ks he saw ball lightning.  His discription  seems kind of like  my blue sphere but I think I was looking at more than ball lightning by the way the 2 objects acted, like something or some one was piloting them.  I live by McChord AFB and Fort Lewis  I see lots of planes every day, I did see a plane flying in the area at the time, it didn&#39;t seem to see them. I know these objects are out of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The only thing i could liken it to was a missile launch but i dont think a conventional missile can move at that angle. The sky was clear blue so it could be seen easily. After a few miutes it suddenly stopped and then started again a little higher and after a minute it just sped upwards and disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was raining moderate to heavy.  I first noticed something unusual when the rain suddenly stopped hitting my windshield, then started back up after about 1/10th of a mile later.  The gap in rainfall lasted about 7-10 seconds.  It reminded me of how the rain suddenly stops for a brief second when you pass under a bridge during a storm.  I could also make out that the sky was darker than normal.  I pulled over (now back in the rain) and looked towards the West.  The clouds in the sky were picked up the ambient light from the streetlights, and against them I could see a much darker object, stationary, over Rt. 70.  I couldn&#39;t guage the exact size or shape, but my impression was that it was huge.  It seemed to drift towards the South, and then I couldn&#39;t discern it anymore.  There were no overpasses or bridges in the vicinity for me to pass under, and the trees did not overhang the highway.  There was no sound and no lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a huge flash of a blue/white glow and scared all of us riding in the car. It was so enormous and so sudden and so bright that all of us thought that a nuclear device had gone off. We were situated just a few miles east of downtown on the 10 Freeway looking toward the west so that whatever it was could have originated from the ocean. We called a few local radio stations at the time, but no one knew what we were talking about. Do you know what that was? So as to reinforce my credibility, let me tell you that no one in our party had been drinking and we are all over 50 years old, my husband is a management consultant and I am a lawyer. We were returning from the Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona (east of Los Angeles - the flask we saw was in the west and covered the entire westerly sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was very disturbing - what with the current political situation, everyone&#39;s first thought was of some kind of terrorism. But, it seems clear that this was not the case and it must have been some kind of natural phenomenon or maybe. . . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please advise. It&#39;s driving us all nuts to know that we witnessed something extraordinary and not to be able to find out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you, ((name deleted))<n>

The sky was clear and lots of stars could be seen. The object very slowly came to a stop and it appeared to be about 2000-3000 feet above the city. It remained suspended for about two minutes during which time I checked my watch at 9.00pm. I was with a fellow worker and we stood on a sidewalk watching this object, and soon another ten people or so joined us and watched it. The object seemed to have a large gantry object sticking out in an inverted V shape but strangely the &#39;gantry&#39; would appear to show up on different sides of the object.  After hovering in a fixed position, the object slowly moved nothward but then a most astonishing thing happened. Long streamers, about a dozen in number streamed down, each streamer was on fire and falling in wavy fashion but the flaming debris went out long before they reached ground. The object then started to dull itself to complete black and disappeared from sight within two seconds.  No noise or flashing lights were seen.  I reported the matter to police and air traffic control at Victoria (left a voice message) but police not interested and air traffic control did not return my call. I am surprised this sighting has not been covered by local media. This is my first UFO sighting ever. I am 62 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to be over the Eastern North Shore mountains/Pitt Meadows area, or, even as close as the Second Narrows bridge vicinity.Very difficult to judge the locale, exactly.Anyhow, I watched it for a good 5 seconds before it disappeared behind obstructing buildings in the downtown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to believe that it was a jet fighter going crazy, but ,no flashing lights or sound. A jet helicopter? Doubtful. Too large and fast, I&#39;m afraid. Again, it was covering a fair distance in the short time I saw, and was changing levels somewhat, giving me the impression that it was almost floating while traveling, rather than going in a directly straight line from West to East.Very interesting, indeed. I wish that I could add more to my story, but that is all I can really tell you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

This is in the southeastern sky.  We have observed this two nights running and are observing it now.  We only have binoculars and can make out the three distinct lights which are bright white, not colored.  This, whatever it is, does not move at all.  It just sits there.  It seems to have moved over long periods but I think it is the earth movement that changes its position.  End of report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were all moveing north west accross the sky. This was the most patterns i had ever seen at one time. in the last month both myself and my wife had seen 4 other trianguler patterns always moving in the same direction, but only 1 at a time. What we saw tonight was phenominal, and is why i am writting in. I have been watching the skys for as long as I can remember, and before this past couple of months had only ever seen singuler lights moving in the sky. I have to say this has kind of freaked me out a bit. Such an large amount, and the patterns were all so perfectly formed, with the lights never breaking formation, with the exception of the ones moving individually. I have seen many unexplained lights in the night sky but this is the most incredible. I will be trying to get some video footage from now on with no gaurentees, as sometimes theese lights are hard to spot with the naked eye.

I was eating dinner and I was enjoying the weather at that time. I just finished my dinner and I looked up the sky and there was a lot stars shinning. Suddenly I saw a bright star moving coming from north heading toward south and it was moving at a very good rate of speed. I pointed in out and everyone at the party witnessed the event. I&#39;m not sure what it was, but  I&#39;m 100% sure its not a airplane, this thing was look like a glowing star travelling at very high rate of speed and also its round shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This could be either a satellite or UFO and I&#39;m pretty sure the are more people witness the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I managed to catch the object in an 8&#34; dobsonian reflector telescope and track it off and on for over a minute.  It had three bright lights arranged in a triangular shape and passed in front of the starfield behind it.  We all thought it could have been the ISS or a satellite, however, upon returning home, I checked NASA&#39;s J-Track software for satellite observations at 20:40 and the only objects remotely visible were 2 small orbcomm satellites (FM7 and FM8). I had a good view with the telescope and have never seen an object like this traveling east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Virtually no satellites have a groundtrack with a significant westerly component to them.

At first we thought it was a satelite until it changed direction several times but always continuing in the same general direction. The night was completely clear and the moon had not risen yet. Temperature was about 80F, winds were calm. Dry, with high humidity. It took the object about 6 minutes to travel from horizon to horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, a few minutes later a blue colored meteor burned in witnesses by myself and one other person.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Not likely a fireball meteor, I suggest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not a UFO report, exactly.  No O to be U or F.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left after work in Orlando Friday intending to visit my parents in Georgia, so it turned dark about 1/3rd the way into my trip. When I witnessed the event, I could not see the entire sky, merely the 30degrees in front, 90 on one side, and 30 to the right.  JasmineTheDog was in the car&#39;s passenger&#39;s seat, drowsily chasing rabbits. Interstate Highway 75 was relatively quiet between Gainesville and Valdosta.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was black as pitch, or it seemed that way to my eyes that couldn’t grow accustomed to the dark because of headlights. About 40 miles north of Gainesville, the sky suddenly became a uniform eerie green (slightly bluish) color all over and lasted that way for a full 1.5 seconds. The light was not bright enough to illuminate the terrain.  Jasmine started awake and looked out the window. It seemed to flicker slightly and then, poof! it was back to black. Jasmine looked around a bit, gave me a hurt look that said she thought I had tricked her, and curled up again to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what could have caused it. A meteor fire-ball is almost never that color, that long lasting, or that bright, from what I&#39;ve seen of meteor-shower watching over the years. I didn’t hear an explosion. I know there’s some sort of mining operation (phosphate?) just off of I-75, but that is many miles away, and I can’t imagine what could generate that much light (unless they dug up a ton of pure phosphorous).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sudden onset of light and the flicker reminded me of the glare from arc welding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Web address deleted here.

I stood there watching them and they began to flash red and green pattern.I went to wake my thirteen year old daughter.She was not excited.She says she had been seeing weird crafts all summer.She went back to bed.I tried to take a picture, but my digital camera wouldn&#39;t work.I got binoculars and watched from my daughters window.The lights then went all green.I then watched the lights go on.I could see what I believe was the top of the craft.It looked like the lights on a ferris wheel&#34; there were green lights around the outside and strait green ones perfectly along the top.The lights were dim and on for a few seconds.They went off and I could only see the backwards &#34;J&#34; green formation.By now it was close to 5:00am.The green lights stopped and I saw one huge lavender/blue light.It looked like it was scanning for something and it disappeared.That was the last I saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that celestial bodies, perhaps twinkling stars, would be the first possibility that would have to be ruled out.

When I looked up there was a greenish-blueish, round, glowing orb whizing through the air at an incredible speed. The speed alone canceled out the possibility of a jet, not to mention that there was absolutely no sound involved. At first, I thought that maybe it was a comet fragment, but I quickly ruled that out, as there was no streak, and also because it didn&#39;t move in a straight path; it zig zaged. Comets don&#39;t zig zag. It didnt stay for long, and was almost immediately gone. I don&#39;t know how long it was visible for, only that i didn&#39;t see it until it was leaving the area. I was urgently trying to get the driver&#39;s attention to have her get a look at the craft, but by the time she actually lifted her eyes off the road, the strangely colored light had vanished.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found it interesting to note that that same day a friend of mine had seen another in the air at a different time, and another group of friends saw many in Tennessee, including a large lenticular cloud with glowing orbs surrounding it, that following weekend. I have the pictures they took and will develope them as soon as possible. One more thing: there was a mysterious helicopter which seemed to be trailing in the direction of the ufo I saw as described above. Fort Belvoir is quite close to the sighting location.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We pulled off I-8, heading east at Vetrol Rd., turning S.  After several miles a sign read &#34;Great Sonoran Desert&#34;.  We pulled in directly W. to camp.  We could hear and see I-8 far to the N.&amp;S.  Approx. 6-8 mi. SW lay the Sand Tank Mts.  At approx. 9:30 p.m., I was sitting facing SW when instantly two large bright lights appeared.  We tried to figure what it could be, as I-8 was visible, N&amp;S, to our N.  Suddenly, two more lights appeared SW of the first two. A bit further away, to the NW , another one popped into view...then the 5th went out slowly, 4 and 3 went out , then  2 &amp; 1, N to S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10:15 p.m. one of the other guys was sitting facing SW, and said  &#34;they&#39;re back&#34;.  The first two lights were back, though much closer this time.  I got out my video camera, w/700 zoom lens.  There was no movement and no sound from the area where the lights were visible, and they stayed between the Sand Tank Mts. and us. After 2-3 min. they began to blink and flash either to each other or us.  Slowly, the N. one flickered and evaporated...then the lone light did the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was my first time for a sighting on video..I have an exceptional 35 mm. still shot taken 6.5 miles SE of Corona, NM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, Marana, AZ. poster, you were not alone that night.<n>
9/11/03 21:00|Saratoga|CA|Circle|~00:10:00|On 09/11/03 about 21:00 Hrs Ca time 3 star like obj at hi altitude travel acrosss sky from south to north within moments of eachother.|9/12/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31415.html|336|ndxe200309| On 09/11/03 about 21:00 Hrs Ca time 3 star like obj at hi altitude travel acrosss sky from south to north within moments of eachother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in an area where we have no street lamps. On several occassions during the past six years about this time of season I have seen  what almost could be mistaken for a tiny star in the nights&#39; sky. Except that it is moving across the sky at a very good rate of speed. It&#39;s direction is coming from the South and moving North and sometimes South to Northeast or so. In the past I was by myself when I viewed these things. My thoughts were that it was a possible sattlelite, but on one occassion two or three years back I saw one of these do a tight zig zag pattern as it passed over head. Anyway I had a hunch that tonight I might see one of these Traveling Stars as I began talking to my thirteen year old daughter about my previous sightings. I guess as the conversation tappered off we began to look up into the night sky. It was a clear night. No fog maybe some slight haze and a full moon rising but low enough not to interfere . It was dark in our back yard and we were in the hot tub looking up when by chance my daughter spotted what I had described to her just moments before. So we got very exicited I thought once again that may be it&#39;s a satalite. We watched it pass and as it was passing I was yelling to my wife inside the house to come outside and get a look at this thing. I wear glasses and my wife wears glasses but my thirteen year old who spotted it has twenty - twenty. My wife did not make it outside in time. It probably took about fifteen seconds from time of spotting till it crossed over going North till it was far from sight. My daughter asked if it could be a UFO and I said I don&#39;t know for sure. It was a school night(09-11-03_ about 21:00)and she after seeing this wanted to go inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know my GPS location on the map but if this helps I&#39;m located about 40 miles south of San Francisco, California which is SFO= 37deg/37&#39;/5&#34; North-----122deg/22&#39;/22&#34; West  Note: One of my previous sightings I called Lick Observatory and inquired about Satalites crossing overhead for the time/date or UFO reports but did not get any definitive answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Continued: I was now alone and looking up gazing around and was wondering if my wife and I would have some quite time in the hot tub and would&#39;nt it be neat to see some more when there it was again another little star like object traveling probably the same path as the previous one did. I yelled out to my wife and she was near by this time and she came out side with her glasses and I pointed to the proximity in the sky directly over head now and her eyes found the object in the sky and it too went out of sight. A third passed over in the same fashion except it sort of skewed it&#39;s course just as it crossed over our area. It&#39;s direction headed sort of North by Northeast once it passed over us. Now during that time on the cordless my wife called her sister whom lives in Sunnyvale about 6 - 7 miles North from us and my wife tells me that her sister went outside and she also had a chance to catch a view. But I&#39;m not sure if she saw what we were seeing because she mentioned to my wife that she saw them moving and line up and that there were 4 of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Decription: These things which I was seeing looked like a tiny greenish stars. It seemed to be very very high in the sky (may be 60 to 100 miles out). Not like a B1 or B52 bomber or jet airliner at 35,000 feet. This was much higher like sputnik or the Space Station which fell to earth some years back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Thoughts: Some kind of controlled satalite or UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was gone a minute Later. Then I kept Watch On The other Star Thing For awhile. It looked like it changed shap into a Line and Then It Was gone. This is not the first Time i have Seens those lights up here before, But not 3 orange lights at once. I have seen the lights at least 3 other times in the Sky but they were like the first one.

I was up at my computer when my Mom yelled up to get down and see thes lights from the front window. I cam out to see 2 bright red (welding torch) type lights coming almost overhead from the east in a horizontal configuration and then when it stood over Orwigsburg for 15 minutes it changed to a vertical configuration. They were about 1 mile from me. I banged on the neighbors house and told her to get out and see the UFO&#39;s positioned over her house. Other neighbors (about 7 people came out) and watched in amazement as these 2 objects hovered in the sky. The sky was clear with a beautiful blue lit horizon in the backround. I went and got my Digital Hi-8 camcorder and put it on a tripod and got about 4 minutes of it hovering over the town. The bottom disk would &#34;blink out&#34; and then reappear. I used the 450X zoom to get right on top of it and that really shows something amazing. I am a trained observer as an amateur astronomer and an independent video producer. This object didn&#39;t make a sound (no wind was blowing and you could hear a pin drop on the sound recording)! No navigational blinking lights typical of our own aerodynamic designs. I converted the tape footage to DVD and did single frame/slow motion viewing and I can tell you that this is nothing we made. There is an electrostatic discharge around the craft often see on UFO&#39;s in reference to the propulsion system reacting with the earths atmosphere causing a corona discharge or the craft to glow--this is typical of what the military refers to &#34;recified beam-field propulsion&#34;. It&#39;s all on the video to see. What really disturbs me is the fact that I called the local TV station (WNEP) and Bob Reynolds called me back twice and said he was interested and said he would send someone down to pick up the HI-8 video tape and take it back to the studio on the 11th. They never called back.  I called the 2 local newspapers (Pottsville Republican) and the lady I talked to laughed hysterically at me. The people at the Call newspaper also didn&#39;t care much either. These people better wake up and take seriously what is going on her!! These craft are not from around here and I&#39;m quite certain they are not from our solar system. Where are they from. I&#39;ll give you 5 good guesses to start: Epsilon Eridinus, Tau Ceti, Zeta 1&amp;2 Reticulem,and  Proxima Centauri to start.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m quite certain they are alien spacecraft and that their technology is easily a thousand years in advance of our own here.

9/11/03 19:00|Richmond|VA|Flash|1 to 2 minutes|Numerous flashing lights over Richmond, Virginia on September 11, 2003|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36973.html|341|ndxe200309| Numerous flashing lights over Richmond, Virginia on September 11, 2003<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were returning from a restaurant west of Richmond, Virginia.  I was in the front passenger seat and a friend was in the back seat.  My wife was driving.  It was dark and the sky was clear.  I happened to look out the passenger window and saw several flashing lights which I first thought were airplanes.  What drew my attention was that the lights seemed too erratic.  Although the &#34;pulses&#34; were steady (like that of an airplane), there was no symetry.  The flashes did not match what you would have expected on an airplane&#39;s wings, or a helicopter&#39;s.  When I leaned down further for a broader view upwards, I saw there were many lights spread across half the sky.  They were moving west to east.  I pointed them out to my wife and friend.  My friend was in the back, on the driver side.  She immediately saw the flashing lights on her side of the car.  (I am sorry to add that she also said she saw &#34;two mother ships&#34;, although I saw nothing of the kind.)  My wife could not look up because she was concentrating on the road, and saw none of this.  The sky was filled with these lights, quite far up.  There was no sound.  Although we were in a car, with plenty of traffic noise, I would have thought a fleet of planes or helicopters that large would have been heard over the engine.  The fact that it was September 11 made me wonder if it was some kind of aerial memorial for the victims of 9/11.  However, the weird pattern of the flashing lights suggested this was something far out of the ordinary.  The lights disappeared to the east.  When I got home I left a voice mail with a local television station.  I wanted to know if anyone else had seen this.  I never got a call back, and was too embarrassed to pursue the matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/11/03 03:00|Lake Charles|LA|Sphere|5.5hrs|We saw one large craft that changed colors and later on we saw 2 other crafts that were smaller and emitted a red light.|9/17/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31431.html|342|ndxe200309| We saw one large craft that changed colors and later on we saw 2 other crafts that were smaller and emitted a red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were night fishing on Prien Lake at around 1:00am.  At 3:00am we moved from one spot to another on the other side of the lake. At about 3:30 my friend asked me to look above us, that he had been watching an object move around for the past 30 minutes and that he thought it was a star at first, but now he was positive that it wasn&#39;t.  I looked up to see a yellow light that seemed like it was getting closer.  Within about 5 minutes we started to see that it was changing colors. I had binoculars in my boat so we looked at the object through the binoculars.  The colors it was putting out were red, yellow, green, and a metallic.  The object seemed as though it was spinning.  It looked round at first, but then seemed as though it might be triangular as it got closer.  The whole time we watched the object it was moving in a way that no other craft known to me or my friend had ever moved.  It would shoot sideways(to the right) at a great amount of speed with no accelleration, just from stop to as fast as it could move sideways in 1 second.  Then it would shoot back the other direction(left) just as fast.  It would then shake a little and then shoot upward extremely fast.  After it would shoot upward, it would appear as if was floating back down, almost as if you dropped a feather and it swayed from side to side as it fell.  After watching this ship for about an hour and a half I started seeing a purple cloud around the craft.  I thought I had been starring at the object for to long and then my friend said that he needed to quit looking at the object because he was starting to see a purple ring around the object.  That is when I mentioned that I had been seeing a purple ring around the object for the past 15 minutes.  We started to realize that the object would only create a purple cloud around it when it would try to shoot upward.  After watching the object for about 2 hours we started thinking that it was maybe having a problem leaving the atmosphere.  The sky was clear(no clouds! ) and it was a full moon, so the visibility was excellent.  About 15 minutes after we discussed the possibility of it having problems, we saw another object come up from the West.  This object was smaller than the original object we were looking at and we actually thought it was some type of jet.  It was moving very fast toward the original object, but it was about a thousand feet or more lower than the first object.  This smaller object was flashing red and when it got below the first object we sighted it went from a fast speed, like that of a jet, to an extremely fast speed, faster than anything we had ever seen.  It shot across the sky about 10 miles or so in 1 second and then came to a complete stop.  The craziest thing about all of this is everytime either of the objects would move sideways or up and down, their was never any acceleration.  It was stop to as fast as it could possibly go and the human eye still see it move, with no acceleration.  There was also no sound.  The smaller object stayed in one spot for about 5 minutes, then it shot across the sky very quickly again toward the original object.  After it got below the original object, it shot up towards it and without stopping, headed South until it disappearred.  Then about 5 minutes later, another red flashing object appeared taking the same path as the last one.  Only this object would stop and go franticly as it headed to the first object we sighted. This third object moved stranger than the other two, but seemed to be the same as the second object we sighted.  It finally got underneath the first object we saw and it shot up toward it and then headed South until it disappeared.  Then suddenly both red objects came into view.  Both of them were on each side of the first object sighted, but not right by it, probably a couple of miles away on each side.  By now it was getting daylight and the two red objects were not visible anymore.  However, the first object we had spotted was still in the air.  It appearred to be further away now and kind of looked like a star bouncing around.  It was now about 8:30am and an airplane was coming in for a landing at the Lake Charles airport, which I thought had to have seen this activity on radar all night, but I later found out that they close all departments of the airport after 10:00pm.  This plane was coming in for a landing with its landing gear down and the original object that we had saw after 3:00am was starting to fade off to where we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  Then the plane that was about to pass over us and land started to turn and eventually took off in the direction it was coming from, leaving us only to think that the airport had diverted this plane away.  At around 9:30am, my friend and I left the lake.  We both realize that we will never really know exactly what we saw, but I hope by posting this message, someone else will have some input on the same sighting that we had.  It just lasted too long and the sky was too clear for someone else not to have seen at least some of the activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  We believe that &#34;twinkling&#34; stars would be the first item to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the parties were witnessing UFO&#39;s.  PD))<n>
9/11/03 02:45|Irving/Grand Prairie|TX|Cigar|10-15 minutes|Large Cigar Shaped Craft|10/7/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32064.html|343|ndxe200309| I was driving home from work traveling southbound on Loop 12 when I first saw a very large cigar shaped craft hovering directly over the road.  It had a very bright, round white light on top and a bright round red light at the bottom.  I did not notice any noise associated with it that you would expect from such a low flying aircraft.  I slowed to about 25-30 MPH as did the other vehicles on the road.  The craft at first was almost directly above me and seemed to be at about the height that traffic helicopters fly except that this object was at least as large as a commercial jet.  As I watched, the craft moved along slowly above the road, staying just in front of me.  It then slowly rotated clockwise until the red light was on the top &amp; white light on the bottom.  It then rotated back to it&#39;s original position and moved to the east side of the road where it rotated again but to a horizontal position.  It continued to move around some and then crossed back over the road to the west side.  Once there, I saw an arm or wing come out from the side of the craft so that now it is kind of &#34;L&#34; shaped.  The wing had pulsating red lights in a circle on the end and then a solid, concentrated beam of white light was emitted from the tip of the wing down to the ground.  It appeared similar to a search light, but was more concentrated.  The beam moved around along the ground.  I watched the craft my entire drive south on Loop 12, then onto Spur 408 until I exited onto I-20 and could no longer see it.  During the entire sighting, traffic around me was also moving very slowly, and some vehicles had pulled over to the shoulder.  It was a clear night and the craft was so large, so close and with such bright lights, that it would have been impossible not to see it or to mistake it for a plane or helicopter.  I have never seen anything remotely like this and to be honest, I hope I never do again!<n>

I was looking closely at Mars and there for a few seconds there was an object  I thought was na airplane light. On further observation this object suddenly became clearer and there it was a &#34;Triangular Shaped &#34; with three red lights each on the tips of the pointed angles...I had my binoculars handy and looked closer. The object had a n unusual metal type appearance and it seemed to hover for awhile... Unfortunately I did not have a video camera because the lights and shape were very distinctive and would have produced a really visible image... I felt a chill up my spine and eary feeling fell over me... Almost  doomlike yet excited that this maybe a UFO... Varied thoughts passed through my mind which elevated fear I have never felt before... I felt like  something was reading my mind and then an image crossed in it and I sensed and could see through my mind&#39;s eye an image and also a sound of something near...I froze for a moment or two and then a sudden air of heat came over me and then the object in the sky was gone...I had pinched myself and had gotten myself a glass of water to get back to the evening&#39;s reality... I was stunned yet an overwhelming calm came over me and I felt safe...This is the first account I have ever experienced and have some heavy thoughts that seem difficult to dispell...Today, I sat quietly and pondered whether or not I should tell anyone.  I feel a release and also relieved that this site exist. so that my experience can be told...I am not sure that what I saw was a UFO, but for now it seems so...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sitting outside on a clear night of 9/11/03 and I was looking up at the stars. I saw this really bright star and just stared at it because it wasnt north I was looking at it was southtorward Canton ohio and Canal fulton. All of the sudden the star starting zig zagging in different ways and it looked like it was bouncing up and down. I called a co-worker over to see if it was just my eyes playing tricks on me and asked him,&#34;what the heck is that&#34;! He couldnt believe his eyes either and then he pointed over and there was another one accross from it. Then we started seeing more of them and everyone asked what we were looking at and we said look up. Is that a star or something else? I had about 6 or more eye witnesses. Then around 4:30 a.m on my second break I went back out there and over the tree horizon I couldnt believe my eyes what I saw. I couldnt tell what kind of shape it was but you could see the colors spinning around the u.f.o.. And it would just stay in one place and go left sometimes or right and sometimes up and down but not much. The other bright u.f.o&#39;s in the sky were still there also. Then tonight on 9/12/03 at 11:30 there outside my apartment at in the sky. There is something going on in the sky&#39;s of Barberton,Ohio. I dont know what but it couldnt be sattelites or stars because they dont zig zag around and move. It&#39;s almost like there is some kind of security going on in the sky&#39;s because they dont move far at all. I dont know what it is but I would like to know!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed, but we believe that &#34;twinkling&#34; stars would be the first possibility that would have to be eliminated.  They are colorful, and they always appear to move around in the sky.  PD))<n>
9/11/03 00:10|Windsor|MO|Triangle|10 minutes|Silent, low flying, multi-light triangle shaped ufo.|9/24/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31772.html|346|ndxe200309| Silent, low flying, multi-light triangle shaped ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw this craft at around 10 minutes after midnight on 9/11/03 while on a break while working the night shift.  The craft appeared approximately 1/2 mile to the west.  I estimate it to be between 1500- 2000 feet in the air.  It appeared over a treeline.  Once we saw it we thought it was a new version of the stealth fighter out of Whiteman Air Force Base, Knob Knoster, MO.  If this was one, it was one bad ((object)).  When it started coming to us, we realized it was something VERY different.....we are use to seeing these stealth fighters at all times of the day/night.  We are use to the lighting, and sounds of these planes.  This was different.  First thing we noticed out of the ordinary was the lights.  This one had a HUGE &#34;headlight?&#34;  It looked just like a car headlightlight beam shing in a fog.  As it got closer we saw the bottom of it.  It had 1 huge dome light on the bottom.  it had 3 much smaller lights that made an equilateral triangle.  This thing was heading straight at us.  That is when we got out of my truck.  It flew by very close to us from the NE.  By this time this thing was probably 500 feet high.  That is when we both noticed how silent it was.  Before that we were just entranced by the lighting of this thing.  But this thing was SILENT.  after it passed, we watched it fly to the south.  Once it got about 1/4 mile away, all we could see was 2 flashing lights.  At that time it looked like a typical stealth bomber.  Later that night my co-worker was taking trash out and saw another one.  He said it was silent as well, but with 1 headlight, and 3 bigger lights making up the triangle, but no dome light.  We figured it might have been a new version of the stealth, but why would a stealth bomber have all those funky lights?  My co-worker and I went to the day shift this week, and today I was telling a friend at work about this encounter, and he told me an interesting story.  He said another guy told him about a girl witnessing the same craft, but she called the sheriff.  He said there was nothing to worry about, but that they had over 100 calls about the same thing that night.  Windsor is a very, very small town, and to have 100+ people report it is just mind boggling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will forward this case along to the Missouri Investigators Group for follow up, and to try to find other withesses.

9/10/03 22:00|Stanley|VA|Unknown|10 minutes|Series of rectangular burnt orange lights observed at approx 10 PM over Elkton, Va. and were observable from at least 40 miles away.|9/17/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31439.html|351|ndxe200309| Series of rectangular burnt orange lights observed at approx 10 PM over Elkton, Va. and were observable from at least 40 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was returning home from my son&#39;s cub scout meeting in Reston, Virginia.  I departed the meeting at 8 PM and arrived in the Luray/Stanley area around 09:50 PM.  There was a full moon that might and it was cloudy.  I live in Stanley, Va and have to drive through Luray on Route 340 to get to my residence.  After I passed through Luray, I then have about 9 miles to drive to my home which equates to around ten minutes.  When I passed through Luray, the speed limit is posted to increase to 55 miles per hour.  I first noticed the strange lights as I was accelerating, and I thought to myself, &#34;that is strange, it must be a new residence on top one of the moutains in the area because I never noticed it before.&#34;   So I drove on and I intermittently kept glancing at these lights as they were very bright and large to be a residence.  These light kept getting my attention as I was nearing my home.  I have to turn left at the Hawksbill restaurant on Route 340 in order to get to my home. When I got to within 1.5 miles of my home, I suddenly realized that these lights were too high in the sky to be a residence on a mountaintop.  I slowed my car down to get a real good look at it.  My occupation requires me to pay attention to minute detail so my following decription of this object will be very accurate. This object was in the sky at a height of about 4,500 to 7,000 feet. (this is much higher than the surrounding mountains)  The appearance was rather strange in that I could not visually detect any outline. (no top, sides or bottom) What I did see was a series of rectangular shaped lights, emanating a burnt orange color.  The lights were not moving or spinning, just completely stationary.  The arrangement of these lights is what gave the indication of some type of craft.  The rectaglular shapes were of a very crisp appearance, in other words, the corners were very sharp.  Taking into consideration of their estimated altitude and how big they were, equates to this object being very large.  I am estimati! ng that the opject had to be at least two to three football fields in size. (600 to 900 yards)  The rectangular lights were all uniform in that the top was wider than the bottom, and the sides were the longest length.  This gave the appearance that the lights were either tapering at angle on the craft or thery were flat and were actually trapezoidal.  There were about 7 or 9 lights and the ones in the middle were much larger that the ones on each end.  This then equates to the lights giving the appearamce of being on the surface of craft and due to the sequential difference in the size of lights in the middle to the lights on each end, the craft then had the appearance of being triangular.  When I realized that I was now a witness to something highly unusual I raced home to get my camcorder, but when I came back out to take some video it was gone.  I have since did some backgound investigation on my own.  I checked the locals around the area and a few people did say that there was someting seen that night and it was directly over Elkton, Virginia.  Elkton is about 30 miles from Stanley and the direction of object I observed in relation to where Elkton is, matches up.  I then checked three local newspapers both in reading and phone calls and there was nothing reported.  I called the Elkton local police and the Elkton Sheriffs office and nothing was reported.  I wish to get anyone else whom was a witness to this event on the 10th of Sep at 10 PM over Elkton, Va that could be seen from a circular observable area estimated to have an approximate diameter of 50 miles. (This estimation of the viewing area results from my initial sighting occurring just south of Luray, Virginia.)<n>

It was a quiet street. Something caught my eyes in the sky above me. When I glanced up, I saw 3 bright lights (I thought they&#39;re stars at first) in a triangle formation moving at a fairly low altitude. By low altitude I mean an altitude where helicopter might fly at (not plane). My second immediate thought was they could be Canadian geese simply because of the triangle formation and the low altitude they&#39;re flying at. Only when I begun to notice the speed that thing was flying at and when I starting to make out the underlying shape of the object, I dismissed the geese theory and I was certain it was somekind of aircraft. Since it was moving at a very quiet demeanour, I basically ruled out helicopter. In addition, I just want to mention that those 3 bright lights weren&#39;t blinking at all. Hence, it couldn&#39;t be a commercial plane in my opinion. Now, I don&#39;t necessary believe that this object is from out of space. It could be some military spy craft from US for all I know (I don&#39;t think Canada can afford something like that). But it sure gave me an interesting experience. One last note, the object was flying towards the North-West direction before I lost sight on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There is a large cliff to the West of the cabin, near the back of the lake. During WW2 this cliff was the backdrop to flyovers by airplanes that drug banners to train arial gunners. Earlier that day I had made a comment that wanted to see a UFO. Around 9:30 pm, I went out to his truck to get something and I looked over the top of the cliff and saw a flashing light that was blinking red, white, and bluish-green. I stood there for a few minutes and watched to see where it would go and it just hung in the sky. I went in the cabin to get my friend and he came out to the truck too. We sat there and watched this thing through the back window and saw it move up and down, then zoom to the side and back to it&#39;s original spot. Then another craft moved in to the North of it, it was blinking in the same colors as the first one, then two more crafts moved into the same area and formed a triangle. They hung in a triangle formation for approximately 5 minutes and then took off one at a time. During their time in the triangle formation, they were blinking red and white. The original craft that we saw then flew off over our heads blinking red and white at a very rapid pace with no sound. At that time, we could hear airplane engines when they flew over, so we knew this was a different type of craft. As it got darker out, we moved into the main cabin where there are bay windows that look out upon the lake and the cliff and watched as many other similar crafts flew into triangle formations and hung in the sky. They would form triangles of all different sizes, but always triangles. We watched them for about an hour and a half to two hours before we got tired and went to bed, but there were still many of them in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

A witnessed watched a extremely large craft fly quickly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just tonight I had a telephone call from the same folks. The man&#39;s wife was outside tending the farm animals and her husband was with her. He takes his video equipment with him on many occasions as he is a sky watcher and does catch some good footage of different things. He also caught some great footage of the forest fires which were burning in the Barriere area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight on September 10, 2003 at 8:50 p.m. the couple heard a sound coming from the north, when they looked towards that area of the sky they saw a bright white light heading directly in their direction and it passed soundless over top their farm. Both stood speechless ! They looked again towards the north where they could still hear the sound coming from, which at this point was growing louder and louder as it approached their location. Seeing the fellow was so shocked to see what just went over top of them, meaning a large silent bright white light, he never thought to &#34;try&#34; to take a bit of footage. But he did say the white moved very quickly and was soon out of their line of sight due to the surrounding area. But as the sound from &#34;something&#34; else drew closer and at this point was at the edge of the farm, he started rolling video tape and was surprised to see two large military helicopters fly low over head. He said I don&#39;t know what one would call the make of the helicopters, but the two of them were really large and flying in the same direction the light was heading. The witness also told me he has good equipment for his camera and did catch the two helicopters on film. (The footage will be making it&#39;s way to me as soon as he can get a copy made up).<n> <n><n> <n><n> (HBCC UFO Note: Due to myself knowing there is a fire in that area, I asked if the aircraft the witnesses saw were anywhere near the fire. The fellow said the helicopters were not even close to the area where the fire is burning. The fire is burning way up on the Bonaparte area and the two helicopters should have been way west of these peoples farm. I also asked one of the witnesses if he knew of any helicopters flying at night due to the fire activity in the area. He said he knew of none flying at night. He did say the run of the mill helicopters are seen a lot during the daylight hours but no military helicopters have been seen in the area. He also added there are military personal in the area and many of us would have heard of this on the news. There are a good number of Canadian troops on the ground fighting these awful fires through the province. I also asked the witness how bad was the fire in the area, and he told me it wasn&#39;t bad at all. (There is a bit of important information I cannot give out as it could lead back to one of these witnesses. This bit of information is key to knowing what is flying and isn&#39;t). Something else which stuck me as odd. A shor time ago the media, along with the general public were at one location taking pictures of the forest fire.

There is about a 100 feet of sand between the water and the bird sanctuary that is on the other side of you as you walk the beach. It was about 75 degrees that night and the tide was unusally high. It is very isolated. It was a dark, clear, starry night. When we got near the lighthouse we felt a weird sensation like we were being watched. The only light is the lighthouse light. I even said I thought someone was watching us. We turned around and walked back to where we entered the beach and had an uneasy walk back to the boardwalk. A chill went up my neck and we walked up the boardwalk where the main part of the city is  and I turned my head to the right and said, &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; One large looming red orange light was joined by another and they mutilplied outward till there was ten on each side, Kevin turned to look as the formation was collapsing inwards (he saw five lights on each side move) towards the center and then the lights got a big bright flash that filled the entire night sky and Kevin saw sparkly things come off it. They then disappeared. The formation was very sophisticated and I grew up on Edwards AFB and my dad was in the Air Force so I know what military exercises look like and I am an engineer and have worked with flares, so I know this was not either military or flare or fireworks in resemblence. We stayed to watch the night sky as red orange formations lit up the sky, sometimes three shapes very high on the left and then two below on the left of the sky. It was some pretty sophisticated stuff. I remember that even though it seemed to happen fast, before we knew it, it was 9pm. I know it started at 8:30 because the reason I happen to be looking in that direction is because I was looking for the time. I can honestly say that I am a skeptic and whatever I s! aw scared the crap out of me and made me consider having a much more open mind. I could not turn the lights out at night when I went to bed, because it unnerved me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While that doesn&#39;t hardly justify me as a credible witness, I&#39;ve been around aircraft all my life.  I work at an air station where we see everything from Cessnas to B757s.  It is my opinion that what I have seen is either not man-made or not conventionally identified per FAA regulations and as such should have been forced to land for their altitude was far greater than 500 feet.  So, to the incident...  I was talking to my mother outside while she watered plants in the front yard when I noticed a single orange light.  It didn&#39;t dawn on me that it was there until it instantly disappeared.  When I commented on it she turned around and suddenly 3 orange orbs appeared.  I could not gauge the distance except to say that we live 8 miles to the east of I-10 and these were hovering over the valley and north of Evergreen, where I work, which is 3 miles west of I-10.  As we watched they disappeared one by one.  I was tempted to get a camera, tried to get my father to see them but he was unavailable.  They disappeared after only 2 minutes.  I did not see any signs that they were man made aircraft.  They did not have strobe lights.  I heard no sound, but since I&#39;m assuming they were at least 11 miles away I probably would not have heard a helicopter from that distance.  However, I have ruled out helicopters because if the lights had been spots, they did not go out gradually as if turning, and given the distance spots would not be focused 11 miles away, they would be focused downward, and finally why would 3 be focused in my direction.  Given the apparent distance and their apparent separation of 1 to 2 miles from each other, I would surmise that they would have to be purposely focusing on my house.  Not a likely prospect. Hence, they were not spots but simply bright lights.  But as the lights went out, I should have seen the strobes.  Also, the objects seemed to disappear in correlation with known man-made aircraft entering the same airspac! e.  Incidentally, it was a near full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the first of two sightings, but I&#39;ll file a follow up for the second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date indicated is approximate.

I watched for the next 5-7 minutes as it maintained its position.  When I got home I told my wife I had seen a UFO and she asked if I had stopped at a bar on my way home again.  I go out after about 5 minutes to have another look, and to my shock there were now two of them but now they were moving.  They seemed to create this shimmering effect as the moved across the sky heading North.

I posted about another sighting at Randolph AFB on the 5th of July. This time I saw somehting totaly different. I was on my way to the gym at around 05:30 on the 10th of September. I was at a stop light on Kitty Hawk rd. when I saw what appeared at first to be a plane flying very low about 500 ft over the top of a normal size tree. This wouldnt be that unusual since there is an Air Force Base but I have never seen planes landing or even flying that early in the morning since all the planes on the base are training planes. The object had 3 very bright white lights on it in a triangle shape. The lights turned like warning lights on emergency vehicles. I could not see the object itself because the lights were very bright and it was still dark out. I have never seen any lights like these before on any aircraft and I have been around planes for the last 6.5 years, and I have seen almost every type of plane when I was stationed at Nellis AFB. Also there was no sound coming from the object. The object was moving towards the South East very slowly. I watched the object for about 20 seconds and as I got onto 1604 South I lost it in the low clouds. All I know is it was very strange and I have never seen anything like it before<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several seemingly credible reports from the same individual, who describes himself as being a member of the U.

I looked up at the Moon and the clouds surrounding it and a break, open sky above me. I noticed a very bright object, bigger than any planets would look. As I watch it travel from north to south the glow lasted about 10 seconds and lowered to just a tiny speck in the sky. I watched it travel south and it again got very bright for about ten second then back to a tiny speck. An Airliner was then coming from west to east. They fly this pattern all the time. I noticed another plane behind it and higher up. It turned in the direction the light was traveling (south) and I lost both to the clouds. The pilot of the Airliner should of seen this or maybe passengers, the plane would most likely of come out of Oakland, San Francisco or San Jose California.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I woke up and let my dog out;  looking up in the sky I saw a very bright light, like a star but a bit larger, and every so often it flashed different colors - red, green blue.  At first I thought it was a plane but it did not move. Then suddenly it shifted sideways quite a distance, then moved in a straight line back to where it was.  I watched on and off for quite a while and the flashing lights continued but it did not seem to change position in the sky, though it seemed to shift around once in a while.  The irregular flashing of the different colored lights and the movement was unlike anything I have ever seen or heard of until I read the post from Courtenay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for sending along the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

We live on the end of the street, and cars often turn around in our driveway late at night.  The &#34;car&#34; sounded like it was stopped outside our house, which concerned me, so I went into the living room (which was dark) to look outside.  When I did I saw 2 flashing lights about a 45 degree angle in the sky, flashing rapidly, with the lights being  about 20 degrees apart.  They were very bright, and unlike anything I&#39;d seen, which frightened me, so I went to wake up my husband.  When he looked out the window, he saw the lights, but by now they were flashing closer together, but were moving away at a very fast speed.  They were moving east, with the lights flashing in a north/south direction.  I never saw a car.  We watched the next night to see if it could have been a plane, but as low as the lights were the plane would have woke everyone in the neighborhood.  I have never seen anything so unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Conversation drifted off in other directions when something caught my eye over the ocean a good ways above the horizion. It was ayelow orangish light that looked at first as a large star would. It faded out in just a matter of a second or two. My mind couldn&#39;t process what I was seeing before it was gone. I said to my 2 friends that I had just seen some strang light that I wished they had seen before it disappered. They kinda laughed at me and we went on talking. About 5-10 minutes later it appeared again in a simelar position, this time both of my friends saw it also. It would stay for a few seconds then it went behind a cloud. We continued to watch the area when it appeared over the horizon way to our left. again it was there only a second and changed position again closer to where I first noticed it. This time when it disapeared we did not see it again. Its change of position was not in the pattern of a plane we didnt hear any aircraft in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all 3 agree that it was the strangest thing we have ever seen. One of my friends thought she could see reddish edges to the light, my eyesight is more distance challenged than hers so I can&#39;t disput that. We are women in our 50&#39;s and I assure you we don&#39;t know what it was but we do know it was real. We want to know what it may have been we saw and hoping that there is a reasonable explaination for this. We were unable to find anyone else that saw a strange light that night. Can anyone tell us anything.                      ((initials and professions deleted))<n>

I noticed two bright lights in the sky that were side by side, similar to headlights.  I pointed it out to my husband and he said that he had seen them a few minutes earlier but didn&#39;t tell me because he didn&#39;t think I would believe him.  The lights were brighter than stars or a planet.  They did not move or flash.  After a few minutes, the light on the left went out followed by the other one a couple of seconds later.  We continued to watch the sky and a couple of minutes later the lights reappeared a short distance to the right from where they had been before.  They did as before, stayed lit and stationary for a few minutes and then the one on the left disappeared followed by the one on the right.  We needed to get back to our baby sitter and child, so I do not know if the lights continued to reappear.  These lights did not appear to be an airplane, flare, falling star or meteor.  I felt compelled to enter this report after reading an article in our local paper about six other sightings in the same area since August 26th.<n>

Followed by USAF observation/intervention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it appeared to be a very bright star, as bright as Venus. Then this &#34;star&#34; moved rapidly across space. Soon we noticed it was one of many. They all had the ability to maneuver in multiple directions. Up, down, and side to side.  They had command of the sky. Shortly, an enormous number of military aircraft were called to the scene.  There were at least fifty fighter jets. These planes looked clumsy compared to the aircraft we had been observing. The UFOs had an incredible grace and range of motion that made the jets seem awkward.  This show continued for about forty-five minutes. Then the UFOs disappeared much as they had come.  They once again looked like bright stars and were instantly gone. My wife and son were with me.  All of us were astounded. The FBI in Phoenix would only confirm that there was---as I had put it---a massive display of firepower in the skies above Prescott. It was an unforgettable experience.<n>

While we were talking I looked out over the ocean and saw an orangish yellowish what looked like a star but much larger.It faded out after just a couple seconds.By the time my brain processed what I saw it was gone. I told my friends that I saw a strange light and I wished they had seen it. They laughed at this and we continued talking. After about 10 min. it appeared again this time my friends saw it also. It moved behind a cloud and showed up way to the left of us over the water after about 1 min. It then dissappeared again and showed up after about 30 sec. the first place I noticed it. It disappeared again and we never saw it again. One of my friends said it appeared to have red around the edge of the light. My vision is more distance challanged than hers so I could not dispute that. I reported this on this site on 09/12/03 but for some reason it didnt show up. I was checking the site 09/13/03 to see if anyone else had reported and saw another sighting at the same time but mine wasn&#39;t listed. I did notice that we wern&#39;t the only ones in myrtle beach that night that saw the strange lights. Would love to know what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am driving parallel to the border and my wife asks about to lights that are showing in the norhteastern sky. One on top of the other at about 30 degrees from the ground. Then some smaller lights start to appear - they resemble to things- either something lights turning kind of what one would think a flying saucer would look like, but also it appeared to be kind of like when you see on TV that an airplane is shooting fire and that the lights kind of follow the path. It was really akward because I tried justifying that they were the lights from the customs port, but then I realize that they were to high to be lamps and that they were to bright and colored white to be antennas.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed several yellowish or orange lights in the sky to the east, which would place them over the ocean. I drew my wife&#39;s attention to the lights just before they blinked out. She did get to see them, saying that there were four lights configured so that they appeared to be the headlights of a car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A similar sighting was reported to NUFORC on August 31, also in Myrtle Beach. The NUFORC note suggested they could be landing lights. As a resident of Myrtle Beach, I can state that these lights were the wrong color and were stationary, whereas aircraft landing lights are a brilliant white and slowly move toward the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our sighting was several days after that other one, and yet the similarity is striking.

A few minutes later we saw it reappear in a different location.  That was when I noticed that Mars had been just off to the lower right of the moon.  Sure enough, this object faded out just as the first one had.  A few  minutes again, and it shows up in another location.  This happened for about fifteen minutes and then just seemed to stop.  At one point two of the lights showed up right next to each other and again faded.

It was moving left across the sky very fast. Much too fast to be a plane. Planes were visible everywhere to compare the distance to the speed. The object was red with a tail at first, then slowed down eventually stopping completely. It was a steady red light, after stopping for about 15 sec it disappeared. Then the object reappeared and flew back in the direction from which it came. Nothing I know of can move that quickly, stop, and reverse itself...nothing!! I&#39;m a little freaked out here!!!<n>

As quickly as it they both appeared they vanished reappearing only seconds later with yet another in a triangle shape...they hovered and seem to circle each other than vanished.This following the events of the prior night, when my son was woken by a bright light in his window.  When he peered into the brightly moon lit sky he distinctly saw a triagle shaped craft with red, white and blue lights that changed to red, yellow, and green.  The craft fluxuated back and forth coming closer and nearly disappearing from sight.  The craft shift rapedly then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Hwy 13 makes a S-curve at this point just south of the Hwy 2 intersection.  Two sets of bright amber lights were first seen over the field just ahead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving slowing coming out of the last curve at least a dozen vehicles were pulled over on either side of the highway with people in their vehicles watching a parallel set of 6 arched amber lights hovering off Hwy 13 about 200 feet over on the east side of Hwy 13.  The lights were just above and behind an abandoned filling station about 100 feet in the air.  No solid object was seen between the sets of lights even though a full moon was out on a clear night. No sounds or radio interference noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While still driving very slowly attempted to take a couple of photographs of the lights using an auto flash camera.  (*Film developed 9/17 was poor quality of the inside of vehicle with only one of the object&#39;s lights is seen through passenger window.)  Then the amber lights all blinked out at the same time.  Suddenly all of the parked vehicles began to drive away.  Nobody stopped to talk about this situation but listened to local talk radio show hoping somebody would call in sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Adams of the Missouri Investigators Group (UFOMIG.com) is investigating this report.

I slowed to a stop along side the road and watched it. It was a bright yellow ball with a comet tail that was bright red. It was close enough that I could see individual &#34;sparks&#34; coming off the tail. I immediately called 911 on my cell phone. It was heading from the north to the south at about a 15 degree downward angle and appeared to be on an approach path to Sarasota / Bradenton Airport. My work is immediatly behind the airport. I thought it was an aircraft coming in on fire. As I watched and spoke to the officer the tail got shorter and shorter until it was only the bright yellow ball. By this time it was directly in front of me on Tallevast Rd. At this point it appeared to stop moving. The yellow ball the split into 3 white lights in the shape of a perfect triangle. At this point I told the officer that he would think I was crazy and described to him what I saw. He told me that he had several other calls coming in reporting lights. The 3 lights then headed slowly away from me directly infront of me going east on Tallevast Rd. I followed Them for about 1.5 miles. The road was under construction and I could go no farther. I sat and watched the lights for 1 to 2 minutes until they gadually got too far away to see. I have seen the explanation that this was a Titan 4 launch but there is no way this is possible. I have seen other launches and they don&#39;t last as long or behave as in this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a public employee.  PD))<n>

This tail of smoke dissolved into the sky 10-15 seconds after the initial sighting.  The sphere stayed steady in the eastern sky for 5-10 seconds before it split into 3 seperate identical spheres of light.  These three spheres of light formed a perfect triangle and held the form of a triangle for close to 15 seconds.  The two left hand spheres quickly headed due east leaving small tails of smoke behind them and disappeared into the nigth sky.  The remaining sphere from the right slowly followed the other two to the east and kept in sight for around 30-45 seconds.  Suddenly the sphere disappeared for a second, came back into sight and quickly appeared to explode into the sky.  Total time of sighting: 2 minutes.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> large ufo -triangle shaped-three lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> September 9, 2003:  I was headed home from a friends house tonight in Tampa, Florida on 275 south heading in the eastern direction towards Brandon at 12:30 am eastern time, when a strange light in the sky caught my eye.  I took a second glance and noticed that it looked like nothing I have ever seen before in my life.  That’s when I got concerned and started to pay close attention to it’s details. It started off as a huge ball of light (almost blinding bright) with a rectangular shaped trial tapering off of it which fluctuated in length. It looked as if it had just taken off from somewhere to the west and was headed towards my direction and grew in size. Then this ball of light morphed into three separate lights forming the shape of a triangle which continued to flicker. All three of these lights had distinct coloration’s to them the main most radiant light at the front/top of the triangle was a pale yellow color, the light on the left was a pale red color, and the light to the right  was a greenish blue color.  The shape of the lights were in the form of an acute triangle and just floated with such grace. I turned off my radio and it made no sound. As these three lights got closer they stopped flickering and a from appeared around the lights. The shape was of a triangle craft with the top peak cut off almost in half. The body was a gray color with a gray blue paneling around it. By this time it was hovering over the tree line and was the size of one and a half football fields.  Then as soon as I got a good look at it the ship gradually disappeared, starting a the rear two dimmer lights which faded away like streaks in the sky as if it was traveling at great speeds. The main light gradually diminished in size and raised in the sky as if it took off towards the south east until it fully disappeared. Every thing about this unidentified object was so geometric and precise in it’s shape that it was breath taking. This sighting lasted for about three to five minutes and other motorists on the roads had pulled off to watch this s! trange appearance. Once I got home I called a friend of mine who lives in the Tampa area and told him about the sighting and he confirmed that some in his dorm told him five minutes before exactly what I had explained to him. So I defiantly know I was not the only person aware of this sighting in that area along with the other motorists on the road with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me assure you that I had always felt neutral on the subject of UFOs until what I experienced tonight. Now i am sure that they do exists.<n>

Both times have involved an object looking like a star, but moving across the sky and changing direction once or twice.  The 2nd sighting was also watched by my friend Dan, but i I dont remember the exact date on that one, it was around 3 weeks ago.  I am still at a loss since if they were satellites, they wouldnt change direction, and if they were planes, there&#39;d have at least been noise, or blinking, or something.  They always just fade away too, instead of continuing on their way.  Has anyone seen similar stuff lately?  Its almost becoming normal now to me to see this phenomena, whatever it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My window was rolled down.  I turned to look just as this brilliant green light entered the clouds to my east at maybe a mile away and 2000&#39; elevation.  The moon was bright through high haze, with lower level stagnant nimbostratus remnant clouds spaced by miles.  The surroundings were illuminated quite well, but the object lit up a considerable parcel of the cloud it went into in bright green light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object seemed to be going down into the cloud at a 15-degree angle.  A second after the light was gone it seemed like the object had gone down, judging from the angle of entry and speed.  It covered at least a mile in less than half a second - speed of sound speed, but there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Too, from the time I left Maple Valley, to the sighting, then to Enumclaw, I easily passed a dozen law enforcement officers from various jurisdictions.  Some were parked (singles and doubles), some driving (saw three in a row coming around one corner)- an alarming degree of activity for that confined stretch/area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife and I and two friends have witnessed these orange to amber balls of light (similar to a flare) on four separate trips (April 2002, Sept.2002, April 2003 and Sept.2003) We observed them always on a clear night, usually about 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon and having a range of motion. Sometimes stationary, sometimes moving in a horizontal path for a short duration. I am an ex-pilot and know aircraft movements, and aerial flare patterns, these lights were not aircraft related. Due to there frequency of occurance, I am thinking they are some type of atmospheric phenom., but noone has been able to explain them. The closest explanation I have come to is ball lightning, but they do not match the descriptions I&#39;ve read. These balls of light suddenly appear(like a flare) but there is no upward or downward movement, always horizontal. I have no way of telling how far out to sea they are or their actual size, but has an amateur astronomer, they have the appearance of apx. 3 to 4 diameters of Mars (as seen on 09/08/03). I have read in this register several observations similar to ours. I would appreciate it if someone could satisfy my curiousity about these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Multiple sightings.

I stopped to stretch and look at the stars sometime between 3:00 and 3:30 a.m. I believe. I was looking out toward the west (slightly south) above the ocean as we were staying in Lahaina. Suddenly one star flared brightly and decended. If I put my hand about a foot in front of my face and spread my index and thumb fingers apart I&#39;d say the object fell down about 4 1/2 inches. It then turned toward the left. The turn was a curved (not sharp) 90 degree turn. Also, the speed of both the fall and the turn was fairly constant. It was brightest at the bottom of the fall and during the turn. It then ascended straight up again and slowly faded in brightness to about the size of a star or satellite. It then proceeded on a straight course over my head and past the hotel behind me as if it were a normal satellite. While it passed over head I observed only a straight course with no turns and the speed stayed fairly constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve read other reports and comments by investigators about &#34;iridium&#34; satellite flashes. I&#39;d like to know exactly what those are in case that might be it. However, from my vantage point it clearly looked as if it &#34;fell&#34; into the atmosphere, veared off to the left, and then rose out of the atmosphere. I don&#39;t know of any commercial aircraft or even space craft that can currently do that, but wouldn&#39;t be surprised to know that our military might have something like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Iridium satellites do not turn during the short period of time that the sunlight glints off their solar panels, and is visible to witnesses in a small area on the ground.

It did not blink and did not leave any trails.  It was small and bright and at first I thought it was a plane.  It appeared to &#34;be right&#34; with the apparent height, brightness, and speed.  But it appeared to be going from S to N and so I thought it strange that I saw no blinking lights.  It then began to speed up.  (All of this took place in probably less than 90 degrees of sky and for the most part was at or below about 45 degrees.  I&#39;m no scientist or astronomer, but have made these guestimates by thinking back and &#34;slicing&#34; the sky into pie pieces.)  Within a few seconds of it speeding up to the point where I thought no plane could go that fast, be seen, and not make a noise, it began a gradual, then steep sloping pattern. By this time I had pulled into a parking lot to a gas station/store that was very busy.  I had also convinced myself that it must be a meteor.  The way it changed speeds still confounded me, but the sharp downward turn that was almost a straight decent down reminded me of a falling star.  I still saw no wavering of the light and as much as I tried to see lights blinking, there were none.  If I had to compare it&#39;s brightness to a star I would say Regulus, but smaller in size.  It then began to slow down as it decended.  It made a swooping turn very low in the sky and then went back the way it came at at slower rate than when I had first noticed it.  There were some trees very low down and to the left which made it hard to see it much beyond the point I had first noticed it.  Even though I had probably made a nuisance of myself by pulling in slowing to the parking lot and parking at the edge near the road, no one seemed to pay any heed to what I was looking at.  All of this probably lasted no longer than a minute.  I was in the store a couple minutes and while I was standing in line I looked at the clock at it said 8:00 exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> i wish to fix information that i screwed up.  i don&#39;t know what i was thinking when i posted it *sorry*  the date was actually 9/27/03 and since it was a few minutes before 8 i guess that would make the time actually 19:55?  i didn&#39;t know how else to fix it it but to use this form!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time above amended to 19:55 hrs.

I&#39;ve noticed on a slight foggy night about Mid August an unidentified white light glowing floating object-size of a blimp, just standing still over the New Jersey side of the Hudson River.  I assumed it was probably a blimp floating at night because in the day, blimps fly over my window advertising for Saturn, Fuji, etc-it stayed there for 1-2hours. I didn&#39;t pay much attention b/c i thought it was probably a blimp until I noticed the same object in a non-foggy night sky last night. I noticed the same object, behind the LaGuardia Aiport floating but smaller because it was farther away and higher. The lights on this thing was similar to the object seen over the New Jersey side of the Hudson, but the lights alternated from red to white in periods of 10seconds apart. It stayed in the air, moving slowly and standing still for about 1 hour.  The airport scheduled continued b/c the incoming airplanes were landing at the airport. There were city helicopters flying over the sky in other directions-with the police lights, but nothting bothered the object. The lights on this object differed in pattern blinking, size, and color than all the other lights on the other aircraft that was flying in the sky last night.

It was an aircraft traveling at a speed that was unbelievably fast.  Ten times faster than any jet we&#39;ve seen.  Also it had red and green lights that were very bright and visible.  It passed over us so fast.  Too dark so couldn&#39;t make out a shape.  How could we go about finding out what that was?  Is there such an aircraft?  Not sure what we saw.  Neither one of us is really a believer in UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it&#39;s a legitimate aircraft, how can we go about identifying it?  Oh, just remembered another detail.  At the time of this sighting we had the hot tub on which is kind of noisy.  When we sighted this object we heard no noise from it, which usually you could hear a jet over the hot tub motor.  We turned off the hot tub and still heard nothing.  Very strange and has made us wonder.  Please advise of a source to ID this and weather there&#39;s such a &#34;legitimate&#34; aircraft that fits this description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she seemed quite credible to us.  Because of the red and green lights the witnesses observed on the object, we strongly suspect that it might have been some type of terrestrial aircraft, although that is a guess.  PD))<n>

9/6/03 20:30|Carrabasset Valley|ME|Flash|15 min. +|Multiple flashing lights over a long period|9/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31299.html|432|ndxe200309| Multiple flashing lights over a long period<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of us were camping up in the Bigelow Preserve in Western Maine at Horn&#39;s pond campsite. At 7pm we decided to take the half mile hike up to North Horn to watch the sunset. After watching the sun go down i turned to look to the East for Mars. In the northeast a flash of light caught my eyes. It happenned several times an at first thought it may have been a firefly playing tricks with my eyes. Flashes got more frequent an we all began to see them. They appeared to be out in the distance 10-15 miles out against the shadows of the next ridgeline. The flashes were very bright alternating between blue/white and orange. The patterns were random. We at first were convinced they were explosions from military testing. We ruled that out knowing that the fire risk was to high for such activities. The lights most certainly were not planes or flares. The flashes varied slightly in intensity. The area we were watching was roughly in the area that the Appalachian Trail would be heading after it left the Bigelow Preserve, toward the Forks area of Maine. Among the flashes we could make out what appeared to be a red antenae like object that was not flashing but glowing. My two friends thought they also saw small objects in the sky being illuminated by the brighter flashes. After 15 minutes or so we were more than a little &#34;freaked out&#34; by what we were watching and decided to make the half mile descent back to camp. I know that this is pretty out there but it was a very clear night and all three of us watched for a good amount of time. I would love any info that anyone has abouth this phenomena. This whole experince has me considering another post about a daytime sighting that we had two weels earlier also in Western Maine. I&#39;ll get to that after I talk to the other observers. Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was definatly NOT a balloon.|12/19/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33732.html|433|ndxe200309| Hello Vike,  I have been reading in the paper about recent UFO??? sightings seen around Airdrie. I would like to tell you about what I saw back on September 6, 2003.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just arrived home after attending the Fall Classic Show &amp; Shine at the Nose Creek Park. It was 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I was looking out my livingroom window, which faces east. My home is situated (deleted) of the tracks, in (deleted by HBCC UFO). I noticed a white, completely perfect round sphere going in a  northerly direction. It was definatly NOT a balloon. There was no string attached and it was perfectly round, as balloons are not.  It stayed at a constant speed and was completely unaffected by wind currents. It may have been going about 30-50km./hr. It stayed at the exact same height. I watched it until it disappeared out of sight. I felt like it may have been following along main street, however it may not have been. It was also difficult to tell the size at that distance, but it may have been larger that a beach ball. I have never seen anything like it in my life. Has anyone else mentioned this to you? I would be curious to know if I was the only one who saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you,  Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n>

We were not all the way out to the ocean, and in the marsh heading out, and had stopped to see if we could get a bite, and the sun hit the Huge Silver Saucer, and for a few min. it just sit there, and then all of a sudden, it flew off to the South with NO Sound!   We think it was around 300-500 feet in the sky, and it was tilted towards us, and that was when we seen the sun bouncing off the Large Silver Saucer!  We did not see any lights, I guess because it was daylight.  We also saw a cigar shaped UFO just hanging in the sky, as we came down Business 17 South in Myrtle Beach,S.C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife saw a Large Bright light years ago, that chased her while on a date, on Fork Shoals Rd, in Greenville/Piedmont, S.C. in the fall of 1972.   She also saw another light that was following her, and she thought it was the police pulling her over, while drivin! g a large truck to pick up some gas lanterns in Georgetown,S.C.,  But her and the girl getting the Lanterns had just got something to eat in Florence,S.C., and she had just pulled out of a steak house around 8:00 PM, and when she started to pull over, the light just vanished, and that makes twice she has had a light to chase her!  I also saw some lights out over the Ocean while I was surf fishing, and there was about 4 of us out there on the beach, an the lights would split apart, and one would be one color, and  The large one that came on first was pale white, and closed like a lens closing, and it was about 3 ft, and two more came on. It looked like a swirl, and split off, and the people that was shooting fireworks, and these lights reacted to the fireworks.  I saw jets that looked like they came from Shaw AFB, that looked like F15-16, and they had missiles under them, and flew around, and returned to Shaw right after they were in the sky.   One light was in the East, and one i! n the south east. We would like to talk with you about these UFO&#39;S IF YOU WILL PLEASE CALL US SO WE CAN TELL YOU MORE!<n>

The discs then emitted bright beams of light roughly every ten seconds I thought to my self what are these things then I thought they may be extra terestrials. after roughly two minutes they sped of into the distance then gave blinding flash of life and dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know whether the witness implies a date of September 6th, or June 9th.

What caught my eye was i looked out living room window (on fourth floor of apartment building) and saw a round shape in the distance just sitting there - flashes of red, yellow, and green.  I woke my husband and asked him to look to so I was sure i was seeing what i was.  it looks like a spinning orb as the lights pass, however it is in distance.  My husband was passing it off as star clusters.  But as i sit here now and look at it - it still peeks my curiosity.  We live in flight pattern for newark airport- and i am used to seeing helicopetrs hover and plane lights - but never have i seen anything like this.sometimes the white is really bright and then fades- but its just hovering.  I wish someone could tell me what this is.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like the same speed as a shooting star. The light was bright, and green, the same green as in a regular plane, except that no noise could be heard and the light went off as the object was still in a visible distance. But despite a clear moon, once the light went off, I could not see the object at all. Again the whole occurence took less than 2 or 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The reasion I stoped and looked was becaue about 6 months ago I saw a light the exzact shape and color that was flying close to my house and acting very strage. I was watching this object and it just seemed to be moving around in maybe a circular pattern would be the best way to describe it but really no set path and then I saw it appear to drop stuff. The object its self is a bright orange ball. If you took like one of the lamps off a police chopper in the front but had a orange tint to it thats what this looks like and makes no sound. It was too high to be a chopper because my estemations it was at over 30,000 feet for over 5 min so it couldnt be a chopper because the air is too thin to run the engines that high. But it appeared to drop objects from the circle, the best way to describe it was it looked like slag (the hot pieces of metal that come off from welding) was falling off of it. It did that about 3 times then it dissapeared for about 30 sec to a minute then it came back droped another piece of slag then it dissapeared for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume the witness means a date of September 5th, not 6th.  We have amended the date above.  We believe that the witnesses may have been observing Mars.  PD))<n>

I was watching television at 11:30 p.m. when I observed a glowing, emerald green object moving incredibly fast from east to west, before moving out of sight over Vashon Island.  The object was quite large, approximately the same size as a commercial jet.  It was rectilinear with a triangular point facing west and two oblong &#34;wings&#34; at each end of the rectangle.  Another curious fact is that there was no sound associated with the movement of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/5/03 22:00|Calaveras Big Trees|CA|Light|20 minutes|A ball of light followed us out of a pitch black forest and hovered in the bed of our truck for 10 seconds|3/28/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35789.html|441|ndxe200309| A ball of light followed us out of a pitch black forest and hovered in the bed of our truck for 10 seconds<n> <n><n> <n><n> WE started to drive out of our campsite in complete darkness when we noticed that the tops of 3 or 4 100ft tall trees where being illuminated by a bright light with no full moon or any artificial lights around anywhere.There are thousands of these huge trees arond the forest but only the tops of these 4 were lit up .We stopped for a few minutes,turned off our lights and wondered how this was possible with nothing above the trees. The light stayed. We drove away down a dirt road out to the main highway. About 2 miles down the road we saw in the rearview mirror a circular ball of light. I figured it was a car but when we turned around the ball of light was hovering in the bed of our truck. We stopped immediately.The ball of light was about a soccerball size and it hovered in a short circular motion about 2 ft.above the bed of the truck for about ten seconds. Then it stopped it&#39;s short circular motion, froze for about 2 seconds and then darted away. This location is far from any artificial light source such as street lights and there were no cars behind or in front of us.I am fully convinced that the light that was lighting up the tops of the trees was of the same light source that followed us down the dark highway because when we returned to the campsite out of curiosity there was no light anywhere,including the light that was lighting the tops of the 100 ft. tall trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

WHEN I LOOKED I SAW AN ENORMOUS V SHAPE OBJECT SWOOPING DOWN ALMOST TOWARDS US.  I YELD AT MY WIFE TO LOOK!  SHE AND MY SON WATCHED IN TOTAL SHOCK.  THE OBJECT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD, AND HAD NO SOUND WHATSOEVER, IT MADE A 45 DEGREE TURN EASTWARD WITH NO LIGHTS ON. IT LOOKED BLACK IN COLOR,BUT IT GLITTERED TO THE CITY LIGHTS.  IT DECENDED EASTWARD UNTIL IT TOTALLY DISAPPEARD.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were a little brighter than a regular plane but I had written it off as being a low flying plane.  Within the first few seconds they grew to be as bright as a set of headlights.  Whenever I looked up from the game I could see that they were still there and they had turned slightly and had a bright gree light behind it and every once in a while a light would randomly blink.  I could tell the intensity of the lights because the street lights of the library just above the field were very dull compared to the set above.  The lights disappeared three minutes later and then they reappeared and disappeard for about another half hour.  A friend of mine also saw the lights right before they disappeared.  I was just wondering if anyone else in Northwest Reno had seen something similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was as high as the clouds and totally white in color.  There was a line down the middle.  I could see no windows.  The object was going as fast as a plane.  It flew through a cloud and came out the other side.  There were no markings.  The object was smooth. It was flying away from me, I guess that would be in the direction of west, since I saw it outside of my drivers window.  There were other cars on the interstate, and I wondered how many others noticed this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was completely clear and blue.  I noticed a very bright light brighter than a star at night to the left.  At first, I dismissed it and continued to watch the road.  Then I realized that that was not normal.  There were no stars in the sky, and it was so bright.  I looked back up to where I saw it and it was gone.  I kept watching the sky now, and then I saw it reappear on the right side of the highway.  It didn&#39;t move.  It just shone for a minute or so and then faded away.  I&#39;d keep watching and it would reappear in a different spot but in the same general vicinity, with the exception of going to the left side of the highway twice.  This happened about five or six times.  The strangest thing about it was that it was so bright and that it didn&#39;t move.  It was stationary until it would fade and reappear somewhere else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were a sort of rusty/copper colour that glowed. they were flying where birds fly (as opposed to aeroplanes) and were very small, about an arms stretch in length. They were very like a saucer shape with a sphere in the middle but much more oval (more like a horizontal eye shape!). the middle one was rocking between the other two as they flew over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> their were four of us that saw them all of us musicians and in our middle age, I am an avid believer but two of them were a little skeptical before, they are not know!<n>

No idea as to height or distance from objects. The objects appeared to be the same size as Mars in the night sky but without the glare. The objects when first observed trapezoid with a craft at each corner during the observation, rear two objects seem to accelerate into the front two seemingly touching. The craft made absolutely no noise during the whole experience. Which was in stark contrast to a helicopter which appeared within 2mins of the objects disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/4/03 22:15|Oak Grove|MO|Light|5 minutes|I was standing with my sister in her driveway when we saw what looked like an airplane with its landing lights on comming towards us fr|12/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33619.html|451|ndxe200309| I was standing with my sister in her driveway when we saw what looked like an airplane with its landing lights on comming towards us from the east. The light was moving at medium speed and at a lower level than other planes that fly over her house.  Her house is not near any airports so it was unusual to see a light this low in the sky.  As the light drew nearer we did not hear any engine sounds nor did we see any other lights (like the blinking navigation lights on planes). As the light passed over our heads we still could not hear any engine noise or see any outline of a plane.  As the light moved away it didnot dim as you would expect if the lights were on the front of a plane that is now heading away from you.  I live in Omaha,NE and have seen a lot of planes with their landing lights on comming in for a landing at Epply Airfield and you can always hear the engine and see the plane as it passes over you .  The sky was clear with no wind so we should have been able to hear it and see the body if this had been a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;m not sure about the direction but as I turned onto Shoto road it(the light) was on my left. I live on Shoto road about a half mile from where I saw the u.f.o. It was a constant light with no blinking lights or anything of that sort. I actually pulled over on Shoto road to watchas I was a little bewildered. There was a high flying plane in the same direction as the u.f.o. I could see the two crafts out my left window as I pulled over. On the plane I could make out the two flashing wing lights, but the u.f.o. was a constant white light. I watched it above the tree line for about 3 to 4 minutes then it seemed to disapear, only to reapear not far away. I lost sight of it so I turned around and followed shoto down to Q(not old Q). I turned onto highway Q but couldn&#39;t find it again. The craft moved at a constant speed never speeding up or slowing down. I&#39;m interested to see if the pilot in this area reports it. I&#39;m not easily excited and I&#39;m also not a u.f.o. buff or necessarily interested in the paranormal. I hope to find other witnesses to confirm my sighting, although it was very short, it left a lasting impression on me! There were no clouds at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The first two flashes were brighter than any star in the sky, and approached the brightness of Mars in the eastern sky.  The object covered approximately 10-15 degrees of sky in about a minute, before the flashes, which grew steadily fainter over time, became invisible to the naked eye.  The time between the flashes was several seconds, and occurred at irregular intervals.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Location was in Forestville CA, in the eastern sky. We were talking about what we saw to my friends husband , when we saw another light in the sky, also in the east. This one was a white light. The light  was bigger than a helicopter or an airplane light. The planet mars was in the sky to the far right. In comparison to size the green ball and the white light was double the size to mars. The ball was traveling south. Movement was slower than a shooting star. The white light was moving very slow. Location was just to the left of where the ball was, it went left, then seemed to go up real slow, then looked like it was either moving in a west direction or east. Then it went straight up very fast, and then stopped, then it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object entered the atmosphere as a large ball of light (fire?) with a long tail that turned green as it moved rapidly across the horizon from west to east.  It appeared to be in close proximity to northwestern usa.  I don&#39;t believe the whole object burned-up before impact which I propose is somewhere within a couple hundred miles of 95338 (Mariposa,CA).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have seen meteor showers in the past which look distant and rather small.  This object looked like it was as close as an airplane would be.  It was about the size of a walnut at that distance.  It was a bright light with an orange glowing tail.  It seemed to be moving across the horizon and downward and appeared for only for 1 to 2 seconds.  I know this must be a meteor, but I don&#39;t understand how it could have been so large and appeared so close.  I was startled by this sight, as I was riding as a passenger in a car driving down Ralston Ave. at approx 8 to 8:30 pm in Belmont, CA.  The driver of the car also witnessed the event.  I could not find any information on any meteors appearing in the local news today.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We immediately saw a bright circular object moving at a high rate of speed from the sky towards the ground (best guess is that the object was 2-3 miles away, headed towards the Mt. Diablo State Park area at a 45 degree angle).  Object appeared as a very bright green circle of light surrounding a relatively dim red light, made no sound, and disappeared after only five seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We have viewed the photograph, provided by the witness, and it shows a bright, yellow object, suspended above a cloud of mist rising off a still pond.  The object is also reflected off the surface of the pond, so we suspect it is not the result of a lens flare.  We do not know what the object is, but it does not look to be larger in width than a meter, and we suspect it is not a bona fide UFO.  PD))<n>

I hope someone else saw some of this too. I arrived home at approx. 3:15 in the morning on sept. 4. as I was walking toward the house from the back alley/driveway I noticed what appeared to be a sattelite moving slowly from southeast to northwest. I didn&#39;t think much of it, other than it was quite bright, and seemed a bit low in the sky. It also was a tiny bit orange-ish in color which I thought was odd, but it was partly cloudy so I thought it may be just something to do with the atmosphere. Then I noticed the strange part. Moving at the same speed, and in the same direction, were three faint blue triangles of lights, all about a hands legnth(to the eye) apart from each other. They were each about the size of my thumb across, which seems quite large for how high they appeared to be. I immediately ran in the house and grabbed my video camera. I came back out to film the objects(which were moving very slow) but the darkness of the sky, and the lightness of the city made it impossible to see anything on my viewfinder, so I was unable to get any footage. The objects slowly moved out of veiw to the northeast. I also saw probably five to ten shooting stars, but I doubt if they were related in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was trailed by a greenish white burning tail with what appeared to be distinctive flames. It didn&#39;t look to be a typical &#34;shooting star&#34; as it was moving much slower than others I have seen and it appeared to be rather close in relation to &#34;shooting stars&#34; that I&#39;ve seen in the past. Same object was also witnessed by a citizen in another part of the county who reported it to the Sheriff&#39;s Department.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see report from Missouri for the same time and date.

I was looking towards the Northwest when I saw the object when It was a bright green light shaped like an oval,  moving from left to right. the Object didn&#39;t emit any sound.   I couldn&#39;t see it clearly because a big oak tree was blocking my view.   It was moving at a moderate pace, and appeared to be at least 150 feet up in the air.  I was standing about 300 feet.  It was it the sky at about a 70 degree angle from the ground, and it was gaining altitude.  Then suddenly I saw sparks emitting from the bright green object and it lost altitudes, and disappeared behind the hill/herizon. I heard dogs barking like crazy after I regain my composure, and could focus all of my senses.  I have seen UFO&#39;s before, but I was 10 the first time, and 18 the second time.  I am 25 years old.  and this is my first report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> It really didn&#39;t go in a 90&#39; degree angle  I believe I said it was  a 70 degree angle when I saw it.  It climbed gradually from an 75 degree then to an 80 degree, then it gradually lost degrees,  that is when I saw the sparks.  Then it disappeared behind the hill.  I thought it might have crashed but I didn&#39;t hear any noise.   The next day, my neighbor and I took a walk in the woods behind her house, but we think it may have landed or went over the neighbors property.  I also forgot to tell you about the size.  I would say it was  double the size of the north star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see report from Illinois for the same time and date.  PD))<n>

We were talking and we both stopped and said &#34;Oh my Gosh!&#34; We couldn&#39;t believe what we were seeing!! There was two incredibly bright red lights coming from the north and what stopped us in our conversation was that first they were incredibly bright and red and they were flying too weirdly together... At first they flew side by side and then they just kind of stopped.  One kind of back-tracked a bit and that&#39;s when I really couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing! One of the bright red lights just kind of lowered and then fell straight down.  Then the other seemed to stay there for a second and then it also fell straight down.. We couldn&#39;t believe what we were seeing.. I didn&#39;t want to move &#39;cause I tought I would miss something and we were afraid that if we went inside to go and get a camera or binoculars or anything to see it closer that we would miss something. But it was over before either of us could do anything.. He went back inside and I was facinated by what I had saw. I have never in my life seen anything like this before and neither has he... I heard sirens later and we saw smoke.. So we went to investigate.. It was near I-20 and it was a trailer house that was totally engulfed in flames.  It was right about where we saw the lights go down.. It was around 12:45 am and there was over 5 fire trucks trying to put out the fire.  I drove by it today and it was rubbles.. I figure if it was from the lights, that maybe there would have been an investigation? I know if we saw them someone else had to of seen the lights too.. Anyhow.. It was an amazing experience and I will never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed two objects in the sky near the horizon line. Both appeared to be stationary at first. I thought they were just two planes in the distance, but then thought they were choppers cause they weren&#39;t moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when the lights struck me as odd, they didn&#39;t blink on and off like on most planes and helicopters. They sort of pulsed from dim to bright like the rythm of a heart beat. And there were a lot more lights on these things than I&#39;ve ever seen on a plane. I asked my brother to come out and take a look, that&#39;s when they started to finally move. One stayed stationary just above the horizon and the other began an upward climb, but it didn&#39;t just go straight up. It curved on an arching path up and over the stationary one. I would put money on it being a perfect half circle of motion with the stable craft at the circle&#39;s center. After it completed it&#39;s trip up and over it started to move in our direction. At this point everyone in my house was on the deck watching. It moved real smooth like it was just gliding across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all dead silent, just watching this thing coast toward us. We all swear that it didn&#39;t make a sound, I mean nothing. No rotor blades chopping through the air, no propeller sound, not even an engine- just dead quiet. and it just kept going, this thing flew right over my building and we watched it go. The one that had been stationary now started to move off towards the north-east and it glided silently as well, right on out of sight. My family has military background, and I&#39;ve spent my fair share of time on the flight line, and I have never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the lights on it pulsed and changed color, there was no sound coming from it, and it flew smoother than a falcon catching an updraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Also the flight path was straight not curving like when meteors enter the atmosphere and start to fall. There were no sparks from friction. I estimate this object to be flying about 1500-3000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lost sight of it when some hills got between us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was one witness to this event which took place on September 3, 2003 at approx: 11:10 p.m. A lady had been outside and was making her way back into their home when she happened to glance up and saw a huge cylinder shaped craft flying very quickly, she claims it was really low. This witness told me that even with it being dark out, you couldn&#39;t miss seeing it. It was larger than any aircraft that she knew of, looking at it length wise. She said there were a large number of bright white lights on it. Her thoughts were maybe these were windows and they were running down the full length of the object. There were no wings noticed on the craft and when I asked more questions, she said it actually reminded her of a long tube. No sound was heard and the sighting lasted for approx: 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the sighting her boyfriend was inside their home and he reported to his girlfriend that their cat went nuts when the object passed by.

I also had a small fire that I was tending to nearby, the remnants of an old tree that had fallen days earlier.  I was looking at the northwestern sky, noting that it was remarkably clear this evening.  I began to trace out the constellations of Hercules and Corona Borealis, when I noticed that within the adjacent constellation of Draco three previously motionless objects, that I had assumed where stars, began to spread apart in the sky!  These objects resembled stars in relative size, magnitude, and color; however, they spread apart, briefly, and began to travel in tandem across the sky!  I watched them travel across the sky in a triangular pattern until the three objects grew faint and disappeared.  I have seen satellites in orbit, they move faster across the sky.  I have never seen a satellite orbiting close to another.  Certainly, they would not grow faint and disappear.  I have seen high flying planes in the sky, as I live near an airport, however, I have never seen them fly this high or this close, nor did I see more than one light on any of these flying objects.  Their flight lasted 20-30 seconds by my best judgment, I knew immediately that I had seen something extraordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether  the witness may have observed the three satellites, which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy &#34;NOSS&#34; system.   However, those satellites remain in the same apparent formation, and do not spread apart.  Hence, if, in fact, they moved, relative to one another, they probably were not satellites.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

Also, moving directly South is an unlikely path for a sattelite, much less a formation of 5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, it was not moving in the direction of the V, it appeared to be moving sideways.

Some stars were beginning to appear in night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bright light caught the corner of my eye. It was in the North, maybe 2 miles from me, higher and larger than a helicopter could be but lower than any planes would fly in that area. It really just looked like a bright shinning blob. It was moving very slowly upward and away from me. I looked at it at least 20 seconds. Then it flew away FAST heading North and sligthly upward, getting smaller very quickly and finally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really can&#39;t explain it. Sometimes you think &#34;gee was that a UFO?&#34; but there is logic that brings on doubt. This one has no logic.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I felt as though we were being watched so I said we needed towalk back to our room which wass 30 min away. The object we observed then turned and flew silently over the lowland country of South Carolina. When we saw it fromthe side it appeared tiangular with a white light in each corner. A red light seemed to blink alternately from top to bottom. I estimmate we probably a mile away from this object and it was around a half mile above the ground. After it dissapeared over the horizen we wittnessed a dozen shooting meteors in the shy.

The wife was alerted to it first, then called her husband to come and watch. They told me that lights would be seen running around the outside of the object, but it was hard to make out the actual shape of the craft. More round in shape they guessed. As the object was very close to their location, they said not a sound was heard coming from it. As they observed the object, it did move along the top of the mountain for approx: a kilometer. It stopped and dropped down behind the mountain rather quickly. That was the last time they saw the object that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The on September 3, 2003 at approx: 11:45 p.m. the same object showed up over the mountain, but more towards the south. This time the object did not move in any direction and was observed for approx: 6 to 8 seconds before it dropped out of sight. Again no sound was heard, and the object, or light coming from it was extremely bright. Both of the witnessed said they have never witnessed anything like it before, and was really surprised to see this strange object which they have no explanation for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Note: This was certainly not a star, or Mars. The second date of the sighting the object was a good height off the top ridge of the mountain, and if a star it would have taken sometime to drop down and out of sight. Also I asked the local helicopter businesses to see if they had any flying in the area at the time of this sighting. There was none flying at that time. Everything was shut down before dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witnesses for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

The object was a dull silver and kind of triangular, but it had very soft angles.  What made me realize it was not an airplane was it&#39;s movement.  It flew in a about a 60 degree angle to the right and smoothly changed directions, flying in a 180 degree angle to the left, then a 90 degree angle (vertically).

As the red object became brighter, whit light pulsations were seen.  These pulsations may have been the result of its passage through clouds, estimated at some 5,000 ft.   The object was preceeded by a much smaller red object in front of it, maintaining the same degree of separation for the duration.  The objects eventually disappeared behind buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting was very similar to that reported by us on 31 August, although in a different quadrant of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired oil company executive, and my wife, who also witnessed this, is a business administrator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report was, indeed, submitted from an e-address in Mexico.

It appeared to be very high in the sky; my guess would be about 30,000 feet. It was about 45 degrees from the horizon. I was playing tennis at the time and pointed it out to my companion, who also saw it. I would say it was about twice the size of an airplane. An airplane flew went right by it, so that&#39;s how I gauged the size. From my point of view, the plane flew right below it. (The plane, by the way, was leaving a chem trail.) The object didn&#39;t move for the time I was out there, which was about 30 more minutes. After I finished playing tennis, I went inside (I live right by the tennis court), got a little telescope and looked at it. Only now it was dark and it was glowing. It could have been glowing the whole time, but in the daylight it looked metallic. In the telescope, you could see the round shape, which rules out a bright star. All I saw was a white sphere; no details. OK, at this point, I was thinking, is this a real UFO? Before I though it might be a weather balloon, except I would think a balloon would move with the wind. It was in the equatorial plain, so I wanted to rule out Venus or some other bright planet, so I went back inside to check. There were no bright planets in that part of the sky at that time. So, after I ruled that out, which took a few minutes, I went back outside, but now the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The area I live in is very quiet, so it was unusual to hear an airplane, especially one loud enough to wake me up.  I went to the window to look outside (my bedroom faces west) and I saw a bright light in the sky.  It seemed too large to be a star and it wasn&#39;t moving like an airplane.  Instead, it stayed stationary.  As I watched it, I noticed that the light would be bright one moment, then it would be gone, then it would be bright again and then it would be gone.  I watched for about 10 minutes with the light pulsing on and off until it finally disappeared. The time between the light appearing and disappearing was probably around 5 or 10 seconds.  Since that morning, I have looked in the sky each night to determine if it was a plane or a helicopter that I saw.  The planes I&#39;ve watched since then don&#39;t stay stationary that long and they fly across the sky along a particular route.  I don&#39;t know how long helicopters can remain stationary, but the object I saw seemed too high in the sky to be a helicopter.  I have also checked to see if there are other lights in the same area that I may have misinterpreted for this object, but all of the lights that I have seen (from houses and buildings)are much lower in the sky than the object I saw. I also thought that clouds could have intermittently covered the object and made it appear that the object was flashing on and off, but I believe the skies were clear that morning.  Because I haven&#39;t seen anything in the sky like this before, I thought I would report this to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From their deck they watched it for a period of time. The light disappeared in front of them. Now later that night, or in the wee hours of the morning the lady woke up as she could not sleep, went to the sliding windows which leads onto their deck and looked out. Again a bright green light was witnessed. Not in the same location it was seen earlier that evening. She then woke her husband up and he looked and he thought it may have been a satellite.

I grabed a pair of binoculors and it was so far off that I could only see the lights flashing and changing. I could not see a shape. I thought it was a star - but I noticed that the other stars were not flashing or changing light texture. I sat down and watched through the binoculors, it barley moved (or it was me shaking the binoc&#39;s). At some points it would flash rapidly and then slow way down, seem to growlarger then back off, all the while the lights flashed blue, red, and amber(or white.

I have been a star gazer my whole life and ive seen many satelites and shooting stars and many airplanes fly across the night sky,I worked for a major airline for five years so I am very familar with planes and how fast they move across the sky and these lights were not any airplane Know of, In fact they seemed to move three to four times as fast as a plane crusing at 40,000 feet. It couldnt have been more than five minutes, and they crossed the entire sky twice. The lights appeared to be the same size as an average star and if I had to guess at the elevation I would say they were as high as our satelites. there were no sounds emmiting from them, and if a jet flys over here I always heere them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We noticed two flashes in the area of the jet.  A few moments later, Debi, trying so look at the jet through binoculars, accidentally spotted an object following it.  It looked like a sphere made up of oval lobes.  For a few minutes it followed the jet, then it changed to an easterly course.  She followed it into the east, when she lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, ((name deleted)) contacted the nearby Medford International Airport, to see if they had noticed anything following the jet.  They took her name and number, saying they would get back to her, which they never did.  Later we called and left a phone message for MUFON, but we never heard anything back from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few months prior to witnessing this orb, our 12 year old granddaughter, who was living with us at the time, sold us she had a dream that she was taken out through the  cieling of her room.  She thought it was just a dream, but the nest day we saw a group of perfectly round bruises on the area of her  back near her coccx. She did not remember any play or other activity which could have caused such uniform, round bruises. We took her to her doctor, but he was unable to identify any possible cause. He and his colleagues had never seen anyhting like them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few weeks later, my wife had a similar dream.  I think she needs to share it with someone.  She was taken through the ceiling into a bright, oval room.  She was on a metallic table, and a device emerged from the ceiling.  Three bright beams of light came from it, focussing on her stomach.  Then, she awoke back in our home, on her bed.  After she shared her dream with me, I noticed a large deep bruise on the right side of her naval, with three hole-marks in a triangular shape. This made us wonder if it was a dream, or did it really happen?  I am a psychologist and I do testing for the State of Oregon, and my wife is an intelligent, mature woman.  We are not given to wild imagination or conspiracy theories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have reason to believe that aliens have been abducting other members of her family, including her mother, a sister and at least one brother (who won&#39;t speak about it).  If anybody would like to know more details, we would like to share them.<n>

As I glanced up to see what planets were visible, I noticed 3 brite lights running parallel to us at about 500-1000ft high ( the height a Ultra-lite plane would fly ) and about 1/2 mile to my right. There was 1 large brite light, and 2 smaller less intense lights running a crude triangle formation. After what seemed a couple minutes all 3 lights merged together, and continued on as 1 brite light. At that point I stammered to my wife to pull over, she asked why, and I looked at her and told her what Id seen. She looked out the windsheild, and replyed she didnt see anything. I told her It was too the southeast and looked back out my side window. Being distracted for a couple seconds I lost site of the light, and never saw a trace of It the remaining way home.

The object appeared as a bright light stationary in the sky for around 1 minute.  I immediately grabbed my 7X50 binoculars to get a better look at the object.  The object then faded to a very dim light and proceeded at a high rate of speed in a northerly direction.  There was no sound and the object appeared to be at an extremely high altitude at all times.  I lost track of the object as it passed over the mountains north of my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked out of the car. My sister and brother were asleep. My mother was busy reading a map. My dad was driving. We were on our way to Stockton for vacation. I gazed up at the sky. It was about late at night. I saw lights high up in the sky. I said to my dad, &#34;Look up!&#34; He wouldn&#39;t believe me. I didn&#39;t even ask my mother because I knew that she wouldn&#39;t believe me either. I couldn&#39;t see the shape of the objects. When the car began to turn right, the light flashed on the objects. I saw the figure. It looked like a frisbee. Suddenly, the objects flashed beams. I was blinded for a while. AFter gaining my sense of sight, I tried to find it but couldn&#39;t. I asked my dad if he was blinded by the UFOs&#39; beams. My dad told me that joking was bad and that if aliens really were around the earth, people would be scared not joking about it. It was as if it disappeared. Even the gigantic ring that was around the seven crafts disappeared. I touched the window trying to open. I felt electricity crackling inside my body.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He was watching an obect in the sky, but no one else was paying attention to him.  then he described it as a UFO.  I looked up to spot it, but couldn&#39;t.  Then a plane passed and he was trying to spot it with someone else and said, &#34;there, to the right of the plane&#34;.  At that point, I was able to spot the point of light he was referring to.  I would describe the color as brilliant pink.  TA first I was skeptical and thought that possibly it was a child&#39;s baloon because of the color.  But since it was stationary, I soon felt that it wasn&#39;t a baloon.  I continued interacting with people at the party and would occasionallylook up at the object.  It was so small, that it was very difficult to locate.  Time and time again, as I spotted it, it seemed very high and stationary.  afterabout ten minutes from the first time I spotted it, I could not see it any longer.  It was deifnitely not like any other object I had seen in the sky before.<n>

I&#39;m not the hysterical type, but what I saw while parked on the damn Wal-Mart parking lot (of all places) gave me the creeps. I&#39;m sitting and waiting in the car while the wife shops. I was just looking toward the front entrance of the store when a glint caught my eye. I thought I saw something bouncing around next to a passenger jet flying in low. (we&#39;re not far from BWI airport) I rubbed my eyes, because I figured I was seeing a glare or something. NOPE. Upon looking back up, there were now three shiny spheres- just circling and following the aircraft until it was almost out of sight. Then- another plane was coming in low and they were back! Unreal!! These things were NOT balloons or anything like that. I&#39;m not a drinker or a drug user and my eyesight is 20/20. It went on so long that my wife came walking out and I had time to show her. She freaked. She won&#39;t speak of it. Before they left, I asked a woman who was loading groceries if she saw what I saw. Her reaction was to turn and say &#34;Good Lord!!&#34;. She split in a hurry. Here&#39;s something strange: We can&#39;t for the life of us nail down the date we saw them. No, we weren&#39;t abducted! It&#39;s just weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD))<n>

It seemed as though it were not a big deal since no one else seemed to be looking and it was the second time within a month that I had seen it.  I just assumed I&#39;d hear an explanation on the news or something.  I&#39;m going to keep my eyes peeled from now on and keep a video recorder handy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

9/1/03 14:00|Springfield|VA|Teardrop|2 minutes|Two "jellyfish" shaped UFOs floating above skies of Springfield, VA.|3/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35252.html|502|ndxe200309| Two &#34;jellyfish&#34; shaped UFOs floating above skies of Springfield, VA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Late summer of 2003, one afternoon, my wife and I were traveling east on Franconia Springfield Parkway, Springfield, VA. Just pass the Springfield Metro (subway station) and at about 11:00 O&#39;clock position, my wife noticed two strange cloud-like formations in the sky. She pointed these objects out to me and they were very noticeable, being that the sky was rather clear and blue. At first I thought they were hot air balloons but then I noticed that they were like vapor clouds, and somewhat thick in consistency since both were casting a shadow. The shape of these UFOs were identical to each other, their tops were circular in shape, as domes, and both had &#34;trails&#34; at their base, similar to tentacles from a jellyfish. They did not seem to move from their positions, static as they floated above. I do recall thinking that they may have been the results of an aircraft &#34;aerial backfires&#34; (if there is such a thing) spewing vaporous balls of smoky, oily residue. No sounds were emitted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More info at this site: http://((URL deleted))<n>

While I observed with my neighbor the two grey colored craft flying together with several hundred yards separation but in definite formation one slightly higher and in front of the other, I noticed a (blurry) pinkish orange object below the other two in apparent formation with the slightly larger and more defined grey colored craft above it.  The three objects moved at a constant speed in constant formation to the south and no exsaust trails or sounds where heard. No anti collision lights where seen and no markings could be seen. From my view the objects where smaller and slower than airliners and there was a brief discusion as to the close proximity of the craft, that they could not have been airliners. My neighbor thinks they might have been military aircraft but I do not agree. I was in Navy aviation for many years and am highly trained in observations and understand aviation and air traffic. As the 3 objects moved out of vision to the south horizon, the sun light from the east brilliantly refected off all 3 objects and they looked like 3 bright stars as they faided out of my view. It would be interesting to check into radar logs to see if they corespond.<n>

Color was fairly rich, drawing my attention. I thought it was mars and tried to photograph with digital cam-photos show tiny blurry red shape-cam not best for astro-photography. Thought nothing of it til I heard on CNN about other people seeing same light.Light did not move or blink-acted like planet/star, so thats probably what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/1/03 01:50|La Mesa|CA||Less than 2 minutes|It wasn't what I saw, but what I heard.   low whiring sound directly over my home, but it caused no rumbling of my wind|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31143.html|505|ndxe200309| It wasn&#39;t what I saw, but what I heard.   low whiring sound directly over my home, but it caused no rumbling of my wind<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between 1 am and 2 am was a strange occurence over my home.  It wasn&#39;t something I saw, but it was more of what I heard.  I am accustomed to hearing Life Flight over my house and I am also familiar with a small frieght train that passes at around 2 am a couple of times a week through our neighborhood.  However, last night there was a strange sound I have not heard before.  First there was a white light that shown through my bedroom window which cause me to turn my head.  It quickly went out, but was followed by a low whiring sound almost like a steam roller.  It wasn&#39;t the local train because it didn&#39;t fade in and out and there was no train whistle.  This sound was constant and loud similar to the Life flight, but there was no rattling of our windows as is the case when helicopers fly overhead.  In the morning, a neighbor confirmed the same unusual noise and had come to the same conclusion as myself that this was not the normal noises we encounter regularly.  I have not been much into UFO sitings, but this was too strange.  I thought it might be of interest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

The campground is on the south side of Mt. Rainier. At approx. 12:30-12:45 AM we were laying down in our tent looking at satellites and stars. Our tent is mostly clear, see-thru netting. A very, bright large point of light flashed on for perhaps 1 second or less and then faded. It appeared to be white with a tinge of yellow. It happened at least 8 more times or so at approx. 1 - 2 minute irregular intervals. The event took place in approx. the East to SE sky (relative to us) and approx. 70 - 80 degrees off the horizon. The light appeared each time in the approx. same area. We had tree outlines for reference. The light would &#34;blink&#34; on and then seem to do a quick &#34;fade&#34;. Our last sighting was of the light turning &#34;on&#34; but much dimmer this time and approx. 2 -3 degrees to the approx. south of the original clusters. Sky conditions were clear with scattered thin cirrus. No moon. No northern lights. Mars was way, way to the SW from our sighting. I assumed that it was perhaps a satellite using thrusters to change orbit, but reading now that there were several similar sightings in Washington State just recently, has me wondering.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
