We saw what appeared to be a tumbling star traveling in a random zig zag patter. It wasn&#39;t until I came upon this site and read another observation in Troy, NY, with the exact description of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They pinpointed the date and in retrospect, even though I was only 9 years old, this date is probably when it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suspect it may have been another Russian Satellite that was out of control and tumbling in a free fall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was not yet ten.  It was dark out so it had to be past 9 pm.  Our Uncle was sitting outside on a swing and a bunch of us kids were hanging out talking to our Uncle... a very traditional man.  He was looking up at the sky.  And he remarked...now that is strange.  He pointed out to us a light high in the sky (like 12 or 11 o&#39;clock) near a cluster of stars.  We all watched it for quite a while and we all saw it.  It looked like a star but it moved.  What was interesting was my Uncle&#39;s comment.  It had to be after the launch of Sputnik. Because our Uncle  was aware of how a satellite would move in a path across.  I remember him articulating: a satellite would be a light that would move across the sky in a non-veering path.  But this light zig zagged and stopped.  Then it would move again and stop. Move again in what appeared to be an un-organized pattern.nothing like a satellite.  Anyway.! ..I think about that sighting often. Our Uncle took the time to make sure each one of us was able to find it in the sky and we all watched it for at least 15minutes when it suddenly streaked across the sky and disappeared.  I remember when the light suddenly zipped and disappeared there was an audible &#34;wow&#34; from all of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is the only time in my life I have seen something unexplained in the sky.  I was not alone.  My sister and cousins and Uncle were all there<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We looked up and a very large saucer with no lights on, it&#39;s surface was black, not shiny, very black metal looking,  it was hovering at at just above roof high, it didn&#39;t make any noise, nor did the pool water move. It had windows on the bottom in a circle.  I saw nothing through the windows.  It hovered for about 3 to 5 minutes, then went straight up in the sky slowly.  I could only see the saucer because it blocked out the sky and stars. Then it stopped high up and put on its lights, which looked like the stars so it blended with the sky , then it took off so fast that it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

8/1/59 18:00|Golden|TX|Disk|3 seconds|children see flying saucer in small East Texas town|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49768.html|8|ndxe195908| children see flying saucer in small East Texas town<n> <n><n> <n><n> The day and the year of this sighting is a guess.  At the time of the sighting, I am guessing my age to be eight or nine years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My nephew and I were outside in front of my home at dusk. We were lying in the grass beside the road.  We would jump up as a car drove by and attempt to scare the drivers.  We were children and weren&#39;t being watched closely!  While waiting for the next car, a &#34;flying saucer&#34; slipped from NNE to SSW at tree top level.  I can still see that saucer clearly in my mind after all these years.  It made no sound.  It made a Z movement as it slipped through the air. That Z movement impressed me, because in 1995 when I saw my second UFO, it made that same Z movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My nephew was no younger than two but probably not yet four when we saw the saucer.  He remembers it. He had to be old enough to talk, because when we saw it, we turned to each other and yelled, &#34;UFO&#34;!  We also had to have heard &#34;UFO&#34; on the television or radio for us to know that term!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran into the house, but neither of us remember what happened after that and there is no one left alive who could tell us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only difference in our memory of this sighting is that he remembers windows in the saucer and I don&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
