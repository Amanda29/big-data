It doesn't end there.|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62136.html|1|ndxe198504| Children from small town school see object over town over twenty years ago. It doesn&#39;t end there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok from what I can remember, I was attending elementary school in about the mid 80,s, I was about 8-10 yrs old and after lunch we went to the play ground, and on the way, there was talk and children excited about an object in the sky.  So I ran to see, when I arrived the teachers and children where pointing in the sky, so I looked an there it was a UFO!!!  What ever that ment  I didn’t know rather to be excited or scared so I looked at the teachers, they seemed to be fine so it was ok. Thinking back it was very high up possibly miles up and north about one or two o’clock high, at first, at least to me it appeared to be saucer or oval shaped but definitly chrome in color, and It just seemed to set their for awhile it didn’t move at all, what was so exciting about that. At least 30 min went by as the children started playing again, then suddenly the teachers started yelling look!!! When I did It had started changing it’s shape to a tear drop facing down and flickering from a dark chrome color to bright chrome glow, at this time my watch a Dukes of hazard watch started beeping Its horn sound , fuzzy sound but It was beeping and it wouldn’t stop so I covered it with my hands and continued looking, then it fell in like a controlled fall about a third of the way down and stopped again for a few minutes, I started playing with my watch when all at once some of the children said it was falling to the ground, I looked but couldn’t find it for a second until it flickered here an there on the way down until I last seen it just above the tree’s. I don’t know if it had fell to the ground are not but it was definitly falling down. After that we couldn’t see it anymore then we went back to class after observing it for at least 45 minutes. No big deal to me I didn’t even know what UFO was. If I am correct on the date the next day when we returned to school, again after lunch we where playing in the play ground when unexpectedly I’m  pretty sure of it are we wouldn’t have been playing out there, the teacher! s starte d yelling at us to leave the play ground, at the same time I Noticed one or two military helicopters just over my head, and that was it for me checkmate I was gone!!! Anyways  when we the children had seen that it was the military and they had landed in the play ground we were excited. I remember thinking they were there for us the children and were going to paint our face’s  with camouflage like they would at the city fair when they would come. But in full uniform the officers just walked on bye straight to the principles office screw them!!! We later went back to class then soon after my teacher including other teachers where called to the office, and we were subbed by another teacher while she was gone. And that was about it until the next day when we arrived back to school and was told on the intercom that what we had seen was none other than a weather balloon and we were even told on kplc news that it was. So that was that. Go figure!!! Hell I believed It. Until about 20 years later after I had forgotten It all those years, it wasn’t a UFO that’s why I forgot about it until I’d seen a similar event on the history channel, then WOW what had happened all came back. Any way I’m glad I seen this site on the web I haven’t really had it in me to tell this story to any one else around here because I haven’t heard anything about it since don’t want to bring it up again. I’m sure I’m not the only one that remembers it around here. Awe one more thing for what its worth just a couple of miles north of my small town of about 3,500 is a large prison compound it could have had a strange appearance from above. And I also seen on the history channel about UFO’s a map showing a UFO crash recovery just about 40-80 miles north of my town. about 40-50 miles north of here is a military base called Fort Polk, I don’t know when the so called recovery took place but it was a long time ago, I guess it would be possible for the craft that I seen to have crashed way up their since it was so high it could have appeared to be c! loser. W ell I guess that’s about It I hope some one else can explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  We have assigned an artificial date.  PD))<n>

My brother mom and eye went up to my room to fold laundry.  We were visiting our mom for the summer, in Ridgeway Colorado.  It was still a little daylight out.  I remember looking outside. well we were folding when suddenly from in back of me and my brother and the front of my mom hovered a red ball of glowing light.  We quickly turned and backed up trying to figure out what this is, besides my mom who didn&#39;t do anything but look up at it.  But before we could really try to move, time slowed way down.  I stood there looking at my brother but he was right in front, 5 feet from the window so I guess because he was lookin right at it he couldn&#39;t move.  I am a little more observant but the light got very bright and I could see the light wrapping around my brother.  This didn&#39;t take  long but it felt very long as the light got my attention and got me.   I remember  my eyes shutting with cray red light all around us in the room.  When I looked at my mom she was completely out, from the back of my older brother I could see he couldn&#39;t move. I woke up quickly in front of the window with the red ball still there as if staring, or wanting for me to see. Then slowly it moved to the left then shooting at a angle forward from where i was, but 5 feet to the left outside, into the sky and disapearing.  I get this sick half dazed feeling that half way threw that wall I started to wake up. My mom went right back to the dryer which is 2 feet from the bed, my brother remembered that day probably for only two days cause he wrote it in his diary the next day.  We were small kids so we put it off as a shooting star but I never put any kind of label on it because I know what I saw.(red ball of light, getting my family to fall asleep and then do somthing with me)  They don&#39;t remember it.  I finally said to myself whatever and left the room after this happened to go to the restroom.  I felt no shock really, I think I was old enough remember but not tocare at the time.  And my mom and brother never talked about it past one second after it happened.  My mom at the dryer as I walked by was looking at her watch and said to my brother and I that a hour passed and it was dark outside. They say that the sun bouncin off mountains turn the sky red, in Colo. but that is bull, because I think what ever happened to me and my family just happened to someone else. I have seen three other times a light shine into my room, when I was living in Arcata, CA, and once here in S.F.Ca.  It was fun that first time but now I can&#39;t help but get mad when I feel my self going into paralysis. 1.Lights circlin in my room.  One distinct shadow flew from window through wall into dads room.  Only my eyes can move.  ( my eyes can usually move in paralysis) 2.White cigar shape flys in front of window, hear very high freq. noises, very scared. 3.Pure white light shower in threw window. I know its real cause It was completely real and scary I can feel the fear when I think about it.<n>

My cousin and I left my gand parents house in the country.they live 5 miles down dirt rd in a heavly wooded area. we had taken the dirt rd. that when out by the pond. we stop the car on the dam of the pond. we were talking about my grand father that just had pass away few days before. I noticed a bright white light perfecty round bright in center with halow or almost like bubble apearance on outside of the bright light. it was the size of a basketball. it was flying below tree top level between the pond and trees.the speed was 10 to 15 miles per hour. it crossed in front of our path on the dam going back into the woods. I started to ask my cousin what is that? before i could get it out the light stopped backed out of the woods. it was like it had the same thought about us.then zoomed up to the front or the car.it made no sound in its movements, it was about 6 foot in front of us and 5 foot off the ground. I was so scared could! not move it set there for about 5 seconds then it when away at a high rate of speed up flash or blur almost. it seemed to change directions like a humming bird.My cousin started the car and we got the heck out of there. never said much more about it in that no one would believe us anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I remember that sometimes when getting to Austin using this road I would see the military jets landing at Bergstrom AFB. It was about 9:30 pm or so, it was pitch dark and a bit cloudy. So I am driving when, suddenly, I see through the top of my windshield this object that looked like a football, glowing bright green, so much so that the green light reflected off the few clouds above. This reflection made it real for me at that moment because my brain said, &#34;this cannot be imagined, the light is actually reflecting off the clouds!&#34; And I remember thinking that the object could not have been too high off the ground, maybe 300-400 feet off the ground or so it seemed. It was flying the same direction I was driving and I was startled to say the least. So I leaned forward on the steering wheel to see it better when, suddenly, it just shoots off towards Austin extremely fast and doesn&#39;t go more that 20 yards before it just disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was utterly fascinated, I think I noticed a car in front of me a couple of hundred yards but it didn&#39;t stop. So I pulled over, just to see the whole sky and to, I guess, get a grip on reality by just looking at the spot where I had witnessed this event. So I am standing next to the car, looking at the sky, when to my left, across the road, into the forest, in the distance, I noticed like smoke and glowing red/orange lights; it looked like a fire but I was not sure. I think I then climbed onto the hood of the car to have a better look when all of a sudden I felt fear, a gripping fear that made me think, &#34;hey, you better get out of here, get in the car and get out of here, this is just too weird.&#34; I got back into the car and drove outta there and didn&#39;t stop till I got to Austin and told my girlfriend about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

She asked me to stay in the cabin at the site to protect the property. The cabin is about 10 feet back from the shore line and has no electric. On or about April 15, 1985 my husband and I went up to the cabin around 9 PM and went to bed. About and hour or so later I got back up to answer natures call. The out house was about 30 feet east of the cabin and since the moon was nearly full I didn&#39;t take a flash light with me. Just as I was ready to sit down i heard what sounded like some one jacking shells into a gun chamber. Since i had no light or gun with me I tried to hurry the business at hand and get back to the cabin. Before i could finish I heard a sharp snapping sound and then a dull thud. I tore out the door,  not fully clad and in the moon light i could see that the center of the pond looked humped up. I let out a scream for my husband who sleeps like a log, but there was no answer. Before i could run a flat thing, like a coffee cup saucer, rose up out of the pond. It hovered briefly and then turned side ways so that all I could see was a thin edge. As it did so i could hear water running back into the pond. Then in a faint flash of color it was gone. I was facing south at the time of this event and the pond was in front of me. I will email a map with a star marking the location of West Franklin, Pa<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested additional facts from the witness.  PD))<n>

I never liked to tell the story because people looked at me as if I were crazy. The only reason I feel compelled to write about it now is because I happened to watch the show Sightings yesterday and I saw something that made my hair stand on end! Here is my story: I was coming home from a date with my boyfriend on a spring night in 1985. It was around 9:30pm. We lived in a rural area of Ashland, Ohio and were driving down a country road to get to my house. When we first left his house, we both noticed a big orange light in the left corner of the windshield. It was much bigger than a star but smaller than the moon. We were very curious but continued to drive and observe it. We both had the distinct feeling of being watched...It did not seem to move and remained in the same spot for at least 2-3 miles. Suddenly out of nowhere, it moved just as fast as lightning..until it was directly over our car. I can tell you that there is no plane in this world that can move as quickly as this object did. At this point, my boyfriend decided to stop the car to see it more closely..we stopped on top of a hill and this object was right over the car...It came down slowly and the lights consumed our whole car, the neighboring fields and the road...It was probably the size of half a football field. It was shaped like a triangle and had lights at each corner. It also had a light coming down from the center of the bottom of the craft. We stood there frozen on the road for what seems like an eternity as this thing just hovered over us. There was absolutely no sound or wind whatsoever. Then, just as quickly as it appeared, it shot straight up into the clouds. All you could see where lights disappearing in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my story and I am finally glad to get it off my chest. I am not crazy and I know what I saw. There is no mistaking something that is no farther than the top of a rooftop. What I saw on Sightings was exactly what I saw that night in 1985.<n>

4/4/85 20:00|Stone Ridge|NY|Other|25 minutes|Huge, low flying, silent cube shaped object with lights on bottom travelling about 60 m.p.h. over Stone Ridge.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48889.html|8|ndxe198504| Huge, low flying, silent cube shaped object with lights on bottom travelling about 60 m.p.h. over Stone Ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date is approximate, however it was the night of one of my best friend&#39;s birthday party who turned 18 on April 4, 1985.  The party was actually set to begin around 9 P.M. but I needed to get there early because I was bringing my entire stereo system (which included a then-rare equalizer with spectrum analyzer).  I didn&#39;t have many friends back then, but whenever there were parties, I would bring my whole stereo, and for a while I would be the center of attention as dozens of drunk and stoned teenagers stared at the dancing lights of the equalizer in a dark room while listening to heavy metal music.  I, on the other hand, never drank or smoked or used any drugs in high school, and in 1985 had left high school a year early to go to the local community college in Stone Ridge, NY.  I didn&#39;t see my friends very much that year, so I was willing to put up with their smoking and drinking because otherwise I would never see them.  This meant driving my parent&#39;s car with the windows open even when it was cold so that the smell of marijuana and cigarettes would not stay in the car.  On this particular night I stopped on Tongore Road in Stone Ridge to pick up another freind who had no desire to get a driver&#39;s license even though he was 18.  This friend had a neighbor nearby who suppled him with marijuana and it was expected that he bring some to the party.  As I drove northwest on Tongore Rd. away from Rt. 209, he started smoking some of the marijuana, so we opened our windows.  We got about a mile away, to the flat area down the hill from Thumbprint Antiques, headed towards the Drumlin.  At that point my friend was already acting a little high, and was not paying attention to our conversation.  I saw what appeared to be a large house on a hill to the north with a lot of floodlamps turned on.  I said something to the effect that it must be nice to be that rich to afford such a big house and keep all the lights turned on.  For some reason, I felt like making a point of how he was not listening, so in the middle of the flats, there was a small dirt driveway leading to a field (like the kind farmers use to access their fields with a tractor), and I pulled in a few feet.  Then I pointed out the big house with all the lights on.  But when my friend finally saw it, we both realized it was not a house but a moving object.  Within a few seconds we both realized that the object was huge because it was several miles away and was as big as a house would appear from a quarter-mile.  It was travelling directly towards us.  It took a couple of minutes before it was nearly overhead.  We could both see that it seemed to have a flat bottom with many flashing lights and may have been cube shaped, although it was difficult to see the sides of the object with all the flashing lights on the bottom shining in our faces.  In that flat area there was one large tree, and the object appeared to be getting lower, as if to land, and was not more than a hundred feet above the tree.  I had shut off the car when we pulled in, and we had the windows open to air out the smoke, but we both noticed that there was no noise whatsoever.  Realizing almost silmultaneously that this was no normal aircraft (because it was silent, only 100 feet in the air, travelling very slow, and as big as a football field) we panicked, thinking that this thing was about to land on top of us and crush us. I remember feeling like an ant must feel just before a shoe steps on it on the sidewalk. So I started the car and squealed the tires, backing out of the driveway and drove away at the highest speed a 1973 Pinto could do.  We headed back towards Rt. 209 on Tongore Rd. up a steep hill where the car would not go over 30 m.p.h. and the object was nearly directly overhead.  It was going slightly faster than us and had gained some altitude to clear the trees on the ridge where Rt. 209 runs through Stone Ridge.  We followed it down Cottekill Rd. to Lucas Turnpike where the speed limit increases to 55 m.p.h.. At that point I was driving about 65 or 70 but the object was going a little bit faster.  We followed it for about 20 or 25 minutes before losing sight of it as it cleared the Shawangunk mountain ridge near the Mohonk Mountain House. We had traveled about 15 miles and the object had traveled about 25 miles during those 25 minutes, and it&#39;s speed seemed to go from about 35 m.p.h. to about 75 m.p.h., much slower than any aircraft I have ever seen. We drove over the mountain to see if we could see it over the Hudson valley near New Paltz, but the winding road and steep hills slowed us down.  By the time we got to the Hudson valley, it was gone.  When we finally arrived at the birthday party a couple of hours late, the other people were only concerned about the marijuana.  The keg was already empty, and they seemed a little upset that we were so late.  They accused us both of making up the story so that we could smoke the marijuana ourselves (which I definitely did not do).  My friend, the birthday guy, laughed when we told him the story, and 20 years later still does not believe either of us who saw the object, even though we have stuck to the same story for so many years. The friend who saw it aknowledges that he saw it 20 years ago and remembers chasing it many miles down dark rural roads, but seems content not to question what it was.  Whatever it was, it was big, like the size of a city block of apartment buildings 5 or 10 stories tall, but seemingly solid. This event is one of the biggest reasons I have never been on an airplane, because it seemed that even a jumbo jet could have crashed into this object and only dented it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Spring 1985<n> <n><n> <n><n> We first saw it as we crested a hill. At first, it appeared to be bright lights from a distant house.  As we approached the area by car, it seemed to shift from one side of the sky to the other.  The area where we saw it is very thick forest that opens to a large resevoir with a dam. As we crested the hill to the dam, it was hovering over the dam.  The water was high, but not moved by the UFO.  It was very large, shaped sort of like a cowboy hat with a very narrow brim, with a large yellowish ball protruding from the bottom.  The top was encircled by rotating red and blue lights.  It stayed there for as long as we did.  My mom only drove away as I started to get out the car to get a closer look. I was 14 at the time.  It followed us as she very quickly drove along the resevoir.  When it began to follow us it seemed to lean onto its side and appeared more cigar like.  Sikorsky Airforce Base reported numerous calls the next day. They said it was a weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

We stared and it did something even stranger.  The craft morphed itself into a spherical white metallic ball.  It resembled a pearl in the sky.  There were clouds above it and the white pearl could still be seen.  It reflected a little of the sun on its surface.  It stayed there not moving.
