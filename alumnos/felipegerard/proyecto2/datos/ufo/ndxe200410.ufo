I started to point at a star in the clear nite sky. All 3 of us looked at this &#34;star&#34; - I saw it move just slighty to my right or west, then stop and get very bright. the brighteness lasted for just a few seconds then begin to dim or decrease in brightness and then this object or light rmoved directly away very fast and get dimmer down to nothing in about 3-5 seconds and then was gone. we all looked at  each other and said what the hell was that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Three red dots seemed to be in a triangular shape off towards Tinley Park. We thought maybe they were just planes going by, but I told them that it defintiely wasn&#39;t becuase of how long they were there. The red dots seemed to be floating farther away or maybe just disappearing, but they lasted about 30 minutes. Besides the red lights or whatever they were we saw a lot of planes going around and not just regular boeing jets, there were helicopters all over. I can see that many other people have reported this too. We first thought that maybe it had something to do with terrorists considering whats been going on, but theres no doubt in my mind that this is nothing like that. We noticed the middle dot seemed to drift to one side more than the other and then go back to its position. I would really like to learn more about this and I&#39;m hoping we saw a piece of history being made. I also would like it if whoever runs this site can email me back with any information that they get about these mysterious red dots.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;ve lived near an airport my entire life and know planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point we thought they were going to collide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They almost mived as if they were magnets repulsing each other<n>

Then it just diappeared there was no tail so I thought it was not a meteor or comet, then a few minutes later two jets came towards the same spot the ufo was in 1 flew south the other went west then headed south, 10- 15 minutes later two more jets arrived and headed south at high speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No way were they planes no noise at all and at the height they were at youd be able to tell. I lived near Lambeau Field and when they do fly overs its nothing like what I saw. They make lots of noise and you can see the afterburners and the red and green lights on the wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What drew my attention at first was how it sparkled, changing colors extremely rapidly. White, green, blue, yellow, violet.  Nearly the entire spectrum.  As I watched it, I would swear I saw another fainter &#34;star&#34; appear right next to it.  Then, both points of light moved!  The best way I can describe the movement would be to compare it to someone shining a laser on a wall and moving it in a very tight counterclockwise circle, at a medium-slow rate of speed.   The movement was barely discernable and lasted maybe 10 or 15 seconds, then stopped.  I wasn&#39;t altogether certain that my eyes weren&#39;t playing tricks on me, so I watched for a while longer, and it happened again. I don&#39;t have a video cam, or I would have filmed it, and it wouldn&#39;t have served any purpose to take a still photo, since the image would have just shown a starry sky.  At any rate, I went inside and watched TV for an hour or so.  Just before going to bed, I went out on the deck and had another look at the sky.  That &#34;star&#34; was no longer there.  There were plenty more stars cleary visible in the immediate area of the sky where I had seen it, so I doubt seriously that it was now hidden behind clouds.  I don&#39;t have a clue what it could have been, but I thought it was pretty strange to see a &#34;star&#34; move like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We then got another person to come outside and look at what we saw. The orangeish red ight seemed to hover in the sky above us not moving and only on air plane came by and the light semed to get dimmer and shift slightly when the plane came near it, the time we saw it the sky was quiet. We got binoculars and looked at it. it seemed to be a line shape, going from very bright to very dim, seeming to have a little light flash once in a while. the sky seemed a bit foggy except where the light object was the moon seemed to be darker then normal. Eventually the light just seemed to disappear. Then the moon was weird like in the movies where the clouds just part not fluffy like clouds, they seemed thick and dark slowly parting away from the moon. After the moon was revealed again and the light was gone at least 10 planes came over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I immediately called for my daughters to come out and tell if I was really seeing these weird lights in the sky.  Sure enough, they saw the lights as well.  I called friends and family who also live in the area and they witnessed the lights also.  We stood outside watching them for about 30 minutes until they disappeared.  They moved slightly over the 30 minute period but stayed in a triangle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

Earlier we saw 3 red lights (very bright at first) in formation and a few minutes ago, my neighbor (one of the 10 people that saw the earlier 3 red light formation) called and said that there was a single red light in the sky, Eastern sky of Tinley Park from 18000 and 88th Avenue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was strange is that you could see planes all over the place in the other parts of the sky as we get a lot of flight pattern from 2 of Chicago&#39;s airports, and this light was not moving at all.  Just stationary for the most part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it blinked, and faded a tad, and then it was gone.  But it did not fade away, it just blinked and then faded to black in 2-3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very similar aircraft with lots of flashing lights also flew very, very close to the red light a few minutes after we first saw it, and unlike the other planes in the area, this one had lots of flashing lights (almost like the lights on top of a police car) and it seemed to fly towards this red light intentionally as if it was trying to observe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I witnessed then from my back yard which faces the North. The objects moved East VERY slowly. The entire event took approx. 30 minutes. They were low in the sky and seemed to be moving at approx 5-10 miles per hour, maybe less. They were appeared to be 100-1500 feet in the air. I am not good at estimateing that however. There was absolutely NO sound whatsoever coming from the objects. There were several other aircraft in the area at the time. None of them were military and did not take any action towards the objects. This did surprise me. The cloud cover that night was low and somewhat thick. The moon was mostly obscured but could be seen. The moon was in the eastern sky. Temperature was in the low 40&#39;s. Very little wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared odd since she did not see any other customary lights as on an aircraft. It also was so slow moving as make her wonder if it could be a helicopter. After a few minutes it appeared to hover to the West &amp; she decided to have her husband come out to view it. Her husband had been a private pilot in previous years and spent time boating. Since he was familiar with various lights of navigation and aircraft she felt he might be able to add some insight as to what this was. He watched the light but could not identify what type of aircraft or blimp or balloon would appear like this so he brought out his binoculars. In looking through the binoculars he felt he could see 2 red lights, 1 slightly above and to the North of the other. He was not able to see any craft nor was he able to tell if the lights were independant or associated with a single object. They were moving syncronized. There was no engine noise detectable although throughout the sighting other aircraft were still in the area. From the time he observed the lights he felt the location of the lights was approximately 10 degrees North and 45 degrees West of where they sat. The lights headed back East (no apparent turn just changed direction) and ended up at about 10 degrees North and 45 degrees East when the husband went back into the house to see if he could see them from the front windows and if so he would see if his telescope could pick them up any better. He could not view them from the front windows and his wife informed him they were now gone. As his wife watched the lights moving East they had again seemed to hover as planes passed. This East area of the sky was hazy and cloudy. Although most airplane lights and the moon light was visable through the haze, the red lights seemed to either go on and off several times (or went behind clouds)and then were gone.  Throughout the viewing the lights appeared to become intermittently brighter or more brillant. We are guessing that the entire event took from about 9 PM to about 9:10 or 9:15 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We saw and heard known objects flying (specifically a loud sounding helicopter) and also there was these 2 or 4 jet looking aircrafts (appearing to be escorting) aside the spaces of the 3 UFO&#39;s. We noticed that the 1st and 3rd red lights pulsed occasionaly at the same time, the 2nd one stayed the same. My friend recalled about hearing about something exactly like this happening about a month ago and he called to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Two hours later, one red light was spotted alone, then quickly vanished. There was also a tomahawk helicopter seen over our town as well, at the same time the objects were in the sky.

I thought initially that it was a meteoroid as it was that dim and moving that fast.  When I focused and started tracking the movement it became clear that there were 6 distinct dots in a diamond formation very dimly lit moving at extreme speeds.  The objects traveled across my viewing area (aprox 40 degrees) in less than 2 seconds.  There was no sound.  I have no way to determine the height of the objects but they were traveling on a north to south trajectory.  I am sending sketch of formation via email.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our townhouse is located near 18600 South Oak Park Avenue in Tinley Park, Illinois.  It was a damp and hazy night. We both watched the three very bright red lights hover above us.  They had no other color to them besides bright red.  They barely moved and made no sound. The lights stayed mostly in a triangular formation, but it flexuated from time to time.  These lighted objects gradually moved over time towards the east, their pattern eventually became more irregular.  One became dimmer, then dropped down a bit before disappearing from view.  Then another eventually disappeared from view, but not in any particular direction.  The last remaining one was visible on the eastern horizon for another 5 minutes.  The duration of this entire episode from my perspective was about 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What was strange about 45 minutes later another fireball appeared South east, just one , it also lasted about 5 minutes. I took pictures on my digital camera and have night vision video on both sightings , In the video it appears as a white ball, when you look in the sky it looks as tho they barely move, but when researching the video it is moving all over the place at at times it looked as tho it was right on top of the screen. In the pictures the camera captured the light movement which is very interesting. I blew the photos up on the computer and in some it looks like they wrote something.

Many people were looking at it i looked at it for a good 15 miutes 2 were staionary and 1 was moving around at first it was a triangle, second it was like a L and third it was like a backwards l. It was weird because a few weeks back I read a newpaper article about red lights in the sky it was just crazy because it was on halloween.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My friend called me, told me the red lights he saw had returned (previuosly posted on this sight), so i looked out side and sure enough directly above my house was 3 very bright red lights. All 3 red lights at 1st ligned up in a str8 line with exact space inbetween each other. A few minutes later the farthest red light moved northbound and then formed an L formation with the other two lights. My mother then returned inside to get her camera, when she came back outside the 3 lights had moved alot farther southbound. Still in the L formation, allmost perhaps it was a Triangle formation. Actually it was alot like a triangle formation. We took 3 pictures but they did not turn out(her camera is just a normal digital camera). soon after we took the pictures the farthest east light disapeared, just vanished instantly. the other to started 2 seperate and soon after the farthest west light vanished.

The other two then slowly just disappeared. This was approx. 8:10pm. At about 9:15pm a few of us were out and saw a single red light that traveled a short distance and then disappeared. There was a helicopter and an airplane in the area at the time and these red lights didn&#39;t resemble either one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She said to look to the East and see if I can spot 3 red lights just hovering in the Eastern sky. My wife and I, along with a few neighbors were siiting in my driveay enjoying the evening and waiting for Trick or Treaters when I recieved the call. After a few seconds I, along with 2 of my neighbors, spotted 2 red lights in the East, North East, sky, about 20 degress above the horizon with 90 degress being directly overhead. One light was directly above the other separated by a few degress. The bottom one moved a little South then went back to being right under the other one. The sky was becoming overcast so we lost them both with in a few seconds of each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I received another phone call about 90 minutes later from the same family member telling me to go look outside again because one of the lights had returned. From her vantage point she told me to look a little to the West from dirctly overhead. I could not see any thing in that direction. So I looked in the direction where she lives and we, (my wife, son, and I), saw 1 red light in the sky identicle to the ones earlier. The light was North, North East from my location. I live South West of Tinley by @ 12 miles or so. I knew we were looking at the same light because I could see airplane traffic in the vicinity and I would ask her if she saw the same traffic and she concurred. We watched this together over the phone for a minute or so before I lost it in the cloud deck. Soon after that she lost it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an aircraft technician by trade and my hobbies include astronomy and photography. I had a few of my pictures of the Perseid Meteor shower on display at the planetarium in Chicago. My neighbors and my wife and I also enjoy satellite watching on summer nights. I am familiar with the differnce between aircraft, satellites, and meteors as to their apperance in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a point of interest, I saw 3 white, satellite colored objects, back in late August at @ 21:00 passing directly over head in a triangle formation. They were heading South with the base of the triangle leading the way. It was not a solid object between the points of light because I saw starlight between them. No one else saw this for I was alone at the time. As I stated before, I look for satellites all the time and have been since I first saw one as child. I&#39;ve spotted countless times were there were more than 1, sometimes 4 satellites visible at the same time in the sky, but I&#39;ve never seen where they seemed to be flying in perfect formation, and had the same brightness between them. I did report this to a different website at the time but to no avail. I came across your website in searching for others who might have witnessed this. That&#39;s when I found out about the other &#34;red light&#34; sightings in Tinley Park back in August.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A plane happened to pass below lights and it was clear to see the difference in lights and these red lights were not that of a plane or blimp. The red lights seem much more off into space than a plane would be.  There was no engine sounds.  We have video of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw over D.C!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and two friends were visiting a friend in D.c. on Halloween night.  3 of us went to the new world war 2 memorial.  This memorial is a man-made island, located in the heart of the city, to the west of the washington monument-- which you can see in the reflection of the pond surrounding the memorial.  All of us were smoking cigarettes and looking up at the stars, which were fairly prevelant this night, though there was some cloud coverage.  One friend spotted what seemed to be a star, moving about at an insane speed, in no one particular direction or course. Two to three more objects that also looked like stars appeared in the sky with the first object.  The objects now, which were a light white, close to the color of any random star, looked like they were playing almost, looping around one another, and changing direction and speed in ways  we believed to be completely impossible for any craft of our knowledge.  The objects would hover and accelerate and take up so much distace in the sky in an instant.  These objects also moved backwards, and there was certainly no turing radius either, they stopped on a dime, and flew backwards and loopty looped and the crafts chased one another in these formations and in a figure eight sort of design. They then dissapeared behind very high clouds. All the objects were fairly dim, and very far away, and it would have been extremely hard to catch this event if you weren&#39;t directly watching the sky, as we were.  We are 100 percent sure of what we saw and i know there are reports similar to ours that also occured over washington. Please do not allow this siting to be dismissed.  We are intelectual individuals ranging in age from 17-20.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They where red and little to the eye, but in the telescope they where bigger. The three of them where always in unision. It at night so they where perfectly clear.

At first they just hovered where they were but then they started to move slowly. I didn&#39;t watch from the beginning and I wasn&#39;t able to watch in its entirety, but i saw them move around in seemingly random directions very slowly but steadily. I went back outside a little late and found only one light. The original three were in the Eastern sky around 8 PM, and the single light was in the Southern sky around half an hour later. As I watched the single light in the South, it started to move, slowly at first but picked up speed and went back to where the original three had been and then disappeared. I had about ten or eleven other people with me and some of them took pictures and maybe videos of it. There was no sound associated with the objects whatsoever. They seemed to be very far away but were still intensely bright. No craft could be seen, only individual lights. The lights glowed orange and seemed to pulsate slightly, although this may have been an optical illusion. When I looked into this event I found similar reports from other dates that mentioned red lights. Although the reports seem to identify the same lights, the ones I witnessed were distinctly orange. These orange lights seem very convenient for Halloween, and may be a hoax. However, I cannot deny what I saw with my own eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Ano<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw the lights over Tinley on August 21st so we have been looking alot more at the sky lately and have our phones programmed to call each other if it happened again.  Tonight it did just that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three bright (laser-like) lights coming from the west and traveling east at a slow rate of speed.  I received the call when they were directly over my house.  There was enough time for me to go out see them and then run back in and get my camera and binoculars and take some pictures and video as well.  The lights were initially in a straight line from my perspective and slowly transformed into a triangle.  They seemed to continue in a triangular pattern although their reletive positions changed throughout its eastward course. As I watched their eastward progression with binoculars the triangle seemed to have its peak pointed north and the base to the south.  The top south light seemed to move down quite quickly and become lower in the sky than the light that was initially lower than it.  It then disappeared and only 2 lights could be seen.  There was no sound.  I could not see any structure around or between the lights.  Because there were clouds and no stars visable, I could not tell if anything was visable through the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just now I came back in the house. At 21:25 I received a call that another single light was coming from the west.  It could be seen due west above the house line moving on a course east northeast.  This single red light flew over the house and as it approached a 1:00 position it was lost in the clouds.  These clouds appear to be very high as there has been alot of air traffic seen this night and all planes visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurrence of a single red light traveling from the same direction as the previous 3 was the same situation that occurred August 21, 2004.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving south on LaGrange road going over the I-80 overpass when I noticed three red lights in a triangle shape. I thought it was strange that they didn&#39;t seem to be moving. They were in the east sky. At first I thought it was lights from a tower. As I looked closer, there was  no tower and they were higher in the sky than a tower. We continued on to our destination in Mokena. As we got out of the car, the people in the car behind us (they were following us to the destination), got out and started yelling about the lights in the sky. We all watched for awhile. There were 3 people in my car, and 4 people in the other car. Later that night I picked up my 11 year old daughter from my brother-in-law&#39;s house, and he asked me if I saw the lights in the sky. I was stunned that we all saw the same thing. This makes me belive is was SOMETHING! I am consumed by these lights, and want to know if and how they are being investigated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 45 year old mother of two, my daughter and her friend were in my car, they are both in 8th grade.

You could also see airplanes flying around them, I dont know if they where passing through or checking out the 3 UFOs. I was standing in my front yard facing LaGrange Ave watching them. They just hovered for a little bit, then they would move around, and the reconfigure. I went back inside to watch some more tv as my brothers and their friends stayed outside to continue watching them. After an hour or so I went back outside to the front yard to notice they werent there, so I went in my back yard which is towards the direction of Harlem and noticed they had moved there doing the same thing of hovering then moving around and reconfiguring. Occording to my brothers, a little bit later they just disappeared.

They started out in a gradual &#34;L&#34; formation.  The were moving very slowly.  There was no noise, like an airplane or helicopter would make.  It then seemed like they were moving closer to one another.  They moved into a perfect &#34;L&#34; formation, then a straight vertical formation, and then a triangular formation (one at the top two at the bottom).  Then, the top light seemed to fall quickly out of place, going straight down.  And eventually you couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  It seemed to disappear.  The other two kept moving slowly, not changing positions.  Then they seemed to gradually move away from one another.  It was a cloudy/foggy night, so the other two eventually disappeared.  Then at about 9:20pm that same evening, another bright red light was seen moving East, all by itself.  It was only visible for a few minutes, then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They would shift formations occasionaly, and once or twice seemed to stop completly.  One of them seemed to be on &#34;point&#34;.  They were higher than most of the normal aircraft, but I am rather close to an airport.  It seemed a helicoptor was sent to check them out coming out of the south, but didnt really hang around or get too close to them.He just zipped north and then west. It also seemed a jet was after them from the north.  As the lights began to reach out further into the horizon the lead light sped forward, while one moved north and the other south. Then they just kinda twinkled out and were gone. Most of the event I captured on film along with many other local residents.  Over 200 calls were placed to local law enforcment.  This is the second occurence i know of in a 2 month span.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The 3 lights then sperated and began to move away from each other for a time then 2 of them started to form back up again then after about 30 or 40 min they passed behind or above the overcast sky and I was not able to pick them up again. I have watched the sky and I pride myself on being a aviation buff I have never seen that color of orange red glow from a craft, I have never seen anything that bright or to that fact not make a sound, they did look like they were hovering or moving at the time I witnessed this with the wind..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very strange...

We thought whatever he and his friends had seen had some explaination. I notified the Tinley Park police and they were already aware of it. I also notified the Oak Forest police and they had no information or any other calls about it. I also called news radio 780 WBBM and told them what I was seeing. There were other aircraft in the vicinity but they seemed to be flying lower than the trhee red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At arm&#39;s length, they were about 1/8&#34; in size.  They were not moving, and were in a more or less straight line that stretched about 35-40 degrees across the sky.  They brilliance was striking.  The lights did not blink on and off, and their luminosity was constant.  There was no noise I could associate with the lights.  From my perspective, the lights were at about 45-50 degrees from ground level.  As I watched, the lights moved very slowly from north to east, and remained visible as they moved from clear sky into cloud cover.  When the lights were due east, they stopped.  After about 1 minute, two of the lights moved fairly close together (about 3&#34; apart at arms length).  The light that was off alone (it was the nearest to north-northeast, and at arm&#39;s length about 2 or 3&#39; from the other two lights) disappeared - just blinked out - at about 8:06 p.m.  Then, one of the two remaining lights (maintaining the distance I described) slowly rotated about 180 degrees around the other light, which was not moving.  I lost sight of the lights in heavy cloud cover.  I submitted a report in August of this year about some other red lights I observed, and find myself amazed to be submitting another one.  My wife and my neighbor also saw the lights.  You folks may contact me, but I would appreciate your not releasing my name/address/phone number.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports.  PD))<n>

The lights were in a horrizontal line moving very slowly. I witnessed the lights in Tinely Park, IL about 1 mile east of Lagrange Rd. and 1.5 miles south of 171st Street. There were three other witnesses with me. One of the witnesses filmed the event with a hand held camcorder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were a vibrant red much like a stop light. The lights were just south of my location and heading east. As they passed over me I heard no sound and could not see any discernable shape. When the lights header east they changed into a triangle pattern. Then some of the lights began to fade in and out. They nearly faded to black before becoming bright again. The lights were larger than a planet and larger than the lights from the wings of a plane. There was only the one red light emitted from each object. The spacing between the three lights remained relatively constant even when they changed their formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While witnessing the event I called my uncle in Oak Forest(a town further east). He to witnessed the lights, and he described them just as I did. I called the police at 8:03 pm to report what I had seen. I was told that I was the second caller and that they had no idea what the lights were. I continued to watch the lights until they were out of my view. I then called my uncle again to find that he could still see them. He watched them for another 25 minutes. During this time they went back to the horrizontal line formation. Then he said that one of the lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to some of the other witnesses there had been sightings much like this a few months ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We first observed them in the northeastern sky and we watched them slowly move east of us.  They stayed in the same formation, equal distance apart, and at the same speed.  They traveled in our sky for about 25 minutes before they slowly faded out one by one.  We called friends and family and all were able to see the lights from Orland Park, and Frankfort.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/31/04 19:50|Orland Park/Tinely Park|IL|Light|20 min|UFO sightings over Orland Park IL and Tinely Park IL|11/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40320.html|68|ndxe200410| UFO sightings over Orland Park IL and Tinely Park IL<n> <n><n> <n><n> DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVERS- My mother was the first person to notice the 3 lights in the sky at approximately 7:50pm (CST). She was walking out some friends of the family and her sister to their cars and all 5 of those people noticed the lights. My mother then called myself, my Father, and my sister out to the driveway to see the lights. We then went and got our next door neighbors to come and see the unknown lights as well. Since I work at a 24-hour news station here in Chicago I called the station to try and let the news director know what we were seeing, however, they were unreachable. I then called two friends in two different parts of our town (yet still within Orland Park) to look up and see the lights, they too were able to see the lights. One of my mother’s friends (who had been walking to her car) she called her husband who was in Tinely Park (an adjacent town to Orland) and he too confirmed that he saw the lights. One of my friends in Orland that I called also saw the lights from his driveway with a family that was out &#34;trick or treating&#34;. The ages of the witness&#39; varied in age from 13 at the youngest to mid-60&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS- there were three distinct Bright Red lights in the sky. These lights were similar to the red lights that are on top of Radio and Cell phone towers.  However these objects were moving, incredibly slowly. They maintained a steady pace similar in speed to a dirigible. The three lights were too far apart and too high to be planes, dirigibles, or balloons. Since we live in an area that has a high air traffic concentration (the O’Hare and midway flight path triangle) we are used to seeing lights in the sky, several commercial planes flew below the lights on there way to and from the airports. There was full cloud cover at a very high altitude, so we were unable to see any stars, however these three lights remained totally below the clouds during the entire 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DESCRIPTION OF WHAT OBJECTS DID- the three lights came in from the southwest when we first noticed, them moved toward the north (towards us), the three lights proceeded south east then after several of the people in our group had begun calling friends and family on our cell phones, the lights were too far away to be seen by 8:17pm. The lights maintained an obtuse scalene triangle formation during the twenty minutes. The distances between the objects remained relatively constant throughout the sighting. The lights did not change speed at all during the sighting, nor did they move in directions that would be impossible for conventional aircraft. Although the near &#34;hovering&#34; speed and the high altitude maintained by the objects completely rules out any helicopters. There was no noise heard from the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUNDS OF OBSERVERS- I&#39;m a 23-year-old college Graduate and I work at local 24-hour news station covering the Chicagoland Area. My father is a 53-year-old college graduate and has worked in sales for over 35 years. My mother is a 53-year-old college graduate and homemaker. My sister is a 15-year-old high school sophomore. My neighbor’s are in their mid-60&#39;s and both hold masters degree&#39;s in education, one is a college professor at a nearby college, the other teaches elementary school. Our friends of family included our former neighbor (ties in her 40&#39;s and a business owner), her husband in his 40&#39;s and is a business owner as well (whom she called on the cell phone), and her daughter (13 in junior high school). The two friends that I called on the phone are both 24 and are currently enrolled in college. My mothers sister is in her 50&#39;s, holds a college degree and is a nurse at a local hospital.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Shortly thereafter, maybe 5 minutes, I saw a airplane (slow moving) or helicopter fly directly into the formation or very close to it, and the shapes did not move or fade.  This area had a lot of air traffic from Midway and O&#39;Hare airports and what was unusual was that these lights did not move at all as far as distance but they did seem to rotate after awhile as if a flag was being turned in the sky and rotating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to the neighbors house and everyone came out on their deck.  My neighbor took pictures with his camera and then videotaped the incident.  Wild!  After a while, one of the 3 red lights would fade for a second or two, then reappear.

The lights were in various formations changing from triangular shapes to a straight line.  They did not move very fast but rather moved with purpose.  We were able to caputure the lights on a video camera as well as observing them through binoculars.  Through the binoculars they were all the same shape and color; an oblong shape with crater-like indentations on the body of the object.  The lights moved into the eastern sky very slowly, again changing formations.  After about 25 minutes the first light faded away and the other two faded as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There appeared to be no noise coming from the lights and no sudden movements.  Initally the lights appeared very bright (as bright as the red lights from plane towers), but as they traveled further from were they were spotted, they became less brillant until they seemed to disappear from sight (from my perception they traveled to far for the naked eye to see from where I was located).  Airplanes flew in the vasinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They arose from ground level very far off in the distance and one at a time kept going up in the sky. They were aproximatly 400 yards from each other and followed the first one exactly. the light was a very bright and rich red color that did not waver in any way as they made thier way east. The lights went up to about 7 or 800 feet in the air before leveling off. Thier speed was so slow I found myself thinking they were very large balloons that were lit up some how. I watched a commercial plane flew by and the plane was just north of them and it did not seem to affect the lights in any way. The plane made no attempt to alter it&#39;s course as it passed the three lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After observing it for a few seconds I noticed that it wasn&#39;t moving at all, just hovering. I couldn&#39;t tell how far away it was but it seemed very large. It must have been fairly close to the ground because the sky was so cloudy that no stars were visible, but the object was very clear to me. I couldn&#39;t make out any distinct lights; it just seemed to be glowing. This all occurred in a matter of about ten seconds. I parked my car out of view of the object and ran back to the side of the road to get a better look, which probably took another ten seconds, and when I got there, it was completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object remained stationary and did not vary in brightness. We pointed it out to some other parents in the area, then we all observed the object until a cloud passed in front of it, blocking our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time we assumed it was a hot air balloon, but couldn&#39;t imagine a balloon flying at night. It definitely was not the sun or moon and it was much larger than a star. It did not have any white, red, or green lights typical of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I forgot about it until I heard Peter Davenport on Coast-to-Coast AM say that others had reported seeing a similar object. Aliens? I doubt it, but definitely a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was not home at the time, so my secretary felt morally felt obligated to go outside and look around.  She said she felt like an idiot staring up in the air as was seen by some neighbors who asked &#34;what are you looking at&#34; and she answered .. have no idea and felt stupid and went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said she did not see a darn thing and told me it had been a false alarm.  I looked over the next few days at your website to see if anyone saw anything to no avail.  This unit has only activated twice in a few years so pondered what was up --I did see other UFO reports on your site that day and kinda finally just left it to an unknown. I just saw today that someone made a UFO report at the same point and almost laid an egg... you will also note i made this same report of the same craft described at the same location also being observed in January 2001 and was chased by aircraft away here in Arden near the Asheville airport.  Now i am left believing the UFO detector DID pick up a real magnetic disturbance made by the UFO that someone else saw.  THIS IS COOL!<n>

It then started to move north once again but very very slowly.  It stopped again and a few seconds later, it looked like the bottom exploded and a round red object came out, then it did it again and another red object came out and then it did it again and another red object came out. They circled the first object and then they all disappeared.  We did watch to see if there would be a report on this, and also have asked several other people if they saw it.

My family and I lived on 9 acres of land with paths running through the back yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s been so long ago, I can’t remember the exact date and year.  I never mentioned the sighting to anyone because at the time I didn’t know who  I could possibly report the incident to, and my family never would have taken the incident seriously.  If I had to guess I’d say the sighting took place on the evening of October 30th, 2005.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a fall evening, I decided to take my dog out for a walk along one of the trails running through the back part of our property. It was a clear night with no cloud cover in sight.  Soon after I gazed up into the night sky, and saw something I could not explain.  The object was far off into the distance, maybe a mile or two away, but was high enough up into the sky that I could see it in the clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I just stood there and looked at it, I soon discovered it was nothing like I have ever known to be an earthly flying object.  All I could see on the object were the lights.  The lights were in layers and rows…each row and layer a different color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had to try and remember correctly, I would say there were a total of 5 or 6 layers of lights.  Seemingly all stacked on top of each other.  I can’t remember the exact colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can honestly say that there was no way it was any type of airplane or helicopter.  The object stayed still in motion and did not move.  The object also emitted no sound.  This was unusual for me. I had always been a fan of aviation aircraft and this by far was different and nothing that I had ever recognized.  It was close enough to where I should have heard sound coming from the object but again I heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After gazing up at the craft for about two minutes or so I looked down at the dog.  After diverting my attention from the sky for about five seconds I looked up back into the sky and the object was gone and nowhere in sight.  I scanned the sky with my eyes but I had seen nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed so strange to see an object with those style of lights and no sound emanating from it.  The lights were nothing like I had seen.  In my opinion, if something could move that fast out of sight and had made no sound, surely it was not of this Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Then the oject reformed itself into a star of david like gleeming light still bright orange in colour. &#34;Its Coming toward us&#34; I said. then it turned round and headed in a westerly direction . I rushed inside the house and grabbed my binoculars and telescope and traced the progress of the ufo till it faded out of sight over the horizon. The duration of sighting was about 5-10 minutes.

Something about it seemed a little off, so I became distracted enough that I found it hard to watch the road instead of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was confusing. It was a line of 4 or 5 white and amber lights, much like an aircraft but much too large to be as distant as it looked. It moved slowly and silently, gliding low in the sky. I lost sight of it through the trees a few times as I drove. A minute or two later there were a few other small, slow triangles of blinking light in the sky, too. One triangle soon looked more like a diamond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For one brief instant, the line of lights seemed to have a faint gray coin shape below it, as if the whole thing might be a lighted disc tilted to an angle. The small objects seemed to move less slowly. Some lights blinked or changed from white to amber, but I can’t remember a pattern. It all just seemed odd and moving strangely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was north of Indy, at about 116th street, driving south as I saw this to my south/southwest, toward some radio towers. The lights were drifting east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/29/04 23:45|Boyd|TX|Disk|Three minutes|Object in the night sky.|12/3/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40663.html|105|ndxe200410| Object in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting took place at roughly 11:45 PM on Friday October 29 near the junction of 730 and what is locally known as Bobos crossing (I believe its county road 4668).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had set up camp at a bend in the river maybe ¼ mile from the highway.  It had rained earlier that day and there were still a few clouds hanging around but you could clearly see stars. There were three of us there that night sitting around the campfire and there wasn’t any alcohol involved. Probably an hour before the incident took place we were all witness to a low flying helicopter with a spotlight surveying the area. That was not uncommon, a few years back there was a prison escape in the area and the convicts were on the run in our area so they were searching like this before as well. Of course we were not without firearms so we kind of got a little excited and readied ourselves. After about forty five minutes things kind of died down and we went back to the usual campfire conversation.  Ten or so minutes later a rumbling noise could be heard in the distance, well more appropriately described as that of a diesel in the distance (which would be fitting since we were near the highway). We no longer heard the rumbling sound but we did begin to hear a humming noise in the opposite direction. We started to look around because in that direction there was nothing but trees and open space for a good ¾ of a mile. You could make out the moon reflecting off a metallic object in the sky just above the tree line. Natural reaction was to grab the guns but as we did it was starting to move towards out position. As we sit gazing into the night sky the object positioned itself above our camp site maybe 100ft up and it paused for a brief moment and then proceeded to change directions and headed off towards the south at an alarmingly slow pace. The rest of the night we were all on high alert, sleeping would almost seem nearly impossible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was first to wake in the morning and it was a trying experience to say the least. Well, we decided it would be best if we packed our things and headed home. As we were driving towards the gate that would open the way to the road we noticed another helicopter flying over. I’m not real educated on military aircrafts but from what I’ve looked at online it appeared to be a CH-47 Chinook. I do see a lot of these in my area though; I believe there is a place where they do training and whatnot with them near Newark. I am a bit skeptical about our sighting, being that there are a few air fields in the area plus were a hop skip and jump away from Carswell Air Force Base (or whatever it is called now).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not much was said about the incident after that day, who would believe it?<n>

The reason I didn&#39;t report it sooner is that I didn&#39;t know how or where to report it. Also, I mentioned it to a couple of people and they  looked at me like I just landed in a UFO. For this reason I never told anyone else except my girlfriend who is open to this sort of thing. I&#39;m not sure of the date, but it was in the fall and i believe it was 2004.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was eastbound on hwy. 417 and I was looking at a full moon which was low in the sky. On a line with the moon at about a 45 degree angle say southeast was two smaller objects which looked like smaller moons. One was about 1/3 the diameter of the moon and the other was about 1/2 its diameter. they were the same brightness as the moon and they never moved. They were there all night and even in the morning when the sun came up you could see them faintly in the sky. i never saw them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wondered if anyone else reported anything and if so is there an explanation? they weren&#39;t bright lights or moving objects like most UFO reports so i wondered if they were some other man-made objects such as space stations etc. I would appreciate any response I could get.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

The crazy thing is that this thing was very large and hovering over the ground approximately 2-3 miles up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hanging from this object was like a hose or something being lowered.  It had almost a dull greyish-white neon appearance to it, and at the very bottom was a brighter white light.  I would have to guesstimate that this shaft was approximately 1 block long. The shaft of light appeared to not have a large circumference to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought at first it must have been some sort of hose with this light on the end of it. I thought is this thing a Stealth and these pilots are just jacking around? But from the way the lights appeared, the V was much wider then the Stealth appears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a few miles away from it.

Appears almost three times a week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my morning walks I have been spotting an unusual UFO that appears to recognize when it is noticed. It appears at different points in the sky, nearly every morning I go walking(usually every weekday from about 6am to 7am). It appears only when it is still dark out. It looks at first to be the north star, but the north star can also be seen while the object is in the sky. In actuality, it is brighter than the north star. It is motionless until noticed, upon which it immediately begins to quickly dim until the bright light is nothing but a small point of light, much like a star. After a few more seconds, it disappears altogether. The object apparently appears at different altitudes. My final sighting of it before the clocks were set back(it does not appear in daylight) occured on 10/29/04. The object appeared DIRECTLY ABOVE ME, at a very low altitude. It was extremely bright, even though it was behind the low clouds. I stood and stared at it for about five seconds, and than the stationary light, like always, shut off. The object was always completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

The movement was about 15 meters above ground but slowely, I moved on to look from another angle on a higher place but did not found it !  A second sighting was in the city of Kuurne a black mass with leights in a side road to the main center not clear but with strong lights that were on. No sound was present also. I did not stop but drove on !   Two sightings occured in the distance the first one far away, the second in a sideroad when you pass and the second craft was not seen moving. The first craft moved to the south, south west ! I really did not take any moments to get out of my car because I had no camera, there was NO SOUND PRESENT !

We thought we could see them flashing red, blue and green. When I zoomed up in on them I was shocked to see that they were pulsating like a welding machine and had red, blue and green flashes. As I zoomed to high power with my digital camcorder you can see a definite counter clockwise rotation and the objects slowly moved upwards from just above the trees up to the 11:00 position. This took at least an hour and the objects flashed intermittently as if communicating with each other. We watched them off and on through the night and at one point there were as many as 8-10 around us with 5 or 6 making a draping effect from the sky down to the top of the trees like a fishing line going to the water. They were east of us in the direction of a microwave tower which is about 3 miles away. Like cars waiting at the gas station. It was strange to say the least. I made a tape of it and took it to work. None knew what it was but we knew what it wasn&#39;t. It wasn&#39;t swamp gas, ball lightening, an airplane, skylab, and I don&#39;t think they were sattelites or planets. But I would like for someone to tell me it is nothing and to sit back down. We have seen them nearly every night since. As well as some other spheres that turn on like spot lights and travel about halfway across the sky and then just turn off. I have seen this three times and my daughter saw it again on Saturday night 10/30/04 and she was scared and believes me now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars, we suspect, but that is a guess.

They were lined up horizontally and were about 30 degrees above the horizon. I thought it was an airliner in trouble and trying to land. After 20 or 30 seconds the lights faded away. The lights then reappeared vertically and again faded away. It was a clear night and no planes in the sky. We arrived home a few minutes later and discussed what we had seen. It was not a falling star, aircraft, weather balloon or fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were circling around on a soucer, and you could tell the object was disc shape.  The object was about the size of a full moon, and maybe 1-2 miles away.  Then the lights vanished.  When the lights vanished, it seemed as thought the object itself did too.  Then, about 5 seconds later, they came back.  The colors didn&#39;t change. The object was moving south.  I couldn&#39;t hear any noise though. I was inside, my tv was pretty loud and it was 1-2 miles away.

I turned to walk back to my truck and saw some strange red lights in the sky.  I was wondering if maybe you know what these lights were.  With my back to the ocean, the light appeared just a little to the left.  It was high in the sky. About cloud level at maybe a 45 degree angle from me.  It was round about the size of your little finger nail held out at arms length.  The light first appeared by itself for about two seconds then another light seemed to come out of it like almost instantly to the left. It was spaced away from the first about the same distance as the diameter of the first light then another came out of the second, and another, and another, until there were either four or five lights side-by-side in the sky all the same size..  Then I can&#39;t, remember for sure,  they either went out all at one time or they went out one at a time in the order they lit up.  I was fishing south of the point wednesday night and saw two red lights side-by-side lower to the ground toward Frisco.  I didn&#39;t really think anything about them at the time.  I assumed they were two jets.  They were just lit for a couple of seconds also.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about as high as a storm cloud, but fairly small. It stood out to me because of it&#39;s brightness; like the sun was right behind it (it couldn&#39;t have been because it was barely rising.) So right when I was about to turn around to grab our digital camera, and it dissapeared; like when you blow on a car window. So I stared at the spot it was for a minute, and it reappeared for 5 seconds. I don&#39;t know what it was, but when I asked my friend on the bus if he saw anything in the sky, it was exactly what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object at first struck me as a low laying cloud as it was kind of hazy but it appeared to be moving quicker than most clouds would as the night was not windy.  Upon looking closer there were three rows of dull red lights.  They were shaped in a half circle.  When the object disappeared from view we heard a single noise that sounded like a goose honking but we did not see any geese in the area or in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing this the fellow and I stared at each other in disbelief and then described the exact same thing to each other, finishing each others sentences.

An object appearing to be about 1/2 the size of the visable moon and a pale yellow orange color (almost like the moon) ran accross the horizon south to north at a very high rate of speed and curved towards the west just as it passed out of my view. (Its movement was similar to how a fighter jet flys over a city during an air show, except there was no jet sound or boom.  The object was mostly round with possibly a flat rear section.  At first I thought it could be a shooting star, but the size was too big and I have never seen a shooting star change directions. I figure other people must have seen this as many people would be out observing the eclipse.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/27/04 22:35|Hampton|VA|Light|6 seconds|While observing the lunar eclipse from the Courtyard Marriott parking lot (off of Coliseum Dr.) moments ago, I had my first UFO sightin|11/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40276.html|132|ndxe200410| While observing the lunar eclipse from the Courtyard Marriott parking lot (off of Coliseum Dr.) moments ago, I had my first UFO sighting.  After lowering the binoculars I was using on the moon, I glanced directly overhead and saw two quasi-pinpoint objects moving in not quite parallel directions from north to south.  The twin objects were about half-a-fist-at-arms-length apart.  They covered the angular distance from zenith to about 30-degrees above the horizon in about five to six seconds.  The objects disappeared behind a layer of high cirrus to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were not exactly spheres of light.  They had a bright-white central pinpoint of light surrounded by a thin faint white halo that seemed to scintillate just slightly.  The halos were probably less than half a pinky fingernail in diameter.  Couldn&#39;t get the 12X binocs on the objects quick enough to get a bead on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was watching the two objects pass overhead, they moved closer to one another and one changed course about ten degrees and veered away from the other after closest approach.  The objects were not travelling at the same speed.  The one that made the quick and abrupt course change seemed like it was playing catch up with the other.  It was just abeam its twin when it made the sudden course change and then accelerated slightly ahead of the one that maintained a more or less steady course and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought these might be jets from Langley AFB which is less than three miles away, but the objects were entirely silent with no obvious conventional nav lights.  They behaved like no polar-orbiting satellites I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the area of the sky into which the objects disappeared for quite some time hoping to see them return.  No luck.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were amazed by them, until we saw a bright white V shaped movement off in the distance. It seemed almost like a ghost, moving slower than a shooting star, but much faster than a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear night and I had a clear view of the moon. While looking strait at the moon, a chevron or V shape craft flew right into my line of sight. It came from behind my house and passed directly overhead going towards the southeast. It was extremely large and appeared to be at a low altitude. I didn&#39;t hear any sound. It was black with dim round lights on the underside that were in triangle arrangement. The leading edges of the craft appeared to be a lighter shade than the rest of the body and I don&#39;t remember seeing the back side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have regular air traffic flying over the nieghborhood on approach to the airport so I am used to seeing low planes. You can hear the planes from the distance and they drown out all sounds when they are overhead so there is no way that this object could be confused with an airplane. I would say that the wing span was at least 3x that of a large jet. It was huge!.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of days later I told some friends what I saw and one of them said that someone else they know saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The triangle formation looked mechanical as it held it&#39;s shape perfectly. The lights weren&#39;t very bright and were moving fairly slowly. The 3 lights were quick.

Up in the sky, about as high as an airplane would fly over Manhattan, at a 45 degree angle to the south away from the eastern-rising moon, were two separate v-shaped solid gray metallic objects flying side by side, not touching, same speed, apex pointed directly due south. There were no lights and no sound. They were clearly visible against the black, cloudless sky with the city lights &amp; moonlight reflecting their v shape and gray color.

The disc were much larger than airplane lights.  The aircraft moved very quickly in a southwest direction and suddenly there was a single soft circular shape that moved in the opposite direction of the triangular shape.

I pointed it out to my daughter and she said &#34;it&#39;s a ship!.&#34; It was gliding slowly north to south coming directly toward us over our heads. Four times the size of a 747. Ship had no lights and made no sound. At first looked like a boomerang, where its front edges reflected a dull faint gray. As the ship moved above our heads it blotted out the few stars. It was a triangle. Scraed and excited us at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While waiting, I was explaining to both of my children what was about to occur when I saw my daughter&#39;s face change.  She said,&#34;Mom! what&#39;s that?&#34;  When I turned around to face the moon, I saw a large gray mass moving as fast as a jet with no lights and no sound (like the trailing sound of a airplane engine).  We both watched it glide across the sky appearing and disappearing in the clouds until it finally got out of site.  The shape of it and the way it was gliding made me think that someone was on a hangglider at night.  But I couldn&#39;t see any body dangling from the object.  Then I thought, well maybe it&#39;s a plane, but again there was no sound from it.  The picture I keep replaying in my mind is that of a &#34;stelt boomer&#34; looking gray object with circles on the body of it.  The circles reminded me of cheese. It was so large that it had to be between 5 to 10 thousand feet up, well as low as the low moving clouds in the sky.  My son was not paying attention to either one of us until I started asking where&#39;s your dad; he needs to see this.  By then it was so far off in the distance that my son couldn&#39;t get his eyes fixed on it.  I am a health care professional  and probably would not have believed my daughter if I hadn&#39;t seen it with my own eyes.  Since many people would have been looking up at the dark sky, maybe there are other reports of this sighting.  Please let me know if this was all a misunderstanding and can be easily explained.<n>

My best friend and I were out looking at the sky waiting for his wife to come out of her grandmas house. I noticed these two bright lights about 1 mile away above the tree line. The lights were verticaly aligned with on another. The top one was alot brighter than the bottom one. There were also about five or six others hovering around the top one but they weren&#39;t all that bright. The top one slowly lowered itself to the bottom one and when it touched it, it got brighter. The top one rose back up to its original spot and the bottom one was gone. Almost like they combined. After the brightest one was in place the other little ones all moved in to combine with the brightest one and it got even brighter. After a couple of seconds we seen a bunch of streaks shoot from the light in all different directions so fast we barely seen it. As soon as that happened the brightest star dimmed back to its original brightness. Then another not so dim light appeared below it like before and the whole thing repeated for about 30 minutes. We then seen alot of airplanes or jets flying in that direction, i&#39;d say 10 or so. Suddenly the light got real bright and then shot in all directions and then we saw what looked like glitter all over the sky in the area. The lights never appeared again. At least not that night. There were 7 of us that seen it by the end and we were all in amazement. This all happened north of Mansfield.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was higher than the many planes flying around, about 2000&#39; (?) and moving very fast. It dissappeared abruptly. I could see that it was orb shaped from my view, and solid white. No blinking lights or anything resembling an airplane. Not a balloon. It was large, maybe more than double or even 4 times larger than a plane.<n>
10/27/04 19:38|Marysville|CA|Circle|Hour or longer|Strange round lights changing colors in the dark sky on the same day of the Lunar Eclipse.|11/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40014.html|145|ndxe200410| Strange round lights changing colors in the dark sky on the same day of the Lunar Eclipse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the night the lunar eclipse happened. I was recording the moon for obvious reasons. When my dad noticed a rather strange light that seemed to be flashing/changing colors to the left. It was above my neighbors house, but not close at all. From our eyes, we could only see it as a dot that was flashing. It didn&#39;t appear to be flying or moving in general. So we didnt think it was a airplane or a star because all of the other stars weren&#39;t flashing rapidly like that.(I dont think I have ever seen a star do that anyway). So I started to record it, I zoomed in as close as I could get and didnt mess with the zoom anymore. It was better on the video camera because we were able to see it bigger and a bit clearer. It appeared that the light was changing colors from blue,green,white. It looked as if it would double too and take the shape of a heart, but it mainly stayed in a circular shape. The thing that really got to us was the fact that it looked like there was some kind of electricity inside of the circle or at least going in front of it. Sometimes though it looked as if the electrical static went outside of the circle and above it, as if it were going nuts. As I said before, I did not mess with the zoom when I had it as close as I could get to it. I restate this because before we knew it, the circle seemed to enlarge as if it came closer, and suddenly shrink to a dot. It was amazing, I didn&#39;t think it was moving at all but it seemed to be moving forwards and backwards at random moments and fast. After a while there were more colors, including red,purple, and some goldish color. There aren&#39;t any big buildings in that direction or anything at all. So a flashing light from a room up high is ruled out also. Anyway, maybe an hour later I went back outside to film the rest of the moons transition, when I decided to check out the light to see if it was still there, and it was. The strange thing was, it was no longer in the same position it was before. As if it had moved off a bit farther n higher to the right. I stood at the same distance and place as I was before, and zoomed in again with the camera as close as I could, yet it never got as big as it did before, as if it had moved farther than before also. When I looked at it with my eye, I noticed there were 2 more on both sides of the one I was looking at. They were also much smaller, yet they were flashing/changing colors as rapidly as the first. I am not sure how long they stayed there, or how long they were there from the beginning, but from the time I was out there for a couple of hours or so they were there. My dad and I are very interested in the paranormal/supernatural. I have never seen anything like that before in the sky. I have no idea what that light was, but all I know is if it was nothing out of the ordinary then I still find it to be a pretty sight, at the same time I would like to hear how that was normal if at all. My dad has said that no one would believe me anyway that it had gotten smaller on its own, that they would assume I just zoomed it in and out fast. I do have statements behind that. First, the volume was on very high and the zoom buttons make a sound when u press them, even if you press them slowly, and when I was filming the moon and adjusting the zoom you could clearly hear me pressing the buttons. Second, I couldnt have zoomed it in and out that fast, because when I did try with filming the moon, it went blurry fast. I had to do it slowly to keep it focused. Last, I am not fond of liars, or hoaxes at all. I would never try and fake a thing like that, I have nothing to gain from it. I believe people who do that, give off a sense of them not being trustworthy, because if they would want to fool others and deny it, then who knows when they are being serious? Like that book, &#34;The boy who cried Wolf&#34;. Anyway, I would certainly like to know what that was. Oh also, I am not sure how long it lasted, because I didn&#39;t stay there until it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When the object cleared the trees we were suprised that there was no  motor noise  heard since we expected the object to be a low flying helicopter because of it&#39;s slow speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for about three minutes as the object transited our section of sky.  During that time we were impressed by the brightness of the object and that the intensity seemed to vary over time.The color was flame-like, and in fact at one point we thought that the object was a plane on fire.The shape could not be determined and the size seemed to be about a quarter to three-eights inch on a scale held at arms length. As the object approached the hill to the SW it began to coruscate and just before it disapeared it ejected a pieace or two of the same color material.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was for the most part clear with low patchy clouds to the SW and high thin clouds in the area in which it disapeared behind a house and hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired photographer and for many years had an aerial mapping service. During that time I amassed over four thousand hours in the air flying in light planes. I have seen many strange things that I always have been able to explain, but this was unexplicable. It certainly could have been some space debris burning in the atmosphere, but I am surprised that at 10AM the following day, no mention was made in any press reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife Jenny, who was with me the whole time, assisted me in the preparation of this report.She is a  retired nurse, and for the last ten years or so of her career, was a nursing supervisor with a group comprising twelve doctors and eighteen or so nurses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length via telephone, and he sounded quite credible, and we assume that he is an exceptionally good witness.

The second sighting was 20 minutes later, it was much much higher up in the sky, we saw it in a boomerang shape, again no lights no sound, it just seemed like the city lights were making it visible and there was no top light due to the lunar eclipse. it seemed to have a dot on each wing. The third sighting was about 30 minutes after that and it was in a triangle shape, flew over our heads and then did this amazing maneuver in the sky, it turned while the dots rotated, a bit mind blowing to see an object do this. then again it faded into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It went slowly higher in the Eastern sky for about 10-15 minutes, and I woke up my daughter to see it.  It slowly went east bound and disappeared out of view.  I figred it must have been a sattelight, or something like that, but then it came back!  It hung around for a while, but then I fell back asleep after watching it for about 15 minutes.

A local rancher, his wife, and a friend had stopped by to chat with us, enjoy the fire, and eat some dinner. Due west of the camp at approx. 8 p.m., eight fireballs appeared in the sky. They were some distance away, and I would guess that they were over a dry lake area just east of Cedarville, CA. One of the other in the party described them as &#34;stadium lights&#34;. The lights then moved towards the center of the pattern and became one light. Then they just blinked out. About a minute or so later they re-appeared, but there were only 6 light this time. This time they did not move together, but simply blinked out. Then over the course of the next 5 minutes single lights would appear and then blink out on three more occcasions. No noise or other phenomena were observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our party consisted of three hunters (2 Pepsi Cola employees, and a Pharmacist), and the three ranchers.<n>

I spent a couple of days trying to learn to use it and took it out the following night. I didn&#39;t really know where to start or what to look at so I just decided to check out the surface of the moon. It was really amazing to see all the surface features, craters etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour had went by of gazing and trying the different powered lenses. I zoomed in on the moon using 25mm eyepiece which will focus on a 3-400 sq. mile area of the moon. I started noticing that about every minute and a half or so, sometimes one but mostly in pairs little black dots would go by as if it were some type of plane orbiting the moon (the moon was full). At first I thought that it was satellites that circle the earth passing in front of the moon, but then I realized that this would have to be something orbiting the moon itself due to the multiple times that these objects traveled the exact same path. The next night I decided to look at the moon again oddly enough I saw the same black dots mostly in pairs and slightly staggered but sometimes only one. I watched this for about 30 minutes, probably 12-13 times. These were very clear black dots and any satellite between here and the moon would not be this clear and so small. So I wrote some emails to astronomers and asked, thinking it would be something easily explainable. The response I got back stated that anything orbiting the moon would be too small to be seen in a telescope and also they knew of nothing currently orbiting the moon. I&#39;ve looked at the moon a dozen or so times since and have not seen anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was in a van on I-71 heading towards Columbus. All of a sudden the entire sky turns bright. So bright in fact, that it looked like the middle of the day. This “flash” of brightness lasted about 2 seconds before the sky faded to dark black again. Although the moment was brief, I can recall certain aspects of the event. First off, I was staring into the horizon and/or just above it since I was driving (about 85 mph). I immediately thought to myself that a serious lighting bolt just dashed across the sky. But I also thought that never before had I seen one light up the sky like that. As I was thinking that, it immediately occurred to me that there were no clouds in the sky at the time and that I had not seen other lighting activity. As I was thinking this I was leaning towards the driver’s side window to look outside and up. As I did, I noticed a black/dark, long tubular object (I couldn’t guess its size/length) “take off” from with the middle of the sky. The term “take off” is used lightly here. There was no slow and steady acceleration. Instead, it looked like it went from 0-300 in 1.0 seconds. The only thing I could see was that it went in a West/Southwest direction. And the only reason I could see what direction it went in was because the sky was still slightly lit up, but fading fast. In it’s wake, this object left what could be quite normally explained as a jet stream (??), or the white, long cloud-like formation we see planes leave in the sky. But this stream was different in the fact that the outer streams were a bright fiery red/orange. The middle of the stream was white. These bright red/orange streams hung in the sky for about 5 seconds before they turned to white streams and simply faded away like thin clouds. I should explain that the reason I didn’t follow the object was because my brain knew it was too far gone. If you would have seen how quickly it jettisoned across the sky, your brain would also have “known” that it was visually untraceable. Therefore, I focused on the “stream” above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the FAA around 01:45 on Monday, October 25, 2004 to inquire about others who may have reported something similar. The person I spoke to mentioned that he saw “numerous” reports on his way to his desk that had been filed tonight regarding this event. He mentioned that they will be following up with the National Weather Service to see what other explanations may be available. He was quite interested when I told him about the fiery stream and the object appearing out of nowhere. He also said that it could be a meteor, but that meteors do not usually behave in this fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can understand lighting, and skies lighting up, and even meteors (although I’ve never seen one that close). But what I can’t understand, and this is the reason I’m reporting this, is that the object I saw “took off” from within the middle of the sky. First off, how did it get there? Second, why did it take off immediately after the bright flash? And lastly, but more importantly, how the heck does an object move across the sky at that great a speed?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD))<n>

It was between mile marker 26 and 24. I saw a ball of bright white light  plummeting at approximately a 45 degree angle, very fast. The ball was not perfectly defined--it appeared  to have motion, whirling, with bright light coming out of it. There was a white tail. The ball of light was about  three-quarters to a full size of what would be considered an ordinary full moon.  In the instant before the ball disappeared from sight, about a third of the length of the tail (the portion of the tail closest to the ball) displayed colors as in a spectrum, in distinct, separate bands of distinct colors, being of fairly wide breadth. The bands of color were perpendicular to the tail, not lengthwise. And the rest of the tail remained white.  I heard no crash, there was no display of light as in an explosion, I heard or felt no rumble or shudder. It was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD))<n>

We stopped for a minute and were standing in the middle of the road talking, when the whole sky lit up for about a second with bright white light. Neither of us saw any object or meteor, and the light came from the west. The moon was shining in the southwest, and the flash was brighter than the moonlight. We noticed there were no clouds anywhere in the sky, and ruled out the possibility of lighting because of that and the fact that we didn&#39;t hear any thunder afterwards. We did, however, hear a strange whirring or buzzing for about 4 or 5 seconds immediately following the flash. We walked in the direction the light came from and up a hill to see if we could see any objects in the sky, but we didn&#39;t see anything else. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s relevent, but my ears started making random clicking noises soon after we saw the flash and have been doing so now for about 4 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

((Meteor??))|11/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40012.html|177|ndxe200410| I have a question about something that happened to me just the other night that i cant explain in the sky. Im from ohio and i was with my girlfriend in columbus for the evening. Well she lives in dayton and i go to school near zanesville which leaves about 2 1/2 hours between us and columbus is in the middle. Well i was driving back to college and was right outside of Zanesville (or 50 minutes east of columbus)and i was on the phone with my girlfriend while i was driving. She was headed in the opposite direction and was right outside of dayton at the time. There is about 100 miles between us at this point. Its at about 11:30 at night and it is a completely clear night and it was very dark when all of the sudden the shy ahead of me lit up bright blue and took over the whole sky and lasted for a few seconds and quickly faded out. At first i suspected lightning but there was something different about it because it was all around me. Right as it faded out my girl friend said on the phone &#34;did you just see something?&#34; and i said &#34;the whole sky just turned blue&#34; and she said it just happened here too. I know that lightning can travel but this was not lightning because it rose from the horizon and over took the sky and at the same moment it happened 100 miles away. What do you think that this could possibly be? I check all the news and internet for anything that could have given an indication of some even in the state that could explain it but i found nothing. What could this possibly be and why? Anything will help....i am just searching for an answer to this strange occurence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports.  Possible meteor.

10/24/04 22:15|Wheatfield|IN|Flash|6 seconds|Gradual bright white light at night illuminating the eastern sky and ground.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD))|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39934.html|178|ndxe200410| Gradual bright white light at night illuminating the eastern sky and ground followed by a streak in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving north on my way to work at 10:15 pm I saw with my peripheral vision on my right side (east) the sky lighting up a brilliant bright white light. As I turned my head to face east, the light became so bright that it illuminated the inside of my car and all of the surrounding landscape in my field of vision. This white light was a gradual brightening, not a flash like you would see at a fireworks display. It was VERY bright, many times brighter than any white flash firework and also very high in the sky. Also, this event appeared very close to the local power plant (NIPSCO). I estimate that from the time I first noticed the brightening of the sky to my east until I had my head turned to look in that direction, about 2 seconds had passed. As I watched the eastern sky I never did see the source of the illumination, I could only see the illumination fading very fast. It took about 1 second for the sky to go from bright white to darkness again. Then immediately after this, a yellow / orange double streak appeared in the sky similar to a contrail but it was diffused and had &#34;sparkles&#34; inside it. This streak &#34;drew&#34; itself from the bottom (what would be closest to the ground) going UP. This streak did not come from the top of the sky going down, it appeared moving UP. I could tell this streak was very large in the sky and &#34;drawn&#34; faster than any contrail I have ever seen. The streak disappeared as fast as it came. I stopped my car to continue watching the eastern sky for about 5 minutes and no other events occured. At work, two of my friends saw the same thing and as I described it to them they both agreed that it happened just as I have said here. One of the 2 friends that saw it said that the white light illuminated the inside of his truck like an arc welder would, and he has tinted windows on his truck. Also interesting is that this friend lives about 30 miles from me and it seems we both agreed on the intensity of the light. It was VERY bright. The other friend lives even farther away from me (about 50 miles) and it illuminated his car just as brightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed here: http://www.nbc5.com/news/3846130/detail.html?z=dp&amp;dpswid=2265994&amp;dppid=65172 that there was a plane that was forced to return to O&#39;Hare airport shortly after takeoff because of flames shooting out of an engine. If you read this article you will see that this was not what I witnessed. I live about 60 miles from Chicago to the southeast. Lake Michigan is northwest from where I witnessed the event. This plane was headed to Brazil which I imagine the plane would be on a southerly course. The event took place in the eastern sky, almost due east from my position in Wheatfield, Indiana. I estimate that the streak was several miles away in the sky, maybe as far away as 50 or more miles. Also, there was no mention of a tremendously bright white light in the sky in the article. I have never seen anything so bright in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The article says that a &#34;boom like thunder&#34; and explosions were heard, the event that I witnessed was completely silent as far as I could tell. Please contact me if you need further details. Also I would like to know if anyone else has reported this event to you. Incidentally, a friend of mine at work said that the local Chicago news has been reporting UFO sightings over Indiana for the last couple of weeks or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.

It continued to move slowly for about 20-30 minutes until it just looked like a normal light in the sky.  I live next to an Air Force Base so it could have been a B@ bomber, however I cannot find any night pictures of one.  Many people in the apartments also saw it.

The 3rd light was on the nose of the jet plane. As this jet plane (I&#39;m sure it was a military jet but it didn&#39;t make any sound?! And my view was as if i was looking at the bottom of the plane so kinda look like triangle becaue of the 3 dim white lights.)It was moving very fast and as soon as it passed the orange glowing light, (the Orange light was higher than the jet) the orange glowing light started to get smaller and smaller. It was so tiny but i could still see this orange bright light until it disappeared. There were 6 of us who saw this. Me my wife, my two daughters (ages 8 and 6) and my wife&#39;s step mom (who saw it first). Amazing! I couldn&#39;t sleep. I called 4 city&#39;s police dept. to find out if other people reported it, but nothing. I logged in the internet and type in search UFO Reporting and that&#39;s how i saw your site. I called your hotline (202) and a recording lead me to this form report. I also went online-chat to talk about it. I have to let somebody know. It was an amazing, unbelievable experience.<n>

Sounded like someone ran into the door? Or if someone threw a basket ball at it. Dh &amp; I look at eachother and say &#34;what was that?!&#34; I put the light on and see nothing. Open the door and find nothing. Thought about this later and related this sound to a sonic boom, which we are familiar with here in Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ~ Go outside on my back patio around 9:45 and see a bright light in the dark sky. I first just assumed it was like a transformer &#34;blowing&#34; or lightning but it was a constant light--not up in the sky though low to the ground. Not like the flashes transformers or lightning typically causes. It stayed lit up for about 3-5 minutes. The night was also a clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ~ Hearing something up on my roof like running back and forth. Initially I thought squirrels but these squirrels would have to be hmmmm...20-30lbs to make that kind of ruckus. No kidding it sounds like a child running up on the roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ~ So, I go out for the day today. I am pulling out of my neighborhood and see a street sign knocked down about a block away. It isn&#39;t bent down more like &#34;sawed&#34; down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ~ Turn out of subdivision and head down fairly busy street. Notice on the left side of the road all traffic signs are bent slightly to the left almost exactly the same. I am talking speed limit signs, H (Hospital) signs, school zone signs, etc. They are all bent like this for approx. 1 mile.??  ~ I have a bruise on my arm that I don&#39;t know where it came from and is in a conspicious area that I racked my brain trying to understand what happened. Met up with my brother and he has the same bruise (size &amp; shape of the letter &#34;U&#34;) that he doesn&#39;t know where he got it either. For the record I didn&#39;t mention my bruise to him or any of my other weird coincidences that have been going on. However, I did mention it to him later.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One of the video camera shots is of multiple (approx. 15) UFOs clustered in the sky.  What I noticed was that the UFOs, if you connect them like dots, make the shape of a radar antenna.  They did not mention this on the show and I am not aware of anybody making this observation before.  Have you seen this or noticed this before?  If you have the video or a still shot of the siting (I searched the internet and couldn&#39;t find it) I stongly encourage you to check it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please let me know if you know what I&#39;m writing about.

It was clear outside and the sun was bright with clear skies and unlimited visibility. I was observing a hwak in the sky when I noticed a bright metallic (orb) or possibly a cylinder. At first I thought it was possibly a mylar balloon(the type you get for a childs birthday) but I noticed a light aircraft below the orb, way below the orb! I called the manager over to observe it and he was also astounded by it. It was stationary from when I first  observed it until it started moving(drifting?) slowly from east to west. The stationary position lasted about 2 minutes. We observed several commercial jet aircraft on flight paths directly below it also. I can easily say the the orb was about 10,000 to 20,000 feet up. It drifted then for approx. 10 more minutes and stopped for about 30 seconds and vanished from my sight. What is very strange is that it just disappeared. It didn&#39;t shoot up furtherinto the distance or zoom off, it just disappeared. Vista is south of Camp Pendelton Marine base. I would say that it was over the southern area of the base or near the boundary. I also wonder if it was some sort of observation platform they are experimenting with. Strange the way it behaved.<n>

Not long after crossing the Greenville county line I noticed 2 lights sitting at a 45 degree angle.  we both just watched it hover. At the time we were about 30 mins. from home. The whole time the thing just sat there hovering. After arriving home , my girlfriend went to bed. I stayed up till 6:30 or 7:00. Before I went to bed I walked outside and it was still there. Still sitting at an angle in the same place. I mentioned this to friends whom also saw it 2 nights before, doing the exact same thing,hovering. The morning I saw this I had a weird experience in my livingroom. It seemed like several dimenions were opened at once. For example, I saw a guy in my kitchen, another guy standing by the TV and I saw another guy come through the front door.I know it sounds weird. But I&#39;m comfortable with it.It seems that the other guys were too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was in the overlook at about 34.6801 north and 94.6325 west (visible at http://terraserver-usa.com/image.aspx?T=1&amp;S=10&amp;Z=15&amp;X=1752&amp;Y=19193&amp;W=1 ).  I was lying on a wooden bench very early in the morning admiring all the features visible in the sky far away from the city.  I was looking in a direction approximately parallel to the direction of the scenic overlook drive, south-southeast.  I was alone, and I know of no one else who saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was looking at the stars, I saw one, fairly high in the sky, start to move.  From my perspective, it appeared to move downward, toward the south-southeastern horizon.  It looked like all the other stars.  I saw no other movement, other than airplanes, in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 15 seconds, during which it moved from being fairly high in the sky to being fairly low, when it was hidden behind some clouds.  I had seen several meteors before I saw this star move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The star moved too slowly to be a meteor and there was no trail behind it.  The only oddity about the star, other than the movement, was that it appeared to flicker or twinkle less than the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it caught my attention, it appeared to be more solid than the other stars.  I could not see how far away it was or how quickly it was moving, except that it was on the other side of the clouds.  The sky around the star was clear until it moved behind clouds that were low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was watching the star move, the sky was clear in its vicinity and I saw many other stars near it.  The apparent movement was not caused by movement of clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/23/04 01:00|Manhattan|KS|Light|2:00 minutes|Many sightings over years|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39906.html|198|ndxe200410| Many sightings over years<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has happened on many ocassions to me and my step-brother. I think the reason that we see the same sightings quite often is because we are star gazers. I couldn&#39;t possibly count how many crafts I have seen, but I know it would be over 50. I just now found this site, so I thought I would report my sightings that I have had over the years. The first time I seen these ufo&#39;s was when I had just got a brand new telescope for christmas in Hawaii. I decided to take it out the night I got it to look at the moon. I was amazed by the detail I could see with the telescope, and I even got to see Saturn behind the moon. After I had my fun with looking at the moon and Saturn, I was packing up the telescope pieces and loosening the scope positioner. I looked up for a second to just gaze at the stars and wonder whats out there, when I seen a light, which I thought may have been an airplane at first. I stared at it for a while waiting to see the lights blink, but it never happened. I continued to watch as it went further and further. I called to my Step-brother to come look at what I was seeing. He was amazed by it also, and we both noticed that it seemed to be slowing down. It slowed down to where it looked like it was not moving at all, and then made about a 90 degree turn and headed south of the island of Oahu. After about 30 seconds it sped up, and left nothing but a streak of light across the sky that laster for about 2 seconds. We were both stunned by this, and talked about it the whole night we stayed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have also had an ocassion where a number of people seen what we spotted. One night one of our neighbors were having a party for their friends daughter&#39;s birthday, and me and by step-brother were told to come over. We hung out by the trampoline, and talked with all the other teens there. We ended up getting on the topic of UFO&#39;s some how, and that led me to tell my story of what me and my step-brother had seen. After I told the story we all looked up and I noticed, out of the corner of my eye, a small-bright object going very fast. This was very different than the first one I had seen because it was more hostile. It was moving in a violent way, zig-zagging, and turning sharp. I told everyone to look to where I was pointing, which was West of Oahu. An overwhelming fear came over the crowd as they looked at the object. We continued to watch, and more gazers came out to see what we were looking at. That same night, when me and my step-brother left the party and were on our way home, we both happened to be looking north-west, when we seen what looked to be an explosion, or super nova of a star. It lasted for only a split second, but was so bright that I could still see it do to the strain it put on my eyes. We didn&#39;t have any other reports of it on the news, and I wondered why. It had to have been seen by more people than just me and my brother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are many more sightings of UFO&#39;s that I have seen, but they will not be described here, as there is too many to remember. I have provided the most impacting of sighting to me here in this, but if you would like to know more, e-mail me at ((e-address deleted))<n>

I only noticed it because of how it shimmered in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving and my girlfriend was in the passanger set. When I noticed it was at a 2o&#39;clock high. Now, when you looked at the light it shimmered to a bright white to a almost electric blue, to a dim gray. I was amazing. My girlfriend thought it was a plain but it didn&#39;t have the signature lights blinking off the wings and tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I know this because the DFW airport is right beside both grapevine and southlake for air traffic.)When we ruled out if it was a plain, and anything else I told her  maybe its a UFO? She started to laugh and then stopped suddenly and said you know it could be because that is the only thing that it might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did the normal thing and compare on how high it might have been up in the sky. I would have to say at least 5,000ft to 10,000ft While driving home of the 20mins it takes to get home, we watched it until it just dissolved or ...disappeared, if that is what you want to call it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I have to say is that this is my second time to see one and I got the same stomach ach that I had the last time I saw one the DFW area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Figuring it was a plane, I grabbed my camera just to see how well the zoom would work at that distance, and lined the light up near the center.  When I lowered the camera, two more lights had appeared to the right of the first light, with one being distinctly further back, forming a triangle pattern.  The first light moved behind some trees, while the two newer ones remained hovering for a few moments.  Then, the one that was more distant that had been at the center of the triangle began moving to the left as well, before disappearing behind the same trees as the first one.  The third and rightmost one had begun moving as well, and I managed to take some photos of it as it moved to the left.  As the final light flickered behind the same stand of trees as the first two, a fourth light suddenly appeared near where the middle light had been.  This light only hovered for a few seconds, a minute at the most, before it vanished as suddenly as it had appeared.  This was at approximately 9:24 pm.  The entire time I described what was happening to my friend, and continued to talk to him for approximately ten minutes afterwards, at which point I began writing this report.  All three of the lights were a dull orange color the entire time, with no change in intensity or shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/22/04 18:42|Picayune|MS|Disk|1.30 minutes|Two disk shaped objects at first thought to be mylar balloons or kites in the distance|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39899.html|201|ndxe200410| Two disk shaped objects at first thought to be mylar balloons or kites in the distance<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting by my front door when I heard the dogs in the neighborhood barking and I noticed a disk shaped object approximately 75-100 feet off the ground traveling from the Southwest to Northeasterly direction. When I first noticed it in the distance, I thought at first someone was burning something and it was ash floating in the air, but quickly realized it was too solid to be ash.  I noticed a man in a car that I did not recognize stopped in front of my driveway to stick his head out of the window and looked up. He pulled into my driveway and turned around and I wondered if he had followed the object from another area in my subdivision.  It appeared to be &#34;drifting&#34; with the wind. I looked back in the direction from where it came because I heard children yelling to one another, &#34;What is that!?&#34;  It was then I saw a second identical object.  At first I thought they were kites or mylar balloons.  They appeared to tilt and roll, which I attributed to the very slight wind, and I do mean slight.  When they turned a certain way they were almost invisible.  They certainly were close enough to the ground as they passed over my head that I could see a kind of silvery outer edge with a bronze color center, although they did not &#34;bend&#34; and appeared to be a hard surface.  It made no sound at all and I saw no strings or wires coming from them. They were relatively small - appearing to be 4-5 feet in diameter. While I am not labeling this as anything significant, I cannot say I&#39;ve ever seen that kind of material before. It also occurs to me that a neighbor and I talk occasionally about how there are unexplained power outages in my neighborhood for no apparent reason fairly frequently.  In fact, there have been two in the last couple of weeks when the weather was perfectly fine. In fact, the last one I heard a strange sound in the distance just before it went out. While I have heard a transformer blow before, this sound was not like that, although I can&#39;t describe it.  I am a 44 year old professional woman who works for a government agency.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My friend jumped out of car to observe better and object curved into a northly direction. We tried to pursue a better view, but it was soon out of sight over northern horizon. There was no sound at all. Too fast for airplane &amp; we don&#39;t think missles have lights on them(?).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I just froze the watching it fly over me, it was strange. You could see it had a metallic glint and at the same time it was sort of transparent, so that as it moved you could see the stars above it, but as though they were being sort of reflected from the bottom (even though the stars were above it). It was sort of like a when you put a magnifying lens close to you at a distance to something. And stranger yet was that it was flying quite low, I was on a balcony (and I was&#39;nt to high up) and it was just like two average houses high above me...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew by, leaving me there staring and shocked. I went inside to make sure the two kids where ok and minutes later my mom entered with her friend. I told them about what I&#39;d seen and they told me about something strange they&#39;d seen in the sea. They were lights, but not normal. And they sort of sank into the ocean and disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I saw it off to my right, which would be west, at first and it blasted like across the sky for a short distance, then it went out and then a few seconds later appeared once again with the same kind of high power looking kind of flame.  I could not get a view of anything in front of this flame, the night sky was dark and i couldn&#39;t see any objects against it, nor could i get a feel of how far or close this object was.  Then I saw the flame go out and I then noticed many tiny red lights in the sky all around the area where this other bright flame that I had just seen was. I noticed one of the red lights move up in the sky in a spiral like manner.  I also noticed that the some of the other red lights were blinking and moving a little but not alot.  Like I said before I was getting on the freeway when the lights first caught my attention, so I was still driving and watching this whole thing happen as much as I could without getting in an accident.  I took my eyes off the lights for a couple seconds to make sure I wasn&#39;t about to hit somebody on the freeway, when I turned back to look again there was nothing in the sky, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, the clouds gave the appearce of movement, however, the lights appeared to remain stationary in relation to a nearby telephone pole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked over to my mother and brother, to see if they were looking at what I was seeing. One of the objects moved to the down and to the right of their orriginal position. Then, the light that didn&#39;t move faded. I didn&#39;t know where the other light went, however, my brother saw it move in two rapid, stop-start movements out of view behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They were bright and just a few degrees apart, stationary. I saw a plane fly over their location. As I looked at them, they simultaniously faded from view. I suspected that a dark thin cloud had gone in front of them, even though I could see a few spotty small clouds in the vicinity that were visiable, this one was not. So I went in, got my binoculars, viewed the area to see to very dim lights/stars in the location that I saw the two lights/stars. They were still there, but no cloud was in sight. I&#39;ve gon back out several nights after, and I believe I can still see the two, but I&#39;m not sure. Very strange. I look at stars often, these have not been there before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But then I realized it couldn&#39;t hurt to describe what I seen. I was looking out my bedroom window one evening in the Fall (end of October) it was near midnight. Directly ahead of me in the sky, I watched mesmerized as a light was in the sky, it was a round, full density light..a ball of light. I didn&#39;t think anything of it, figuring it might be a plane but it was too big and round. But the thing that made me gasp was that one minute it was there, and the next minute, it was as though someone slipped a black blanket over the light, cause it vanished. There was no movement, no speed of light. It was like a candle being snuffed out, because the ball of light vanished in the spot it was in. Maybe it wasn&#39;t a UFO I seen, but it sure was strange and I have never forgotten it. Nor have I told anyone in my town what I seen. As I said I dont want anyone to think it&#39;s one of my wild imaginations because I&#39;m a writer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

These lights lit up five different times over the course of an hour and fifteen minutes. The first time there were what appeared to be two or three amber lights lined up with one red light and then one amber light separate from the line formation. The second time and third time there was only one amber light which pulsated for about two minutes each time while remaining in exactly the same spot on the horizon. The fourth time there were several amber lights clustered with one red. The red light moved horizontally towards the south slightly after all the amber ones faded out. The fifth time they were clustered again the same way without motion, but much further away (possibly over Sun City or the Peoria Sports Center. I approximate that the first three were probably over Glendale or even close to Arizona State University West Campus. Each time they were lit up for quite and extended period of time and very low in the air over the horizon. I have witnessed these lights on three separate occasions over the last two months. The first two times were over the West end of South Mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports of similar phenomenon, submitted by the same witness, for Septebmer 13 and 22, 2004.

My roommate said &#34;What the hell is that?&#34;, I looked up and saw a fat triangle shape with lights (Six?  I forgot already). It was flying south-west. If I were looking at a car on the road, I would guess it was going about 60 mph.  The triangle shape was clear, but there was a hazy, soft fuzziness about the object. It did not make any sound.  The lights were not clear and sharp. There weren&#39;t any clouds in the sky. Several visible stars, but too much light in the city to see many. A jet followed but by the size of the jet (very tiny to the eye), I don&#39;t think it was near the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought wow thats a lot of airplanes at once, but as the blinking lights moved closer i saw that they blinked in a pattern, a huge triangle pattern. one light blinked at the top and then 3 or four blinks down the sides simultaneossly (spelling). this thing was huge and it moved toward the air force base. when it reached about the edge of the military property line it changed direction and instead of moving toward me it headed right towards the flightline and center of the base. I was on a cell phone with the a freind and she pulled up to see the top of the triangles blinking light before it disapeared behind a row of trees 2 steets away. It was high up enough that I could make out all the lights it, even though it never got on top of us,but it was not way up either. I would say about the level planes fly when they are mid level in the sky. it should have been low enough to be heard! they lights moved across the sky together never geting farther or closer apart so I kow they could not be a bunch of different planes. Well my freind and I stood staring into the sky and about 2 minutes after it disapeared a red circular light came from almost exactly where I had seen the triangle last, it moving swiftly our direction. It was solid red never blinking and it was at about the same level as the triangle in height. If it was a plane It would have been audible. It flew at the same level as planes in the sky that night that were clearly heard. this is where this gets military. I am at the far end of the base and I only hear planes take off when they are fighter jets. right when the red circle was overhead of us, we heard fighter jets or jet take off, the roar is loud and unmistakeable. as soon as we heard the roar the red light just was gone, blinked out. it did not zipp off or continue flying it was just gone. like someone turned out a light. I wanted to call military authorities but then I did not want my husband to be blacklisted or something. We are not a fighter base, but my husband says we have a few for defense purposes.  I think it is odd at the timing the fighter took off, and that it made the red circle go away. I have not slept all night long and i watched the news and no one said a thing. this triangle of lights was huge maybe a half mile across, and the red circle was about the size of an airplane. Large not the usual size of the blinking or non blinking lights on a aircraft, the light itself was as big as a plane. I think the red circle came from the big triangle. also odd was the fact that there were a number of airplanes in the area, so many so I commented to myself about it before this happened and then directly after it the sky in are area was completly empty. no more planes. I dont know if that is relevant or not but it stuck out at me. that the once busy sky seemed empty when these other craft arrived.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was much smaller than the moon would appear, but much larger than a normal star or planet.  The light was stationary for about 15 seconds, with no sound. Then it faded quickly and instantaneously reappeared in a different location not far from where it was originally seen but far enough that it could not have been an airplane and reappear that quickly. The light was just suddenly bright again, lasted another 10 to 15 seconds and faded quickly again. We waited, but saw nothing further.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were multiple clusters of dark clouds with gaps in between.  Well I was looking very hard at this one particular dark cloud for at least 30 secnds with this extremely bright light coming from the center.  Then all of a sudden I seen a disc like object shoot upward through the gaps of clouds in a diagonal motion into the evening sky.  I guess this object realized that I saw there light beaming from the dark cloud and took off.

This time, while waiting on a street corner (Old Courthouse at Lord Fairfax) for a bus, I observed a jet flying towards the southwest, at an altitude of perhaps 30 degrees above the horizon, being trailed by two apparently spherical objects, one larger than the other, giving what appeared to be a metallic or specular reflection.  The objects maintained a roughly constant distance from the aircraft of a mile or less, following consistently on the port side of the jet (clearly away from the contrail left by the jet).  The jet (and others like it) were leaving contrails, but the spherical objects did not.  As the airplane and the objects passed into the distance, the smaller of the two spheres became less visible, being obscured in the general haze at times, and eventually all three were lost to view.  Other than the haze, the sky was cloudless.  The jet appeared dark in silhouette against the sky, unlike the objects--i.e., the reflection patterns of sunlight were entirely different for the objects from those of the aircraft.  The observation location was -77.22943 long, 38.91296 lat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While riding the bus home from that point a few weeks later, at nearly the same time of day (about 1615 EST--note that the first observation was in daylight time, though), I again observed the same phenomenon, this time with only one spherical metallic object in view, with the plane and object nearly overhead, rather than lower in the sky and well to the southwest of the location.  The sky had a lot of high broken clouds, and the plane and object disappeared and re-appeared among the clouds more than once.  Because of the angle of observation through the bus window, the phenomenon could be observed for only a couple of minutes this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather permitting, I have continued to observe west- and southwest-bound jets at this time of day since, but have not seen the phenomenon again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was at a festival on a farm, with several hundred people in attendance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was cloudless and no city lights interfered with the view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing on a hillside and looking out over a small valley with another small hill dotted with trees about 200 to 300 yards away.  Above the trees I could see a sky full of stars, some bright, others dimmer, and many others that faint speckled color you get on such clear and crisp evenings in the autumn and in rural areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up into the sky, I noticed that an object the size of a dimmer star was moving, but in an up and down, back and forth, and &#34;s&#34; like fashion.  And, it was moving as if it was like a laser pointer in that it was not the speed of an airplane but simply too swift and too unorthodox.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it caught my attention, I watched some more and tried to fix on it so get to an approximate distance.  What was really curious was that it seems to be &#34;among&#34; the stars but if that were true, it was moving at 100&#39;s of light years a second, which was simply both impossible and most likely to be measured by every astronomer on the planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It clearly had to be within earth&#39;s atmosphere, or just on the edge of space.  On the other hand, if that was the case, and using either the speed of high altitude plants or satellites as a gauge, it was moving over a few 100,000 miles per hour, which was impossible both because of lack of technology and its maneuverability.  It seemed &#34;playful.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I concluded this, I noticed a second light that it seemed to be playing with.  They would chase, do the loop-the-loop, squiggle, zig-zag (but not with sharp angled cuts), and move otherwise chaotic or seemingly randomly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 minutes I was convinced I was seeing something, but still wanted to confirm what I was seeing was real, or at least could call on one witness later on to confirm it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called a friend over and pointed it out to him.  He too saw them, stood for a minute, remarked on how curious they were, but then left to chat up a female near a bonfire.  I stayed and watched some more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess that they had to be about 20-30 miles away but this guess still played havoc with the idea that they seemed equal size or visual appearance to a somewhat faint star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever they were, they were there, they were not airplanes, helicopters, satelites, or weather balloons.  They did not hover.  If they moved slowly like an airplane one would not have noticed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, from the place I was at, they also were faint enough not to draw attention from the crowd.  No other details could be made expect that they were lights moving in incredibly unorthodox fashion and did so for about 20 to 30 minutes...maybe longer, but then I remember the women over by the bonfire and went to join them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

They seemed to be in a tringle formation at first, then these lights began moving very fast, at first I thought  we were seeing spotlights. However, I realized that they probably were not due to the fact that they were &#34;following&#34; the car while they were chasing one another. Also, they seemed to zoom in and out, causing an interesting perception of distance in relation to the activity displayed. First they were to the left of the drivers side, then they came around to the front, then circled around the vehicle. One of the lights then began to appear yellow in colour, then blue again. I began to get a bit nervous (wondering if the lights could be following us), and decided to take the next turn during the drive home. My daughter said that the lights were following us. I did my best to ignore them, and about five minutes later she said they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We made a call to tell my mom, she called back two hours later stating that she and my dad could see these lights as they drove home from a relatives house. Our locations are  on opposite sides of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 17 years ago, aparantly, there had been strange lights reported in the sky on October 19th.

During the night at approximetly 10 p.m. for a duration of 3 hours they observed triangular craft ranging in different sizes and shapes flying over them in massive groups for 3 hours. He has seen these events on two occasions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A week later I was at a campout in my high school behind this cementary when I saw 1 craft multiple times through out the night. It consisted of 3 white lights in a triangular formation flying silently 150-300 feet off the ground. It would fly slowy in which its front light would shut up and then the craft would disappear mysteriously. This happened multiple times. There was 6 or so witnesses at the camp site but most of them are non-beleiving &#34;narcs&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/18/04 22:30|Des Moines (east of)|IA|Light|approx. 1 min.|Seen from 29,000 ft-- two "stars" stared moving, parallel to one another, and abruptly stopped 15 sec. later. Faded out.|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39862.html|232|ndxe200410| Seen from 29,000 ft-- two &#34;stars&#34; stared moving, parallel to one another, and abruptly stopped 15 sec. later. Faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a first officer for a regional airline. I fly an aircraft called a Do328 JET.  I flew a one-day trip on the said date, from our hub to Des Moines, and back the next morning. It was approximately 10:30pm, and we were flying our 32 passenger regional jet westbound at 29,000 ft. It was an absoutely clear sky-the overcast was below us, and we could only see stars above. I had turned down the cockpit display lights to look at the night sky. It&#39;s amazing how many stars you can see with the clounds below you blocking out all the ground lights. The aircraft was on auto pilot, as it always is in cruise, and we had approximately 30 minutes remaining until our destination. I was focusing out my side window (right side of the aircraft). Our cockpit windows are curved, so the visibility is great. You can see up, down, forward and back just by looking out the side. Anyway...I was focusing on the night sky. I have seen quite a few shooting stars lately, so I was looking up at the night sky in hopes of seeing one on this night. I noticed that if you use off-center viewing, which we are told to do at night- you can see many more stars than the normal &#34;bright&#34; ones. It is amazing- millions of them. Anyway, I slowly started looking toward the horizon, and I stopped on two stars that were staggered kind of horizontal from one another. One was &#34;higher&#34; than the other, and they were staggered. I have absolutely no idea why my eyes stopped on these out of all the stars in the sky. They were not the brightest, by far, nor were they the dimmest. Just two average stars. And they were stars- not airplanes, not lights colored any different than any of the other million stars in the sky. I looked at them for probably three or four seconds (estimating of course)and to my complete amazement, the one in &#34;front&#34; (the &#34;higher&#34; of the two) started moving. And not gradually- there was no gradual acceleration- it was like someone flipped a switch, and this &#34;star&#34; started moving. And a moment later, the star behind it did the same thing. As if it was saying, &#34;wait for me!&#34; The two stars moved at rapid pace across the sky- I looked over at my Captain to get his attention, but he was updating his company manual, using a personal light that we each have built into our side panels. I looked away for only a second, but decided not to bother with him. I looked back up at the sky, and they were still there, moving across the sky. Two lights, that looked absolutely IDENTICAL to an average star, travelling as a pair, still staggered, just as they were before they started moving. The total distance the moved was from approximately 20% above the westerly horizon, the direction we were travelling, to just aft of straight above our aircraft, which is a huge distance. My point is, it&#39;s not like it was a night illusion where you stare at a light and after a while it appears to move. This was not like that. The lights moved almost half was across the sky. And to reinforce what I was watching, the two light came to a complete and SUDDEN stop. No deceleration, no gradual change. They went from a fairly rapid pace to a complete and obvious stop. The entire episode lasted, if I had to estimate, 20 seconds. At this point, I was still staring at the &#34;stars&#34; wondering what exactly I was seeing. I didn&#39;t want to take my eyes off of them again. They were now stationary, and straight up from us, in relation to the sky. As I stared, BOTH lights went from their &#34;normal&#34; brightness, and slowly faded out to nothing over the course of approx. another 10 seconds. They both faded out int the exact same manner, as if controlled by a dimmer switch. I realize this is a very wordy explanation for a sighting (or whatever you want to call it), but it was absolutely abnormal. I see aircraft fly by us daily, day and night. This was not in the normal operational altitude of a jet. It was, to use a general term, definately up in &#34;space.&#34; It absolutely blended in with the stars, and originally was stationary. Why did I choose to look at these two particular stars out of the millions available? I have no idea. That&#39;s what really intrigued me- I thought, after it happed- holy cow- I&#39;ve never really spent any amount of time really looking at the stars....and I spend a minute or so doing it tonight and I saw THAT????? It was an extremely odd sight. The very mechanical staring and stopping, the fading of the lights simultaneously when all the other stars around them did not change, and especially how the second light started to move in the exact speed moments after the first one. That&#39;s what really did it. Aircraft that approach us head on, with a relative closing speed of close to 1,000mph can take minutes to pass us on a clear night. These two lights covered almost half of the entire night sky in probably 15 seconds or so. And the fact that I took my eyes off of them, and came back and they were still there proved to me that it was no illusion. I was not scanning the sky hoping to see something odd--I did not imagine this. It was very very odd. I hope this is helpful to anyone interested. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

And it flew right behind a cloud. So I asked everyone if they just saw that but only one of them said he did. He and I explained what we just saw to everyone. Then we continued playing when I looked up in the sky and saw it again. This time it was there longer so I told everyone to look and they did and saw it. Then it dissapeared again. My friend went inside to get his camera so we could take a picture of it. We stood there watching and hoping to see it again. We did see it again but my friend did not get the chance to take the picture due to it being so brief in sightings. We saw it several more timees before it dissapeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was trying to figure out why this plane had such a bright light. As it got closer the light seemed to get smaller, then I started to panic a bit thinking if this is a plane it&#39;s going to crash in my back yard, then it just stopped! I told my son (9) to turn the back porch light off so we could see this thing better. After looking for a few moments we figured out that it was  no airplane. There was no noise and it was hovering, my 9 year old was stunned as I, my 2 1/2 year old was terrified, when we saw this blackish grey triangular craft bobbling, or doing some sort of rotation, then locked in a trajectory and shot out of sight. I have never seen anything like it in my life. After looking about for 10-15 minutes, we noticed 2 military type jets flying patterns....but no sign of the unidentified object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a beautiful clear day and I thought it was odd that a star would be so bright so early. It looked like a helicopeter with a spotlight on but it was staying stationary. It was southwest of my location and with all the trees along the road I would lose site of it periodically. As I drove past a clearing that is along the Shinnecock Bay I couls clearly see it and I slowed down to try to get a better look. It was in my clear sight for about 30 seconds when it shot to the north west faster than anything I&#39;ve ever seen and was gone. It didn&#39;t seem real at the time and I didn&#39;t say anything to anyone. About a week later I was laying in bed with my wife when a show on tv about UFO&#39;s was on. I turned to my wife and started telling her about what I saw and before I could finish she had described the very same thing, but she has seen it over the summer. On your site I see a lot of similar descriptions and I felt I should include mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was gaining altitude at a constant rate and maintaining a constant speed. I figured the object to be a small balloon size until it disappered into the clouds and I realized at that distance it had to be as large as a hot air balloon and traveling at a speed faster then any jet. It was silver metalic, and had a definite sphere shape with the sun light at the horizon shining off of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I noticed a strange formation that seemed to be a gathering of small dark objects. As it passed directely overhead, maybe 2 thousand feet or less, they gathered into one object ,hard to tell if it was rectangle or circle, it continued to fly due east . If they were birds then how come they gathered so close? I kept an eye on it as it reached the bay ,seemed to be going 20miles an hour. I&#39;m reporting this incase someone had a better look then me . I tried to find a north calif reporting center for ufos and only found south calif. Since i listen to Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast i decided to send it to you. I&#39;ve never seen birds bunch so close, perhaps they were higher up in the sky ??? and it was a optical illusion? I doubt it, because it seemed to me as it approached towards where the sun was rising ,it was clear to be on object.I felt they were probe that gathered into one shape and where heading towards east bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone reports a simulair sighting today please notify me since i&#39;ve never seen a ufo before, only in dreams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Second report from same witness.

Before it did this , each one pusled a  light that surrounded it, then instantaneously became one and moved at about 20 miles an hour towards the south east,towards where the sun was already 20 degrees or more in the sky. I was the only one to see it take shape the others that looked couldnt figure out what i could be. One person said it might be a weather ballon and laughed at me after i said i doubted that since it was first 5 dots that formed into one shape. It might be a coinsidance but i felt that it detected i observed it and questioned what it was. This seems to be my 1st sighting. I feel it was orbs that joined together. However maybe it was alien craft ,with super small aliens?? who knows . ... please notify me if anyone else had seen this craft on that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Second report from same witness.

My wife continued to try and race away from it but it kept up with the car ,it suddenly appeared to go up and after a thew seconds the bonnet of our car lit up white,then suddenly the windscreen was covered with this transparent cabbage shaped coloured substance ,after a thew seconds it disappeared,we were both very traumatised by this point and we both felt disorientated, within about 30seconds a car overtook us,it must have been doing about 50 odd miles an hour as it shot ahead of us down the road, then suddenly the vortex appeared again next to the car again but it was higher off the road after a bit it suddenly went up in the air over our car to the left i opened my window and looked up to see what appeared to be two vortexes one electrical spinning on the outside and inside plasma  tear drop shapes spinning around also, it  hovered over a  field to our left for another mile or two before going  right up into the clouds were it seemed to disappear ,this was not light,or lasers we saw ,or anything man made i could quite clearly see the properties of the vortex outside our car,the last thing to say about it of which we do not expect anyone  to believe is that when it was on our windscreen there were moving particles like when you look under a microscope in it,we one again say this is true, this happened,its hard to beleive but it happened the way ive described in this email .Ive become gradually frustrated seeing what we have saw with no evidence, and knowing the science community does not know or understand this, or believe what happened but only we wait now  until someone else sees this too<n>

I looked (skeptically) to where ((wife&#39;s name deleted)) was indicating and saw the object very clearly. It was an &#34;Aw Sh-t...&#34; moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - The object appeared like a distant but clearly round planet would appear out in space, distinctly round, very likely a globe, but with no surface features. It appeared to have a smooth surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - Things began to get pretty weird, pretty fast. We saw more and more  distinct balls appearing throughout the cloud banks. then after there were several large globes / balls in view, some of them suddenly began having 3 - 4 smaller balls appear right next to them... I believe that all of these new spheres appeared to the objects&#39; left, our right. Some of these new smaller globes / spheres then would move off...  I simply could not comprehend what I / we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - We estimated that in total there were at least a dozen large objects and many more smaller objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - They were primarily in two sizes and round shapes, but there were some triangular ones as well. The triangular shapes had rounded corners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - The objects were as distinct and solid-appearing as marbles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - These were very distinct balls or globes, with definite firm outlines and consistent appearances. Some when they appeared were triangular, but they remained that way, and the round ones stayed round. They all remained quite distinct and clear through this episode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - Early on I saw one that was so distinct and bright that I mentioned to ((name deleted)) that it looked like a plane with its landing lights on... Monica told me she had not mentioned it because she was sure it was a plane. Although the light was red, I thought this airplane might somehow help explain what we were seeing. We both viewed this specific object for a while, and it wasn&#39;t an airplane. It moved to the right for a bit, then stopped and hung there.  It hung in the sky throughout the episode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - We spent the next 5 minutes or so excitingly pointing to other globe / ball or triangular objects that simply appeared, or others that were moving left or right relative to all the other balls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - This type of activity was going on throughout our field of vision and beyond so that we had to scan a bit of the sky to take in all the objects. I estimate around a 20 - 30 degree field of view was necessary to encompass all of this. We of course were primarily going from one specific focus to another, but I would occasionally widen my view to take in more of the big picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - As time passed, to the left side of the scenario, we watched some smaller balls that had come out of a larger ball morph into what looked like small, fiery-red, still distinct objects against a very dark background. All of this developed quite quickly. The objects continued to morph into more and more complex shapes and more detail against the dark background. It appeared to me that they morph&#39;d into some sort ofcuneiform, or hieroglyphics. The images were quite distinct and clear, if very small, but what they were specifically I could not tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - ((name deleted)) later described this same activity as looking like &#34;moving braille-like characters&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - This particular display then morph&#39;d into what looked exactly like a medium-sized city at night (black background, white glowing city lights) as seen from onboard an approaching aircraft. This scene first appeared to be a view from directly above a city, but then the view angled down to look exactly like the view one would have as they were landing into a city at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - I kept telling ((name deleted)) that I wished I had brought our camera. Understatement of the century.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - Then, very suddenly the whole show (writing characters, globes, other objects, etc.) began to quickly fade and merge back into (the effect appeared to us) the clouds behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> General Comments: - The entire incident was completely non-threatening with a calmness about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - The whole effect was as though the visual &#34;show&#34; was generally unfolding toward us. It appeared that each new activity took place in front of, or at least came out of and to the side or below the previous objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - We really did not have time to ask ourselves what they were because we were simply too busy pointing out one or another new item or activity to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - It seems certain that ((name deleted)) and I saw the same exact images because we repeatedly pointed out one or another object to each other, and we would then get immediate confirmation. It was unbelievable, except that ((name deleted)) and I clearly saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - There was a family in a house behind us with a motorcycle in their driveway behind a dark red Hummer. I have not yet contacted them to see if they saw anything like we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - I called my mother to see if she had seen anything in the sunset, but she had not watched it tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - I called my friend to see if he or his wife had viewed the sunset, but they had not. I  spoke to my friend at length about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - I called WOAI TV news hotline to see if any one else had seen and reported anything, they had not received any news like this, and neither had their weatherman.<n>
10/17/04 18:50|Converse (near)|IN|Light|5 minutes|TWO SIGHTINGS OF UNEXPLAINABLE LIGHTS OF DIFFERENT ORGIN|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39841.html|251|ndxe200410| TWO SIGHTINGS OF UNEXPLAINABLE LIGHTS OF DIFFERENT ORGIN<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday October,17th my two sons and i were traveling to Wabash,IN. and witnessed what we believe to be two ufos. We were driving and had just turned off of state road 22 eastbound onto county road 1350 heading north when we immediately noticed an extremely bright white light hovering just a little to the right off the road about the height of what a small plane would fly. Ruling out that it was&#39;nt a plane (since it was not moving) and seeing other aircraft in the vicinity, we kept our options open to see if it was moving towards us, it was not. As we continued to get closer we could most certainly tell that this was no aircraft with wings. This object appeared to be very large with a very bright intense white light that we could see some five miles away. Looking straight up in front of us wwithin a quarter of mile, it just vanished. The light had just completly turned itself off. We all three said practically at the same time, &#34;hey where did it go?, it&#39;s gone&#34; We were amazed at what had just happened. This is just the first one we saw. We continued to talk this over with each other for the next 7 to 10 miles i would guess approaching our turn onto the Miami-Wabash county line. When we were just about to turn right (this is in the Mississenewa lake area) we saw out in front of us a somewhat dim amberish orange light appear out of nowhere just about a half to a mile out in front of us. I stopped the van at our turn and we watched this light which seemed to be traveling at a super slow rate of speed for around 30 seconds. Once again, this light just semmed to turn itself off as quickly as it came on. That was it. I just have to say that i have seen unexplainable lights like this before when i would be driving alone over different periods of time but, never have i seen two different sightings on the same night within minutes of each other and having two other witnesses with me. These sighting occured south and north of Converse, Indiana on county road 1350. The first one in Howard County and the second just a bit north of the Wabash-Miami County line.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To the right of these objects was a larger off-white object with darker color on the bottom of it. I estimate these objects to be at approximately 5 or 6 thousand feet high. They were staying in a formation type configuration except for the off-white object which seemed to move at it&#39;s own will staying in close relation to the other 4 objects. When I first spotted these I thought they were skydivers that opened their shoots real high, that&#39;s what it looked like initially. The four smaller objects seemed to be travelling with the winds aloft but the larger object seemed to be able to control itself. Being a pilot I&#39;ve flown airplanes for the past twenty five years and I&#39;ve NEVER seen anything like this. I could&#39;nt even sleep last night thinking about it. I observed this activity for at least five minutes until the objects slowly disappeared from sight. Sky conditions were perfectly clear, visibility unlimited.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Together, the four of them formed a diamond pattern. We watched for approx. 1 hour and then wnet to bed. All four objects remained in rhe sky by the time we retired at approx. 4:15 AM. The object at the top of the diamond from our vantage point displayed a red flashing light from time to time. It was a clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible celestial bodies??

Instead we came face to face with a UFO.  We saw a light in the eastern sky just West of the 59 Hwy. on the Patricia Beach turn off.  We saw it zip almost &#34;cartoon like&#34;  to the South.  Pause and then zip to the North again.  It slowly faded and then it appeared again out of nowhere in the same place.  The thing had colors of red, blue, green, pale yellow, as well as what appeared to be purple.  The two other girls insisted that we leave at that moment and that it was two to one.  They won.  We left and headed south towards Libau.  Once there we stopped at the closed gas station.  We saw the same light in the same general area in the Eastern sky.  It zipped a couple of times to the left and then straight &#34;up&#34; and what appeared to be a figure 8 pattern.  It had done this several times.  I must mention that this occured at the same time that it was the expected time of a meteor shower.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One  light was flashing,  it happened so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 11:30 pm and I was looking outside my window, a second story apt , looking at some stars that seemed to be moving around. I got my binoculars out and started to look but did not see much and just after looking at these stars I saw a multi colored object come out from behind the trees ( mountain ) and rise up.  It was all full of colors, it happened so fast, I saw alot of red, orange and maybe other colors I do not remember it happened so fast and I was exicted. This object rose up, it was a beautifull colored ruby red or cranberry red beautiful color, it had which looked like two lights but only one was flashing. The light that was flashing was to the left, or it&#39;s right light, it was large and flashing quickly and the other was not, it went up and than started to travel towards my direction and I left the apt and went to the other side to see it. I went ouside, looked up and saw it continued  traveling, but it was traveling more like a fast plane, not like a helicopter speed but like a plane, fast plane.  It all happened so fast.  It just came out from behind the tall trees, rising up, alot of colored lights, not a star, nothing like a star it happened so fast I can hardley remember now or right after what I saw, but it was there, like a christmas tree and I saw it mostly from my binoculars at magnified close up.  It is almost like I can not remember it and so soon after?  I saw something, something that was filled with alot of colors, flashing like headlight, only one of the two? flashing? rising up behind the tall trees.  I live in the mountains, a apt complex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had missing time or where I was one minute in one place and than something happened and I was much further along on two occasions and on another like some type of time change, but in the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also had like something like out of body but more like spirit travel, where I instantly and with no notice, begin to feel I was traveling underground, to NY, on to a UFO and I saw three beings, military blanket on the first floor, computer panel circular room on second floor.  Another time, the same type of expereince of travel, where again I was very relaxed but not really asleep, traveled again but this time on a rocket, much faster, landed like a ufo would land  one two three very easy and fast, and I found myself inside a  dome  enclosure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw about 5 years or so ago, a bright white ball of light traveling very fast, from the west to the east around 3am in the am in south florida.  It seemed intelligent to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.   I wonder if what I saw tonight was a ufo, alien  or could it have been a government craft since it was , once up in the sky traveling at a speed more like a fast plane?  but the ...all the colors!  the cranberry apple bright beautiful color red?  the one flashing light?  the light was like a smaller version of a spotlight but much much bigger than any plane would have when seen flying!  it was amazing but it all seemed to leave me, what I saw seemed to leave my memory so fast?   Behind these trees there seems to be activity.  I saw once a large big white like spot light facing me, directly in my direction? than it moved to the right and just was gone?  there is nothing behing these trees but woods....the mountains?<n>

Lauderdale and Naples.  Over the median about 75 feet above ground, there was a round object flying past me in the opposite direction.  It was very large about 40 feet in diameter with a bright light blinking from the center. It looked like it had legs or what appeared to be landing gear coming from underneath.  It was gray or silver.  As it flew past me I looked in my rearview mirror and all I saw very high in the air was a blinking light and then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It immediately kept my attention as the the lights on this aircraft would change drastically. At first, it can only be compared to the waving of a firecracker. As it curved in the sky small bright lights would expand out into a wild flickering trail and then it would compact again and as I exited off the freeway into my neighborhood, I was compelled to follow it as long as I could. It was high enough for me to keep a constant visual. As I caught up to it slightly, it would dim down to just the red light almost going out completely only to come back strong again. The last time I saw the white lights expand-out I was closer and so it was more defined, appearing that the lights were attached and in a half oval shape ( very Spielberg-ish ). I have no idea what this could honestly be. It was brillant against the black sky.I followed until it had dimmed to just the red light and then it dimmed out completely. I waited one minute but it was gone.  It had continued North flying over Miramar until it vanished. I had driven to our quiet local airport, Montgomery Field. There is an aircraft show this weekend at Miramar but I cannot imagine an acrobatic plane capable. To the east I could see in the distance normal aircraft coming in from the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Because of O&#39;hare there are a lot of planes in the sky all the time, and that is how i know that this craft lookes starnge. Also, as i was looking at it, it disapperared completely. On moment it was there, driving/gliding slowly in the sky, not very hight and not very fast, and he next it was gone! completely in one second, in a blink of an eye. But, the oher plane was still in the sky, i waited for  couple of minutes, looked around in the sky, but it did not appear again. also, i know it is pretty cloudy today, but the clouds were too high and the plane too low to disappear into the clouds. And the lights completely disappeared. Also, there were no wing lights or any other lights other than the front headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I call it a UFO, because to me it was  an Unidentifed Flying Object (UFO), whether it was a conventional UFO or not! What is a conventional UFO? Also, i never did see the shape of the craft, which was weird because the sky was pretty bright, and i could see the shape of the plane behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were hunting about 10 miles east of Grand Coulee Dam, Washington along lake Roosevelt. The terrain is sage brush, pockets of brush/aspen trees and rolling to sharp cliff hills and canyons.Our method of hunting is to leave the truck at 3:30 am and climb to near the top of a 1,000 ft. ridge and commence hunting at daybreak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 10/14/04 we were about half way up the ridge at about 4-4:30 am in the dark, we stopped for a breather, sat down an looked across the canyon at the steep ridge on the other side, this ridge has sheer drop offs of volcanic rock, has no roads and in most places it is to steep to walk. The outline of the ridge top was visable in the night sky. We then observed a light just below the ridge top and soon another light a mile or so futher up the canyon also just below the same ridge top. We commented to each other how in the heck did someone get up there its impossible! The lights were about the size and color of a small headlight, soon the lights started to move much the same as a butterfly, up, down, 90 degree turns, the movements covered about a 400 yard area back and forth up and down. They changed from a yellow headlight color to a greenish color and occasionaly a redish tone, the light farther up the canyon sometimes would split into two lights and then come back together into one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked at them with our field glasses and it just made them look bigger but not different. We observed this for about 20 min. to a half hour, the light across the canyon went dim and then out, the light further up the canyon continued, going from one to two lights then it moved to the top of the ridge, turned very bright and larger and then went out. that was the last we saw of them. After daylight came we hunted till about noon and met up with our 35 year old hunting partner who hunted the upper end of the ridge we were on, after talking hunting for awhile, we mentioned did you see the lights on the far ridge, his comment was, what the h--- was that, as it turned out he observed the same thing we did except that due to his position he was not able to see the secound light at the head end of the canyon. As a note it should be mentioned that the lights did not give off a beam of any kind so as to shine on the ground, nor was there a beam of any kind going to them such as someone playing a joke with a laser or other device.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is getting more complicated all the time and the sad part is I don&#39;t have the time, however I can&#39;t seem to leave this alone until I have all the facts straight, correct and no stones unturned so that I may properly retire this incident in the archives of my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will re-submit my original report or add this as a footnote, let me know which, and how to do it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were actually four of us in our hunting party, one hunter did not see what the other three of us saw so I considered him irrelevant to our sighting and omitted him in the report.  The four hunter who was the last to leave his vehicle (10 m. behind) also had the longest distance to hike in the early darkness. He would be cutting across the ridge diagonally below where my partner and I had just come up from. He is also 35 years old and very physically fit. (two 35 year olds, a 61 and 63 year old). At the time us old-timers were taking a breather and noticed the strange  lights across the canyon, I noticed and remarked to my partner &#34; there is Ron&#39;s flashlight&#34; it was only on for a moment, then a few minutes later I noticed out of the corner of my eye his flashlight again. He was just about where I thought he would be in the dark morning. My partner never looked over on either occasion and he has since told me he was so keen on the lights across the canyon that he didn&#39;t bother looking. Normally we do not use a flashlight but generally carry one in case its needed. I guess something stuck in my subconscious about the look of his flashlight appearance as it was just a very small area of bunch grass/sage brush that lit up on the ground, and I didn&#39;t see the flashlight bulb itself, it all seemed pretty normal at the time because his body was probably blocking the flashlight bulb itself, but as I thought about it days later,<n> <n><n> I called him on the phone and I mentioned to him that I had seen his flashlight come on a couple of times that early morning. His answer to me was &#34; I didn&#39;t have one with me that morning&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My only answer to this is that it was part of the strange light occurrence and the lights followed him up the ridge with enough distance behind him that he never saw them, he also stated that he never stopped and turned around as he had a long way to go before daylight.

10/16/04 03:30|Savannah|GA|Light|about 30 seconds|Red blinking light appears three times, changing speed and direction many times before fading away.|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39804.html|264|ndxe200410| Red blinking light appears three times, changing speed and direction many times before fading away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was extremely clear and cool outside around 3:00 in the morning and my friend and I decided to lay out on our roof and watch the stars for awhile. After laying there about fifteen minutes I saw a shooting star. And then after another fifteen minutes or so, I saw what at first looked like another shooting star, but it was not moving at the same velocity and it was very red (red like a star looks red, not like a cherry red) and blinking. The blinking looked more like a change in light intensity and I then thought it was a satellite because of the blinking and because it was moving along so steadily and it didn&#39;t come and go quickly like a shooting star would. It just kept cruising along. After a few seconds of this, I pointed at it and began to exclaim to my friend that a satellite was moving over us. As I began to speak, I noticed a slight slowing of the light&#39;s pace, and then a sudden stop. It hung in place for about half a second and then moved left at a slower speed. After a second of this, it stopped again and began to curve down and to the right. It was about then that my friend noticed it. It curved for a couple seconds and quickly moved back to the left and it rapidly alternated between a fast and slow pace. It then slowed drastically and drifted upwards and it faded away next to a fairly bright star.  This all occured in a span of time no greater than thirty seconds. The red blinking light came back two more times and followed a similar type of pattern. It would appear in the same area of the sky as it had before, and it would move in one direction for a few seconds and then it would constantly alter its speed and direction until it finally slowed and would always return to the same area in the sky before fading away.<n>

I was awakened about 3:00 or 3:30 a.m. by a dog barking way off in the distance and a VERY strange sound that kept getting louder as it approched and flew directly overhead and then beyond and out of hearing range. Of course it&#39;s extremely difficult to describe sound but I&#39;ll try... It sounded like bubbles popping or like you stuck a straw into a bowl of water and blew accompanied by an electronic high pitch sound that would rise and fall about four times per second. No whirring of blades, no engine sound either, jet or piston, whatsoever. Scared me to death!  I&#39;ve never heard anything like this in my life. I&#39;m sorry, but I didn&#39;t see this thing because I was tucked into my sleeping bag and I had tarps draped and tied overhead to cut out the wind. I thought about trying to get a look at it, but by the time I got my wits enough to think about this it was very close and I guess I was just too scared or something and, man, the sound was just reverberating through the woods and it was just too weird. I&#39;m really sorry now that I didn&#39;t try to see it but I just laid there wide-eyed and I bet you would have done the same (and I had a loaded Marlin 35).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

At first I thought it was a commercial jet, but it was not moving, just hanging in the sky-absolutely still and much to high and to bright to be a helicopter.  I awoke my girlfriend who came out to see it, she could not make any sense of it.  After a minute or so it began to pulse; going from bright red to a faint transparent red, then back to bright red.  The glow was crisp and had a pureness to it; there was no haze or distortion at all.  I went to get the phone to call a friend to take a look at it from his location when my girlfriend called me back, the light was gone, she said that it began to flicker rapidly and that it just disappeared with no trace of movement.  This is the second but different U.F.O. I have seen in the last two months from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> RE: Red Light Over Phoenix<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a follow-up from my report of last night.  This morning at about 9:00 I went outside to look for the ‘red glowing object’ again.  In the exact same spot as the night before there was a metallic silver object motionless in mid air at the exact same altitude as the object I saw the night before.  It was not moving, it was perfectly still.  I went inside to make a call to NUFORC and the object was gone when I came back.  I would estimate the location of the object to be over Cave Creek Rd and the 101 Freeway at an altitude of a thousand to two thousand feet AGL.  I took a photo but my lense was not strong enough to capture anything of clear value.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

They were in a perfect circle around thew horizon and were quite low in the sky. My best judgment tells me they were agligned aroung a 10 to 15 mile circumfrence.  I then looked through my moonroof and there was one directly above me.  It appeared to follow along right above my car as I drove down the hwy.  The 10 in teh circle then began to quickly dart about and then began to all quickly move outwards and then disappeared over the horizon.  I looked up at the one above me and it moved straight up into the air slowly and eventually disappeared into the clouds above. The spheres themselves were perfect in shape and did not blink of flash or pulsate.  Their light was solid and very bright.  They stayed perfectly still while they were at rest and darted around around like no plane or helicopter I have ever seen.  I rolled down my window to listen for the sound of a helicopter or plane, but there was only silence.

WE are a mile outside the Rock Hill, SC city limits.It was clear and there were many stars visible.  Toward the S-SE, I saw a faint blink of a light high in the sky. I watched &amp; 10 seconds later, saw it again.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked through my binoculars &amp; told my husband to look in that direction &amp; saw the blink again. Through the binoculars I could only see the light blink.  I could not see any outline of an object. Several commercial airplanes flying at high altitude flew over as we watched.  The flash seemed to be much higher than these.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I switched to my monocular nightscope &amp; continued watching the flash, which came every 10 seconds.  Through the nightscope, I was able to see many more stars &amp; got a fix on the flash&#39;s position based on 2 stars close by.  The light moved slightly to the East, stopped, moved to the west, then north. It made several more moves, then moved due east &amp; out of the area with the 2 stars.  It was soon out of view because of trees &amp; my roofline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute later we saw with the naked eye, a dim object moving south to north along the same area of sky.  It moved out of sight.  Another couple of minutes later we saw a similar object moving north to south on the opposite path.  I watched it with the nightscope &amp; it suddenly flared up very brightly &amp; then dimmed until I could hardly see it.  It moved out of sight.  These 2 objects appeared to be satelites, except for the flare-up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, we observed 3 meteors in that same area. (The Orionids are visible now) I have watched every night since &amp; have not see it again.  The next day a high altitude plane made many Y-shaped contrails across the sky. I actually watched as it cut off the contrail to connect the Y.  This happened for 2 days in a row.  I don&#39;t know if there is a conection or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our Bio info is as follows: I am a 47 yr old SCUBA Instructor.  I also was in Civil Air Patrol while in high school &amp; earned my observer wings.  I have flown in many types of aircraft &amp; spent a lot of time on Air Force bases.  I have lived under the flight path of Charlotte Douglas International airport for 14 yrs.  I saw my first UFO with my family when I was around 10 yrs old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is a corporate exec in the IT field.  He is very analytical &amp; tries to reason through sightings like this, but was truly stumped &amp; a little un-nerved by this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((AMENDMENT TO ORIGINAL REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Amendment to previous report on 10/22/04<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is an ammendment to my previous report dated 10/22/04. I got the times mixed up on the 2 objects that were a few minutes apart going in opposite directions. They were right after dark on Oct 15th. The object that blinked every 10 seconds was between 10 &amp; 10:30 PM &amp; there were commercial aircraft flying in the same area of sky during the sighting but the object appeared to be much higher in the sky. After reading up on satelites, I believe the 2 objects were satelites, with the one that flared being an irridium flare. The 3rd object, however, has me stumped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

They were each about the size of a dime held at arms length and appeared to be over the nearby village of Secor, IL.  They were in an uneven triangular formation with a vertical orientation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared to ascend in a slow manner and simply disappeared.  The  three lights were large but dull orange spheres. They were not entensly bright and were about 15 degrees above the horizion and rising to about 25 degrees before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting lasted at least 10 seconds.

From my vantage point in the drivers seat, the lights were approx 30 to 40 degrees above horizontal. They initially were above the tree line. It was a CLEAR and UNMISTAKEABLE formation of lights in a chevron pattern. I believe that there were four lights on each leg of the chevron. I judged the apparent size as subtending an angle approximate to the width of 3 fingers held together at arms length. After approx 15 seconds the chevron was blocked by roadside treeline and I lost sight of it. My recollection is that I noticed at the same time airplane lights in the same area of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My neighbor was outside on the phone when at approximately 8:05PM, she saw a strange light rising from the horizon. She called me immediately to come out and look at it with her. Looking South by South West, a single white light was traveling straight up from the horizon. While we were watching it, (what seemed to be several miles away), we noticed a second light, then a third until we had counted eight in all. Each subsequent light seemed to be a mile or so behind the one before it. The fifth light in this formation was larger than the rest and glowing red. The sixth light was much closer to the red one than the others, and seemed to be &#34;dancing&#34; around it. There was a light cloud cover starting at approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. We watched until the last light passed behind the clouds. Elapsed time: 10-15 minutes. In doing some research, I found an article about a sighting being called the Estrella Lights (West Metro Phoenix Area, June 14th, 8:40PM) which is similar, but in this sighting, the lights were in a horizontal configuration and much closer together but did have a red light in the midst of the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My training is in cognitive psychology and I no doubt lack the background and vocabulary to describe this object in precise terms, so please bear with me.  Fortunately, my training and background  did provide me with the good sense to sketch the object immediately after seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The overall shape of the object was roughly similar to that of a crescent wrench. The end-portions were like different sized semi-circles, with the one at the nose being smaller and perhaps less &#39;closed&#39; than the one aft.  The portion connecting the two crescents, or the &#39;handle-part&#39; to continue the crescent-wrench metaphor, was oblong--perhaps something like a cigar, the extreme aft portion of which extended slightly into the inside of the crescent and was rounded. The end &#39;points&#39; of the aft crescent seemed to have rounded objects attached or were perhaps rounded themselves as if there were engines (?) or something at those points.   I cannot estimate speed or altitude reliably.  I might hazard to guess that it was roughly the same size as a commercial jet.  It appeared to be a dull black or dark-grey colored-- not the shiny metalic surface of commercial jets.  It did seem to have a noise of some sort, but it wasn&#39;t very loud and I did not notice any visible exhaust or vapor; however, I don&#39;t recall now if the sky were overcast or not, which perhaps could mask a vapor trail (?).   If it were, it must have been below any significant amount of haze or cloud vapor because I could see it clearly.  Although it was 6:22 pm, it was still early enough to be seen easily.  I did not notice any lights.  The object moved outside of my view after a few seconds (10-15?) due to buildings around me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What struck me as odd, was that the semi-circle or crescent on the front was opened in the direction of travel, i.e. the &#39;points,&#39; if you will, of the semi-circle on the front of the &#39;fuselage(?),&#39;  pointed in the direction of travel. Perhaps this is not unusual in aviation today, but it is counter-intuitive to the casual observer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should also note that Lawrence is about 50 miles or so south/south west of Kansas City Internationl (MCI) airport.  We are also about 100 miles east  of Ft. Riley, a military base. I assume that this is some kind of new military plane or something, but  the fact that no one else I showed my sketch to (non-military, non-aviation folks such as as myself) had ever seen one made me think I should report it.  I also did a google search and was interested in the account of the engineer from Huntsville, AL who posted on your site in June of 2003.  I was very interested in comparing my sketch to his if what I describe here is not a currently identifiable aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am not sure I can even describe it.  It had rained all night and was still raining, so I drove her to school. It was pitch dark, rainy, and maybe a little cloudy (hard to tell in the dark).  We are driving down a coulee in the country on a county gravel road.  Right in the bottom of the coulee, suddenly these six elliptical &#34;lights&#34;, all in a row, about windshield height, appear out of nowhere.  I thought they were faintly yellow.  My daughter thought they were white---not really bright, sort of like headlights in the fog brightness, but different shape.  We both braced because we thought we were going to hit something.  Then, just as suddenly, they seemed to go over us and were gone briefly.  They reappeared one more time in the same way as we went up the hill and then we never saw them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It flew directly to the left of me and it looked like a large jumbo jet but without wings.  It was silent, and I saw no lights on this object.  I felt it was a plane that was about to crash because it was so low to the ground and now just 50-100 feet above the road and to my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed me and I looked in the mirror expecting to see a large explosion/smoke or some evidence of a crash but there was nothing.  I could no longer see anything as the sky was dark.  Again I did not lose any power to my car or radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I picked up a co-worker in Punta Gorda and continued to travel south to Estero, Fl., that morning, and saw nothing more but did mention my sighting to my co worker, and she just laughed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We returned home the following night (Sunday) around midnight, and about 10 miles south of Punta Gorda, we both witnessed another bright &#34;orb&#34; like object high in the sky.  We watched this for about a minute and it didn’t seem to move, then suddenly it was gone.  We did not see it move, it was just there one moment and gone the next.  Shortly afterwards as we were exiting the highway to return to her house, she looked at her watch and commented that it was much later than it should be  when we arrived back.  It seemed to take us approx 45 minutes longer to make the trip from Estero to Punta Gorda that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had kept these 2 &#34;sightings&#34; to myself all this time until I mentioned something to my sister in law recently, and it was she who said that round &#34;orbs&#34; have been reported in the past as UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then found your web sight for reporting any sightings, and felt that perhaps this may be significant, even though it has been quite sometime ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the dates of the two sightings are approximate.

I remember thinking that it was funny that a car would pull out from this wooded area since there is no road or driveway.  It was very dark out but from driving this road every day.  I was aware that there were no roads on that side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the orb which I had assumed was a vehicle light disappeared from behind me, but then noted in my passenger side mirror that this &#34;orb&#34; ( the color was slightly more yellowish than a clear headlight) was following directly to the right of my vehicle.  This &#34;orb&#34; followed me along the road for approximately 5 miles &#34;bouncing&#34; along the right  side of my car.  I also remember  thinking that it looked like the &#34;bouncing ball&#34; on the old  Mitch Miller show.  I then remember thinking maybe this was a UFO, but from anything I had ever seen on TV, this was not a UFO vehicle, and my radio was playing and the car was running so I  just couldn’t figure out what this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END REPORT))<n>

As i was looking out i looked up and from above my house i saw a medium shaped perfect triangle slowly flying in the north east direction, the triangle had 3 white lights at each point and one blinking red light in the center of the craft and if i had put my hand up to the craft it would be 2 thumbs thick and the left and right tips would just barely stick out at the ends. At that early hour of the morning there was just enough light so that i could see a perfect triangle outline in the dark blue morning sky. My bedroom window was open at the time and the thing that got my attention was that the street was completely silent and this craft was not gliding, not at the slow pace it was moving at and it was completely dead silent no noise whatsoever. I kept watching as it moved north east for about 30 seconds or so and the triangle shaped craft eventually disappeared over the horizon. Theres one more thing i would like to mention that i feel is very important, im not at all a morning person, i never get up early, not since my school days and the thing about that morning is that i woke up and it&#39;s almost as if someone or something told me to get up open the blind and look out the window and when i did 5 secends later this triangle shows up. It&#39;s as if for some reason unknown i was meant to see that triangle that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

They moved so fast that if I had blinked I would have missed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say my friend off 11+ years and I were a little more than shocked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood out there for about 10 more minutes, hoping to see just a little more, but nothing else had occured.

We stopped to see what it was, if we could. The fog was comming right twords us, and so was the light. Eventhough it was covered in a haze of fog you could tell this was no plane, it was getting closer and brighter. It was very big and almost right on top of us when we all got scared and ran.

We noticed a really bright light in the sky, about half the size as a dime in the sky about right in front of us. then 10-15 minutes later we noticed it was alot further to the left. We started looking at it periodically and noticed it was slowly moving horizontally across the sky but very slow. I don&#39;t know how close we were so I cant tell you exactly how fast it was going. All the time it was gradually changing colors from a bluish, to a greenish, to a yellowish color, i emphasize on the &#34;ish&#34; because the colors were changing so fast we could not make out one specific color at a time. Then we were both watching this light yapping about god knows what, probobally trying to figure out what it could be, when all of the sudden the light got really dim, then it flashed really bright while changing colors still and vanished from the sky for good. Then a week later the exact same scenario happend to a T. Same lights, same slow moving &#34;craft&#34;, same dim to bright and disapear action. Until then I did not believe in E.T&#39;s or UFO&#39;s, but since that night i&#39;ve been reading alot and digging deep and now i&#39;m sure what I saw is what I think it is. Sorry it has taken me this long to share this information, but you have to understand I am hard headed and it has taken me nearly this long to realize what I had seen that night.

About 500 feet in the air and just about half a mile away from the road was a super bright white light. I slowed my truck down to a stop as 6 more lights lit up!. The formation was about 75 to 100 yards long. They were equal distance from one another. They were all lit up for about 3 seconds and then they were gone. The lights gave off no visible beams and didn&#39;t light up the ground. The sky was clear. There were no clouds. I got the biggest goose bumps of my life!. So I decided to called sheriff&#39;s department and see if anyone else had reported seeing it.

PD))|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39791.html|293|ndxe200410| Bright orange hued lights that pulsed, faded, disappeared, reappeared in different locations and danced with quick movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From our vantage point, we could see everything from the NW to the SE for as far as the eye could see, on a perfectly clear night with absolutely no overcast and a new moon.  The first object was a single orange light, straight west from the lookout.  It just appeared,midway in the sky, stayed for 10 to 15 seconds, very bright (the brightest light in the sky) and then quickly dimmed and vanished.  It reappeared maybe 10 seconds later in the same spot only to once again dim and vanish.  We then noticed a trio of orange lights to the SSW of our location, lower to the horizon, and watched them for maybe 2 minutes until they too just disappeared.  That group of 3 lights reappeared  further to the east of where it previously was, and remained in the same formation for a few more minutes until a 4th light appeared.  It was then that the first light we saw straight to the west reappeared.  Both groups of lights remained visible for several more minutes until the westward light dimmed and vanished, and the group of 4 vanished a minute after that.  The light to the west reappeared after a few minutes, followed a minute later by the group of lights, now 3 again in the same original formation... one light with another directly above it and another above and to the right of that one.  The single light vanished after a few minutes, and the trio a minute after that.  That was the last to be seen of the single westward light.  The group to the SW reappeared, in the same formation while 2 more lights appeared slightly eastward of those.  These 2 groups of lights acted exactly like the first... the westward light(s) would dim and vanish and the SW group would vanish soon after. All of these lights would pulse with brightness, and would have periods of solid brightness.  They all vanished and did not return, but now a single light would appear from the south and slowly grow brighter and slightly gain in elevation.  At the closest point (still too far to be determined), you could see colors of red, blue and green pulsating around the main white w/orange  light.  The colors could be seen with the naked eye, and confimed all that much more with binoculars.  That object would vanish and reappear several times, and even sped west to east quickly but shortly, sped back to the west and even at one time &#34;danced&#34;... very quickly speeding in an abstract pattern only to vanish again.  This all took place over a course of 2 1/2 hours, beginning at 8:00pm. and when we left at 10:30, the time between sightings was getting longer.  A curious thing... when the lights would vanish, we would see lights from passing aircraft pass by the area within a half minute, and the lights would reappear when the aircraft was gone.  All in all, it was an incredible sight to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that celestial bodies would have to be ruled out as a possible cause of the sighting, before we could conclude that the witness observed genuine UFO&#39;s.

10/14/04 14:20|Reno|NV|Changing|2 hours|White snake -like plume with objects on either end|12/14/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41070.html|294|ndxe200410| White snake -like plume with objects on either end<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened on a beautiful windless and cloudless clear day around 2:20 pm. I work at Meadowood Mall and went out to my car in the west parking lot. When I got into my car and looked west, I noticed a thick, white irregular rope-like plume in the sky. It was low in the sky and I thought it might be a stunt plane spewing out a trail. It was moving west to east about a half mile away maybe, and to the north of my position. It move slowly. As it approached closer going towards the Reno airport it was obviously not the smoke coming out of a plane, but two strange objects connected by this snake-like white plume. The substance was not whispy like smoke, but thick and shiny white. This object is a little hard to describe. The best I can explain the the rope-like substance is if a can of shaving cream was shot into a basin of water and then &#34;froze&#34;. The object became more vertical, with an ovoid object on top that appeared to be moving a little back and forth as if creating the plume, with the plume in the middle and an orb-like object on the bottom. One of the dock people was dumping garbage in a big dumpster in the parking lot and I got out of my car and brought his attention to it. We both watched and commented on the sheer strangeness of the thing. The object was passing north of us now, and a couple of customers in the parking lot were noticing it too. As the thing headed east, the plume began to tighten up, and become more &#34;straight&#34;. I decided to get a couple of employees to come out after watching it for about 10 minutes. When they came outside, the object had attained a higher altitude and was sitting south of the airport close to Rattlesnake Mountain. As we all continued to watch it, an older woman stopped her car by us and asked &#34;what is that thing?&#34; We said it looked like a ufo. She smiled and drove on. By this time I was MIA at the store, so I had to go back inside. I took every opportunity to go back outside  and observe the object, which had now turned into a white orb. At 3:30 pm I took my hour lunch, and watched the object for an hour with a friend of mine who popped into work to see me. It moved west of its position south of the airport and closer to us. It appeared to change shape sometimes from an orb to a rod, then back into an orb in a blink of an eye. We saw four or five planes fly near or over the object. They appeared to be taking an interest in the object. At 4:25 or so I had to go back inside. A couple of young guys had stopped thier truck near us and asked what it was we were looking at. As I walked back to the store they were still looking at it. The next day more people at work said they had seen the strange thing also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is now 12/11/04 and once again I went to my car around 3:15 pm to take a break and saw another white orb-like object to the north east moving south west towards my position. It moved in a slightly zig-zag way, and sometimes appeared to have a small tail. It looked like it was swimming through the air. It stopped and headed north east then, getting smaller and smaller until it was out of sight. It was a warm still day with few clouds and good visibility. Well, it is after this sighting that I decided to put my two cents in. To be fair, I have had several sightings of these things in Sparks where I live. My unit is almost directly above the flght paths of the commercial airlines. These sightings always happen on clear still days. What they are is anyone&#39;s guess, but they seem intelligent and &#34;alive&#34; When people ask me why I have had sightings and they have not, my advise is &#34;look up&#34;!<n>

Then we noticed several yellow lights, and a few blue lights, and a red one which was also very bright. We watched from 2am until 5:30am. We saw many different things. The very bright blue one  (the first one) we saw had something that looked like a beam from it, and the only other one that did was the red one. The red one was the closest and the last one we saw. They all moved in eradic motions. Up and down, and then left and right, and then they would go in circles, and also do zigzag and diaganol movements. Many were in a triangler formation, and then some were in lines. At least one of the triangles were connected to another, and there very well may have been other patterns but we were caught up in the excitement. An intresting note is 2 of the other witnessess were not in the same location as the other 3. We called them to see if they saw the same things we did. We also saw a LOT of shooting objects which only appeared for a second as they moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At on point it was directley ubove us and through the sun roof I could see it clerley. one whiteish blue light was in the center with 4 lights surrounding it those lights would change color and rotate positions. it made a slight humming sound. (it was probobley a bad idea but the sunroof was compleatley open). A short while later it took off behind us and later was followed by a low flying hellocoptor. wich surprised us. I think the hellocoptor was following it because it was flying DANGEROSLEY LOW and in the same directon as the craft whin it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate; does not indicate the location of the sighting.

The sightings are similar to my first report.  These bright lights or stars appear in the Northward sky, low.  They appear as a pop of light the size of a bright star and fade away as though someone has turned a dimmer switch to shut them off.  On October 13 around 20:00, I saw seven (7) of these appear in a time span close together.  On October 18 I saw six (6) between 20:25 and 20:50.  Also, I saw the reoccurance of a star or light moving fast across the sky that same night...it appeared to be right behind a plane, suddenly it took a 90 degree turn towards earth, traveling a very short distance then disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of these sightings have been on extremely black, clear nights...the Milky Way seems to paved with millions of diamonds...just a wonder to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt honored to see my first sighting last Spring, of course, I never dreamed that I would continually see these amazing sights.

My number three picture only show a very faint object that looked like a smoke ring, it was about the same place above the large rocks as the disk and dome. We did not se it weth our naked eyes.

The little bit of sun left reflected off of something in the sky, a plane I had assumed, and I looked up to see why it was so bright. As I stopped and waited for the reflection to dissipate I realized that there was absolutely no noise accompanying this &#34;plane&#34; so I asked my boyfriend to look up at it as well. when the reflection finally dissolved I couldn&#39;t understand what I was looking at, it was a perfect oval, a brilliant smooth silver surface covered this ovular shaped object and it glided, smoothly, accross the sky. It kind of hovered, it moved without any noise, swiftly but gently accross the sky. I thought &#34;this has to be a plane or a helicopter or something like that, maybe a toy blimp some kid is playing with&#34; but it made absolutely no noise, and living in the town I do it isn&#39;t hard to hear noise it is that quiet. My boyfriend and I just stood there, baffled, wondering what the hell it was, trying to come up with what it could possibly be. We even went so far as to (later that evening while we were still in awe at the encounter) look in the phonebook and ask around about any nearby military bases that may be working on aircrafts. We came up with no leads. This solid, smooth, silver, soundless, oval had no windows. at first I thought it to be small, but as it neared directly above my boyfriend and I, we realized it was huge, and it was closer to the groud than any helicopter or plane could be, it was too big to be a toy or a kite, there were no windows! How was it operating if it had no windows or a remote control? After it had passed over us this, oval (as I like to call it), shot off, extremely fast, and seemingly dissappeared from sight. I have only ever seen it one time again, when I was walking in the mountains, alone, and I dare say I ran back to my dorm room (college student) as quickly as I could because I have heard too many scary tales to open a tale of my own. Believe me, I am not a natural believer of the supernatural, I do believe in ghosts, but I didn&#39;t really until I encountered one, I assure you now I am also a firm believer of aliens, as crazy as it may seem I cannot deny what my eyes beheld on that strange october day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

10/13/04 01:25|Galveston|TX|Light|30 mins|Starting on October 10, 2004, I have seen an obj. in the sky twice.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus may be one of the objects.  PD))|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39759.html|309|ndxe200410| Starting on October 10, 2004, I have seen an object in the sky twice previously in the past week and a third time last night, I saw two. Usually I noticed it around 2 or 2:15 am (while I was working at my home computer, I am a writer and so is my husband) and it would be noticable for about 30 to 45 minutes but since it was early in the morning I have usually gone to bed before it disappeared. However, on Monday night 10/12 it disappeared before I went to bed.  I might add the weather was good and no other stars were visible in the sky when we have seen these lights. After the first sighting, my husband up out of bed to see it/them. The object(s) appears on the Gulf water side due East and Southeast over the Bolivar Peninsul/ Texas City area.  You see a belt of lights parallel to the horizon seeming to rotate around whatever it is, changing colors from white to yellow to green occasionally with a red flash.  Normally it hovers in one spot moving ever so slightly but last night 2 of them appeared at the same time. At first they were a good distance from each other then one moved to be in tandem with the most easterly one and they were close to each other high over the roof top of my neighbors home but I have no idea how high they were, I would say extremely high.  On Monday night the one that was there was kind od darting around slightly before it disappeared. I am concerned and I do not know what to do; because as you may know there are many petroleum refineries here in this area and the salt dome oil storage is underground at High Island not far from here. I guess I am worried these might be some sort of spy vehicles but they just seem so unusual that I cannot believe others have not seen them and I have to think the US military and the Coast Guard would be strengently guarding these refineries, so why have they not seen them? We tried to get some photos but our camera is not good enough for this type photograpy.  We do have a telescope and we are going to adjust it today so we can possibly see something in the next few days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus may be the object.  PD))<n>

The ends of it were facing east/west but it traveled north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can remeber watching it for some where close to 20 second and then rushing over to the light of the gas station and filling up my front tire. I biked home and I kept looking over my back to see if I could see it again.

It look as if it was slowing down to land near us when at least 6 F16 jets came from the east west and the north sky and started to chase the ufo. And just as they were getting close to it it shot back into the air and started moveing toward northeast and went over the oak trees in my front yard i then ran to the end of my drive way to see the where the ufo was headed and watched as the ufo took off with such a high speed that it was gone leaveing the f16 jets in its dust. It was an awesome sight to see this thing move .i was amazed to say the least. after it was gone i counted at least 10 to 15 jets going each direction in the sky looking for this thing for about 20 mins after it was seen. all the dogs in the neighborhood were barking like crazy for a while after the ufo took off from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On this particular night in October, my friend, who was visiting me had to go back to his place which is farther away.  He left on his bike at about 11 pm, he had to cross a long stretch of forest before hi can hit the civilization.   While driving on a lonely deserted unlit road, he was disturbed by a slowing moving craft, at first he dismissed it as an aeroplane, but when the craft came closer, he didn&#39;t beleive what he saw.  A disk like object with flashes of color lights stopped momenterly.  He stopped the bike and couldn&#39;t beleive what he saw. He says the craft was in a static position for a couple of minutes before it zoomed away in vertical direction with amazing speed.  This friend was not aware of any UFOs. Only when he told about this sighting to me, I was able to figure out what he saw was something unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

At first, I thought it was the ISS (International Space Station). It appeared to have the same orangish/white color as the ISS. I then noticed it had a haze or glow around it, and was LARGER in relative size than the ISS. The object tracked on a path similar to a satellite, but did not &#34;Feel&#34; the same. It dissappeared over the horizon to the north. The conditions were CAVU: Ceiling And Visibility Unlimited, with a sodium vapor street light 300 feet to my relative west. After checking the Marshall Space Flight Center&#39;s J-Pass Web Site (http://science.nasa.gov/RealTime/JTrack/3D/JTrack3D.html) for satellite overflights and found none near Florida, I called MacDill AFB in Tampa. The Duty Officer said they had no information on any missile tests or other activities, and would log my call.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This COULD NOT have been a commercial aircraft, although it was moving at the same apparent visual speed as a jet at 20,000 feet.  The headlamps on a jet are brightest when seen from the front (this object was heading away!!!).  The time of the event (8:01 pm EDT) is very accurate. Duration was less than 15 seconds.  This was definitely NOT a jet aircraft!  What was it?  I doubt if it was a satellite, as it was going from North to South.  It maximum brightness was about -1 magnitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were enjoying the scenery when one of our party noticed a craft that seemd to be hovering under a cliff. The craft was cylindrical in shape with no obvious doors or windows. The color was some sort of metalic but it&#39;s difficult to describe it because looking at it hurt our eyes. (As in some sort of camoflage). Suddenly we heard a sonic boom and 3 fighter jets flew over, in what seemd to be a tight formation. They passed over us about half dozen times. All of us were very afraid, both of the noise and the low passage of the jets. When the jets had finally gone the craft left. It passed directly over us. It made no sound but we all felt terrible pressure in our heads and all our watches stopped. About a half hour passed until we felt strong enough to come down from the mountain. The fighter jets might have been from the U.S. but we are not entirely sure, a large Russian fleet has been manovering on the west coast of our country for a week now, they have not given any expalnations about what they are doing there. There seemed to be no markings what so ever on the jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report does appear to have been submitted from outside the U. S..

I was reclining and looking up at the sky.  It was a very clear day with some cumulus clouds, approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit.  The ship was moving so I cannot recall how much of the wind was apparent versus true but there was certainly a breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted a round object that darted in and above the clouds (my estimate is 6,000 -10,000 feet).  There was no discernable pattern to the movement but it &amp;quot;zigzagged&amp;quot; within the area of one particular cloud.  It made incredibly rapid changes in direction and would descend and ascend through the cloud.  As it changed direction it almost seemed as if it were on the end of a pendulum - it seemed to slow just a bit before quickly moving 180 degrees in the opposite direction.  I cannot estimate the speed but it appeared to be moving at a fairly high rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the estimated altitude and flight pattern I discounted it from being a bird.  It moved and changed direction too quickly.  I am also knowledgeable about military and civilian aircraft and I could not identify this as any publicly known vehicle.  The object appeared black or dark in color, had no discernable wings, vertical stabilizer or any form or propulsion.  The object appeared round.  I could not make out any noise or light from the object.  The object was alone in the sky as I do not recall any aircraft within the vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for approximately 30-45 minutes before losing it in the sky.   As far as I know, I was the only witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Everyone kind of looked at each other then went off to do what they needed to do. The sky was clear no real breeze. No special noise or funny feelings, etc. There were the same craft up high like the last time but many more, sometimes single simetimes in pairs. They seemed to change altitute and direction alot. Most of the craft seemed to head east. There was a high altitude jetliner passing fairly close to one at one point.

And by the blink of an eye it had moved clear accross the sky to the east of us and just stopped. I got out my video camera and zoomed in on it.  From a distance it looked just like a light, but when I zoomed in on it, it was shaped like a drum or a barrel. the top and the bottem were rotating while the mid section wasn&#39;t moving.

Lewis at the time, I don&#39;t remember which. I can&#39;t recall the exact time and date, I&#39;m sure it wouldn&#39;t be hard to find out, I&#39;m fairly certain it was October.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor and I were outside talking and he remarked he was watching the F-16s or whatever they were doing circles around what I guess was the Puget Sound area.  We were guessing they were circling because GW was in town and the whole terrorist threat and all that was (is) going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we looked over the roof of my apartment which from my position is south to south east, we both saw three orange circles that seemed to dance around and change formation in random order. They changed places but never intersected, very quickly, while moving east.  I didn&#39;t see them disappear, as I took my eyes off them to tell my wife to come look, I asked my neighbor, &#34;Did you see that?&#34; and he said &#34;Yes.&#34; I said &#34;What WAS that?&#34;. At first I thought the jets were chasing it or it was chasing the jets, but it was too hard to judge the distance. It looked like it could have been 100 feet away or 2 miles away. The reason I couldn&#39;t judge the distance, I think, was because it was unlike anything I&#39;d ever seen in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They weren&#39;t like lights because the edges were crisp, or at least not blurry, something in between.  They didn&#39;t glow so much as they were just &#34;on&#34;. It was hard to tell if they changed shape as they maneuvered because they moved so fast. They looked very close at first, because of their clarity...but they made no sound, and so I reasoned that they could not be close. I think they got smaller as they danced away, it was hard to tell. It all happened so fast. Maybe four seconds. I then reasoned it may have been a reflection off my glasses or something but my neighbor saw it too. I got very excited about what I just saw. I told my wife I saw a UFO or &#34;something&#34;. My neighbor and I tried to figure out what it could have been, and came to the conclusion it must have been a UFO, as it was unlike anything we had ever seen. Right after it all happened, I went back outside and looked up in that direction hoping to see something more, but after several minutes I thought it foolish to think I would see something like that again in the same place in the universe. To this day, I cannot accurately describe what they looked like- not bright like a light, no discernable three dimensional shape except circular; almost like putting a flashlight to a piece of clear-orange plastic, but not glowing(?).    When I say &#34;danced&#34;, it was not a zig-zagging movement so much as it was a quick and fluid motion, so fast I didn&#39;t see a pattern to it.  They seemed to randomly switch around positions in a very, very tight &#34;formation&#34; as they moved in a group.  Proportionately, if they were billiard ball size, the &#34;formation&#34; never got more than, if even, five billiard balls across in any direction.  The whole thing was over so quickly, I imagine it may have been only two seconds, I really don&#39;t know.  Two days ago I talked with my neighbor and recalled that night and we both agree we have no idea what we saw.  He is from what I know of him an average and honest guy,  maybe 10 or 15 years older than I am.  I have never asked him if he has ever seen a UFO, but he seemed to me to be fairly accepting and not so surprised as I was.  Kinda like, &#34;Yep, there&#39;s one right there.&#34;  The people I work with would laugh at me if I told them, although my family did not.  Although I may have marked it on my calendar (which I have since thrown away), and I don&#39;t recall the exact day, I&#39;ll never forget seeing whatever it was I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

While I watched the unmoving light, another light appeared to approach the hovering light from the south-east (left) at approximately 2 degrees above the tree line, at times passing behind the branches.  This light moved relatively fast and appeared to veer back off to the left before reaching the hovering light.  I&#39;m not sure if I saw red and green aircraft warning lights on the bottom of the moving light, as it dissappeared behind the trees and I was focusing mainly on the hovering light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I briefly walked away from the window to fully shut off the sink faucet in the bathroom across from my bedroom so as not to wake my parents up, and when I returned to the window the hovering light had appeared to have shifted to the left by a few degrees, although I could have been standing at a different portion of the window.  As I continued to watch, a plane came over the trees to the left of hovering light and passed over my neighborhood, banking and showing it&#39;s distinctive red and green belly lights as I heard the usual airplane sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the plane dissapeared to the south-east, the light continued to hover for maybe two more minutes, and I had begun to think it might be a light on a cellphone tower or something, before it slowly began to drift to the south-east (left) passing behind the trees, and appearing to stop and move back a short ways to the right before resuming it&#39;s course to the left.  Also, as the light began moving, it changed in color from a bright white to a dull amber color.  After that, I lost sight of the light and checking the time it was 11:24.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This really peaked his interest, so we stayed out for a while to see if there would be anymore of them.By now it is approximately 12:00-12:15.He spotted a formation of at least 30 of these craft,hard to determine number because so many and moving in a wave like formation.After this formation passed us silently moving Southeast, we noticed from the backside they didn&#39;t appear as bright.This formation moved in a wavelike pattern at a pretty good rate of speed.We noticed after about 15 seconds it blended in with some wispy clouds in the area.I stayed out for about another half an hour,but didn&#39;t see any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The first time we witnessed it was probably sometime in April.  It appears to be a bright star with a notable exception; it slowly spins. There seem to be colored lights on it; red and white predominate; sometimes orange and green appearas well. The first night, it moved in tight little formations like a diamond or it would bounce up &amp; down repeatedly.  It was in the western sky just above treeline at sea level. It has since become commonplace to us, almost like a benevolent presence.  We have seen it many times, and it is visible most nights.  I have seen it glide across the sky in the west, moving from south to north, gliding silently.  It seems mostly to hover and spin, and it makes no sound.  For the past month or so, it has been in the low north-northeast sky.  Several of us go outside to look at it regularly.  I have been wanting to report this for some time, because I find it fascinating; but I guess I felt foolish and tried to rationalize it as a balloon or a satellite, even though I know it is not.  I have seen it in outdoor events here where there were many people (outdoor parties and such).  I do not drink or do drugs; although had I seen this without other witnesses, I may have thought I was crazy.  It is always pretty low in the sky.  I wonder if there is some kind of rational explanation for what it is. If so, I&#39;d really like to know. I wonder how many others have seen or reported something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at a twinkling star, although that is just a guess.

It appeared to be about a quarter mile east of the highway, and it moved eastward in the sky at a slight downward arc before (presumably) falling from sight behind a wooded area.

A 747 was flying near by, leaving a long contrail and heading south parallel to the UFO. The UFO didn’t make any sound as it passed over. The UFO was round and bright and gleamed like the suns rays were bouncing off of it. As it flew over I could see that some type of white mass was protruding from all around the UFO in a clockwise position at a very slow spin compared to its speed. The UFO was too high to determine if it was shedding the white material or not. It was hard to believe what I saw until I got my October issue of UFO magazine a few days after the sighting.

The objects appeared to be round/possibly spherical with one edge that appeared dark or fuzzy at times, and red at others.  The objects also appeared to change shape from time to time.  We watched the objects for 5-10 minutes when they stopped, still in formation.  Immediately we noticed another small bright object heading from north to south in the general direction of the group.  This object moved much more rapidly than the first four when another object appeared behind this object moving faster still.  Just as the two were about to converge they both made abrupt, instantaneous turns in different directions, then looped, curved, and zig-zagged until both slowed and stopped momentarily.  At this time the initial group of four began to move again.  One object headed off rapidly and disappeared towards the northwest.  The other three objects moved together in a constantly changing formation toward the south.  At this time a bright blue object appeared directly overhead, and as we wathched this one, another reddish-white object appeared approximately 1-2 degrees east of it.  We then watched as 3 of the initial 4 objects disappeared to the south.  The red and blue objects headed off in different directions but we did not notice where as at this time several objects appeared in rapid succession heading east to west very rapidly.  One of these objects appeared to have a long, maybe .5 degree line of very small and very bright objects trailing, leading, and then circling the central object.  We witnessed one more object come in on the original path of the first group of 4 objects, travel a very erratic path and eventually disappear towards the northeast.  The weather was clear and sunny with a very light breeze.  The entire event spanned approximately 45 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No clouds or ceiling present.  A light moving at an extremely high rate of speed entered my field of vision from the north- west quadrant of the sky.  It continued at a rapid pace at an even altitude for approximately 12 to 15 seconds before it left my field of vision as it headed in a southerly direction.  My first impression was that it was a shooting star.  However, I am perplexed as I have seen many shooting stars before and they have never been that clear nor have been flying in such an even pattern.  There was no discernable noise and the luminosity of the object was in fact very similar to the brightness of the stars in the morning sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

By the behavior of the object it didn&#39;t seem like a star or planet and definitely not a plane.  It also was too high and had no lights that would indicate that it was a helicopter.  It migrated across the sky slowly, like a star, but much quicker than any celestial object would move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus.  PD))<n>

I glanced up and saw a fairly dim shape, like the wings of an old-style plane, rectangular and wide, moving overhead, but without a nose or a tail. The size was approximate to that of a plane flying over head, the hieght it would be when approaching a nearby airport, but it seemed MUCH higher than that. I couldn&#39;t hear an engine of any type, and it was moving FAST, over head and gone in the distance in under 15-20 seconds, disappearing into the haze on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving east/south-east. I am in Woodland hills, and it was almost directly overhead, a bit to the north, and passed the length of the San Fernando Valley, then out over what I assume would be East L.A., maybe Glendale and then over San Bernardino. The color was a pale greenish-blue, but NOT glowing - a faint color.  The thing that set me off was that there were no running lights of any kind, no identifying shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always look up at the sky when I go out at night, to look at the stars, the moon, and when I saw this, I kept waiting for it to become recognizable, something I could explain. I still can&#39;t explain this. My gut reaction is that it was some very large orbital object, perhaps the international space station, but it seemed far to large for that. Please note that my sighting time is estimated at 2:37 am. It took me several minutes to look at a clock.

We found it odd and began to drive further out into the country to get a better look. As we drove, the objects began to break formation, one even shot fairly quickly straight up into the sky. This left 2 of the objects, which had begun to blink red, green and white lights, remaining in the formation while the other two headed off in opposite directions. Even more intrigued, we drove out to a country road and parked the car, fascinated by what we were now seeing... the 2 crafts that had taken off were now inexplicably back, as well as a few more... all in all we believe there were at least 8 of these at varying points in every direction of the sky. At this time, they were all blinking, hovering (sometimes flying) and spaced at intervals, yet didn&#39;t appear to be much bigger than what an airplane flying by may seem to be.  Also at this time we were still trying to convince ourselves that perhaps these were some sort of strange airplanes or military crafts (though I&#39;ve never seen an airplane that could shoot straight up into the air, and there&#39;s no reason why 8 of these blinking objects would be patrolling the sky)...<n> <n><n> <n><n> This continued for approx. one and half hours, at which time one of the objects which was low in the sky began all of a sudden to increase greatly in size, and took the appearance of a large ball of white light (Much bigger than a planet, and definitely in our atmosphere). It began to move quickly directly toward where we were sitting in our car on the side of the road, and as it approached it was very low, about tree line. There wasn&#39;t any noise except for a sort of low chugging sound, no emissions from the craft and no seeming way to propel it. It flew directly over our car and I got a good look at the underside of the craft, which I can only describe as a sort of rectangular shape with 3 bright white lights in a row (much like a large traffic light flying over the car, except all 3 lights were white.) Also on one side of the craft was a small blinking red light, and a green one on the other. After this craft flew over us and continued on, the other crafts began to blink sporadically and almost resembled faint strobe lights. *It should be noted,too, that during these few hours all of the crafts were alternating between hovering in the sky and flying around, so that at times some seemed to be dangling from strings in the sky, some seemed stationary, and some had no pattern at all other than to fly back and forth.* Awed by this sight, we decided to go out the next night (last night) as well and look for these objects, and sure enough they were there again. This time, though none of them came down to our level or flew over our car, 3 seperate crafts at about half hour intervals went from being small, blinking things to the large white lights that we first saw the day before. Each time this happened, the object would go from being small and blinking, to large and glaring, and then fade back to blinking and ascend straight up into the sky. All three were in the North-Northeast sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear day as far as I can recall--little or no cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something caught my eye which I first assumed was an airplane. It was slightly (5 degrees maybe?) to the right of straight ahead of the car and maybe a few degrees above horizontal, meaning that I could easily look at it with only a tiny eye movement from where my eyes would be normally while driving. I dont know how to estimate the distance because I dont know the size of the object but if it had been a commercial jet I would have guessed that it was several miles away. If I held my arm straight out this object would have looked the size of, or smaller than my thumbnail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was silver in color. The shape was indeterminate and I could not make out wings, a tail section or any features for that matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What first caused me to be particularly curious about it was that it didnt seem to be moving. Everytime I glanced up at it it appeared to be in the same place. Had it been a plane it would have been slowly making its way across the sky but it didnt seem to be doing that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I continued to look at it for another minute or two while driving. Then, it began to change color, to darken to a grey and then a dark grey. This took about 3 seconds. Then, right as I was looking at it, I could no longer see it at all. It had kind of faded away quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled my car over and got out so that I could see clearly and there was nothing there but blue sky.

I waited for my dog to do it&#39;s business and happened to glance up in a SE direction at the skies directly above my neighbor&#39;s tree, and happened to notice a series of lights floating or hovering at at pproximately 3500 ft, tor possibly higher, the shape of the object seemed to change from spherical to triangular.  There were four lights associated with the object, the dominant ones being, green , red, and blue, and the less dominant one being white.   There seemed to be a aura or haze around the lights, but I did&#39;nt have my glasses on so it could have been my eyes.   The weather was mild but quite windy , I think too windy for a helicopter to be hovering in one spot at that altitude for that length of time.   The area was very quiet.  Portage la Prairie is approximately 5-8 miles from an ex military base which was converted to a private flight training  facility for training of  military pilots back in late 90s.   On Sunday afternoon, I contacted Southport, and asked to speak to flight control operations at the airport, it was revealed that flight operations was shut down for the holiday weekend and there was no flights or flight training taking place at the airport over the weekend.  I went to look for a disposbale digital camera but they were expired.  I went to use my video camera but my battery was dead.   There was no noise associated with the lights, helicopters from the base are usually audible from where I live when flying at that approximate altitutde,  I came back every so often to check if the lights were still there, at approximately 4:10am they had either moved off into the distance or were gone as I did not seem them as clearly as I had when I first noticed them.   I had not been sleeping that night.  I also had trouble getting my dog in the house, because  he was sick from too much Thanksgiving Turkey, and was grazing on the grass in the backyard  and did&#39;nt want to come in, which is unusual in itself as he is normally onedient and comes when you call him.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The condictions were somewhat foggy so when my friend woke up and stated that she thought she saw a shooting star I was skeptical, but then we both saw 3 small white lights just above the horizon. We were camping on a rise above the Delaware River with the tent fly open and were looking almost directly across at the light. Then a bright red glow started to shine that was almost like a sun rise and we saw the Black solid body with a flat top, concave sides and a srtight botton that was longer than the top. The red glow clearly outlined this large sturture. The glow plused and dimmed so that the object was lost in the haze. Then the light returned and we were able to again see the object. This happened three times over the next approx. 45 mins. There was no sound or noise that we could hear. The object was stationary and did not move. After the third time that the red light shown and dimmed we did not see it again. In the morning we est. that this object was drictly over the River about 1000 ft from our tent and no more than 50-100 ft up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was at the Sheraton Hotel on one of the top floors facing west.  I just happened to look out of the hotels large room window and saw what looked like a light on top of a tall building abour half a mile away.  I didn&#39;t remember seeing this very tall building earlier that day but shrugged it off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I began to turn and go back to bed I witnessed the light begin to move towards the hotel.  I thought it might be a helicopter...but at 2:50AM??  Anyway, the light began to take the shape of a triangle with blinking colored lights on the bottom of it.  The object than slowly hovered it seemed right over the top of the hotel over my room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when I most definitely saw a triangle flying hovering object not making any sound or noises.  It was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, the object disappeared out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I caught the elevator down to the lobby of the building as fast as I could, looked outside to the east in the direction the object was! headed but it was no where in sight.  I began to tell the desk clerk what I had saw but he looked at me like I was crazy or on something.  I said never mind, went back to my room and didn&#39;t fall asleep until the sun began shining through that same window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whenever I tell this story, no one beleives me, so I am asking you guys to beleive me.

I saw a very bright red and blue strobe light coming from the west (over Phoenix) to the east. I went across the sky 10 times faster than an air plain could. In about 1 min. the light was gone. In about 2 min. more there was another one and my husband saw it. He got out our little 30 power scope and when he saw it through the scope it looked like 3 red triangles in the scope. With our eyes we could only see one red and blue light. We took the scope and went to the park by our house where it was clear from any other houses and trees. When we got there at about 23:00 hours we could see three of them come from the west to the east. They seemed to stop over the Superstition Mountians. They stopped in mid air and then went to the south and then very fast up to the east. They would stop and hover and go up and down and left and right. Then all at once there was a larger one that seemed to come up in front of us (we were facing the east) it was larger and brighter than the others.It went to the right and then stopped.It looked to both of us like a deep v. It was strobing red and blue. It would move all around and then it looked as if it was coming closer to us. We saw a total of 6 in the air. I have spent a lot of time watching the ski for the falling stars. I have never seen anything like this. It gave me a sense of fear and excitment. I have seen plains in the sky and it was not a plane of any kind. For one thing plains would not be going that fast and not so close to each other. This was something that we could not explaine.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It slowly and eventually moved off into the northern horizon till we could not see it anymore.  This movement was gradual.  Nothing that you would notice just by watching it.

At first my logical conclusion was that this phenomenon was merely an air plane or a sattelite, however, after a prolonged staredown I realized that this phosphoresent blob in the night&#39;s sky was moving at an irregular and unpredictable pattern.  The star-like figure would remain static, flickering with coloration and then would suddenly--not to mention erratically--begin to whimsically gyrate in no measurable pattern.  These movements took on many directions--spiral, circular, up-and-down, and horizontal--in a random fashion.  After approximately 25-30 minutes of viewing this abnormal astral occurrance the intensity of the light emanating from the object began to taper off, and eventually the phenomenon departed entirely over the westward horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we reached the tentative conclusion that he might have been observing a twinkling star.

I pulled off the road to view it and it was as though they turned off their lights.  It just disappeared!   When I got to Cee Vee, my nephew reported that several friends of ours, hunting on one of our farms, had seen three lights (separate units) over the farm, and they took camcorder pictures of the event.  On Sunday, October 10th, I viewed their pictures and it was unbelievable!  I told them I thought I had seen the &#34;mother ship&#34;.  Their lights changed alternatively white to red.

I was standing in my front yard near 10th Ave. and Garrison St. in Lakewood, Colorado, a suburb of Denver. The sun was close to setting but had not yet set.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching a flurry of leaves fall from a tree I noticed a bright object in the northeast sky through the tree&#39;s branches. At first I thought it was the sun reflecting off an airplane but it became apparent to me that the object was not moving in relation to the tree&#39;s branches. I checked my watch and it was about three minutes past 6:00 p.m. (Mountain Daylight Time). The object appeared to be in a position not quite half way between north and east and all the activity I describe took place at an elevation of between 30 and 45 degrees above the horizon. Having no reference point, I can not guess as to the distance or altitude of the objects I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved to get the tree out of the way and began thinking perhaps I was seeing a star becoming visible as the sun was setting but it was just too early for a star to come out. I then began to think it was a weather balloon reflecting the sun. I have not seen a weather balloon since I was a kid and am now 60 years old. By the time I changed position and got the tree out of the way, I could see that the object was now moving in relation to some overhead electrical wires.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 seconds had elapsed at this point. Now I began to think I was seeing a satellite of some kind, as it was moving to the southwest at about the speed I have seen satellites move. I called to my daughter (age 24), &#34;Come see the satellite,&#34; and when I looked back the bright object was moving to the straight west. While I was waiting for her to arrive I saw several smaller bright lights (of two sizes) appear and disappear randomly at varying distances around the first object. Some were visible for several seconds, others just flashed on and then off. She arrived just in time to see several smaller objects, about six of them, form a semi-circle around the first object for a few seconds and then, in a split second, a number of the secondary objects formed a straight line with the first object for a few seconds. The line was angled in such a manner that, if extended upward, it would have crossed the northern sky in direction of the north compass point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter looked at the bright objects through binoculars and said that they appeared to have orange and green lights on opposite sides. After this, both the primary and secondary objects appeared and disappeared randomly in the same vicinity for several minutes. Some were large and others were small.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point one of the secondary objects separated from the group and began moving in a southwesterly direction. Every so often it appeared to produce flames, like rocket propulsion, and would accelerate rapidly in random directions. At some point another object separated from it and acted in a similar manner, flaming and changing direction at odd angles but keeping in the vicinity of the object from which it came. Both objects headed west, sometimes bright and sometimes dark, as silhouettes, but I could not discern any particular shape. The offshoot object disappeared but I continued to watch the other object for a while. It became dark continuously and looked and acted much like a radio controlled model airplane. It flew west and I swear that at times it looked like the silhouette of a large bird flapping its wings, then it too suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While this took place, several of the other secondary bright objects moved off slowly in a northeasterly direction. The first object then disappeared and by 6:15 p.m. all objects had completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter continued to watch the sky and about 10 minutes later she said she saw a bright object again in the vicinity of where the dark objects had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They appeared in quickly one after another, about a half second between each, in an area approx a moon&#39;s width apart. The fireballs were a bright orange color, similar to a road flare, and lasted about five seconds, with the first one to appear being the first one to go out and so on. I continued to watch the area of sky where the lights appeared and continued to see the same three fireball cycle continue for the next 5 to 7 minutes,with the cycle repeating, about every thirty seconds, until I was directly west of the fireballs. I guessed, based on a cell phone tower that the fireballs were in front of, that the fireballs were located approx. 3 to 4 miles southeast of Monticello at a height of 2,000 to 4,000 ft. There were aircraft in the area that I feel were military but these aircraft were all to the west of my location and were doing some kind of training activities with each other, which is a common thing to see at that time on Thursday nights. This is not the first time I have seen the fireballs, but it is the first time I have been certain it was not a naturally occuring fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was stationary, it was radiant like a star it did not flash like airplane lights but it was the most beautiful red gem like light, it didn&#39;t have the dead or mechanical look of airplane lights.  I watched it for a while thinking it has to move and then I&#39;ll know it is a plane, but it just stayed still.  I ran in to get binoculars and when I came back out it was still in the same location.  I could not get a steady fix on it with the binoculars.  Then it moved to the south in almost a floating, slow type movement.  It stopped and stayed put  again, then it vanished.  It did not move off into the distance, it simply vanished right where it was.  I am 56 years old have never seen anything I couldn&#39;t explain until this.  It was a beautiful light laser like, somehow it had &#34;life&#34; to it.  I also think the altitude was quite high.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One of the craft (the largest), suddenly emitted some kind of &#34;tractor beam&#34;, which shone directly into the carpark I was walking through, and engulfed my work colleague, Mark Pearson, in a blinding ray of light. Frightened that the alien craft were trying to &#34;haul&#34; my colleague into their ship, I pushed him out of the way of the circle of light, hopefully releasing it&#39;s grip on him. We both sprinted into the supermarket, and all was normal in the car park when we came out 10 minutes later with our lunch.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A sphere with a glowing, bright, red light hovered over a tall, 13-story apartment building across the street from me. I saw at least 50 people on the ground pointing at it. The craft, which was very small - about the size of a car, hovered for about 30 seconds over the apartment building and slowly moved towards me overhead while it was ascending. The hotel is the Holiday Inn in Grand Rapids.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It then made and obviouse curve and turned into 3 reeectangular lights that made a small line. Imediately after it turned again, it was a single blinking light. We watched it for another half minute or so, when we noticed that its speed was accelerating. Then out of nowhere, it has lights that swirl around it similar to an atom and its electrons. At the same this was happening, we were being approached by several airplane sounding crafts that had blue and red lights. One of the ufo&#39;s flew directly above us, and we could see triangular light patterns on the bottom of the craft. There were approximately 15 of these in a line flying NNE. After we thought all this excitement was over, not even five minutes later did a Military Jet fighter start zooming through the sky, like it was chasing them, It did a few curves and even broke the sound barrier. My smoke and light seemed over, so we all stepped inside. 1 minute later, a huge flash of light lit up the back window, so we checked and there was that same flying thing that we saw at the start, and this time it wasnt flying in a straight line, it zigzaged slightly. Shortly after, i got very pale and sick, i dont know why, maybee the chicken.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It definately had red lights and pretty sure that it had white lights, maybe blue (very patriotic I know).  The other peron said that perhaps it had some type of rear tail wings but I didn&#39;t see them.  It could have been some type of experimental plane because it didn&#39;t seem all that other-worldly except that it was triangluar, pretty quiet and flying so slow.

It was about the size of a star (maybe a little bigger), but it had a brightness almost that of the moon. At first I thought it might be a meteor or something, so I stood to watch it. I realized it was moving toward me, and as it did, the one bright light became smaller lights. There was also a flashing red light. It continued to get closer, and I thought it was a very low flying airplane. However, I suddenly realized it was making no noise at all, and I found this very odd. I am nearly positive that it stopped and hovered, although I cannot be entirely sure. As it did, I could make out the outline of it. It appeared to be about the shape of a bowler hat. The lights were around what would appear to be the brim, and the dome part was dark, but I could make out the silouette against the night sky. I suppose this dome part could have been my imagination, but I&#39;m almost positive of what I saw. Before this, I was still under the impression that it was an airplane. I certainly was not expecting to see this shape, and it instantly gave me chills. Suddenly, the object made a sharp 90 degree turn and took off to the south. This, to me, confirms it was no aircraft that I&#39;ve ever seen before. The way it turned, it was so smooth, and very quick. Before, as it came towards me, I could not see the speed with which it moved, but after the turn, I could tell that it moved very quickly. I walked toward my back yard so i could see it through the neighboring houses, and I watched it dissapear over the tree line to the south. Something that may have just been coincidence: I could hear several dogs barking off to the south, which I thought sounded like what I had heard about other UFO sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing about all this is, before tonight, I really did not believe in UFOs that much. I thought people who saw them were crazy. Tonight left serious doubt in my mind. I&#39;m writing this less than an hour after the event, so it&#39;s still completely fresh in my mind. I will swear on anything that I&#39;m not making this up. Coming from someone who thought people who saw UFOs were crazy, I would say that what I saw was most definantly a UFO, no question about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At about 20:30 some of our classmates noticed what appeared at first like a satellite in the sky.  My attention was drawn in the direction of the object and  I began to observe the object through my binoculars thinking as well that we were looking at a satellite. It was travelling at a high rate of speed . At first it did not raise any suspicion because that is what one expects from a satellite. But very soon this changed due to the fact that it was tracing a somewhat erratic flightpath as it crossed the sky from about where  sagitarius was at that time of the night (which was at a relatively low angle)up to the region in the sky where the constellation andromeda was located.  I would say that it accomplished this  in about 25 seconds max. A strobing light sometimes emitted from this object which appeared to be at such a distance that not even my 10*50mm binoculars could resolve some discernable shape.  Additionally, the object emitted a greenish light. The object made no sound of any kind.  Now as it reached andromeda, it suddenly made a tight turn and at that moment I noticed that a second object came into view.  It appeared to be racing to meet the 1st object and as it gained on the first object, I noticed that they both began to decelerate at a very steady rate until both were flying at the same speed.  Suddenly the first object began to rapidly accelerate and as this occured, the angular distance between the two increased and at that point I could only follow one of the objects.  I continued following what I identify as the first object as it headed due north now when suddenly the second object closed in on the first as it came into my field of view in the binoculars.  About 2 seconds passed when abruptly I noticed that a third object had now come into my field of view.  The 3 then continued on this norhterly course together until they disappeared behind a hill and I could follow them no more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I want to say a few things regarding this &#34;potential&#34; sighting. Firstlly, I have been fascinated with aircraft all of my life since I can remember being alive.  I go to airshows several times a year and have seen many different types of military aircraft in action. Military aircraft are to my knowledge very noisy vehicles.  The vehicles that I witnessed this night made absolutely no sound whatsoever. Secondly to bolster my 1st point, I would like to state that the objects accelerated rapidly at least twice that I can remember and not once was there any sound nor the appearance of the prominent flame that I could associate with that which is emitted when jet aircraft engage their afterburners in order to command the  impresive rate of acceleration that these vehicles displayed.  Thirdly, we live in the San Francisco   Bay area.  It is very active with air traffic given the two major airports which are  located so close in proximity from one another (literally right across the bay from one another)  The notion that the military would conduct such risky maneuvers in such an area of the sky that is already rife with civilian air traffic is in my opinion not viable unless one is willing to accept that the military does not take the issue of civilian air traffic safety seriously.  If we are to then accept that maybe these objects were military jets flying well above the civilian air traffic corridor, let us say perhaps above 20,000 feet, then these jets would have had to fly at the speed of sound at the very least in order to cover the aforementioned area of the sky  and they would have surely generated a sonic boom.  But as  I say, not a peep eminated from these vehicles.  conversely, if they had been flying at a lower altitude which is the only other explanation that could explain the large sky coverage executed by these vehicles in short a short period of time, then surely, unless these are military jets with a sophisticated new propulsion technology, they would have definitely made a lot of noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot definitely say that what I saw were craft from another world, but they sure did not behave in any way that I could attribute to modern military jet aircraft.  If you have any feed back for me regarding this event i.e. any new propulsion technologies that you may have heard of, please drop me a line.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These lights did not move, but just appeared, and flashed in a sequence.  They were like spot lights, orange and red in colour.  After about thirty seconds, they just disappeared.  About five minutes later, another light appeared higher in the sky, same colour, but this one moved in an upward direction, like a flare.  Only it originated high in the sky.  A second light appeared almost immediately, slightly lower.  With the same motion upward, they both disappeared.  At this point, the lake is about sixty miles wide and there are no obstructions.  I often see numerous jets and planes, but none have ever looked like this.  The night was totally clear, with a slight wind.  There were some waves so I didn&#39;t notice any sounds.  I was with a friend and he saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I do love to look at the sky on a clear night as we live in a rural area of south jersey and there is no light pollution. I am a real estat agent and familiar with the rural farmland area of this county.  There is a flight pattern for planes and they are usually u very high, look very small and move quickly along. We are just about 50 minutes from Atlantic City and Philadelphia Airports.  There are small airports in nearby towns.  I am familiar with the military planes that fly lower.  Two days a go on a clear October sky, as I was driving home from a late appointment, I was admiring a bright light that just seemed to flicker larger than most stars, thinking it was a plane, I tried to focus on it.  It never moved for about 10 minutes.  All of a sudden, it started to move very slowly, very far up, slower than the planes that passed it.  All of a sudden, it quickly moved down just over top of my car and just hoovered.  The shape was more triangular, but I could tell it wasn&#39;t a plane.  It had bright yellowish lights.  I heard no sounds as you do a plane.  It left lightning fast high into the sky and a second craft did the same.  I really had no idea what it was and figured it was just some new military craft.  There were about 4 other cars on intersecting streets, but I did not hear anything else about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day at midnight, I was out at a charity dinner and on my way home. I saw the same two lights in the sky.  They didn&#39;t seem to be moving at all.  Planes passed high above them.  All of a sudden, they both started  moving slowly. They did not hoover over my car this time, but slowly moved along the sky and then moved directly down, not at an angle as a plane would.  My car radio did not work this time; all stations were static and when I got home, my power had been interrupted and I had to reset my clocks.<n>

It was 4:00 pm and a clear, sunny day.  My dad (age 61) was across the street from his house with two neighbor girls (both under the age of five years old) and they were looking up in the sky eastward.  My dad had his binoculars and I thought he was looking at a plane or a bird.  As I got out of my car he called for me to come over and take a look at what he was seeing.  There was a jet passing overhead that was quite high in the sky, and I initially thought he was looking at the plane with the two neighbor kids.  He told me to look up toward the plane, and I did, thinking the plane was the object we were focusing on.  In actuality, it wasn&#39;t the plane, but what looked like three twinkling stars in the area of the plane.  At first I thought the plane had dropped something and that the three objects were just debris falling from the plane.  But one twinkling object was higher in the sky than the plane.  I looked through my dad&#39;s binoculars and the objects were still tiny to my eyes, but they were still twinkling exceptionally bright in the sunny daytime.  To me they each looked like a tumbling shiny polygon of some sort.  They must have been much higher in the sky than the plane because even looking through the binoculars the objects were not more than &#34;twinkling stars&#34;.  They seemed to be reflecting light, not creating their own luminescence.  My dad said something to the effect that he thought they looked like they were tumbling down to earth, and I agreed.  Shortly thereafter, we lost sight of one object (the plane was now long gone) but the higher of the two remaining objects descended an was now holding it&#39;s place in the sky diagonally down from the other object.  Both objects which had seemed to be tumbling stopped in this position for about 45 seconds.  Then one object disappeared under the tree line (my parents live in a neighborhood with tall trees everywhere).   At this point the girls&#39; mother came out and my dad pointed out the twinkling lights to her. A few minutes later the mother took the girls inside for whatever reason.  I lost sight of the objects but my dad said he could still see one.  Since I didn&#39;t see anything anymore, I went in and got my photos and came back outside.  My dad said the last object drifted under the tree line.  He told me the objects had started out directly above him minutes before I arrived, then becan travelling slightly to the norteast (more east than north I&#39;d say).  Since I live about a mile east of my parents, I went home hoping to see the objects lower in the sky as there are few trees in my neighborhood.  It took me about 2 minutes to get home, but I saw no more of the twinkling lights.  If I were to learn that these objects were some sort of falling high altitude debris, I could certainly believe that.  However, I would be very surprised to find out they were some kind of common man-made flying machine due to their shape, their incredible brightness in a sunny sky, the odd &#34;tumbling polygon&#34; look they had, their strange movement, and the fact that they left no exhaust or trails.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up in the sky, the sky was clear,but looked like down 10 miles down by Palos Hills there were a few small clouds and one 150 foot cloud looked as if a hoving disk drove thru the cloud twice on each end side going up or down on the right and left side of this 150 foot looking cloud. The burnout hoving marks on the left and right side of the 150 foot cloud had the same length width and height of 35 feet. Making the hoving burnout look as if it strach the cloud on each side. I seened these marks on this cloud thats why Iwas looking up in the sky. The cloud looked as if the cloud was the length of 150 feet from left to right,by width on 60 feet going up and down,the girth of the cloud seemed to be 270 feet. As I was driving still down 95st looking at the cloud for 15 seconds while glancing up and down trying to not get in no car accident maintaining the 30mph I stoped at a red light glancing back at the cloud I watched a polish waxed silver 1950&#39;s looking u.f.o disk smaller than the ufo hoving type cloud streching burnout marks I saw, it looked like a real small version of the 1950&#39;s looking u.f.o. it was so far looked to be at least 5 to 10 feet in height and 7 to 13 in length from right to left. When I was at the red light I watch the disk 30 feet from the right side of the cloud driving in a straight line from right to left enter the 150 foot cloud then disappeared in cloud at speeds of 100 miles per hour in the middle of the cloud I seened it in the middle of the cloud still moving in the same 100 mph speeds for 2 seconds still driving left. The light turned green,I continued to drive expecting to see the disk agian,thinking at 100 mph it would of been out of the 150 foot length cloud by now,glanced and stared at the cloud for 15 minutes on the way to work and the disk never cam out of the cloud from the left side as I was driving. This is the 3rd time I seened something,but this is my 1st I reported. Back in 1985 i seened a skinny tall shadow very athletic jump on my back fence and hissed at me with snake tongue in dark ,violently and I ran in fear i seened as when it jumped on fence and heard fence rattle fast as if his foot right foot was gasped up on fence as if his knee was 3 feet over his head,pointyknee,and in 2002 of march I seened liquid metal u.f.o as if some type of magnet in the sky swirled around liquid and could rewind itself while moving in a 60 degree angle and disapear and then come back then throw a fit moving in angles all over the place in nonstop different directions as fast as moving a flashlite around. Looked like it was studing planes the way they take off I seened it with a kindergarten teacher. It also seemed as if it had some kind of capacity camalflog disappear and reappear and was having technicial diffaculties with his camelflog. I could see ripple of waves on the liquid moving.

It made a sharp and substantial change (but a bit less than ninety degrees) in course, suddenly, at about 40% up the vertical component of its course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It disappeared due to altitude at about 80 degrees elevation in my ~ south-east.  Sphere became brighter as it sped up and with distance, but the electric blue column seemed to keep a constant light level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Attached are, (1), how it looked before extending the column, and, (2), a version of how the object looked after the electric blue column was extended.  One comment: That drawing of the sphere, alone, does not show the thing nearly as clearly as the actual view I had of it.  The edges were very sharp, and clear as could be -- much sharper than the moon&#39;s edge on the clearest of days, because it was so close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until the object climbed very high (almost vertically), it was of sufficient angular size as to be seen quite sharply and distinctly.  The white, spherical object had NO COLUMN WHATSOEVER until I took my eyes off it for a moment because a car in the parking lot honked near me, and when I looked back up after only a couple of seconds, the strange column was there!  No camera with me. :(    I&#39;d have gotten some spectacular, sharp  images, otherwise.  At closest, the sphere, per se, subtended at least half a degree (moon or sun angular  size), but as you can see, the electric blue column made its vertically subtended arc larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The initial sighting location was a few blocks W-SW of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, and would guess the object made its direction change when it was approximately right over the space flight center. Come to think about it, that would possibly have been what it was over when the electric blue tube beneath the object appeared, but I would caution against any undue speculation about what, if anything, it might have been doing over Goddard.  Of one thing I am certain, it did not come from there, because I am quite familiar Goddard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited, overnight, to report this until the drawings were complete, wanting to make the drawings while while what I saw was very fresh on my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ray Stanford<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Ray Stanford, noted author and UFO investigator, for sharing this report.

It was a beautiful black night and the stars were bright.  I looked up and saw an extremely large bright star and told my daughter that I had never seen a star there before and especially that bright...about the time that my daughter looked to see it, the brilliant light seemed as if a dimmer was turning it off.  I kept thinking about that event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not sit outside most of the summer because of the heat, but then we started having nice nights in September so I would sit out and talk on the phone or just look at the wonderful stars.  We live on a mountain ridge and can see the lights of town below to the right, but to the left and straight ahead are mountains and forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never expected to see another event like I had in the Spring, but my eyes flew open when I saw not only one bright star but five popping bright in a flame stitch pattern right below the handle of the big dipper.  They popped one right after the other then seemed to dim after a couple of seconds.  Two airforce jets had just flown by low in the sky, they seemed to be circling over and over again and I know that they do practice around this area...in fact, there were lots of aircraft in the sky that night...I thought that this was strange.  Two nights later I saw two bright pops, then they dimmed as the others had.  Then I looked over and I saw a single glow from afar and it seemed to last for several seconds...I remember thinking...what&#39;s this, it&#39;s staying bright for so long?  The same night I saw a regular looking bright star moving pretty fast, low in the sky.  I watched it for several seconds.  It was traveling from North to South...I was looking for blinking lights of some sort, like on an aircraft, but there were none...just the bright star moving at a fast speed, then it just disappeared!  About three weeks later I saw exactly the same event, the fast moving star except it was moving from West to East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of these sightings were fairly low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my son-in-law if anyone from his work had seen anything like this and he said that they hadn&#39;t mentioned it, but he said that a few years ago that he, a doctor friend and some others had witnessed some bright lights over a scout camp.  I asked him what he thought it was and he said that it was a mystery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am thinking surely someone else has seen such.  Here I am, out on my deck just once in a while...what is happening when I am not out here??<n>

A guess to hight would be 1000 to 2000 ft.  The lights were moving East to West at the speed of an airplane about to land.  After about 15 sec they were blocked from view by trees, and had to move with traffic as the light had changed.  We live a few miles from the county airport and see lights of planes all the time,but this event has never come close to anything we have seen the 12 years we have lived here.  I hope someone else may have seen them and confirm our sighting.<n>

The sky was crystal clear, blue, slight breeze, warm, and we had the usual panoramic view of the Bay Area. We normally have a lot air traffic coming over the hill. This was nothing like that, especially since the altitude was so high. 3 white lights were in a triangular pattern, spaced a distance apart, and were pretty high up there. It was like seeing the North star during the day x3. One was especially bright and the other two were just a little dimmer. They stayed static for a few minutes then one zoomed off, looking like a meteor but left no trail. A second dimmed and took off. The third one zig zagged a little, may have come down a distance since it got a little brighter, and then vanished like it was sucked away. I&#39;ve asked a few other people I know if they&#39;ve seen things like this around here. They&#39;ve said yes but usually at night or early evening.

On two occasions, I&#39;ve sighted a similar object in the same general area that exhibited similar flight characteristics. For the sake of brevity, I&#39;m only describing the most recent incident here. In the month of October 2004, I was traveling west on I-40 near Pottsville, AR at approximately 2000hrs when I noticed a white, non-blinking light west of my location at approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. The light was moving from south to north. I estimated its speed as comparable to a small fixed-wing aircraft. As, I neared the eastern city limits of Russellville, I realized that the object was directly over the eastern part of Russellville at an approximate altitude of 1500 ft. At this time, I reasoned that the object was the landing light of a small aircraft inbound to the Russellville municipal airport. However, an actual small aircraft moving north to south passed beneath the light and continued to descend towards the airport. I estimate the closest distance between the object and the aircraft to be less than 1000 feet as the two passed. The object continued to move to the north until it was approximately 1/2-3/4 mile north of I-40, at which time it made a slow turn towards the south and followed its original path back the way it had came across I-40. As I neared Russellville, I crossed beneath the object&#39;s flight path. At this point, the object was directly south of my location. I exited I-40 at exit 82 and stopped at a gas station at the top of the exit ramp to attempt a better observation of the object. Unfortuntately, by this time the object had moved well to the south and was difficult to observe. While standing in the gas station parking lot, I was able to note that the object was indeed moving to the south and was not a star or planet. I lost sight of the object shortly after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

At first, it had the appearance of a satellite burning upon re-entry to earth, except all the lights were white rather than many colors(as would normally be expected from a shooting star or burning satellite).  Also, the lights were moving too slow to be meteorite(less than mach 3 for sure).  As it was moving, I noticed a trail of smaller lights launching from the cluster, but in the opposite direction.  The trail behaved like debris being left behind a fast-moving vehicle, except it was moving faster than the larger cluster of lights.  Keep in mind that during this time the cluster was still visible and all this happened within a second.  Normally, I would dismiss this as a meteorite or satellite anyway, but this is the third sighting I&#39;ve had of this type of object since June 2004.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness implies an evening sighting.

My husband was sitting in the window seat and I was sitting in the aisle seat (no one in between) on the left side of the plane in row 6 or 7 (before the wing).  I saw what looked like two dark brown sticks or poles sticking out of the clouds on a 45% angle (again I am not exact).  I was so stunned to see something sticking out of the clouds that I sat there running all the different things it could be through my mind (and coming up with nothing).  I finally said to my husband what is that - he tried to see what I was seeing and blocked my vision for a moment or two.  I then heard my daughter in the seat in front of me say, what is that?  By the time my husband moved out of the way, all I could see was a dark line like a shadow moving or gliding over the clouds away from the plane until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore because of the wing.  My daughter and husband only saw the dark line part.  We asked the stewardess and the pilot (once we landed) but no one seems to have seen anything.  I still do not know what could have been sticking out of the clouds at the height.  We had not begun out decent to Buffalo yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 5 minutes before I reached the Ridgeland exit I looked over and saw what appeared to be a white plane, but I did not see wings. I am slightly near-sighted so I passed it off as vision problems, but then when I got a full view of the object I discovered it was not moving. It was hovering there, not going forward, and it was too low to the ground to be a plane. There was a building several yards away and it was higher than the building, but it was still very low. After studying the object for a minute it slowly rose a few feet into the air but continued to hover. It was then that I took the Ridgeland Exit and went to my class. I don&#39;t know what it was. It was not a plane or a blimp although it resembled more of a blimp like object. It was not particularly big or small, it was probably a little bit smaller than a commercial plane, but bigger than a small plane. It was white. It had no lights and no markings. At the time there were many cars on the interstate so I&#39;m sure others must have seen it, especially since the object was not very far away and it was a clear, sunny day outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I figured if I went to my office (from the parking lot where I initially spotted the light) and the light was not there, classifying the light as an &#39;unidentified&#39; flying object would be justified.

A helicopter flew close to the smoke plume closely followed by a white light.   The chopper went out of the screen (the camera remained stationary) and the light slowed, &#34;turned&#34; around toward the smoke,  then quickly pursued the chopper again.  This may be an optical illusion on my part,  but it certainly was convincing.<n>

Looking around the skies from my backyard I watch for any falling stars and sattilites, like I do often, having to smoke(cigarettes)outside. The view from my backyard I see a large portion the northern night sky. Last night I did see a single sattalite or star fall, I was excited to see this and scanned quickly for any more falling objects. From the south east behind me I saw a cluster of round lights in a V formation, on a straight fast direction going north. It took at least 3.5 seconds to clear from one point in the sky to its dissapearing point in the north behind the tree-line of my nieghbours. The round lights were in perfect formation of a V, and I am positive that there were separate in flight. I could see stars in the background and in between the lit round objects. The brightness of each of these circular objects was about the denisity of common porchlights in the distance, though I am certain what I saw was not sattalites or falling stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Tonight at about 8:10 PM in the southern sky halfway between the horizon and zenith I saw a large very very bright yellow-orange light. With my arm fully extended and my thumb up against the light, it was about 1/4 the width of my thumb. It surprised me to be where it was, I was not aware of any planet or star of such magnitude in that part of the sky. It was not flashing as an airplane light would. I then noticed that it was slowly moving further south and then shooting up into the sky and becoming a white pinpoint of light as it continued traveling south across the San Fernando Valley. It finally grew too faint to see through the city lights. There was no sound. The incident lasted about 60 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Both objects then moved in opposit dirctions and sometimes would come close to each other and repeat the action again. Sight of both objects was lost as they moved out behind some clouds.

My mother, her boyfriend and myself were sitting in the meadow of prospect park. My mom&#39;s boyfriend looked into the sky and pointed out what would have looked like a constellation of stars in a night sky. Six &#34;stars&#34; total, all equidistant from each other in a V-shape. We stared and stared and watched as they remained perfectly equidistant and seemed to float ever higher in the sky for at least 35 minutes. They were much higher than any other aircraft and eventually they disappeared from our field of view. We thought the show was over and we returned to our conversation eagerly trying to discern what we had just saw when to the Northeast two UFO&#39;s appeared this time much lower in the sky. They were visibly silver to the naked eye and appeared oval. Again these two objects remained perfectly equidistant and floated ever higher in the sky until they also disappeared from view. After the two objects were gone from view, my mother &amp; her boyfriend decided to head home to their apartment rooftop to see if they could view anything else. I stayed behind, and about ten minutes after they left a silver object shot across the length of the sky. It moved quickly, seemingly lower than a comercial plane and totally silent unlike a helicopter. It moved west to east across the sky (airplanes over the park all fly south to north). It&#39;s movement seemed much more fluid than an airplane, I orginally thought it looked like a giant silver bird flapping it&#39;s wings. I tried to dismiss the sighting thinking my eyes were just playing tricks on me, when a second object of equal size &amp; color followed along the exact same course! This one, however, changed course about a third of way. It turned sideways and reversed course quickly out of my field of view. When it turned it appeared to have &#34;wings&#34; that were shaped like shark fins but it was hard to tell if these were multi-dementional or flat. After that I finally went home, eager to see if any other sightings had been reported on the news. I saw no other mention of this sighting which I find odd given the amount of people in the park that afternoon and the length of the events. My family and I have never seen anything like this before and my mother&#39;s boyfreind who initially pointed out the objects is a very skepticle person, yet we all agree we saw something that afternoon that cannot be explained by today&#39;s known science &amp; technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It remained in the horizon about thirty degrees above [see attached photo] due north/west of Mt. Hood. It was a beautiful morning and the sun was just coming up. As I began walking my dog going east, I watched it coming towards me or so I thought because it was becoming brighter. I got concerned and called my husband on my cell phone. It then began retreating, and so I pulled out my tiny Nikon Coolpix 3700 camera and zoomed all the way to capture it before it got too far away. I would say it was in view for ten minutes while driving and five minutes while walking before it &#34;retreated&#34; slowly behind the hills in the Columbia Gorge. I didn&#39;t think much of it until I saw the EXACT same object on the news this morning [Fort Wayne] video taped by another observer. It was not a meteror--it moved too slowly and stayed in the same general location of the sky.

I briefly mentioned at that time the experience on 10/3/04.  First, it is important that you know that the experiences I have had over the past 31 years since the initial event in 1973 have been in a dream-like state.  Not deep sleep, but a dozing off state.  The older I get the more aware of these visits I am aware of.  The last one happened on 10/3/04 in a light dozing at 3:00 am.  I saw in a vision/dream whatever you want to call it, a light appear in the trees in my backyard.  I levitated up to it, was paralyzed for about 5 seconds, got back in my body and was aware at this time.  My body was cold and shaking.  I closed my eyes, and saw an afteraffect of a light in my eyes while closed.  (Look at a light for awhile, and close your eyes, you will see the afteraffect of that light.)  It was 3 am, no lights in the room for at least 5 hours.  DARK.  Then this happened.  The light afteraffects were in my closed eyes for about 30 minutes.  What happened was real because you do not see afteraffects of a light in the dark.  What I think the UFO phenomonem is about is dimensional.  PLEASE FIGURE THIS OUT.  DIMENSIONAL.  Every scientist out there is looking out in the sky when it is here in our own backyard.  It has been 31 years for me.  My life, a nobody, a somebody to some, is telling you that the UFO you want to find is dimensional.  You may see a craft in the sky, you may see crop circles, you may see things unexplained, but the REAL essence of the UFO is in the soft-white glowball that enters the body and returns for whatever experimental means it wants through a dream-like, subconcious state.  Please have an investigator call me.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object hoovering in the sky with flashing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking the dogs with my lady friend when I just by chance glaced up into a clear blue sky when I noticed an object flying from what I would say was the North heading roughly south-southwest. I noticed it due to the massive light source it was putting out. At first I dismissed it as a reflection off a planes hull. I looked up at it again and noticed that the light was still flickering even though it was in motion. I know that when you see a reflection from an aircraft, its really only from that angle. As it continues to move the reflection should change until the craft no longer is at the angle for the light to reflect. As this object continued its path, it was still flickering a very bright light. Originally when I noticed the object, it was to the right of the sun and even after it passed and was now to the left there was still this very bright flashing light. This is the reason why I continued to watch. If it were a reflection from the sun, it would have long since past the point of reflection. Anyway, as I watched the object and since it was so small I would say that is was well above 40,000 feet, but the weird thing was that there was no con trail. I continued to watch it and as I did, it began to slow down. I would say that this object had crossed 2/3&#39;s of the sky when it came to a stop!. I could not beleive what I was seeing. My lady friend had seen it moving but continued walking on the trail and didnt see it stop as I had. I tried to find someone who could verify what I was seeing, but the only person around was about 100 yards away and he had his child with him so I didnt want him to think I was some nut. Anyway, I ran with the dog to catch my friend. There was a short distance where I could no longer see the object due to a wooded area. I wanted to catch her so that I would have a witness to the craft stopping in mid air. I caught up to her and had her hurry though the wooded area to the clearing so that we could both see it again and upon arriving at the clearing, I could no longer locate the object. There was still about 1 mile or so of trail that we had to walk and I looked in the sky to rest of the way. I cant help but to think that if I had stayed where I was originally at, I could have seen what happened to the object. I dont know if it just took off on the same course or flew further into the sky or what. I know that this sounds crazy and all, but that is what I saw. This took place at Jefferson Barracks Park in South Saint Louis County. If anyone else has seen anything like this, this past Saturday please respond. thanks for your time. Also when the object was stopped or hoovering or whatever you call it, the light was still flashing in the same manner I first noticed it. this is my first time reporting or even seeing anything that I could not explain away. Please help<n>

I saw past a model plane and spotted a clear sphere in the direction of Denmark Hill as viewed from a little north of the old control tower e\west of the main strip. It seemed far away and was traveling east-South East straight and level flight. Its size was 3mm diameter as measured with the fingers at full arms length. Its height was about 20 degree above horizon. Its appearance was of a glass ball in that I could see the complete spherical outline with the left side being slightly brighter. This agrees with where the sun was (not sure of the time as I did not take my watch that day, however the program (I have a copy) states that the model aircraft were on from 10:41am to 11:05am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is more on the actual sequence and timing of my observation:    Spotted it while looking at a model (large model, 1-2 meters across) from a distance of about 50 meters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped following the model (from left to right) and watched it intently for about 5-8 seconds and then I deliberately looked away while closing and rolling my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looked back; I could not see it straight away: perfectly clear sky;  nothing to focus on anywhere so I strained and then I caught it (10 seconds later) again, now it was smaller and seemed further away and was blending into the blue of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It only dawned on me then that I had my 35mm SLR and a 200mm lens with me so I quickly opened  the bag, fitted the 200mm (took about 15 seconds) looked up and tried and tried to see it again but could not. I raised the camera up and looked through the lens (only slight advantage for the eyes in object size but screens out side light) but to no avail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What a bummer! If only I had prepared my camera upon arrival I reckon I would have caught it and at a size that would blow up nicely!      My feelings are as follows:  It was not a balloon due to its straight and determined flight path, its speed, and its size which is difficult for me to work out though it gave me the immediate impression that it was large, say 3 plus meters across. This impression was formed due to my experience of observing aircraft at altitude and distance (ex RAAF and keen follower of Air Force displays) and my rather good view over the Amberley area from my street in Sadliers Crossing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed rigid, as if it was a solid globe structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not immediately cause me to think it was unusual as I have seen much in the way of junk flying around in the sky especially paper and plastic bags! It was the fact that it was so straight and purposeful in flight that grabbed my interest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Logical answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nuh. Can’t think of any.  And I’ll tell you what it reminded me of, early in the peace - that shot of the ball flying across the fields in the crop circles documentary that is available on DVD! Except the object I saw was much clearer than the one as presented on that DVD and traveled dead straight!    That’s it!!!<n>

He was several miles from his home in a very rural area, when in the distance, he saw what appeared to be a fire on a hillside. As he drove closer, it became apparent that the &#34;fire&#34; was not a fire at all, but a large moving object. He came to a crossroad near his home and he stopped and exited his car to get a better look. Upon exiting, he described that the object was moving from the north and toward him. He stated that the &#34;fire&#34; which he thought he was seeing turned out to be three huge bubble shaped lights on the bottom of a giant triangular craft, moving straight at his location quite slowly, maybe 40-50 mph and at treetop level. He became afraid and started to run but then realized that there was nowhere to run to.The craft passed directly over him and he stated that the lights which were burning brightly, lit the bottom of the craft and he could plainly see rib-like structures evenly spaced across the object, having the greatest definition along the centerline of the craft. he also stated that the object covered the entire sky and appeared to be several hundred feet wide and also equally long. The craft was described as being highly reflective, metallic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft passed over him, he states that the sound seemed to reverberate through his body, described as a low frequency throbbing hum. The witness also stated that his skin seemed both to be tingling and burning .<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several seconds the object passed to the south of the witness and turned west, without banking and quickly moved away to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This witness reported the events to me on Sunday, October 3rd. He stated that at this time he had awaken with a metallic taste in his mouth and also had a slight nosebleed. Today, October, 4th, While I was interviewing the witness he showed me his back which looked slightly sunburned and called me later today telling me that his face feels burned  and he feels weak and tired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have advised him to seek medical attention . It should be noted that this witness is highly reliable, retired military.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Faa radar facility at &#34;tri&#34; some 20 miles away logged no anomolous returns or logged any reports from aircraft or citizens.

It was traveling at a slow speed. It had no lights and it was very hard to determine what it looked like exactly because of the cloudy sky contrast against the object.<n>

I looked around at my surrondings like I usually do and out of nowhere a very bright and extremely big circular object moved in the sky. Also the evening was a bit cloudy but this object was like a jewel among the darkness for a few seconds that it appeared. It moved so fast and within seconds it disappeared as fast as it appeared. I really do not know what I saw but from my distance it was high in the sky but it was so big that I could see how bright it was and that it was round in shape. I figure if this was a shooting star or satellite it would have left a trail to follow but this did not. I came in to tell my family immediately because I was not sure what to think. I also believe it was just pure chance that I saw this because it happened so quick. I would normally not go online to tell this story but I thought it might be important for you to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After observing for several minutes, the lights started to move toward me from the West to East. It passed almost directly overhead at about 500 feet. There were two crafts. Both were shaped like triangles. The lead craft had two outboard white strobing lights and a light on the front. It also had what looked like fluffy whit lights inboard of the strobes. These were definitely not FAA regulation navigation beacons. The second craft had the triangular shape following below the first and to the rear of the first craft. This one only had a red light in the middle of its silhouette. There was absolutely no noise. They were proceeding very slowly and eventually turned North in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The local newspapers later reported that strange lights were seen in the sky.

I stood looking for a few minutes but saw nothing more.  About 10 min. later I came back outside with binoculars because I saw planes high enough not to hear and I wanted to watch if they were circling the area.  As I moved out of view of the plane I saw two circular lights moving through or behind a small cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were smaller than the oval, round and moving seperately, kind of zig zagging and very fast.

It had a large fuselage, and at the top, there were a wing on each side that came out from the craft at the top of the fuselage about twenty five or so feet, and then took a sharp 90 degree downward bend extending about 15 feet.  The fuselage was not round but it was more like a boat hull but not noticeably rounded at the bottom, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the bottom of the craft to the top of the fuselage, it must have been between about thirty and forty or so feet and it must have been sixty to seventy feet to possibly eighty feet in length. There was arching violet to purple colored electricity all over the hull and wings of the craft but particularly the wings. The electricity reminded me of the kind you see in a TESLA coil. I could feel, smell, and hear the noises of the exhaust gasses as the ship hovered. There was a hatchway, a debarking/embarking stairway passage door, and there was a man about six feet tall standing in the hatchway. The hatchway was at the bottom of the fuselage, and behind him, you could see a staircase going up to a higher deck inside the ship. He just sort of looked at me, and I looked back. I didn&#39;t act surprised, and in another instant, the ship zipped away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  Report is well written, but we wonder, nevertheless, whether it is a serious-minded report.  Genuine UFO&#39;s generally are not reported to have wings.  PD))<n>

I happened to look up and see a bright orange light in the sky moving north parallel to the coastline and bay. At first I thought it was a plane with its landing lights on except the color was a bright orange and the light was moving slowly. Eureka is often covered by a cloud deck as it was that day and I estimate it to have been about 800- 1000 (Thousand) feet above the ground. There were also patchier clouds approximately 400-600 feet above the ground though far fewer. The light was below the 800-1000 foot cloud deck, but above the 400-600 foot cloud deck. As the light moved behind the lower clouds it would become obscured momentarily. I spent probably at least five minutes just watching it from the street. By now my curiosity was raised so I went to the back yard to get a better look. It continued this path for another couple minutes. It then made a logical arcing turn westward where it began to increase velocity away from my position. The intensity of the light dissipated and it eventually disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most similar thing you could compare it to is a helicopter with a spotlight, however their was no noise, and I tried very hard to hear anything. The light remained constant and could be compared to a flare, but it did not descend in elevation. It could have been a mylar balloon caught in different air currents, except it was emanating light (And was under the cloud deck) and was accelerating slowly. All that was visible was a orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not seen anything like it before or after. And its been a couple years since this sighting but I remember it well and it was witnessed by one other person that I know of, and others must have seen it as well.

At times it would pause and then move erratically in movements that just made no sense and then at times seemed like patterns of right angles repeating them selves. at other times when in a pause mode, it would appear as if different colors would pulse of red, blue and white. Then at another point in time two others appeared along side of it doing the same similar movements but were not around as long as the first one to make other observations of. As the sun started to rise and the stars  started to dissapear this shiny circuler object still appeared faintly. At times the object would dissapear and reapear when a normal air craft would circle around about once every 15 minutes as if doing some kind of surveilance of the object them selves.  Then all of a sudden it was gone and we were all left in shock because we know that what we saw was not from this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
