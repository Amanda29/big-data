Stops and stays in the same place for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One aircraft flying silently over Del Mar/ Encinitas, CA.  From west to east.  Suddenly stopped, continued stationary for several minutes.  I noticed that there were two other similar looking aircraft with exactly the same kind of lights (two white lights close together with a red light at the tips of the &#34;wings&#34;.  Already stationary in the sky in a triangular formation fairly far apart but over the same geographic area.  Heading back out soon to see if they are still there.  Absolutely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Small white ligh|9/12/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/009/S09191.html|3|ndxe195912| Silent, Extreme Bright White Disc of Light, approx. 100 foot diameter Hovered approx. 10 minutes then &#34;Switched Off&#34;.  Small white light in same location shone beam.  When Beam turned off the light source changed colors several times, then silently flew away at extreme high speed straight and climbing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time of my first sighting was during the pre -Christmas season of 1959.  At that time my husband had completed some college in the electrical engineering program.  He is now a forty year computer professional.  I was a high- school grad at that time but now have a  B.A. in psychology.  I was pregnant with my first child. My husband and I were driving from Highland Park, CA to Hollywood, he was behind the wheel and I sat beside him.  We were at the intersection of Eagle Rock Blvd. and Verdugo Road.   Because the traffic was very heavy we had to sit through several signal changes. While waiting at that intersection, my attention was drawn to an enormous intensely white aerial light.  The view occupied a minimum of four inches of the top left quadrant of the driver’s side windshield.  (That put it south-west of our location.)  My first thought was that it must be a nearby helicopter operating some sort of huge search-light.  But I quickly realized that it was too large and too stationary to be a helicopter (it did not even waver).  After watching it for a couple of minutes, I asked my husband what it was, but he didn’t know. I kept watching it as we approached and finally crossed the busy intersection.  Then we drove a short distance up the hill on Fletcher Drive below Forest Lawn Cemetery before we pulled to the curb and parked.  Being parked on the hillside put us much closer to the altitude of the object which was about a quarter of a mile to the south-west (at most) and probably no more than fifty feet higher than us. My husband got out of the car to have an unobstructed view.  I declined, wanting to stay out of the cold night air.  As I recall, we communicated about what we were watching through the open driver’s window.  The light was completely motionless and silent. We saw no apparent structure above or around the light (that doesn’t mean that there was no structure, only that we could not see the structure).  It appeared to be an enormous two-dimensional intensely bright white disk- shaped light source.  (It was more intense than advertising search-lights.)  Below it was a clearly defined, sharp edged, three-dimensional field of illumination.  Within that field of light which encompassed the rooftops of some old buildings, everything was as clear as if it were daylight.  My impression was that the buildings were turn of the century hotel or business structures.  My memory for the details of the experience is growing hazy, but I don’t believe the light reached all the way to the ground. Based roughly on the assumed sizes of the rooftops and their geometric relationship to the disk I estimated the size of the disc to be about<n>
