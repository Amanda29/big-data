12/24/81 20:00|Bedford County (Stewertsville Area)|VA|Disk|1hour to 1 hour and 30  m|close encounter of the second kind, 15 feet from disk shaped craft.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32737.html|2|ndxe198112| close encounter of the second kind, 15 feet from disk shaped craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I were travaling back home from a day of christmas shoping in Roanoke via route 24. We were talking about the birth of jesus and the star of david and had just past the blue ridge  parkway bridge that goes over top of route 24. We where talking about the star of david when I looked up into the sky and said. &#34;did the star of david look likr that mommy?&#34; Directly ahead of us in the sky was what appeared to be the brightest star I had ever seen. It seemed to take my mother by suprise as well because of her reaction. By this time we had gone up the first hill on the way to Stewerstville, and where passing Wonder Drug on our right hand side of the road. By this time we where discussing how bright the object in the shy was, and how it appered to be gitting lower in the shy. We went up the second hill on the way two stewertsville and took a left at the Hopin store (now its a getty mart I think). By this time about twenty minutes have past from the time we first noticed the bright star. we past sterwertsville elementary on the right kept our attention on the star. By this time my mother is getting a little excited I think bucase I remmeber her saying someting about how it was fallowing us. As far as I could tell it was going along the same path as we were. We lived in the shady Grove area, and the road goes down a step hill and through a couple of s&#39; turns. My mother is starting to panic because the star is right behind us. We dirve through the curves and come too a small pond and work shop on the right side of the road. ( the pond is dryed up today but the work shop is still there). We pull off the road in front of the pond which is on the right side of the car, we rolled down the windows. By this time about 35 minutes have passed. The bright star was about 100 yards from the far side of the pond. Then the Bright lites just turned off! There was a disk (two plates face too face) object about 15 to 20 feet off the water of the pond. The moon was full that night and the reflection of the disk could be seen slowly, the disk came across the pond. The water didn&#39;t move there where no ripples of any kind. The only sound that the craft made was the sound of what sounds like an amplifer makes when it is turned up to full blast but no music is playing. My mother and I just sat ther not making a sound, watching this disk shaped craft. The craft made its way right over the car. We could not have been much more than 15 feet from it. I can say how far we where from it because it was inches away from the power lines, and power lines are maybe twenty feet from the ground. I don&#39;t know how long we sat there but we didn&#39;t get home until almost 10:00 o&#39;clock that night. My father was kind of pissed we got home so late. My mother can&#39;t remember just how long we where there either, but I am sure it was at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. there are few things I can remember fully from my child hood but this I can remember like it was yesterday the smell of the air and the sound that that craft made have been implanted in my mind. It changed my mothers live as well. She quite going to church and hasn&#39;t ever gone back. I would love to know how the technology that alowed that ship to fly!!<n>

12/1/81 21:00|Orlando|FL|Light|15 minutes|17 lights that appeared they were playing tag in the night sky.|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54220.html|4|ndxe198112| 17 lights that appeared they were playing tag in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if this counts since it was quite a few years ago but while driving home from my grandmother&#39;s home, my mother noticed numerous lights in the western sky flying super fast, stopping, moving up and down and at various angles.  She told us to look and proceeded to pull over.  My mother, siblings and I got out of the car and watched this strange phenomenon.  It appeared that these 17 lights were playing, flying toward each other and away at unbelievable speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other people coming out of the shopping center looked up to see what we were looking at. Everyone freaked out. Since I was an 11 year old, I remember telling my mother that I thought they were angels playing tag.  It was unbelievable. The lights appeared the same as stars but were much large.  I would say they measured about 90-100 feet across flying at 7000 feet. My mother was so excited that she telephoned my father and told him to come to where we were to see it but they soon flew abruptly upward after pulling into a tight circular formation.<n>

I have been looking since this time for someone who has seen or heard of such a craft.Also...before we saw the craft, we&#39;d been singing (silly family songs) and recording them...then the craft came...didn&#39;t turn off the recorder, as it happened so fast...on the tape, we were screaming, as I described before, and when we described what it looked like and listened to the tape later, the description wasn&#39;t recorded.<n>
