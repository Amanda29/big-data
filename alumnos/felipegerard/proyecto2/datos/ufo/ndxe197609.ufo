I saw what appeared to be an oval shaped object wrapped or swaddled in a somewhat goldish, metallic material.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36314.html|1|ndxe197609| Their was a green fog. I saw what appeared to be an oval shaped object wrapped or swaddled in a somewhat goldish, metallic material.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a week night in September of 1976. My Daughter M had just started kindergarten. I was married to B. We were living in a little house on Seminary Dr. in St. Paul, MN. We had gone to bed about 9:30, as we usually did on week nights. It was probably several hours later when I woke with a start to find that B was not in bed with me. This would not have been unusual except that he had to work the next morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked through the house stopping to check on M, who, was missing from her bed. While B being gone was not much cause for concern, he would never, on the longest day of his life, have taken a 5 year old with him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began to panic. I ran to the back door with the intention of looking to see if our van or car were gone, when I opened it there was a green haze or fog which was quite thick. My dog ran out into the yard, I screamed for him to come back which he did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My panic turning into terror, I picked up the phone but put it back down. Who would I call, and what would I tell them? That my Daughter and Husband were missing, and my house was enveloped in a green fog? Right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the kitchen sink, which was clear of dishes, and splashed my face with cold water in a vane attempt to compose myself. I got a glass of water, drank it and put the glass down on the right side of the sink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was snot nosed and sniveling. I paced the length of our small house repeatedly, stopping to look in M&#39;s room. Was I having some sort of bizarre psychotic episode, or was this just a terrible nightmare? Yes, the Granddaddy of all nightmares. With this in mind I went back to bed. I lay there in a sweat, with my eyes tightly shut, saying to myself, between heaving sobs, &#34;This is just a bad dream, this is just a bad dream&#34; At some point I noticed that the lights were on in my bedroom. I didn&#39;t recall turning them on. Our security light and the corner street lamp provided more than enough illumination to see most everywhere in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked down toward the end of the bed and to my horror saw what appeared to be an oval shaped object wrapped or swaddled in a somewhat goldish, metallic material.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened my mouth to scream. Nothing but a wheezing whimper would pass my lips. Truly frozen with fear, I was pumping adrenaline at a rate I thought might kill me. My heart wasn&#39;t beating, it was buzzing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some time passed before I was able to move one of my feet, very slowly, out of the fetal position to push this object further away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember a thing after that until daylight when I awoke to find that B was in bed beside me. I raced to M&#39;s Room where she lay sleeping peacefully. As I walked back to the bedroom I glanced at the sink. There was my glass, on the right side. The light in the bedroom was off. I glanced in a mirror and noticed my face appeared sunburnt. At breakfast I could see that M and B looked sunburnt too. I recall thinking to myself that it had been cloudy and cold all week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pushed this incident to the back of my mind in a category all it&#39;s own labeled &#34;Nightmare like no other&#34; and went on with my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few years later as I sat in a Dentist&#39;s waiting room (in San Diego) paging through a magazine, I noticed an article that pretty nearly described my ordeal. Intrigued, I stopped at a book store on my way home. As I looked through the books on UFO&#39;s and the like I came across some drawings of odd looking, supposed, human/alien infants. One was of a red haired baby wrapped in an oval shaped goldish colored blanket.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking back on the events of that night, I wish that I hadn&#39;t been so fearful and that I would have closely examined that oval shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyone out there had a similar experience? If so I would like to hear from you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, R<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I want to file this report with you even though it happen years ago.  Peter has anyone else reported to you this type of UFO that I&#39;m going to mention below?, My name is ((name deleted)) and I live in Bordentown NJ !  Back in the late 70&#39;s, around mid September me and two friends ((male name deleted)) and ((female name deleted)) were sitting outside on his back porch (screened in) one Sunday evening.  Well we were  watching    &#34; All In The Family &#34;  on TV  when ((male)) said, Hey ((female)), I&#39;m out of Beer, can you go and get me some !  ((female)) said sure but you have to come with me ! ((male)) didn&#39;t want to go so he asked me to take the ride with ((female)) to the Local Bar ! I said sure, no problem ! Peter, just for the record The only thing ((female)) and I was drinking was  Tea ! Well it was getting dark out and ((female)) and I took off for the Bar.  We turned right onto Groveville Rd., it&#39;s a nice long road, not a well lite road that takes you to Rt. 130 in Bordentown that leads you to the local bar.  half way down Groveville Rd. I noticed just little above the tree tops a very large, slow moving Object, moving across the road from left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the bottom of this object  appear to have lights on it, but real strange lights, like it was writing out a message, but it was nothing we understood ! I&#39;m telling you Peter this Craft was moving maybe 5 miles an hour if that, and made no sound at all !  I said to Kathy, that&#39;s a UFO, she replied no way !  As it pass over to the otherside of the road, just above the tree tops, it started to move back the way it came !  It never stop, it made no turns, it just started heading back the way it came, like someone threw it in reverse without ever stopping!  nice and easy, and like I said before, No Noise ! ((female)) was so scare she screemed out loud  &#34;Oh No Let Get the Heck Out Of Here&#34;  We just took off and hit the bar to pick-up ((male&#39;s)) six pack !  Now if memory serves me it was about 8:00pm when we left  ((male&#39;s)) place for the bar. It only takes 5 mins. to get to the bar !  ((female)) stayed in the Car I went inside to get the beer, From the time ((female)) said Let get out of here and arriving to the bar is no more than two mins. As I got out of the Car I looked towards the woods where this thing was going ( you can see real far from the parking lot) but didn&#39;t see a thing ! As slow it was moving I should have seen something !  Well we made it back to ((male&#39;s)) place, Boy was he HOT!!  He was very angry at us for taking so long, plus ((female)) is ((male&#39;s)) girl ! We told him that we just went to the Bar and back, to us the whole ordeal took no more than 15 mins. if that ! We also told him about the UFO we saw but, he didn&#39;t want to hear it, he swears we were gone about an hour or longer !  He took his beer and started to drink it, ((female)) and I had Tea. As we were making our tea we talked about what happen and noticed that it was around 9:45 pm .. I told ((female)) it was getting late so I&#39;ll have a quick cup and head home !!  It wasn&#39;t until years later that I made a connection with what happen to us when  I read &#34; Missing Time &#34; ! All the Best to you !

I roamed the streets after hours many, many times.  My parents put me to bed around 10:00 PM and around 11:00 PM I took out of my room, down the wall and out on to the kuche to meet up with some friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of hours of, eh, recreation I headed home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hopped onto the wall that surrounded my home, from there up to my balcony and just before I opened the door to my room I heard the roar of afterburners overhead.  I looked up and saw an F-4 full throttle screaming across the sky above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking war was about to happen, I hunkered down, but continued to watch as this jet fruitlessly tried to follow a darting light in the sky.  For the next 5 minutes or so I watched a light bounce and dart, like a pinball, around the sky while the Phantom doggedly tried to pursue.  From east to west, north to south they played a game of tag.  On afterburner, off afterburner, the plane was way more interesting to me than than its target.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last view I had of the object it was chasing was when something split off from the light and dropped down, in the direction of the airport.  The F-4 hit  the gas, full afterburner, in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of minutes of silence, I gently opened the balcony door and crept back into my room hoping my parents were still asleep.  That&#39;s the story....<n>
9/16/76 23:30|Western Pacific Ocean||Oval|2-3 Minutes|I often wondered why we were the only two that saw the UFO on such a large ship.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32476.html|6|ndxe197609| I often wondered why we were the only two that saw the UFO on such a large ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been reluctant to tell this story over the years due to disbelief to the listeners. This happened at around 23:00-23:30 on the flight deck in 1996 when I was stationed aboard the USS Coral Sea CV-43, an American aircraft carrier. The first aircraft to leave the ship before a launch is the rescue helicopter and is the last to land. I worked as an aircraft refueler (purple shirt) and was in charge of quanity and quality control of aviation fuel operations. After rescue helicopter landed,I was doing &#34;mop up operations&#34; (Making sure that all fod materail (trash and equipment) was removed so that we could get ready for the morning launch. I was walking aft of the ship alongside a shipmate (Aviation Ordnance, red shirt)when I saw an assortment of blinking lights directly behind the ship. I walked cautiously to investigate and was simply amazed at what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was round and circular in shape and about 20-30 was just hovering (or floating) behind the ship with the blinking lights. In about 2-3 minutes, it simply disappeared as if it sank in the deep waters behind the ship. I realized that my shipmate had a grip on my arm with his mouth wide open and states, &#34;Wow, did you see that!&#34; I said , &#34;Yes, did you see it?&#34; I left the scene, and my ship mate still standing there in disbelief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told a couple of fellows about it and they simply state, &#34;Why don&#39;t you give me some of what you been smoking&#34; and they simply laugh it off. I rarely tell anyone of the incident unless they initiate reports seeing UFO&#39;s. I have never seen anything since that incident, but I often watch the skies. This incident has not shaken my faith, I still believe in God and I am a Christian, I just know that we are not alone in this vast universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

I and my girlfriend (who is now my wife) looked up into the dark sky. We both were driving our motorcycles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I urged her to stop. When she did she got in panic, and drove away quickly. I stayed behind to watch it. First both of us stood in a column of light, every sound was gone even from our motor cycles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was standing there, it came towards me, me standing in that light. My wife saw it looking back. it was hanging there now and than gliding away, lights were couloring from wite to rose and purple as if it was talking, again every sound had been vanished (cars from the motorway and factories in the neigh-berhood).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was great, but we dare not to tell anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day all over Holland had been sightings it stood in the papers next day. As quick as it appeared it glided away in fast speed, faster than a meteor, from one second to the other. I never believed in it but my life and thoughts and my wife&#39;s thoughts have been changed since that night!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Keep up the good work, We know some are watching us, maybe for the good!!!  (I hope)  We never told this to anyone.  Like to give you this information after all those years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ever hoped to see it again, unfortunately we haven&#39;t..…<n>

Witness is former law enforcement officer.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM SAME WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter..Thank You for your Response..I Have always thought what we experienced .. was extremely interesting as you will Note with the Follow Up Details I will Provide..I don&#39;t mind if you make reference to My Law Enforcement background..Just do not use My name under any circumstances..Outside of telling some family members and retired Military friends I have not made this information Public prior to now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional REPORT INFORMATION ..It has been so long ago that i gave you An Approximate Date..I am sure it was either 1976 or 1975..I can remember that within a Year of Our Experience..I read a Story in Newsweek or some other National Publication about Dozens of UFO Sightings over Military and Nuclear Weapon Storage Facilitys all across the United States and the story included a Map of the United States that was covered with sighting locations and Most had occured during the same approximate time we had Our Experience Near Mt. Elanor.I Remember making that Connection quite Clearly at that Time...That is when I began to wonder if this Craft  was Approaching the Newly Constructed Bangor Trident Submarine Base on Hood Canal..I don&#39;t know if any Nuclear Weapons were stored there yet at that time..<n> <n><n> <n><n> SPECIFIC DETAILS..THE  MOST REMARKABLE OCCURENCES THAT NIGHT WERE..THIS AIRCRAFT CAME DOWN FROM THE AREA OF RUGGED MOUNTAIN PEAKS AND PASSED DIRECTLY OVER OUR HEADS..continuing down the mountainside in rugged terrain in pitch black conditions toward Hood canal several miles below us..<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. IT SOUNDED  LIKE IT WAS JUST ABOVE TREE TOP HEIGHT AND I  WOULD ESTIMATE AN ALTITUDE OF POSSIBLY NO MORE THAN 100 FEET..<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. IT WAS MOVING EXTREMELY SLOWLY,  JUDGING BY THE SOUND, PROBABLY NO MORE THAN A FEW MILES AN HOUR, AND SOUNDED LIKE SOMETHING I WOULD CONSIDER A STEALTH-TYPE AIRCRAFT ((FLIGHT)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. The Most Incredible thing was the SOUND it made which was an AUDIBLE HUMMING SOUND..which also seem to make the ground around us Vibrate as it Passed Directly Overhead.. The Best way i can describe it is if You Have ever gone into a Hydro-electric Dam to the Gemerator Room and Heard that Sound and Felt the Vibrations those Generators Make..That is the EXACT Closest Sound I Can Relate This to..<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5. It was NOT like any Conventional Aircraft Engine I have Heard..We could not Hear it off in the Distance as You can a Combustion Engine Approaching.. We Only Became aware of it Just BEFORE it Very slowly Passed Directly overhead..and for a short time after it continued down the Valley..I doubt if you were any distance away you would even be aware of it Flying Nearby..<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6. The Weather conditions were Good, No Rain, But VERY Dark, No Moon or Illumination..I could Not see any Lights on this Craft at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7. We Both sensed that it was a Pretty Large Craft, just by the Sound of It passing overhead, You got the impression of something BIG..<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8. For some Reason we Both sat there afterward somewhat shocked,and had uneasy feelings of Vunerability..We Both immediately agreed that what ever flew over us was No Conventional Airplane and the Only thing that could Have Made those Sounds was some type of UFO..and still Believe so today..It was definately SOME TYPE of  Unconventional Flying Aircraft..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best Regards ((name deleted)).(.Hope You Find this Useful Somehow..Peter)<n>

My bedroom widow faced the south. I was doing homework, reading a book when motion outside caught my attention.  When I looked up I saw an orange line moving slowly across the sky from the south.  I ran outside to the front of the house and called for my older brother who then joined me.  The light which must have been approximately 100 feet in the air left its reflection on our pond as it moved over our feild.  It was a perfectly clear evening, you could see the backdrop of stars perfectly.  The orange line, which must have been 20 yards in length and perfectly quiet, then stopped moving when it was approximately 1/2 mile to the north of our house and sat straight down until it was out of view.  We waited for what seemed like a long time, but could only have been several minutes, looking in that direction when it arose from behind the trees/houses everything else that was blocking our view. The object then started to the west what seemed for a few minutes and then just shot off to the north and disappeared.  The next day when by brothers and I reached our bus stop the large maple or oak tree that had stood behind a neighbor&#39;s house was burnt to a stump. I have with-held telling this account of what happened so many years ago because of the stigmata that surrounds these events, but I remember it like it was yesterday.  I only wish to know if anyone else during that year spotted an object like the one I did during that time and place.<n>

It resonated when it moved, about 5 mph. It followed the electricity wires, and hung by a similar matt black attachment from a void above it, like a rip in the sky but with soft edges.  The cuboid didn&#39;t halt when it got to the steelwork of the pylon, it passed through it and retained its shape.  We got freaked out at that.  Then it noticed us and then stopped for about five seconds, hovering perfectly still, with no noise. It was watching us.  We felt as though it had registered us and then continued to go on along the grid over the housing estate at a height of about seventy five feet. Remarkably, no one but us saw it that night.  I was 7 years old, and no one would listen to me. Me and my step brother kind of just looked at each other with bemusement.  But it has caused severe problems with my relationships.  I feel totally alienated from humanity...and abandoned by that whatever it was.  It just went off like we just didn&#39;t matter.<n>

L. in an apart|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50322.html|12|ndxe197609| In September 1976, I had another UFO encounter.  This time I was out of the Army and living with my former girlfriend H. L. in an apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, she came running back inside the apartment screaming.  I asked her what was wrong.  She said that a UFO was hovering 200 feet above her head.  I didn’t see anything.  I noticed she was hysterically crying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove her to the Sacramento Sheriff’s Department and they had her use their phone to call an 800 number to call Dr. Allen Hynek of the Chicago, Illinois Bureau of UFO Investigations.  Dr. Hynek sent us some forms to fill out, so she could describe what she saw.  Dr. Hynek later called me and asked what I was doing.  I told him I was watching &#34;Dick Van Dyke’s The Comic&#34; on TV.  He asked what happened when Helen was screaming outside, I said the TV went on the blink, it displayed static and I was trying to fix the TV, when I heard her screaming.  He told me that when UFOs hover nearby, that they cause disturbances on car engines, TVs and radios.  This was a normal occurrence.  Later I learned that 2 other people in Sacramento saw the same UFO in two different locations and it was reported in the Sacramento Bee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From 1979 to 1986 I was back in the U.S. Army.  This time I joined Military Intelligence and I was stationed at PIC-K (Photo Interpretation Center, Korea).  This time my code name was &#34;Hollywood or Joe Hollywood,&#34;  I wore a black suit now and I was clean-cut.  I kept the sunglasses though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My job as a 97 Bravo (Intelligence Analyst) was to work with Image Interpreters in identifying targets in North Korea and Red China, such as T-72 tanks, etc.  I would create what is called a &#34;sitmap&#34; pinpointing targets discovered by Image Interpreters, that studied reconnaissance aerial photographs.  I would categorize certain photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We would go on what is called a ‘hot run’ from Seoul, Korea, (Yongsan Barracks) to Osan Air Force Base.  The vehicle would display a placard that indicated that the vehicle could not be stopped for any reason.  There was a combination lock on the trunk of the vehicle and a combination lock in the suitcase inside the trunk,  the driver and myself would have ½ of the combination to open the trunk and the suitcase.  We would place the hotrolls (film) into the suitcase and head back to Seoul.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my time as an Intelligence Analyst I categorized 6 photos taken by reconnaissance satellites of what appeared to be UFOs.  The UFOs moved on their own accord, as if they were guided by some kind of intelligence.  Therefore the 6 photos were significant by Military Intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The photos moved up the intelligence chain from Military Intelligence to DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) to CIA (Central Intelligence Agency).  From there, I don’t know where the photos went.  While at PIC-K, I worked with Air Force Intelligence, Navy Intelligence, DIA, CIA, Marine Recon, US Army (Green Beret) Special Forces, 101st Airborne, US Army Rangers, 82nd Airborne, Delta Force, Navy Seals.  It was necessary for us to work closely with certain elite military groups.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another strange photo I once saw was given to me to categorize.  It was a photo of an American POW in Vietnam, taken in 1981.  The photo went into a metallic box with a combination lock and disappeared up the intelligence channel.  The spooks (intelligence personnel) I worked with, would never discuss UFOs.  Most spooks belonged to some sort of secret society, most were Freemasons and I was a Rosicrucian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I departed Korea, I signed up for the 82nd  &#34;Screaming Eagles&#34; Airborne and Special Forces training and they were ready to send me to Ft. Gordon, Georgia and Ft. Bragg, North Carolina and I was called to do a special assignment.  I received an H identifier and became an Army instructor and taught the Soviet Threat for OPFOR (Opposing Forces).  I wore a Russian uniform, ski mask, black gloves and talked with a fake Russian accent and called myself &#34;Corporal Dowbowski.&#34;  I would instruct the Soviet Threat, teaching the W.E.F.T. (Wings, Engine, Fuselage and Tail) on Soviet Aircraft, kill zones on Soviet aircraft and land roaming vehicles, the use of many Soviet weapons from the AK-47 to the SVD Sniper Rifle in which I was proficient.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my time with OPFOR, I learned from Intelligence circles, that the Russian KGB also knew and were aware of what exactly UFOs were and where they came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day, I don’t know the answers to the UFO mystery, but hopefully one day our Government will disclose what they know to the public.<n>

All three of us (my mother, my cousin and I) were born and raised in the Laredo. I had come to Laredo to visit my family, as I had been living in Mexico since 1956.   My cousins knew I was interested in UFOs and that I believed there was life in other planets.  They told me that there had been a lot of sightings recently in Laredo with people calling in to tv &amp; radio stations etc. about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That afternoon, my cousin drove my mother and me to her house.  She parked her car on Davis St. looking north to let us out and then she started yelling, &#34;The thing! The thing!&#34; I looked at her and said, &#34;What thing?&#34;  She then pointed straight ahead and again repeated the same words.  I looked towards where she was pointing and a short distance away, hovering right above the trees was The  Thing.  It was dusk and I could see clearly the oval shaped ufo with lighted windows all around it.  As my cousing changed shifts to drive toward! s it, it zipped away in an instant.  One minute it was there, the next it was gone.  We were very excited about our experience which I have never forgotten and still tell people about it, especially because it was such a close encounter.  It wasn&#39;t like way up in the sky and is it or isn&#39;t it.  We know what we saw.   At that time it didn&#39;t occur to any of us to report it. Now I wish I had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was &amp;quot;trash night&amp;quot;. My parents purchased a new easy chair for the living room. My Dad and I carried the old one out to the curb for the garbage man to collect. The chair was still comfortable. I sat down and spent some time gazing at the stars. I noticed a fuzzy ball of white light orbiting in a perfect circle, it appeared, right overhead. The light was dim and about the size of a dime held at arm&#39;s length. It circled overhead for a good minute. Then, suddenly, it shot off to the Northeast at a tremendous speed. Seconds later two jet aircraft looking like they were at full afterburner streaked right across the spot where the UFO had been orbiting seconds before. The jets disappeared over the horizon on a Northeast heading, apparently in pursuit of the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was used to seeing the planes land at night and was familiar with the slow approaches from the south and the west to east patterns of planes landing.  I was also familiar with the airplanes turning in the final approach to the airport at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I witnessed or thought I did was a disk shaped object with illuminated window panels and blinking red and blue lights on the outer edge of the object traveling east.  At first I thought it to be a blimp traveling west to east or an advertising plane - I had also seen these at night.  What struck me as strange was the speed, sort of a slow deliberate and perpendicular path that was too straight.  I witnessed this and thought the distance to be at least a half mile away which would make the object huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my vantage point the object moved slowly and did not produce the jet sounds that I could make out from that distance that airplanes usually made.  I still thought it was a single blimp until it reached the far eastern edge of my view and another similar object entered my view from the east but moving in a gyroscopic fashion - at the same plane of the horizon and perpendicular direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became excited as the first object stopped dead still and seemed to wait as the second object approached from the west.  It was too much for me to believe and I watched for several minutes (about three) before I left the window to get some water and regroup.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned to the window and to my surprise both of the objects had left the area, I remained watching for a long time but did not see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has been bugging me for over 25 years, want to know for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate.

I don&#39;t remember anything until it was pitch dark and I was in front of the mailboxes with a dark large round disc hovering over me.  I ran home and it followed me, it waited until I ran out with my mother and hovered over the trailer next to ours.  Then it tilted itself so we could see the whole thing. It had lights all aound the perimeter and they worked like a movie marquee in that when one light went off the next one went on and so on all around the saucer.  It was big and very bright and colorful and it seemed that the colored lights had a hypnotizing effect.  There was also a red dome on ! top of it. I can only describe the dome like the red lights on the Navy ships when it is dark (I was in the Navy, retired from Air Force).  There was absolutely no sound.  The date is approximate and the time is approximate because I have missing time.<n>

We often camped in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, usually hitch hiking from Boston and back again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After camping over the weekend we started out heading for home it was late in the day/early evening so we decided we would hang out one more night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not wanting to set up a tent or light a fire, we decided to crawl into our down sleeping bags to keep warm and just go to sleep. We used the porch of the old ranger’s station in Franconia Notch at the base of where “The Old Man of The Mountain” used to be. (Above profile lake)  There was already snow in the mountains and the wind was whipping and freezing so we turned the log benches on their sides and slept behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got up real early because the moon was just coming up and reflecting off the lake (approximately 3:00 AM), It was so beautiful out so we walked around a bit on the side of the highway (next to the lake) so we could get a clear view of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was so clear you could almost reach out and touch the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We always liked to look for and track satellites across the sky (which was easy to do in the mountains away from the city lights) especially this morning since the sky was so clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Spotting a couple of satellites over a period of a half hour we started to walk back to the rangers cabin, “lets see if we can spot one more” before loosing the view under the cabins porch roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking up we both spotted a satellite, I remember saying; “Cool, huh”? Then it just stopped and we said at the same time: “where did it go”?  In one split second four additional (whatever’s’?) shot out across the sky in four opposite directions from where we were looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These four objects traveled across the sky in four directions beyond and out of our site, then just as fast they all came back to the same spot where we last saw the satellite stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then continued across the sky as any normal satellite would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my opinion unless we have the technology to create a spacecraft that can travel at the speeds we witnessed that morning, (Satellite speed) then shoot out four additional objects at approximately six to ten times faster than the original track of what we thought was a satellite and at the distances all four objects traveled and back again is beyond our comprehension.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It almost seemed like it was creating a grid and mapping the area. Like taking a picture of the mountains or something?  Who knows how many stops it was making and how many times it was projecting out these four objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

9/5/76 21:00|Birmingham (UK/England)||Circle|40 minutes|Had a close encounter with UFO which moved silently and seemed to be following and watching me.|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44724.html|21|ndxe197609| Had a close encounter with UFO which moved silently and seemed to be following and watching me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from work and became aware of a small red flashing light in the sky as I left work.  For some reason I continued to look at the red flashing light in the sky which seemed to move at a similar speed to my car the whole of the trip home,(approx.twenty minutes).  In those days,I kept my car in a rented garege a couple of roads away from the road where my house was situated.  After garaging my car I looked again in to the sky and the red flashing light had gone.  I walked from the garage to my road.  As I turned the corner in to my road I observed the red flashing light stationery in the sky above the house opposite to mine. I would say at this point I was approx. 300 ft away from my house.  As I walked to my house, I continued to look at the red flashing light which seemed quite low, above the house opposite (the neighbour&#39;s roof).  As I almost reached my garden gate, the red flashing light came across the road and stopped above my head, at which point the red flashing light went out and a large green light came on which was circular in shape and approx. 20 ft in diameter. When it was a red flashing light accompanying my car, when it was above the neighbours roof and came across the road, went out there was NO outline of any sort of craft whatsoever.  That was strange because it was a clear summer&#39;s night. I remember there was only one cloud in the sky and it was not dark.  As the red flashing light was over the neighbour&#39;s roof it was perfectly still as if it were a fixture and there was no sound.  As it came across the road it moved in perfect silence and did not shake or quiver, it came across the road in a perfect silent line.  When the green light came on (the circular shape), which looked like looking up at the bottom of a saucer, (saucer shaped).  It was just like looking in to a green traffic light. It appeared to be glass. I could not see through the green light to what was behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whilst all this was happening I remember that my mouth dropped open in shock, amazement and shear awe!  I decided to rush inside my house and fetch my family out to share in this most facinating experience.  As I moved, the green light went out and the red flahing light came back on and it moved off in an upward angled direction and went behind the one visiable cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported what I had seen to the then called Elmdon airpot, (now called Birmingham International airport.  At the time they informed me that they had a resident UFO expert who was one of the air traffic controllers.  When I reported my sighting, they said they as the crow flies, we were about two miles from the airport.  They said what I described could be done by a helicopter, but they said it was strange that on that particular night they did not have any helicopters out and said there would not have been helicopters from anywhere else. I remember that when I was on holiday and was lying on the beach I saw and heard a helicopter way up in the distance and it was tiny and loud.  What I saw was just over my head. I don&#39;t know how high.  I would say at a guess, 30ft up. Certainly not in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then rang the airport and they wrote back, unfotunatly I do not still have the letter.  Then letter said because I did not request a radar check they did not do any checks. I rang later that evening of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was interesting was that when I was giving my account at work the next day, a lady who worked there and was listening said &#34;Oh my God&#34; &#34;last night I was sitting in my boy friend&#39;s car at the petrol station&#34;.  &#34;As it was a hot night, I wound the window down and put my head out of the car to get some air&#34;.  &#34;As I looked up there was a massive orange ball hanging low in the sky above the car&#34;.  &#34;I immediatly shut the window and sat almost frozen in my seat, terrified&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has to be said that following my experience, I became facinated for several years in UFOs spending most nights in the garden looking in to the night skys, such was the strength of my experience.  It was only as I came across your web sight that I read that you publish very old sightings and therefore decided to send mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

This event took place 30 years ago.  The only part of the date I could be sure on was that it took place 1 to 2 days before a major holiday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very young then and the whole event seems like a story now, or more like something that I have watched on TV.  Its hard for me to believe that I really saw it.  And as time has passed it has become just a memory, but one of those memories that sticks out in your childhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was late at night.  I would wake up in the middle of the night and go into my parents bedroom to crawl in bed with them or to hang out in their room so that I would not be alone in my room late at night. (I was a kid...what do you want)<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this night I was in their room and was just looking out the window.  The apartment complex we lived in had 4 units per building(2 story) and probably 10 separate buildings.  As I was looking out my parents upstairs window, slowly and silently a metalic saucer shape approximatley 30 feet across moved into my eyesight from over another apartment complex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pace of the object was that of someone walking.  It flew just over the tree tops and the building and thats why I guess it was 30 feet high.  It was about 25-30 feet infront of the window/building that I was in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have re-visited this place since to gage the height and size of the object.  I have drawn pictures of this object a couple of times in my life to better illustrate the object for a few freinds that I have shared the sighting with over the years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked like it was a rough polished metal. Light bronze/silver.  Flat on the bottom except for right in the center of the underside.  It had a 10 foot across inverted cone shaped area that went into the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, it continued to move over the building and over a small parking area (directly infront of me) and continued on in the same direction.  I watched it until it went our of sight.  I waited...it never came back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was so young, the event at the time did not seem that remarkable.  I do not even remember sharing this event with any adult until later in life.  I did though in fact share the experience with my cousins at a holiday/family gathering the next day(or day after).  I remember telling them and them laughing at me.  They were all older than me.  I remember them distinctly asking me if it had lights and what color they were?  I told them it had no lights they continued laughing and asked how I saw it then?   That was the end of my credibility with them and they stopped listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was true, it had no lights.  The moon light, street light or what ever light that was being emitted from the area just reflected off the object to reveal the detail of the metal.  It was so close I didn&#39;t need any other light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that tdateof the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I saw that the light beam was still streaming through the ceiling and looked up to see my friend floating down. She landed on the bed and sat straight up and gaped back at me. We just looked at each other, flabergasted, and then both looked up just as the light blinked out. I immediately got up &amp; went into the other room to answer the phone which was placed next to the picture window in the living room. As I picked up the reciever I was that there was a disc shaped craft hovering about 50 feet over the house. At first I could see the edge of a dark circular shape with an extremely bright circle of light coming out of the middle of the bottom. As I said &#39;Hello&#34; it was slowly traveling northeast away from the house and when it got about 500 yards away the light blinked off and the disc zoomed away into the horizon.

I was a sophomore at Tehran American School.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and five of my TAS buddies went camping in the Alborz mountains.  We were laying out watching the stars late at night. The sky was very clear and the heavens were brilliant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the twinkling stars all of the sudden got much larger as if is was coming toward us. Where all the other stars looked like a pin points in the sky, this star looked like the size of a dime.  Then it stopped getting bigger and shot off in a trajectory that crossed about 1/4 of the sky, then it zigzagged around for a bit, and then it receded into the sky until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple minutes one of my friends said, &#34;Did anybody else just see that?&#34;  We all had.  It was a bright round light in the sky but I have never seen anything move like that before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around that same time, there was a UFO incident reported in the local newspaper.

My father was a military contractor with the Iranian Air Force back then, and it was all the talk among his cohorts.  Dad was very much an unbeliever and wrote it all off to atmospheric conditions and the pilots&#39; active imaginations.  I don’t go along with that, as from my point of view, the night was very clear, and I saw what I saw.

9/1/76 23:00|Ahwahnee|CA|Fireball|2 minutes|Huge fireball hit and one big or three smaller  crafts with blue lights came from where it hit the ground|3/11/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27156.html|25|ndxe197609| Huge fireball hit and one big or three smaller  crafts with blue lights came from where it hit the ground<n> <n><n> <n><n> My two young daughters and my fiancee&#39; and I had gone to our 750 acre ranch above Ahwahnee to our camping spot for a couple nights before school started again in the fall.  I believe it was in early September but I&#39;m not positive about the date only the occurance.  It was either &#39;75 or &#39;76 and had to be late in tne year because it was cold!  We had a small camp trailer there and also an old bedstead which you could put a mattress on so you could sleep outside if you wanted.  The girls chose to sleep in the back of our new Datsun pickup and we clamped a sheet on the roll bar to the tailgate so they would be warmer as the wind was really cold.  They were sleeping and we were hanging a sleeping bag over a clothes line which hung above the head of the bed where we were going to sleep as a sort of windbreak also. It was about 11:00 P.M. and a crystal clear night.  All of a sudden the sky lit up like it was 12:00 noon! We looked toward the east to which we had a perfect view of the mountains of Yosemite amd sailing across the sky at a rapid rate was the biggest fireball I have ever seen in my life!  Not thart I have seen any before or any since this thing was HUGE and it was whistling and had a huge, long firey tail!  At first I thought it was lightening until we saw it!  I litterally thought the sun was falling out of the sky!  It takes some time to register these things because you don&#39;t believe your eyes!  I am glad someone was there to see this with me. So this huge fireball sailed from the east to the north towards Mariposa and we watched it for about 20 seconds or less even until it HIT somewhere over the mountains to the north of us.  When it hit the whole ground shook!  So as we were watching over where it had hit with our mouths hanging wide open before we could say anything here comes right over the top of us three lights in a triangle pattern.  We could not tell if it was one huge object or three fkying in formation.  I finally spoke first as by then I was totally freaking out and said what the ! F--- kin d of plane is that but I knew when I said it, it was no plane.  It or they or whatever made no noise what so ever and they were almost grazing the tops of a couple pine trees next to us.  The light in front (one in front and two behind) glowed bright white and the two behind were an odd blue green color. As they flew over a couple oak trees going from north to south, we ran along side through the trees which took us about 5 seconds till we reached a clearing where we could see the whole sky and all the horizons and they were totally gone!  No noise, no nothing!  We spent the whole night trying to decide what to do.  Should we tell someone?  Should we call the cops and what the heck are they going to do?  We asked a lot of people if they saw anything-it was so hard to miss as it was lit up like broad daylight!  During those years, though, the area was very sparsely populated.  I have always wanted to know if anyone ever saw the same thing becauyse I know something hit the ground in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Stood and watched it for 15-20min. until it sped away. Sped acroos the horizon at lightening speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened about 12 miles from Belzoni,MS on a local road named Broad Lake Rd. The road runs east to west. Our house was located on the north side of the road. We had been attending church that evening and got to the house about 10:30pm. As we got out of the car, my mother and I spotted it at the same time. We both uttered to the others to take a look into the south to southwestern sky about 1/2 mile out where some woods were located. As we stood looking at the object it seemed to be hubbering not more that 50 feet off the top of the trees, spinning around omitting serveral bright colors. Red, Green, Blue, and White. But to me the white light seemed different. It seemed to be reaching out to us, like maybe a scan of some sort. The light was not affected by our appearance. But after about 6-8 minutes the light turned off. We were amazed at what we had seen so we stood there to see if we could see it again. After being turned off for 60 or so, seconds. The light came back on. It continued to hubber and spin in the very same position that we had first seen it, for another 5 to 8 minutes. After that, it moved towards the west at a rate of speed that I have never seen before or again since. During the duration of our expirience, we all agreed that the craft had not made a sound at all. Not even when it left. It has been a number of years since it happened and some of us have departed since. Some of us have a veige memory and some of us dont remember it at all. But, I remember it as if it happened yesterday. We never made a report of our sighting due to the fact that it was a small town and noone would believe us. And some of us didn&#39;t want that type of publicity. At this point in my life, I dont want the publicity either. But maybe someone else in the area had seen it too, and this story will help them some how. Neither me, nor any of my family members were abducted during the sighting. But we did infact see this object in the sky.<n>

Upon returning home I noticed a red light in the sky at the end of the street.  It was a dead end street, and we lived in the boondocks!!  It was dark and the light just hung in the sky.  I watched it for some time, then went into the house and got my brother in-law and mother.  We watched for some time, then my brother dismissed it as a plane.  It did not move, it stayed in one spot.  I do not, to this day, believe it was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Lowered to 500&#39; and was spinning very rapidly with no sound at all.  The saucer was brightly lit with a very luninous look to it.  There were windows evenly spaced around the whole ship which lead me to believe it looked like a spinning rooftop restaurant.  Got in my car and quickly drove toward the yatch basin and as I looked in my outside mirror, I saw the ships reflection and it was following me.  As I approached the yatch basin 2 more people standing outside pointed at it and started to run.  The ship was 2000&#39; above us and then disappeared so quickly that it looked like a star in a matter of seconds.<n>
9/1/76 20:00|Burlington (Canada)|ON|Unknown|10 minutes|Massive array of lights roughly 60 feet in the air pass directly overhead, at low speed, totally silent.|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87835.html|29|ndxe197609| Massive array of lights roughly 60 feet in the air pass directly overhead, at low speed, totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO REPORT Submitted March 19, 2012  Sighting Occurred: 1976.  Burlington Ontario Canada  I was driving home this particular evening in the autumn. It was very dark.  My family at the time lived several miles north of town in the country with very few neighbors.  I was driving north on Appleby Line from Highway 5 (Dundas Highway) at about 60 mph along a straight section of paved road and looked up and to my left (west).  High in the sky I saw what appeared to be a very bright star moving quickly in one direction then stopping and moving in a different direction.  It would pause periodically between movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was impossible to tell how far away it was and therefore how large it was or how fast it was moving.  But from my vantage it was a bright light about the size of a dime and would move a foot or 2 in each direction it traveled.  It had the appearance therefore of bouncing around in the sky.  My parents (my father was a doctor and my mother a registered nurse) had each seen similar lights over the years and this was really the first time I had seen one and it was so large and so obvious I was excited to get home (about 1 mile) to get the whole family out to watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some moments later I turned and looked directly to my left.  Over the field that was adjacent to the road was a massive cluster of lights.  Because it was dark I could not really make out the outline of the object, but I thought at the time it could have been about as large as a passenger jet (727 or perhaps larger). It appeared to be over the middle of the field, traveling in a straight line to the North, at about the same speed I was then traveling.  I thought it might have been a helicopter, since there were some high voltage power lines nearby and I thought maybe there was some kind of inspection going on.  I slowed the car to about 10mph and rolled down my window.  There was no sound at all. The object was “gliding” at about 60-80 feet above the ground and was going only a little faster than my car. It could have been a blimp, except there was no engine noise.  I stopped the car completely at this point to watch and listen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were mostly white.  One or two as I recall were blinking (like lights on an aircraft). What stood out however was an array of red lights.  They appeared rectangular, and 2 sets of 3 across, stacked one above the other.  I remember thinking that they looked like so many sets of Thunderbird tail lights which back then were large and rectangular.  There was also a search light scanning the field below and in front of the object.  I had read about UFO sightings before and heard stories related to me by my father as a follower and believer in UFOs so I had heard of sightings like this.  I seriously thought that perhaps the object was looking for a cow to dissect, since it was a cow field (there were no cows that particular night. Lucky cows).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I considered stopping the car to get out and watch more closely and perhaps flag it down to communicate with it. I recall reasoning however that a) I might be picked up and never heard from again, b) have a close encounter that no one would ever believe, since there were no other witnesses or c) I would stop and it would keep on going and I would not be able to watch it again.  I opted to drive home (very fast) in order to get my family out to see it, so that I would have corroborating witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sped home and up the driveway. I ran into the house to get my parents and brother and sister. Apparently I was so excited and agitated that they could not understand what I was trying to tell them. I ran back out onto the front yard and stood there as this massive array of lights and shadowy form glided over our front yard in total silence. By the time my parents came out to see what I had been yelling about it was a mile or more away and only about the size of a quarter in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad had me draw what I recall it looking like immediately afterward. My heart was racing. It took me hours to calm down. Several days later there was a story in the local paper about a lady who had a sighting and it was accompanied by a drawing that was very similar to mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had many years to contemplate this “sighting” and a number of questions/issues arise. I have also done a great amount of reading and study on cosmology and physics over the years since then:  have always concluded that the lights over the field were the same lights of whatever it was originally up in the sky.  It could be that they were 2 separate objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this object was from a superior intellectual species (either extraterrestrial, other dimensional or from years in the future) and they had the ability to design a craft that could apparently defy gravity, move without engine noise, move at incredible rates of speed, etc….. why would it have lights?   Especially blinking warning lights!  Who are they attempting to warn? Would it not be within their technology to fly around without lights?  This makes no sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -	Were they looking for a cow??  With a search light? Again, certainly they could locate an animal with something other than a bright light, especially since they would be drawing attention to themselves in the process.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -	Don’t they care about being seen?  Why not have NO lights?   It would appear that the lights are on purpose… that is, they WANT to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -	Since the nearest stars and planets are many light years away, it seems unlikely that these objects are from those (unless there is a worm hole or a crinkle in the space-time fabric that allows it to happen).  In short, traveling that far as fast as they would have to go, by the time they got here from there and back, so much time would have elapsed on their own planet that the trip itself would be moot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -	My guess is that it is more likely that they are either from another dimension (the existence of which is pretty well accepted among physicists) or from a different time (either the future moving back to our time or perhaps a past time moving forward into ours) and perhaps from within our solar system (Mars from a billion years ago perhaps).  Current physical theory postulates that ALL time past present and future exist concurrently.  So it is not inconceivable that one could move from one era to another without the so called grandfather (time) paradox.  In the alternative, where moving backward in time could create such a paradox, moving into the future would not have the same effect.  So it could be that these objects were created WAY in the distant past and moving into their future (our present).<n>

I went on a tv service call.  When I got to the residence, the gentlemen who had asked to have his television serviced had left with his family for some other place,which is what he told me the next day.   When I started to leaved his place I noticed this bright light up the road from me. The more I stared at it the more came brighter. I stopped my 1976 Blazer in the road, and stopped the engine, got out and this thing was stationary with no noise whatsoever.  I stayed and watched it for a good 2 to 3 minutes.  I started my vehicle and started to move slowly while keeping my eyes on it, I was getting closer, I was not more than a quarter mile away, with this thing about 4 to 500 ft above ground.  Then I switched my truck headlights on still having my eyes on it. And then all of a sudden this thing just completely vanished.  I started looking for it and started to go down on the mountain road towards St. Agatha and looking to my right across a field, just about a couple miles from the first sighting I saw it again, and again being stationary, I turned my vehicle towards the field and once again without a trace that thing just vanished. That was the last I saw of it.  Returning to work the next day, I told a female person working with us &#34;if I told you what I saw last night you would tell me that I am crazy&#34;.  And, she replied,  I saw something strange also over the lake in St. Agatha last night.  I do not know what to tell you, except that this was not a plane, for it to be in a fixed position for so long, and a helicopter would have made quite a bit of noise.  This was very strange.  This is the first time I am making this public.<n>

When on duty at the Colorado State Prison as a corrcetional officer preforming tower duty on the primiter of the prison, at approx date and time stated above,a silver looking oval disk shaped objict came over the mountain ridge about 200 yrds away.  It was spinning about 25-35 rev counter clockwise and moving along the ridge about 20mph.  It looked to be aprox 100 feet in length,it was making a low pitch humming sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This took a while to process as it was strange to see, i think i put this on my shift report.
