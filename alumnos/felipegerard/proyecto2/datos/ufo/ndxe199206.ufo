6/30/92 21:00|Las Vegas/Charleston Heights|NV|Sphere|30 minutes|Red light/sphere seen over neighborhood of Charleston Heights with street lamps blinking on and off.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73016.html|1|ndxe199206| Red light/sphere seen over neighborhood of Charleston Heights with street lamps blinking on and off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is something I have lived with for many years and was too afraid to ever write it down. I&#39;ve only discussed it with the people involved and a few trusted people in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was about aged 13 this event occurred. I had been in my house one night while my parents and other family members were out, it was about 8:30 to 9 pm during the summer in the early 1990&#39;s I remember watching television and the power suddenly went out.  I was feeling very uneasy about being alone in the house in the darkness so I decided to go up the block to my friends house as I figured they were not doing anything since the power was out.  My friends came outside with me in their front yard and we were sitting on the block wall talking for about 15 minutes when suddenly the street lights on our block had started to blink on and off.  We thought it to be strange as all the lights were blinking in unison with each other yet the lights within the house were not blinking.  Usually the lamps warm up before they reach full brightness after sunset or when recovering from a power failure.  I had climbed up on the block wall to look over into the other neighborhoods to see if the! streetlights on other streets were blinking as well which they were not.  It was only the ones on our cul de sac. Suddenly coming out of the east very high up in the sky we all observed a red sphere or ball that suddenly stopped and hovered above where we were standing yet it was very very high up and hard to judge exactly how high it was or its size.  The street lamps were still blinking on and off in a Morse code fashion.  After about 2 minutes of this object hovering above us it suddenly took off toward the west which was towards the direction on Red Rock/Spring mountains.  We were baffled, yet we slowly realized between the street lights blinking and this object that we had just witnessed a UFO.  My friends parents were also not home that night.  No other neighbors came out to where we were.  It was the strangest incident in my life. My friends siblings who had staid inside the house had reported that when they were trying to contact their parents on the phone that the phone ! suddenly had when static and they had heard a strange whirring noise d uring the same time we had witnessed this event.  Now these children were strict a Mormon family that were quite average and good people that usually would not believe in such a thing, but were convinced and still convinced they had seen a UFO to this day.  The whole incident was strange.  No parents home at wither home, power going out for about an hour, street lamps blinking on only our block, and this very bright red sphere high in the sky moving at speeds beyond aircraft that we may know of.  We believe that it was trying to communicate with us, or it was studying us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/30/92 20:00|Millinocket|ME|Triangle|30 minutes|Alternating red lights in the Northern Maine Woods|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42511.html|3|ndxe199206| Alternating red lights in the Northern Maine Woods<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back in the spring of 1992, my wife, my younger brother, his girlfriend, and I took a ride up towards Baxter State Park on what is known locally as the &#34;State Road&#34; in my 1990 Ford XLT 4X4 pick-up truck.  The sun was slowly setting in the sky and it was a beautiful, but somewhat chilly, early summers evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove past the entrance to baxter state park and continued north on the state road which, at the time, had been closed to vehicular traffic as it was being utilized as a logging tote road due to the logging operations in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having lived out of state for a few years, and home for the fourth of July holiday, I commented to my brother, my surprise that they were havesting timber so close to the park.  About that time my soon to be sister-in-law exclaimed &#34;Did you see that? Did you see that flash of light?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother replied that he did but my wife and I stated that we didn&#39;t see it but intrigued, I stopped the truck and we all looked off towards the right side of the road where they said that it had come from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were sitting there talking about what they had seen, the bright flash occurred again and instantaneously the truck died. No lights, no radio, nothing! The ignition key was still turned on but the truck was entirely dead. This time, all of us saw the flash of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Spooked, I opened the drivers side door and got half-way out of the vehicle, scanned the area and got back in, leaving the drivers side door open.  I turned the key to start the engine, tried the horn, and the headlights, all to no avail for a period of about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we sat there talking about what had occured, with my wife sarcastically accusing me of &#34;Using the dead battery trick&#34;, the trucks&#39; dome light and headlights slowly and eerily came back on as if someone was turning a rheostat from dim to bright. The radio came back on with static with its clock reset and counting down from 00:00.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, we were all a bit spooked by this, but at this time the rational part of me was thinking out loud that the truck had some sort of electrical problem. I quickly turned the ignition key and started the truck. My brother agreeing with my thoughts, stated that maybe we should turn around and head back towards town (25 miles away) before the truck dies again. I agreed and proceeded to perform a quick three-point turn in the middle of the narrow tote road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sooner had we turned around and started to slowly drive back towards town, my brother, in his usual humorous manner, started to carry on that maybe the truck died because of an unseen UFO or aliens.  We all started laughing and joking about his comments, but as I turned my head to say something to my brother, I was stunned by what I saw and mid-sentence I said &#34;What ((obscenity deleted)) is that!?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Off to the right-side of the vehicle, approximately 50 feet into the woods and approx 10-15 off the ground, were three alternating red lights in a triangle pattern, that were ever so slowly, gliding silently through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped the truck and everyone stared out the passenger side window as these lights slowly moved through the forest, parallel to the road.  My brother exclaimed &#34;go! go! follow them,&#34; so I put the truck in gear and started to drive down the road at approx. 10 mph in order to keep them within view on our right hand side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both had our windows down yet the lights made no sound what so ever. Nor did they seem to be impeded by any of the trees, they just floated and blinked silently through the forest as we kept pace with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a half mile down the road they started to pick-up speed and I adjusted the vehicles speed to keep up.  Further on down the road, they increased speed again, staying within the forest at the same elevation as before, but now  visible out the front windshield of the vehicle.  Again my brother prodded me to speed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I had accelerated the truck to 50 MPH on the rutted old tote road yet the lights were leaving us behind. As we crested a hill we could see the lights approx 100 yard directly in front of us in the middle of the road.  I floored the accelerator hoping to gain on them but in the blink of an eye the lights took off..gone!<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached the section of road where the lights dissapeared I stopped the truck and we all scanned the forest, sky and behind us for any sign of them.  Nothing. Just eerie blackness pierced by my vehicles headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put the truck in gear again and continued down the state road towards town.  As we neared Millinocket Lake we decided to pull into the Golden Road gatekeeper&#39;s office to see if anyone else coming out of the Northwoods had reported seeign anything strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Note: The golden road runs parallel to the state road for several miles between millinocket lake and abol. Where we witnessed the UFO lights the distance between the golden road and the state road is approx 1/4 mile with a high tension power line (from McKay Station Hydro) running parallel between the two roads.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we reported what we had witnessed to the gate tender, we returned to the state road heading towards town (millinocket).  As we rounded a sharp turn in the road, just before the millinocket lake store, I slowed down and pointed up to the power line in front of us to make light of our experience,and I jokingly told my brother that the UFO must have just refueled because the wire was glowing red. (note: this section of line has device on one phase that intentionally glows whenever the line is energized)<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother started in with his wisecrack comments and then......the truck died!  Same as before, no lights, no nothing!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Totally spooked, and with the hair standing up on the back of my neck, I jumped out of the truck and started looking around in all directions for the lights that we had seen previously. Nothing. Nothing but total blackness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped back in to the truck, and this time the girls were rather upset, again my wife accused me of pretending that the truck died (why I&#39;ll never know?) so to prove it to her I turned the key repeatedly and pushed and pulled the headlights several times all to no avail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then..just like the previous time...the headlights and the vehicles dome light slowly and eerily came back on as if someone was turning a rheostat.  Needless to say I wasted no time in starting the truck and headed towards millinocket.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the end of of our freaky experience in the Northern Maine Woods...or so we thought.  Upon arriving back in town, we headed over to my brothers house to watch a movie that we had rented earlier in the evening.  Still excited by the nights events and good naturedly discussing and jibing one another over what had transpired, the girls and I turned on the TV and sat down on the couch while my brother popped some pop corn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were sitting there watching TV and talking...the TV mysteriously turned off...all by itself, with the remote control to the TV sitting on the coffee table in front of us.  Weird Huh?   With that my brother went into another hysterical episode of how they had followed us and were hovering over our house....but then ...you had to have been there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I took my truck up to the Ford garage where a friend had worked.  My brother and I told him about our experience and they willingly looked the truck over.  The only thing that they found was the positive post of the battery had a dark discoloration as if it had been overheated.  They cleaned the terminals and the truck never died on me again for as long as I owned it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe it was a coincidence that the truck died, and we saw and followed the flashing lights or, maybe the lights that we did see, did in fact affect the trucks electrical system.  Either way it was not a natural experience seeing those lights, alternating and floating through the forest and out-running my truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must add, this was the second time that my younger brother had seen a UFO (1980&#39;s which I didn&#39;t find out until after our mutual incident) and since then, I have witnessed another UFO, years later in 2003 while camping at millinocket lake with my older brother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But those are for another day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Respectfully submitted  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

My father was at work and my older brother was sleeping in the basement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden I remember my house being violently vibrated, not like a earthquake vibrate, more like a fast high pitched vibrate.  Like a loud bumble bee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother goes outside with me in arms to check it out.  We both look up to see a steady hovering circlular plane about a 20 feet from the top of my house.  We just stared at it for about 3 minutes and it slowly moves down my street going over all my neigbors houses.  Very dark black base with three ports of blue red and green.  The colors are faded from my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, my mother calls up 911 to report it, the operator said she doesnt know whats going on.  She says to my mom the switch board over at the control center is lit up with callers from the same area.  We get a call back from the operator to let us know that response they got from air traffic control was that it was a military test.  Obviously this is bull, or maybe not, a few neigbors call my house to ask about the loud noise, and some call ask about seeing a large object above my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so young when this happened but it is all pretty clear to me. I mostly remember seeing the fear in my mom&#39;s face making me nervous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object was out there, she had tried to video record it but her batteries were dead.  Sounds a bit clishea (spelling) ((cliché)) but she remembered charging it to full the day before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The wierd thing about this story is also that, when I asked all my sisters, neigbors, and mother about the details of what they saw.  They all say a different thing.  That&#39;s what baffles me.  My mother said it was triangular, I say it was circular, two of sister say long oval, neigbor says sphere.  One sister recalls hearing no vibration just seeing a silent object in the sky.  Another sister recalls vibration.  I recall it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mother says red, green, and blue portals, siter says pitch black, other sister says one big port in the center.  I feel that what happened that night was alot more than I can remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suffered from chronic day and night terrors ever since it happened.  No alien dreams or anything, just the feeling of pure fear.  I&#39;m getting tired  noe and would like to share more but Im going pass out, good night :) :)<n> <n><n> <n><n> p.s this is no bull, i work full time and dont have the time write false crap, but how can I prove that. I guess I can&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date shown above is approximate.  We will invite the witness to have his family members submit reports, as well.  PD))<n>

At the time I was living in the country, well away from any town. The road that I had to travel to the store was covered by tree canopy.  As I was on my way, a vehicle was coming towards me.  I noticed that it had two lights above it.  I thought it was a 4x4 truck with the spot lights on the roof turned on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my amazement it was a car with two balls of light above the roof.  When the car passed me the balls of light swooped over my windshied and vanished.  At that instant my car&#39;s engine quit and the car that passed me slammed on its brakes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediatly looked at my watch to make sure I had not lost time and got the heck out of there. I had always been a believer and that was just the icing on the cake.  I tried to rationalize it but nothing could explain the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/24/92 22:00|Laramie|WY|Light|2 odd lights|Odd intelligent seeming lights seen during a UFO conference in Laramie, WY.|6/18/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37400.html|11|ndxe199206| Odd intelligent seeming lights seen during a UFO conference in Laramie, WY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior to attending good friend Leo Sprinkle&#39;s UFO conference in 1992 Laramie,WY when he still held them there,both I and a friend had premonitions that we&#39;d see a UFO while in attendance.She put an importance on 11 o&#39;clock. I at spotting one at the 10 o&#39;clock sky position through the right-side passanger window.I add this as enhanced ESP during UFO activity is often experienced,as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Leo suggested we visit a nearby ranch if we wished,for odd sky events had often been seen there many times,so we went. Knowing that ETs for some reason found punnish humor funny, I noted with interest that we spotted an &#34;erratic&#34; star at 10 PM at the 11 o&#39;clock position in the sky,not out of the right-side window,but the left. Then from lower left in the sky a softly glowing orb was seen moving toward the &#34;erratic&#34; star in a jerky stop and go way. It made a 90 degree turn and merged with the other. A bit later it came out again, moving from our left to right until it stopped directly in front of us at an 11 o&#39;clock sky position as seen through the windshield It made another 90 degree turn and hovered directly above us over the open moon roof for about a minute or so,then continued on in a straight line till out of sight. Was not a satellite that moves in an arc, nor jerkily unless inebriated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event took about 10 to 15 minutes,after which,I looked for the Mars/Venus/Jupiter alignment scheduled that night so not to be accussed of mistaking it for a UFO. It was over our right shoulders to the rear. Opposite to where the sighting had taken place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was probably what one would call a minor sighting today, but I heard you say you&#39;d be interested in older reports when on with Noory last. Both my friend and I had earlier sightings. Leo has the above one on file, along with others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/21/92 21:00|Conesus|NY|Unknown|1-2 minutes|Eye contact with Creature|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72868.html|12|ndxe199206| Eye contact with Creature<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened nearly 20 years ago but is forever fresh in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> June 21st 1992 - Southern End of Conesus Lake near Joy Rd. in western NY - USA It was a beautiful summer day filled with waterskiing and fishing with my college sweetheart.We cooked out on the grill at about 7:30pm EST and dinner was ready at about 8pm. Just as our meal was ready to eat, it very suddenly began to rain very hard, like someone had flipped a switch. It had been hot and sunny just previously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We quickly grabbed the food off the grill to avoid getting too wet and ate indoors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 9pm we sat in my car while parked in the driveway to have an after dinner cigarette, as that I had promised not to smoke in my father’s cottage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was seated in the driver’s seat and she was in the passenger seat. The front door of the house was located about 3 feet directly off the passenger door of the car. The front door had 3.5’x2.5’ glass pane window with curtains.Very suddenly, the rain just stopped.It was suddenly deafenly quiet compared to the rain pounding very hard on the hood of my car. I had the strange “sensation” that something had just fallen from the sky nearby. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 seconds later, when I turned my head to the right to face her and comment on the strange weather I saw the creature in the window of the house. It was inside the house holding the curtain back making eye contact with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was huge. It was crouching yet its head was still only inches from the 9’ ceiling of the room. I estimate that it must have been over 15’ tall when standing erect.  It’s hand holding the curtain back was as large as the window.  It’s  skin was black and shiny but not wet or slimy. It was very muscular and predatory looking. It had a snout about 6-9” long and had pointed incisor like teeth throughout its entire mouth. It’s eyes were very human looking and seemed to denote a  very focused look of sentience and/or intelligence. My mouth dropped and I froze. It seemed that even with the two doors between us we were already much too close (about 3-5 feet away) for safety sake.  It was clearly some kind of predator of great physical power. I didn’t make a sound. This went on for about 30 seconds. I was making direct eye contact with it. When my college sweetheart  finally turned to see what I was staring at, her immediate reaction was to turn back toward me and start punching m! e in the arm screaming “just drive away!” over and over again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This shocked me back to my senses. I started the car and peeled out of the driveway immediately. As I drove away I saw it running down the road in pursuit of us, but it seemed to “phase” in and out… almost like a bad TV reception. She saw it too. I drove very recklessly to put some distance between us. It worked but even so I continued to “feel” like we were being watched. We talked about what we saw but didn’t know what it was or what to make of it. We were too scared to return back to the cottage that evening. I dropped her off at her parent’s house and then drove to Geneseo NY. I still “felt” like I was being watched. I ran into a friend walking down the street and told him the story. He wanted to see it. I reluctantly drove him there. When we got there he too could “feel” the “vibration” and was now too scared to go inside the house. I however felt that I hadn’t come for nothing and also wanted to turn off the lights and lock the doors of the cottage. When we went inside! the “vibration” was much stronger and we both found it difficult to breathe.  I felt like I was being stalked. After about 5 minutes we left. I still “felt” like I was being watched. For about a week I still “felt” like I was being watched. Even at times even threatened. I was very scared. I felt like I was being followed. I finally couldn’t take it anymore, instead of being afraid – I got mad! I wanted to challenge it, wanted to physically fight it. That’s when it stopped and I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still remember it like it was yesterday, even though for a long time had not a clue as to what it might have been. I just knew it wasn’t of this world. That’s all I knew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a year ago I saw a sketch drawing on the internet and it was exactly what I saw.

It had vien-like structures on the sides of it and spotlights all the way around the base. The dome part was flashing like an electrical ark,it appeared to me to be in distress. There was alot of activity around the base ,like spot lights moving around frantically.The car in front of me slowed down to observe so i passed and got away . Isaw enough of the object to know i didnt want to get any closer to it.<n>

I lived on 6acres of land, surrounded by trees and my neighbors were also several acres away.  There were no street lights of any kind.  I worked 2 jobs and was leaving for what they call the midnight shift at a convience store in Gainesville.  As i was backing out of my yard and going forward to the dirt path/road thru the field (which had not been mowed for sometime, and was taller than me)i got chills going up my spine.  I felt like i was being watched, but it was so dark out and with no lights,you can&#39;t see what is out in the fields.  I do not know why i did what i did next, i turned my car off, opened the door, got out and looked up.  I was in awe at what i was seeing.  This craft was rectangular in shape and had to be the size of a football field.  It seemed so close, i almost felt i could reach out and touch it.  Not one sound came from this object and it had about 6/8 dull&gt;non flashing red lights on the bottom.  We just sat there and watched each other for about 3/4 minutes (yes, i knew they could see me, just can&#39;t explain how i know).  It then started moving NE very slowly not making a sound.  How could something that large not make a sound.  I kept watching them leave, when all of sudden, it went from slow to gone with a flash of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course no one believed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 1yr later, and i thought i was dreaming.  I was standing outside by my electric pole, watching this same craft leave.  I did not want it to leave, for whatever reasons i do not know, i was saddened by its departure. I could smell the crisp morning air and feel the dew on my feet&gt;&gt;it was so real. The next thing i know, I am waking up in my bed, but my feet are covered with dirt and the little black seeds from the grass, like it was not a dream after all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next several yrs, i had multiple pregnancies,and i mean multiple,2 miscarriages, 4 live, 3 aborted, the other 5 not sure where they went.  Pregnant 2/3 months along, then not pregnant with a little spotting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had to pass right under this craft, which wasn&#39;t a helicopter, or an airplane. There was a dim light hovering arround this oval shaped object, but we could not tell where the light was coming from; it was just there. Right before we got close to it, it moved to the side of I-5, briefly touched down, didnt make a sound, or lift a single particle of loose sand. About 2 seconds later, it took off, moved back  to it&#39;s original possition, by now above us.It was as big as a football field, and didn&#39;t make a single sound. Then it took off, and it was amazing how such a big aircraft moved so fast without making the slightest sound. It was so fast, that it dissapeared in the sky in less than a full second. We looked at each other, described what we had just seen, and promised not to sayanything to anybody, fearing they would say we were crazy. We have talked about it 2 or 3 times since then; I have told my immediate fammily, and they don&#39;t seem to believe. Both me and my cousyn were 30 years old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were laying there and I was a light which was brighter than the stars around it.  I couldn&#39;t tell what shape it was because it was very high in the atmosphere.  This light was moving from northeast to southwest.  It moved along for awhile and I thought it was just a satellite or something.  Then it did a very sharp u-turn and when it was returning the way it came from it did a zig-zag type pattern on it&#39;s way.  This pattern I know is not possible with any type of jet or anything we have.  The size of the zig-zag pattern was a decent size in the sky and as fast as this thing was making it the pattern had to be miles long from zig-zag tip to zig-zag tip.  This frightened me so bad I have been freaked out &#39;til this day because I know there is something very strange out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was approximatey 23:30 E.S.T when I had finished some school work and decided to go for a walk and have a cigarette because I didn&#39;t enjoy smoking in the house. Brampton, Ontario , at the time was stil a developing city (at least in the west end where I was) So you can have an idea of the area, there would be pockects of new developements and open fields in between. I had my walkman with me at the time and I enjoy my music very loud. After about 20 minutes of walking and taking in the beautiful weather I heard a humming noise over top of my walkman - I naturally assumed that it was a transport truck or something in the area. I turned off my walkman and that&#39;s when I realized the sound was coming from over head. When I looked up I was in awe of what I was seeing. I was not frightened or nervous. The object was no more than 50 stories above me. It was black, Triangular shaped, and had only three light at each corner. The object must have been the size of a football field. The object hovered in one place, directly above me for 1 minute when it shot off (from a stand still) and out of my sight in less than a second. This is when I became nervous. I do not know anything in physics that could propel itself from a stand still like that. I hurried home and as you probably encounter daily, I was met with ridicule from my friends and family. Three days later, while I was at school, three men in black came to my home and asked my mother all kinds of strange questions. They repeatedly asked if they could come in, and when my mom responded, no, they would ask something else. Where I was from? Where I was? How old I was? Could they come back and see me later. When I spoke with my mother later that day. All she kept saying is that they looked very strange....very odd. that&#39;s it. At that point, I dropped the UFO conversations and left it alone until tonight when I came across your site and the people from Newbrunswick that witnessed the same thing as I did, and in the same month. Just thought you would like to hear about it. For my security, I will not leave any personal information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

At the time we were both high school students and dismissed it as something that was strange and interesting, but probably explainable.  The more we have talked about it, the more we feel it is worth consideration as a possible ufo. The main reason behind this posting is to see if maybe someone else observed this event.<n>

All the lights were on, which is what attracted my attention, when I observed a green glowing ball of light traveling north. It appeared to be half way between the stadium and the highway 300 to 400 feet off the ground. The object itself was translucent in nature traveling at a good clip but not so fast as not be able to track it. The area it was in is protected airspace as it was under the flight path of McCarran International Airport. The course it was on would have taken it past Sunrise Mt. and directly over Nellis AFB. The local news did air a report that night of a green light sighted, however it was reported some 15 miles north of where I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were sitting in a 1990 Geo Storm with a hatchback. As we were talking we noticed a light inside of the vehicle, it was so bright it seemed as though the sun was out. My first thought was that a street light had come on. There were no lights near the vicinity of the vehicle. The light shinned on us for a few seconds(maybe 20-30 seconds). After the light left the car we looked out the front windshield and saw a very bright shinning orb approximately 100 feet in front of us. The orb was about 30-40 ft in the sky, just above the trees. We watched for a few seconds as the orb moved around in the sky in front of us, then it took off at an amazing speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was dark outside and we had not been drinking and did not do drugs. It was probably between the hours of 8:30-9:30 PM. In the sky there was an object with lights that I have never seen on any airplane, helicopter, or anything else for that matter. The lights were like those that you would see on a kaleidoscope. The lights faded in and out of each other, kinda like they were blending into each other as the lights chased around the UFO. The craft hovered in one spot, I didn&#39;t notice any movement at all. I have never seen any aircraft stand so still in mid- air. This lasted for about a couple of minutes, and then the object took off with a speed that I have never seen. It was there one second and gone the next, If I would have blinked I would have missed it take off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound at all.

It was June of 1992, and my family was sitting on the porch talking as they would do often.  I and my two cousins were in the next door neighbors backyard playing with their dog.  I happened to look southeast and see a light in the sky, which looked a lot like a star, just a bit brighter than most.  I dismissed it at first and continued playing around.  We lived in-between two Navy bases, Cecil Field and NAS JAX, so we were used to seeing planes and things flying by.  After my older cousin had stopped and took notice of this light we all three stopped to study it.  It seemed to be moving across the sky towards the northeast.  We ran from the neighbors yard to edge of my yard to get a better look, and in the process of running without taking our eyes off of the light, we all three ran into the fence which was barbed-wire (barbed-wire is almost invisible to see at dusk anyways).  When we reached the edge of my yard we just stood motionless staring at this light travel across the sky very slowly.  It then did something I have never heard of before.  Around the light itself, a sparkling, cloud-like bubble formed that was shaped like an egg.  It traveled with the light for a small time matching its movements perfectly.  The light then left the cloud, and the cloud disappeared very slowly.  After the two were separated the light moved about very spuratically across the sky in normal UFO fashion then disappeared completely.  The sighting must have lasted at least 25 minutes.  Just like in the movies, coincidence or not, at least 10 military helicopters showed up in the sky headed in the direction of the UFO right after it disappeared.<n>

Video shown on 2 different episodes of &#34;Unsolved Mysteries&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1992, 4 of us were able to capture on video some of the maneuvers of the &#34;Area 51&#34; object.  It shows the craft hovering, then moving down the ridge line until it disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also on video, the morning sequence which showed the craft pulsate and become brighter.  This is the segment used on Unsolved Mysteries.  Once it became totally dark it was nearly impossible to capture all of the maneuvers on video.  This thing could go from horizon to horizon in just seconds.  It would fly just like a meteor, stop on a dime, then go in a completely different direction.  We all saw the craft become brighter,almost as if it were gaining energy, then shoot across the sky.  After doing several maneuvers, the light would become dim, then go out.  The other 3 said,&#34;it just disappeared&#34;, but I was looking thru binoculars and saw what appeared to be an egg shape craft with the slightest pearlescent green glow. I watchedit go out of range.  The craft would be gone for approx. 45 minutes, then at the exact same time, all 4 of us heared a high pitch frequency &#34;inside&#34; our heads.  Then instantly, the object would appear.  I saw thru the binos what appeared to be some sort of docking with a larger ship.  There were several smaller ships throughout the evening which appeared to me as if they were helicopters observing from a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a private pilot and a former Marine.  I&#39;ve spent alot of time around planes and helo&#39;s.  This main craft was definitely not one of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, what seemed to bother all of us the most was toward dawn, the craft came to a stop, and almost appeared to mimic a star.  It stayed in rotation with the rest of the stars &#39;till dawn.<n>

The bright light or lights gave the appearance of a large zig zag or Z shape.  I suggested to our sons that it might be some sort of aircraft, and they didn&#39;t think that made sense and had been observing it a good while as it approached, before we were called outside into the open patio. None of us heard any sound, which also was strange, since the clouds it disappeared into were not very high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The report below I just saw reminded me of the event: GEORGIA ZIGZAGGING CRAFT WITH RED BLINKING LIGHTS MORROW -- The witness says, &#34;While unloading supplies at my office 9:45 AM, I saw a strange looking craft on November 13, 2002, that had three blinking red lights.&#34; It appeared to hover then zig zag around the sky and eventually diving behind a group of trees. In a few seconds it appeared again off in the distance at an even lower altitude. At the same time another craft with a very bright light and two red flashing lights appeared behind the same group of trees and just seemed to hover there! These lights were not blinking and were rather large lights. My family and I have observed a passenger type aircraft for 8 or 9 months with a extremely bright double headlight that can hover in one place for any amount of time, and turn on a dime! It doesn&#39;t have to make a large turn like a regular plane. We watched twenty to thirty minutes. It could be some new type of craft that the military is testing? We do have an Army base nearby. I don&#39;t think it is really an UFO. But it is something new we have never seen in the skies over middle Georgia! &lt;http://www.ufocenter.com/&gt;NUFORC<n>
6/15/92 02:00|Sedgefield (UK/England)|||5 seconds|Circles of light on pavement without beams|8/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24581.html|31|ndxe199206| Circles of light on pavement without beams<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if this qualifies as a UFO report or some other strange phenomena but back in 1992 a friend and myself had been to a concert on a coach and were dropped off outside of our village to walk home.  (I can&#39;t remember the exact date but I may be able to find out.)  We walked into the village I think it will have been about 2am and we went our separate ways.   I was walking for a while down a street which was well illuminated by streetlights and nobody else was around at this time when a circle of light appeared on the pavement in front of me, it was about 2 feet in diameter.  It was as though someone had held a really bright light above me almost and shone it onto the pavement.  Bear in mind the street was already well lit up and so this had to be a very bright light, but there was no visible beam just the circle of light.  I didn&#39;t step into the light but I did stop and look behind and up into the sky wondering what had caused it, I didn&#39;t see anything and when I looked back in front of me it had gone.  Meanwhile my friend walked to his home which has a dark farmyard and he too saw two lights on the ground without beams projecting them.  I thought no more of it until the next day when I mentioned what I&#39;d seen to my friend, who was relieved that I had mentioned it as he wasn&#39;t going to say anything thinking nobody would believe him.  We have talked now and again about this for ten years now and still can&#39;t think of anything that can make a light like that.  Our friends don&#39;t believe us and say we were probably drunk etc, but I can assure anyone that we had not drunk anything at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will encourage the witness to establish the precise date of the incident.

I really dont know<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see all these posts about things happening in the past. I might as well share my one unexplainable experience. It either occured in 92 or 93. I know this because my youngest sisters crying woke me up in the very early hours of the morning and at that time she must have been one or two yrs old. Im guessing between 1 and 3AM this event occured. I was laying on my bunk bed which was placed against the wall, which right on the other side was my baby sister. Her crying not only woke me up, but my parents also. And in a minute i could hear my stepdad walking across the hardwood floor of the living room to tend to my sister. I awoke facing the wall inches from my face. I turned on my opposite side to get more comfortable and i saw something standing two feet away from my position in my room. I had not a clue as to what it was. But whatever it was it was not there when i had gone to sleep. It was as tall as my bunk bed, so i was horizontal with the upper portion of it. i was very scared, frozen into staring at it. I saw no discernable features, it didnt move, but it definately was smooth (skinned?) cuz the only light from the fishtank around the corner allowed me to see it well enough. I stared for five minutes while right around the corner my stepdad tended to my sister. I was too scared to move or utter a sound, so i forced myself to turn back towards the wall, shut my eyes, and sleep. The next morning that space in my room was empty, exactly as it were when i went to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I havent told any of my family about this, they already think im crazy. Ive told a few friends. But this is one of those childhood memories when i was about 8 or 9 yrs of age, before i knew anything about aliens or abductions. I KNOW it wasnt a nightmare. I hope my sharing this helps someone out there, and i could care less if im believed or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was late, between midnight and 1 in the morning. The moon was out and the sky was partly cloudy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was looking out the window of my truck and noticed the outline of an cigar shaped object and it appeared to have dimmly lit, almost like a fluorescent light on the bottom.  The light was round, maybe 16 to 24 ft.???<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was decribing it to me while I was driving and looking for a place to pull off and get out to see for myself.  I then pulled into a gravel drive at an old store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left the motor running and got out of my truck. And just like my wife had said, there it was,completely silent, the outline was very clear.  It was perhaps, 400 to 600 yards away. And I noticed it was hovering over some very large power lines. This thing was right on top of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got out of my truck to look at it and only seconds later this dim, fluorescent type light which was on the bottom of the UFO, turned off.  This scared my wife, She was very upset telling me to hurry and get in the truck.  She was ready to go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a flashlight in my truck and I wanted to flash it on the object, however my wife wouldn&#39;t let me.I got back into my truck and started down the highway, no sooner than I on the road again the light on the UFO came on again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I knew what it was, it looked gray under the moonlight.  It gave off no sound. I think it being over those powerlines had something to do with it being there.  And it was strange, that when I got out of my truck, it turned the light off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

He gasped in disbelief when he (we) saw an approaching string of large white lights coming at us from the west heading to the east directly over the city of Jacksonville FL.  The row of lights (7 or 8) were evenly spaced and at the same hieght.  As they approached us they went straight up into the sky and while going up formed the shape of a large &#34;V&#34;.  The &#34;V&#34; continued to go straight up into the sky until it was almost completed out of sight when a flash of light from either the horizon or ground shot up at the formation in an waverly line followed by a second streak of light.  We all sat there dumbfounded by the sighting.  My cousin who is a pilot stated that the light formation was not that of any plane over the US. and the entire time the formation made no heard sound. We all three never really pushed the issue until I had seen film footage of the sighting over Phoenix this year and what was filmed was almost exactly what we had seen.  Now I believe.<n>

I was just starting the climb, when, over the crown of the hill, came what appeared to be a very low-/slow-flying small aircraft, like a Cessna.  It got about (line-of-sight distance) 40&#39; past the crown &amp; split into 3 or 4 small orbs. Each was a different color.  Then they went in different directions so fast, I couldn&#39;t keep track of them &amp; safely drive at the same time.  The setting is VERY rural.

After watching a program about a man with something in his body, they extracted it and did not know what it was, I immediately recognized the object and even now, I am getting tingly just writing about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about 10 years old and sitting on the toilet.  I guess I was rubbing my calfs with my hands as I felt something.  I looked closer to find there was something imbedded in my right side of my leg below the knee.  I tried to get a hold of it with my fingers, but it was too smooth and pointy to get a grip.  My mother had a pair of tweezers close by.  I finished what I was doing and propped my leg up on the bath tub.  I pinched it with the tweezers and began to pull.  I was shocked to see this thing in my leg being so long and pointy, yet I felt no pain.  After I pulled it out, there was no blood, but only a hole.  I looked at it closely and I can remember it being very similar to a thin yet long and pointy piece of rice.  It had a gold/brown colour to it, and was very hard.  I didn&#39;t think much of it at the time as I was only 10.  the best is yet to come.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Frequently,over a couple of years, I marvelled at the hole.  I looked at it, felt it, and didn&#39;t go away.  Another couple of years, I forgot about it, then once again, I was sitting on the toilet and remembered it again.  I looked at it and saw another object in the very same hole.  I got up and looked for some tweasers.  After finally finding some, I pulled it out again.  It was identical to the one I pulled out the first time. Again, I was stupid and did not think to save the piece.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been about 20 years since I pulled the last one out, and still think of it.  I still look at it, but it hasn&#39;t returned.  The only thing I have left, is a grown in hole, that you still can see.  I joke about it to the people I tell and even show them the hole.  I tell them the people planting this &#34;bug&#34; on me, finally got sick and tired of me removing it and sending them to the sewage plant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I and many members of my family have witnessed unusual looking aircraft.  When I was 9 years old while we were moving from Wears Valley to Gatlinburg my mom and 2 of my sisters was traveling in one of our automobiles ahead of my dad and myself in the moving truck, when right above us crossing the mountain about 500 foot above all of us were 3 circular shaped aircraft with multi colored lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then when I was 12 years old me and my nephew and niece were running home from a friends house a couple streets down from the street we were living at the time as we had stayed out after curfew, approximately 5 minutes from house to house, when a triangle shaped aircraft appeared just above the tree line over road and multi light beams were hitting everywhere and time seemed to slow way down or stopped as I remember we were running but not gaining ground.  We arrived home later than we should have and we escaped puni! shment for telling what had happened and my parents told us not to mention what happened to anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years past as they do and I went to work in supervisory positions at the main airport here near the Secret City. One night while I was relieved from duty at around midnight and after completing authorized paperwork at around 12:45 am I proceeded home, I noticed what seemed to be construction going on the second set of RR tracts I had to cross nightly going home, as I approached what I thought was a crane holding up a lighted tubular object with spheres on both ends over the tracks was in fact a very unusual aircraft, I stopped to look at this aircraft and began to get out of my car when it turned  toward me and I looked  straight at the pilot of the tubular shaped aircraft with sphere&#39;s on both ends and the cockpit was lit up as I saw the pilot clear as day, as I was approximately 50 feet from aircraft, he was as human as you and I Caucasian in color. He wore a black uniform ! with a black military or swat team type cap on his head, I did not exit vehicle as the pilot was smiling at me and the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and the voice inside me said I should not have seen this aircraft and to leave as fast as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove off and on straight-aways hit 70 to 90 mph. I had to turn left at a stop sign and then had to cross adjoining RR tracts to get to the road I live on at the time. I came to the road where I had to slow to turn right and something told me to stop and look to my right left, the aircraft had followed me almost to my home and was hovering in the cow pasture  were I was planning to turn right next to my home. I could not move I had to stay there and observe this aircraft, it then started moving backwards and at a tremendous amount of speed crossed the pasture and shot almost vertical into the clouds and from where I was sitting to the end of the pasture were it shot up took about 2 seconds and traveled about a mile. I had always thought if I was in a position to investigate an unidentified! flying aircraft I would do so, but I tell you until you are faced with the decision I was faced with at that time and the feelings that came across me, you cannot say you could have exited the car and tried to make contact. I have held many prestigious positions of authority and I have seen Black Helicopters’ with no markings in our mountain areas from the secret base, I have walked beside wild bears here, but I had never felt what I felt that night. The aircraft seemed to use a magnetic source to travel as it made no sounds while in operation, also given its shape it would have to use magnetic sources of travel. I was born with an I.Q. of 186 and I investigate everything someone tells me or I hear on the television, I am skeptical of almost everyone and what they are telling me and I advise everyone reading to do the same and not just believe what everyone says, as what you will learn from investigating what you see or hear will make you a much more productive person in o! ur society, I have found through my investigations what could ! not be r eal in most cases has been, and what seemed so simple turned out to be something more integral in design.<n>

After fighting the urge to do so, I gave up, and got up to go take a look.  Outside the window, there was a spherical ball of light--about 1.5 to 2 ft in diameter, acting in a way that can only be described as conscious.  It was about 20 yards away from me; it was rising and disappearing into the sky, and falling gracefully back down in an arc so that I can only see it through the tall grass.  It spiraled in circles and it bounced up and down, drawing a wave with its movement.  I felt that it was conscious of my audience and that it was acting this way, strangely enough, for me: that it was playing and dancing around to make me feel that the interaction was a friendly one.  I grew frightened of the notion that it knew I was watching, and returned to my room, resolved to shut my eyes and not to open them again until morning.  In telling my grandmother this story in the morning, she got a strange look in her eye: she told me that there had been reports about 50 years back of children aged 12-14 being approached by a spherical ball of light, similar in description to what I saw, as they were walking in the neighboring woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At first we thought it was just a remote controlled aircraft that the navy used to tow targets for naval practice and sometimes aircraft practice. But it was a sunday and there was strictly no flying of these aircraft on sunday. we then viewed it for a while heading south. Until a tree blocked our view. But when we were meant to see it again it could not be found. There were 5 of us that we know of who saw the craft...... My mother who had first spotted the aircraft. my father. my syster. my best friend and me. The object was disk shaped but not spinning, and had black squares painted on it. It had a very reflective under belly and with the sun behind us made it seem very bright. It was about 2-3km away and only lasted a few minutes. But I did not see all of it, I went and got a pair of benoculas and this alowed me to make the further descriptions above.<n>

I noticed a blinking light to the South-Southwest at approximately 45 degrees.  The light was small and at a considerable distance.  I initially thought it was just an airplane or helicopter. The light began moving East and back West in very fast straight lines.  The movements were first short and then covered increasingly longer distances until it was due South, standing still directly over the horizon of the lake.  The light then moved up and down in quick jerking motions, and East and West in very short jerking motions.  It then shot off diagonally to the South-Southwest at a speed faster than any of it&#39;s earlier movements and disappeared.  I often spend time watching for another similar light but have seen nothing in the 10 + years since.  It is important to note that in 1992 the army base at Fort McLelland, which is now closed, was still open.  Fort McLelland is South-Southeast of Weiss Lake where the sighthing occurred.

I sat at my back door which was open but screened in.  A loud, but not deafening roar came over the back yard, which extends for a couple hundred yards and is pitch black.  Then, a craft emerged into my view and must have been hoovering at a distance of about two-hundred feet above my home.  It was triangularly shaped with red circular lights that compromised the three corners of the object with a much smaller (circular) white light in the center.  This object glided my view for about 10 seconds with a relativity slow velocity.<n>

I was dropped off a mile or two from camp, to guard an ammunition dump in a clearing of about 100 yards by 150-200 yards, surrounded by tall trees.  The moon was full and the sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 100-200 yards past the treeline, a craft arose in the vicinity of a small lake.  It rose like a helicopter and flew slowly, like a helicopter, yet it was silent and lacked distinctive characteristics of both a helicopter and airplane, like a tail fin, wings, propellers, or safety lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the bright moonlight, I could clearly see the entire craft, which was long, possibly oval or round, and tapered towards the tail.  There were three sets of lights in a 120 degree arc around the front of the craft, which appeared to be windows, but may have been headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was paralyzed with fright and tried not to move, lest be seen.  I slowly turned my head to watch the craft pass by.  After it had passed, I could hear the faint sound of a jet-type engine, however the craft moved far too slowly to be a jet.  There were no runways, from where it took off - it had to come out of the lake.  Having seen many helicopters throughout my training, and ridden in them, I can say without equivocation this was no helicopter.  With the bright moonlight, there is no doubt in my mind this was neither a commercial nor military craft known to the public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another soldier was posted about 1/4 mile away at another ammo dump. We had agreed beforehand to pick up our field phones at 11:30 to make sure we were both awake. Our exact conversation went: me,&#34;Hey, you there?&#34; him, &#34;Yeah&#34; me, &#34;Did you see that?&#34; him, &#34;Thank God you said that!&#34;  We had both seen the same thing, described the same thing to each other, and agreed we had both seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident was never reported because our fellow Reservists thought it was a joke we had both concocted and we eventually dropped it.  But to this day, I shudder when I think of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was lying on my back on the floor with the lights out, with my feet facing the french doors, watching the display. All of a sudden there was a bright gold light that filled the windows. It wasn&#39;t a lightning bolt, and I waited for it to be over, but it stayed and stayed. I got up and got dressed, thinking something really big was happening (something I had never seen before, I wasn&#39;t sure what, but something big) and I might have to go outside. During all that time of deciding to get up, finding my clothes, and putting on shoes and socks the light just stayed, glowing warmly, filling the whole sky. Then it was gone.<n>

The object had a flashing blue pulse of light on its bottom.  The blue energy returned and crackled in the air.  Suddenly the object dissapeared.  Almost as if it teleported.

After craft went out of visual contact I got back into my car and within 10 min. the radio station said Omaha listeners were calling the sighting of lights from a strange craft. Police officials were recieving many reports. NASA confirmed the event stating it was only space junk. However, space junk doesn&#39;t fly level and I had an excellent observation of the exterior. The craft defied all known physical laws and aerodynamics. The craft made no sound and released a shower of sparks from what looked like a exhaust port.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cigar shaped objects were moving form west to east approx. on a 090 degree heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling by car to Salt Lake City, UT when I noticed what appeared to be an airplane on the intermediate approach segment of a landing. I saw three landing lights (believed to be a heavy aircraft) approx. 3 miles away and wondered what airport was in the area. After a moment of thought I realized there was no controlled airport close enough to facilitate a landing. My next educated guess was that it might be a military aircraft flying a low level mission. I pulled my vehicle to the side of the rode and stood at the side watching the lights become three separate objects flying in a wedge formation. To my amazement they were cylinders approx. 100 ft. in lenght with a beam of 15 ft. olive colored with a line of port holes. The light on each craft was on the nose. The had no aredynamic sufaces and made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Captain ((name deleted)) (Airline Transport, Multi- Engine Pilot Rating)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

Right before we started to pack up to leave we heard this bone chilling cry behind us.  When I say “bone chilling” is was not a cry of anything I have ever heard of before on this planet.  It was loud and long.  I will never forget what it sounded like.  We both JUMPED UP!  It was just starting to get dark,  just a minute after the sun set.  We were around twenty feet off the side of my jeep.  There was a dirt bream about another 30 feet past the jeep.  It was slightly wooded with quite a bit of brush.  I shined my flashlight at where the sound came from.  What we saw in the reflection of the light I also will never forget.  These two large eyes were looking right at us.  They had a green/orange fluorescent look to them and were oval, pinched at the ends and slightly sloping down at the centers.  Then it howled again.  We could see the outline of its mouth in its eyes. It had a fairly large mouth.  We watched it for 20 seconds or so longer then all of a sudden it vanished.  Then as fast as the ambient light from my flashlight could move it would reappear.  And it howled again.  It moved a couple more times and howled a couple of more times.  It could move through the brush and the trees SSSOOO  Fast!  I could move around 40-60 feet as fast as my flashlight could move its beam of light.  It would move within a ½ second of one spot to another.  We were pretty freaked out by this time.  I turned all my fishing poles around so the reels were extended outward incase I had to start beating something over the head.  We scrambled to my jeep and got the hell out of there as fast as we could.  My girlfriend cried for hours after that because she was so freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day my buddy and I went back there so I could do some investigating and see if I could find anything that would help explain what the creature was.  We eventually called it the (Waubonsee Monster) because we saw it out by the waubonsee college.  Any way I didn&#39;t find anything.  No footprints, broken branches- Nothing!  I couldn&#39;t figure how anything could move through the brush and scrub that fast.  How anything could move that fast anywhere.   Well going forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My buddy and I started fishing again for a little while.  We packed our stuff up again and started to walk towards my jeep up a slight hill.  When we got to the clearing by the jeep, where there was also a clearing that opened up to a corn field.  We both stopped in our tracks and coming at us from across the corn field just about 10-15 feet above treetop level was some craft that had quite a few lights on it.  It also had some sort of spot light that it shined right on us for about 2 seconds.  Then it made a 90 degree turn and zipped out of there Very! Very! Fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft did not have any sound what so ever.  You can imagine how quiet a small stone quarry is at sunset.  Well this craft was one hundred percent soundless.  Even gliders have some kind of sound and we could have heard a pin drop 200 yards away it was that quiet out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One or other of the events would have been pretty exceptional.  But to have them happen in two consecutive nights is really pretty profound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I truly believe that what we saw the first night was some type of extraterrestrial.  I know it was not any creature of this earth.  And then the next night to see the craft in the same location.  Pretty neat!!!!!!!!!! I don&#39;t know too many people who can say that they have actually seen an extraterrestrial and a UFO like I have.   Well that my story.  Make of it what you like but I know what I saw and truly believe it was &#34;Out Of This World<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Then it shot up in the air, slowly descended, then it went straight across the sky, it shot down in an arc behind the hills, then re-appeared even closer to me (about a quarter km), which freaked me out a little, and it was at this point that I realised it was a disk shaped object, with really bright lights on the bottom, the center appeared to be red-orange, but at times almost dark pink? In the night sky it appeared to be gray-purple color, but that could have been reflections since the sky was a similar color..the object moved across the sky behind me, made no noise at all, and I lost sight of it due to the trees behind me but I could still see the lights through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then I noticed how close it came to my position when I could see about 150 yards in the direction of the object the light flickering down illuminating the ground. I felt a strange &#34;charge&#34; in the air, like in a lightning storm, and my hair on my arms and neck were stood up..the next thing I knew I couldn&#39;t see it anymore, and I turned to my right to see if the object was going to emerge on the other side of the trees, and it didn&#39;t emerge where and when I thought it would, but when I glanced over my right shoulder there it was hovering in the air about 300 yards or more away and it took off like a shooting star (left a light trail or blur) upwards and I got such a fright I had to sit down and have a cigarette. I  had this feeling it was watching me for that second, but I am not sure if it was the same object or another object that I never noticed since my attention was on the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was my 3rd strange sighting at Gagetown while I was a Reservist but the only time I actually saw anything up close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/1/92 00:00|Langhorne|PA|Triangle|3 min.|The triangle of orange dots in the distance was suddenly a large mechanical mass hovering above me as I felt my heals leave the ground.|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70611.html|65|ndxe199206| The triangle of orange dots in the distance was suddenly a large mechanical mass hovering above me as I felt my heals leave the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To provide yet another description of a UFO that you mosy certainly had already heard I would more effectively offer that what I have learned from my unusual experience approx.  18 years ago. I was sure that what I was seeing was real when the Military came to visit a number of times.  If the truth is what your after please feel free to call.  If your stuck on the sterotype conclusion that the government wants us to beleive don&#39;t waist our time.  It&#39;s just a matter of time before the truth comes out so you must either go with the flow or eat some dust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have concerns... maybe you work for the government after all?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/1/92|Home Front Compound (India)||Disk|A minute or so.|I am a Spiritualist who now believes in the unseen: for it is from that nothing - that everything comes. Time to think from the Beyond:|4/3/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80706.html|66|ndxe199206| I am a Spiritualist who now believes in the unseen: for it is from that nothing - that everything comes. Time to think from the Beyond:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please excuse me for being able to submit my findings now. As I was not aware of a website for UFO&#39;s, so it took me time to get in touch with you&#39;ll. Better Late than never. I hope I can help you&#39;ll achieve what you&#39;ll want to know. I have come across three different types of UFO&#39;s on four different occasions. I came across them in mid 1992(forgot the month).One was seen by me twice and happened to be carried in one of them and while I was gliding or being taken a ride of the Galaxy:it was here that that I was given a command or an order for me and it was a message for mankind at large. To help you&#39;ll get a better picture of what I am writing about, please sent me a mail in my inbox -so that I can send you&#39;ll an attachment of the story (now Story)of the blue-bird and it&#39;s wishfulfilling multi shaded blue-feather. For what was a myth then----; after being proved, the myth is no longer a myth but a FACT. God bless all in his service. Amen. PEACE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Types of UFO&#39;s Seen:1)One was shaped like a Saucer but with a curved upper and lower crest.  2)Circular but it had writings revolving around it in a circular motion. 3)The third one I saw was elongated and triangular:long like a cigar shape and had four lights. Three were orange in color and which were attached in the corners of the triangular shaped liked a cigar and Red big light was in the center of the other lights(bigger than the three orange color lights)I am a Spiritualist who now believes in the unseen: for it is from that nothing - that everything comes; for it is something ---- which makes wonder.Time to think from the Beyond:to the Beyond.which is our Ultimate Reality. God Bless YOU in his service. Amen. PEACE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in 1992 is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/1/92|Benton|AR|Disk|2-3 minutes|Round object, appearing the undeside of a suacer, hovered near me, then silently "whisked"off across the sky at an amazing speed.|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16094.html|67|ndxe199206| Round object, appearing the undeside of a suacer, hovered near me, then silently &#34;whisked&#34;off across the sky at an amazing speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have only told friends about this event. I have never reported it officially. As I see more and more reports on the television, I felt obliged to report this event.At my rural home, in the evening, I was sitting on my front steps. It was a summer evening and the sky was clear excpet for a few pink clouds on the horizon. Silently and from out of nowhere an object resembling the bottom of a plate or saucer appeared out of my periferal vision. It hovered if front of me across the road, still no sound for about a minute. As I watched, it suddenly &#34;whisked or zoomed&#34; at an amazing speed, much to agile for any aircraft. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before. The most amazing thing to me was inspite of the large size, uncanny speed and the fact that it hovered, was the stark silence. I knew that instant I saw it, that is was a UFO. I never felt compelled to convince anyone, just relate it to a few friends. I understand now why some people who see UFo say they didn&#39;t really care whether anyone believed them or not; that they knew instincively what it was. This was my experience. I have never seen anything like this before or since. I am a registered nurse, mom, wife.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
