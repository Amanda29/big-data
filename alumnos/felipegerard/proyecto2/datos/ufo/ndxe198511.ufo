It was the Tues morn after Thanksgiving 1985 around 430 am. I was riding along Ga rt 441 south of Eatonton, and stopped along the road to p.  I was right next to a fence that was along the hiway on a small inlet off the big lake. I could easily find that spot again, even after all these years. I was facing west while taking a pit stop and the sky was dark, starry, moonless, silent. I saw in the west three lights in a triangular formation. They were moving in a direction toward me very slowly in a path from due west to east. They were noiselss. All was silent and I would have heard any noise they made, as in a plane, or other known craft. I watched for many mins as they moved slowly across the sky. I then realized I had my 264 win mag rifle with me, it had a 3-9x40 scope on it. I got it out as they passed overhead and put the scope on 9x. I saw thru the scope three saucer shaped oblect with a bubble type turret or top. The lights seemed to eminate from a row of windows or whatever around each turret. The crafts were all three totally traditional &#39;flying saucer &#39; shape. I watched them thru the 9x rifle scope for a long time as they proceeded east into false dawn. Then they stopped totally and didnt move for many minutes. They seemed to just hang near the eastern horizon for a long time as I watched thru the rifle scope. It was getting lighter along the horizon at this time. Suddenly, and I mean suddenly, they streaked North and disappeared from my view. The speed which with they took off amazed me. It was instantaneous, a move north then GONE. I wasnt as shocked by the sighting as I was by the sudden disappearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The objects were close together and faded after about 6 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While myself and 3 friends where hunting for racoons one night between the towns of Big Cane and Plaucheville LA. we saw a series of lights. They traveled from the east to the west and looked to be very low.  The first light was about as bright as the landing lights on a commercial plane.  The second light followed close behind and was green in color and waving up and down like it was being pulled by the first.  It left as short green stream behind it.  The third light was simply a white light about half as bright as the first and following the green light. They decended at about a 20 degree angle and faded after about 6 seconds.  I heard a swoosh sound after they passed in front.  This may have been the wind.  The flight path looked like a small plane decending for a landing if one was standing at the end of a runway and about 50 yards to either side of it.  I was facing north at the time so I would have been to the south of the lights. I would like to know what these were.  Do meteorites leave green trails? I did not hear an impact, and the area was woods surrounded by corn fields.  It may have been flares. but the decent angle was wrong.  I have seen parachute flares, and this did not look like them.<n>
11/20/85 04:18|Cedar Grove|WI|Sphere|10 minutes|A large greenish Orb is sighted near Cedar Grove WI early in the AM 11/20/85 for aprox. 10 minutes by two witnesses|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17817.html|4|ndxe198511| A large greenish Orb is sighted near Cedar Grove WI early in the AM 11/20/85 for aprox. 10 minutes by two witnesses<n> <n><n> <n><n> May 27, 2001 To my friend, Peter Davenport I&#39;ve thought long and hard about whether or not to write this letter to you. Please take the time to read it completely. It&#39;s honest and true. Almost 16 years ago (11/20/1985) while on route to a Professional Photography Seminar in Indiana, another Professional Photographer and I witnessed something that I still can&#39;t explain to this day. Let me go into detail. We were traveling south on Interstate 43 at approximately 4:15 a.m. near Cedar Grove, Wisconsin (approximately 39 miles north of Milwaukee). I remember making a comment about how black and crystal clear the sky is. I am an amateur astronomer and you tend to notice details about the sky such as (where the moon is, sunrise time, constellations, meteors, etc.). My partner, who was driving, let out a yell (and a few choice words) and told me to look at that thing. I said what thing? He told me to look east toward Lake Michigan. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes. We both saw a greenish glowing orb east toward Lake Michigan. We pulled over quickly on the gravel shoulder of I-43. I looked at my watch and it was now 4:18 a.m. We both got out of the car and just stared at the object. The orb or whatever it was, appeared east from our location at an angle of approximately 45 degrees off the eastern horizon. It was impossible to judge distance given that we had nothing to reference it to (the area is extremely dark with few lights.) We were approx. 2 miles west of Lake Michigan. The size of the object was difficult to ascertain given the lack of reference. I, however, did a simple comparison that gave me some sort of repeatable ratio to the object. I held my arm straight out fully extended toward the object and made a tight fist to reference the size of my fist to the object. The object was almost the same size as my closed fist at arm&#39;s length. The time that the object remained at this size was about four minutes. During this period of time, the orb didn&#39;t seem to move or change in brightness or color. It remained clearly round and had a definite diffused greenish glow to it. After this period of time (approximately 4 minutes), the object did a strange thing. The object began to i! ncrease rapidly in size I did my extended arm test again and this time the object was about the size of an open hand with the fingers fully extended. (At this time, I think we both felt a sense of fear at what we were seeing.) I can only estimate that the object stayed at this size for an additional 3 to 4 minutes. After this time period (approximately 8 minutes from first seeing the object), the object began to decrease in size and became as before, about the size of a closed fist at arm&#39;s length. At about this time, my partner grabbed his camera, and fired off a few frames of film. (Unfortunately, he had only daylight portrait film loaded) Because of the low ISO rating, the film was not sensitive enough to record low light without a tripod and long exposure. The next thing that happened was even stranger. While we both observed the object, it seemed to expand outwardly and de-materialize right in front of our eyes. We both observed the object a total of about (10 Minutes) including the time when we saw it de-materialize. The time according to my watch was now 4:30 AM. I know how crazy this probably sounds to you, but as God as my witness, this event is true. We had to be in Indiana at a Professional Seminar by 8:30 AM so we had to continue on our journey. The following day after the sighting, I called The Center For UFO Studies in Chicago. I have to admit I felt awkward and a bit uneasy calling in about a subject such as this. The man who talked to me was pleasant and asked a lot of questions (such as directions, time, location, clouds, etc.). I answered carefully and honestly as best I could. When I had finished describing what we had seen, he told me that the Center For UFO Studies &#34;had received three separate reports from three commercial airline pilots who had apparently seen something east of my location at approximately the same time and date.&#34;   He; however, wouldn&#39;t go into detail. I don&#39;t use drugs; never have, and never will. I only have an occasional alcoholic beverage. I have a clean record and have never been in trouble with the law. I have never had any mental problems. What I have said is 100% true and honest. Before this sighting, I would have laughed at people who claim to see UFO&#39;s. I no longer laugh at this subject. Many rational people have observed unexplainable things in our skies. I, frankly, don&#39;t know what we saw that early morning almost 16 years ago. I do know it was not a normal occurrence or imagination. One important thing we did the next day was to make a tape recording with all the information and details still fresh in our minds. I also made several duplicate tapes and have distributed them. I know this sounds paranoid; however, at the time we took this event very seriously. If you need additional information or would like to contact me by telephone please call me collect. My phone number is (920) ((number deleted)) after 5 PM central time week days. I would appreciate it if you would not use my name in your Sightings Data Base. I have not (at this point) contacted the second witness about reporting his sighting to NUFORC thank you for your time ((name deleted)) ((street name deleted)) Sheboygan WI 530XX<n>

I believe it was on Oak Ridge Rd.  My nearest neighbors were a distance away, maybe 100 yards, and wooded areas seperated the houses on my street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was late fall and getting dark early.  I was sitting in my bedroom, playing with lego blocks, and had my back to the window.  I remember that the window had a broken &#39;pull down&#39; shade that would not stay down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I sat there, I felt a sudden electrical charge all over my body, and found that I could not move.  I had no idea what was going on, and became afraid.  I do not know how much time passed while I was unable to move, but when I could move again, I became aware of the feeling that I was being watched.  I got up, turned around and came face to face with a thing looking in my bedroom window, less than 4 feet away.  It had a large head, was whitish, and had piercing black eyes.  I do not really remeber if it had nostrils or a mouth, but I suppose it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stared at me for a few moments, studying me.  I let out a scream and ran as fast as I could, looking for my father.  I found him in the basement, doing laundry.  I was crying, and babbling that I had seen a &#34;skeleton head&#34; in my window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course, he didn&#39;t believe me, telling me that I had a nightmare.  As he held me, though, the thing in my window reappeared in the basement window, looking in upside down.  I screamed again, and pointed at the window.  My dad turned around to look, but the creature moved out of view very quickly.  He says to this day that he did not get a good look at it, and could not describe what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no trees near my bedroom window, and no way of setting up a ladder without me hearing.  It was too real to be a dream, and too solid to be a reflection.  Plus, many other people describe seeing the same thing when they are young.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then, I have had 2 ufo experiences, one nighttime, and one daytime, as recently as last year, and witnessed my more than two other people.  Also, I have been plagued by intense nightmares recently, where I wake up and am unable to move, and unable to wake my girlfriend, and feel hands on my back.  I get rolled over by these hands, and find myself staring up at one or more of these things.  I know there are other people who have seen things like this and would like to talk to them about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The night was moderately clear, with enough light pollution to limit stars to the top two thirds of the sky.  Around 7 or 8 pm, about three quarters up the sky in the west (coming to view above the tree) my attention was drawn by what appeared to be a white, glowing line, shaped as follows...<n> <n><n> <n><n> _____     _____________ \   / \ / ` ...in reality, the line was a solid. My drawing is also pointing the wrong way - please rotate the figure one quarter turn counterclockwise.  The &#34;v&#34; portion pointed westwards.  It was moving soundlessly and in a smooth manner similar to that of a satellite, although slightly faster. It was about a half to a full degree in size from one end to the other, or a bit larger than the full moon when viewed normally.  I had reasonably powerful binoculars on hand (strong enough to view the major moons of Jupiter easily) and through these the line resolved into individual circles or disks, flying very closely together and never altering formation in the slightest.  There were about 15 of them all told - about 4 on the &#34;short&#34; end, three on each side of the &#34;v&#34; and about another 7 or 8 on the &#34;long&#34; end.  They were not attached to each other, but were closely spaced enough to appear a glowing line from the ground. They were white in the center, fading to a fuzzy, blue white on the edges. Focusing them sharply proved impossible.  The line continued eastward and passed from view.  It took about a minute to a minute and a half to cross my sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not pretend to know what it was, but I am now, in these first few days of 2008, 36 years old, and have been avidly looking up for at least 30 of those years.  I was young when I saw this, only 14 or so, but was a very experienced skywatcher even then. Night after night after night of gazing has shown me thousands of satellites, endless airplanes and helicopters, beautiful meteors and startled birds lit by the lights below them. I have never seen anything like this again, before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I am not quite sure what I saw. It first appeared as dim light in the distant night sky.  The light appeared to be slowly moving from 20 miles away NE to SW. I mentioned to a friend that was there and he noticed it but paid it no mind. We first surmised that it was a helicopter.  Several minutes had passed and I noticed that it was moving ever closer but I could not hear the operation of the machine.  I watched it as it floated directly overhead. It made no sound and appeared to be black or gun metal gray and machined on the bottom (lines or groves in patterns). It was triangular in shape with a light in each corner. I stared at it for a second.  The rest of the group appeared to pay it no attention at all even though it was right above us. It was stationary above us at about a 100 feet.  After staring for a minute it started to slowly move to the east.  I walked the alley di! rectly underneath it trying to follow. As I followed the craft it appear to notice me following.   At that time it started to ascend into the sky. I imagined that it would rise into the clouds but it did not.  After ascending for a couple of seconds it just disappeared completely.  No one spoke of the incident but I have recounted the story many times to my family since it happened.  I had not heard of a triangular UFO at the time so it struck me as a bit odd.  The movie  Contact came out and my brother called me on the phone to state that it was odd that they used a triangular UFO in the movie in light of the story I had always told.  He had never heard of triangular UFOs either until that time. I now know that black triangles are a common siting and that vanishing is a common phenomenon associated with them.  I am sorry that I cannot remember the exact month or year but I know that school was in at the time and it was around 1985 or 1986.  I do remember the media stating that pe! ople had reported a UFO siting over north Texas at the time. That made it clear in my mind that what I saw was not my imagination.<n>

I actually submitted this report to a South African UFO organization sometime ago,but unfortunately I never recived a response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of this sighting,my family and I were living in a suburb of East London in the Cape Province.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early one evening just before dusk,my son who was about 8 years old at the time,were sat outside reading.Although I cannot recall the actual month,I guess it must have been spring or early summer time,as we were outside on a very pleasant cloudless  and calm evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son said to me, &amp;quot;Look Dad,there&#39;s an aeroplane&amp;quot;. I looked up,but what I saw was no aeroplane. The best description I can give is that it was a flourescent orb flying from west to east/south east at tremendous speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was observing this,my son then said &amp;quot;There&#39;s another one coming!&amp;quot; and almost immediately thereafter &amp;quot;and another one!&amp;quot; Incredibly,these three orbs were following each other equidistantly in a controlled manner and didn&#39;t appear to be descending.Although it&#39;s difficult to judge what height they were at and what distance they were away from us,I would estimate at approximately 1,000 feet and probably no more than 1 mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no sound from them at all and as I say,their speed was tremendous.All in all from them coming into view to disappearing over the horizon towards the Indian Ocean,was probably no more than 5 seconds! I have been interested in aviation and related topics all my life and I can assure everybody who may read this,that no aircraft either then or now is capable of such speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of curiosity the following morning,I contacted the local newspaper to enquire if anybody else had reported this.Apparantly many people had,but obviously the newspaper could not offer an explanation what these UFO&#39;s were.They did publish a small article relating to this sighting a couple of days afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seems incredible now in these days of heightened security throughout the world of aviation,but the person I spoke to at the newspaper offered me the telephone number of the control tower at the local commercial airport to see if anybody there could offer an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The guy I spoke to at the airport was very forthcoming with the information he gave me and I recall him telling me that although he hadn&#39;t been on duty the previous evening,a colleague of his had made a log entry that the UFO&#39;s had passed relatively close to the airport.He also told me that it was noted that the flight crew of a South African Airways Boeing 737 had contacted the control tower to report the UFO&#39;s!! Not being a computer buff,I cannot say that I have literally trawled the internet searching for further information of this sighting,but on the few occasions I have looked,unfortunately,I have not been able to find anything at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What prompted me to report this incident to you was your report and graphics from Seattle,WA dated March 19 2006. Although this graphic only depicts one sphere,it is virtually identical to the three we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope this is of interest to you and good luck with your ongoing activities.<n>
