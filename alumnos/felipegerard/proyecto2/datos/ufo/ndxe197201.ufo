1/18/72 21:00|Blacksburg|SC|Light|2 hours|In the early 70's, four of us chased lights in the sky. ( we were in a vehicle )|4/26/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/006/S06329.html|1|ndxe197201| In the early 70&#39;s, four of us chased lights in the sky. ( we were in a vehicle )<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I was sitting in the back seat, must younger and much smaller I couldn&#39;t follow the shape of the object. All I remembered was seeing red and blue lights ( possibly had green light, I cant remember ) going over the tops of some trees. It was very low, practically touching the tops of the trees. The lights must have been at the back of the craft since the craft was moving forward. The lights were round and didn&#39;t seem to be going on and off. I was 15 yrs old then, I am now 41. Looking back over the years this has puzzled me a lot. I dont remember anything after that, I don&#39;t even remember going home. And no, I never used drugs. There was a lot of talk going on in the area at that time about ufo&#39;s being spotted. I never took any of it serious. I just went along for the ride. My main question is, were there really ufo&#39;s in that area that particular time in the 70&#39;s?<n>
1/15/72 23:00|Malmstrom AFB|MT|Unknown|mult hrs|UFO on USAF base 1972 or 1973|9/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25189.html|2|ndxe197201| UFO on USAF base 1972 or 1973<n> <n><n> <n><n> A good friend, at the time assigned as  NORAD Watch Cmdr, 11pm-0700 shift, rank: CPT, USAF was on duty at Malmstrom AFB in Great Falls, Montana when an incident occurred quite similar to that reported in the 1975 newspaper article you have posted on your website. My friend was made aware that sensors surrounding one missile silo recorded a rapid rise in ground temperature( from -25 to -30F to 50 or 60F} within the space of 5-15 minutes. Simultaneously all the sensors on perimeter &#34;fences&#34; showed that whatever was occurring had not been initiated by something crossing the fences nor had any of the ground sensors indicated anything had &#34;walked&#34; by ground passage up to the missile site. He said he was told that the missile silo cover had been set aside, that &#34;crew&#34; from the unknown craft broke into the missile silo, and some of its &#34;crew&#34;  were examining the circuitry of the ballistic missile. At least one Observer on the U.S. military reaction team arrived to see &#34;crew&#34; scampering aboard the &#34;craft&#34;. Apparently as is SOP, fighters  scrambled. My friend said when the radar target appeared on &#34;his&#34; radar scopes within a few moments of the reaction team&#39;s &#34;radioed&#34; report, it was travelling straight up at a speed in excess of 50,000 miles an hour. It disappeared by moving outside the range of the radar his NORAD shift was using.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When he told me this he began perspiring profusely and was very nervous and discomfitted. As a decorated Vietnam combat veteran I know nervousness and a few things about fear. My friend was very nervous, a bit scared, and upset. If we had not been such good friends he probably would not have told me about this. He did know about one prior UFO experience I had - and before this happened used to give me grief about what I had told him had happened to me. Ever since that conversation I am now reporting, he has never made fun of UFO sightings or reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I read the report situated on your website I initially thought you were talking about what my friend had reported to me. I was very surprised that the date was 1975 because, if what my friend told me was true - and I believe what he said, it wasn&#39;t the first time missiles at Malmstrom AFB had been examined by unknown personnel from a craft whose origins were also unknown. From what my friend said, it had technology far ahead of ours. He said everyone was told the &#34;incident did&#39;t happen.&#34; I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t be more specific because I am relating the comments my friend made. That is why I can&#39;t give you a shape of the craft or other details. He was watching this on various instrumentations, but others involved &#34;talked&#34; to eachother, swapping info {I would imagine} to confirm they weren&#39;t crazy. He was an experienced Fighter controller expert, so this was no novice relating the story to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

According to my friend, the 1972 or 1972 event was similar to the one in 1975 in that the missile silo was opened, then the missile was opened up and the electronic circuitry examined. See my friday report. One thing I forgot: this &#34;craft&#34; apparently lit up the area surrounding the missile silo so its&#34;crew&#34; had light to work by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END MESSAGE))<n>
1/5/72 19:30|Gering|NE|Light|2-3 minutes|Fast moving light, darting then hovering in sky; emitted beam of light.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43027.html|3|ndxe197201| Fast moving light, darting then hovering in sky; emitted beam of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were driving out of Gering, NE southbound approximately 3 - 5 miles south of the Wildcat Hills in the winter of 1972.  There may still be a windmill on the east side of the road that marks the place where this sighting occured.  We were on our way to a get-together out in the &#34;boonies&#34; at a friend&#39;s parents&#39; ranch.  It was very cold &amp; there were clouds of an impending snowstorm in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove south, we saw a very bright light moving at a very rapid pace from south east toward the west. At first we thought it might be a low flying jet, (under the level of the clouds)but then noted there weren&#39;t any blinking &#34;airplane lights&#34;.  I pulled the car over on the side of the road to watch. In an instant the craft stopped in the sky (west of highway) &amp; remained stationary for maybe 10 seconds.  It then streaked eastward, moving faster than when we originally spotted it, hovered momentarily again &amp; then streaked back to the general area it first hovered in. After again hovering for maybe 10 seconds, a bright and wide beam of light shot down from the object toward the ground.  We could not see where the beam hit the ground because there are hills toward that direction at that point of the highway. We were pretty alarmed.  Then the beam shut off and just a few seconds later the object disappeared, reducing in size until gone, as if it had accelerated toward space (didn&#39;t move left or right/up or down).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My reaction as driver was to get the H out of there.  I looked down as I put the car in gear &amp; the instrument panel on the dash indicated my car was overheated.  I turned the engine off &amp; popped the hood to check the radiator, with intentions of going to the windmill&#39;s stock tank for water. Upon inspection, there was no indication the radiator was overheating; I loosened the radiator cap to check.  Got back in the car &amp; the gauge was reading normal.  The entire event was very disconcerting.  By the way, it may be unrelated but the stretch of road between Gering &amp; Kimball had a number of underground nuclear missle silos located there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My employment background includes technical/science training in the area of OSHA and EPA regulation. I have a bachelors degree &amp; graduated magna cum laude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
1/1/72 20:00|Huntsville|AL|Unknown|2 minutes|3 lights, light speed, no sound, 90 degree turn|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43212.html|4|ndxe197201| 3 lights, light speed, no sound, 90 degree turn<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date was sometime in the early 70s.  The &#34;Guess Who&#34; band was playing at Milton Frank stadium in Huntsville,AL. I was about 2 miles from stadium, standing outside listening to the music.  An object appeared coming toward me from the west at a level of about 3 telephone poles. It stopped directly over my head. The form was muted from city lights.  It flashed in sequence 3 different colored lights (can&#39;t remember colors) forming a triangle. It then proceeded 90 degrees from where it had came at light speed. It never made a sound! I have tried to pinpoint the date, one would think it easy to find out when the concert took place.  If you are interested and can find out when it was, please let me know.  I told people that after stopping and flashing the lights on me, that they found no intelligent life and proceeded on!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.
