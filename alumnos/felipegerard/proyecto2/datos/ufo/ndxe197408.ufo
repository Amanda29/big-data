We saw at the other side of a field a hovering silver cylinder slowly moving across the far end of the field. It seemed to be aware of our presence and changed direction, hovering above the bushes and heading towards us. We all ran back to our caravans and told our parents. When we returned it had gone. That same night while we were all asleep I was waken when my aunt and uncle burst into our home shaken and obviously terrifed. Something had shaken their caravan about and pulled off the door, whatever it was was chased away by their dog. the next day we saw the caravan, it was a complete mess smashed to pieces.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

8/23/74 19:30|Bridgeport (pond flowing out of Remington Arms compound)|CT|Triangle|about 3 hours of lost tim|2 girls lose track of time while singing "Octopus's Garden" and taking a short cut through the woods around a pond after seeing a UFO !|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61751.html|4|ndxe197408| 2 girls lose track of time while singing &#34;Octopus&#39;s Garden&#34; and taking a short cut through the woods around a pond after seeing a UFO!<n> <n><n> <n><n> On our travels away from my home to my friend&#39;s house, we cut through some wooded areas that concealed a barbed wire fence enclosing a compound called Remington Arms. We had done this hundreds of times before, just like all the kids did, but this time we had become frightened while passing through the first woods because of an orange glow which seemed to be illumunating behind some trees in the compound. It was a dry humid summer night, but it smelled strange, like rain or some wierd sweet odor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started to sing the Beatle&#39;s song:&#34;Octopus&#39;Garden&#34; over &amp; over again as we entered the second section of the dark wooded area. Brushing sounds of branches made us so nervous!  Soon we were at the clearing around the pond and could see the open sky.  We sang a bit louder and tried our best to ignore the orangey glow behind the trees.  I remember that the moon was hanging low and to keep our spirits light we slowly walked along the path toward it and kept on singing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An object seemed to fly out from inside the Remington Arms compound and we noticed the strange odor in the air again. That wierd sweet odor, but even creepier was the way the tree tops were swaying, especially because there was no wind!<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we had first entered the pond area it felt as if something had been following us from behind the other side of the fence.  My friend was scared and I was too, but acted a bit braver and told her to keep singing and so our voices got louder with nervousness.  As we got closer to the shore of the pond we could see the sky better across the open water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly we noticed that it was a triangular shaped ship which appeared without any sound, except for the movement of tree branches brushing together as it emerged from behind some tree tops. The dark triangle cruised directly towards us. It had some bright orange lights and made everything look like a negative film, with that orangey, brown tone. We kept singing, but softer as we couln&#39;t believe our eyes. Was this truly a UFO? Time seemed to stand still and must have slipped away because when we finally were able to move away and go down the path, skipping rocks in the strange glow which illuminated our way out of the woods and into the streets, the moon had risen and looked smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We hurried to her house as fast as we could and upon arrival everyone was worried. We were three hours late. It was after 11:00 pm and we started out from my house at around 8:00 pm. It was less than a thirty minute walk even with our dilly-dallying!  No-one believed our story and said we each shared an over active imagination. We cried and begged to be believed. &#34;Call the authorities! We&#39;re telling the truth.&#34; and continued to insist that our experience was real! Then the next day my friend&#39;s Dad said, &#34;Maybe, girls, what you witnessed was only a new aircraft of sometype that the government was testing out. Make sure you both keep away from that area because you&#39;ll be caught and convicted of tresspassing!&#34; Of course, we didn&#39;t heed him and went back the next day afterschool. We sang until our lungs turned blue, but no UFO appeared. Later, after supper at my friends house, she decided to only walk me halfway home, the pond would be the &#34;good-bye&#34; point. So we sat on rocks in the clearing and began singing Octopus&#39; Garden again. Sure enough, the orangey glow hoovered over the moving tree branches and the UFO softly floated above the water once again, not making any sound. This time we were both frozen with fear and disbelief. Again time slipped by, my friend wore a watch, but when we checked it later, it had stopped. She admitted that maybe she forgot to wind it or push the pin in tight enough after setting it. Whatever happened we&#39;ll never know? We ran down the path not even skipping the rocks properly. With soaking sneakers and drenched bell-botttoms, we reached the streetlights and fell to our knees in the middle of the road and began to pray! The older kids in the neighborhood started to make fun of us when we told our tale, so we stopped sharing it! One boy who had a tree house  and lived near the pond told everyone that it was true and that he saw the same UFO! We sorta felt better and became closer than ever before. Eventually,though, we kinda stopped talking about it altogether. Soon we became more interested in teenage things, like love, Rock N Roll, and our developing figures. I was always on the skinny side, butd suddenly started to loose a lot of weight. The boy and my best friend fell in love. Soon after my parents moved to the country, I was hospitalized. The Doctors diagnosed me with Hodgekin&#39;s Lymphoma. But the pathology report said some nodes had bizarre changes in them which couldn&#39;t be identified! Radiation &amp; Chemotherapy took over my young life. I was just turning sixteen. I lost touch with ALL my childhood friends. The last time we got together was in 1984 after our dear friend, who said he also saw the UFO, committed suicide. My best friend was newly engaged to be married, but suspected that she was barren inside, maybe because of our experience. I haven&#39;t seen or spoke to her since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However,I was able to give birth to twin girls in 1986 and in March of 96 or 1997 during the visit of Hale-Bopp Comet, I had bizarre dreams of being abducted and woke up with tiny needle marks on the veins in my right hand. My daughters both had nightmares! One of them saw me on a table in a white room. I couldn&#39;t beleve it when she told me that these aliens took her arm off and she saw them doing painful things to her twin sister. I told them that I had a visit too and showed them my hand. I had two tiny unexplainable scabs directly on my veins. I chose not to tell them until later in adulthood that I saw them in the white lights too, and in my dream I also saw that same daughter laying on a table without her arm. God&#39;s honest truth! To this day the twins become uncomfortable talking about it. They don&#39;t like to remember the bad experience and say that I am making up my admissions just to scare them. I wonder...can generations become targets of study?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

8/21/74 11:00|Holloman AFB|NM|Other|1 hour|Had my military career and life threatened by an officer while in the USAF|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88041.html|6|ndxe197408| Had my military career and life threatened by an officer while in the USAF<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a teen growing up in North-Central Texas back in the late 60&#39;s I had once bought a paperback book on the subect of UFO&#39;s.  And years later in the late summer of 1974 while I was stationed at an Air Force Base here in southern New Mexico,  a case in that book caused me to have a very strange encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was an &#34;Administration Clerk&#34; {called a 702 in Air Force terms.}   Once while my Boss and I were in the West area of the base doing some inventory of computer parts in a hangar, I noticed across the road was another hangar with a very tall chain-link fence, barbed wire at the top, and a lot of junked crates piled near the top on the inside, so barely the roof of the hanger was in sight.  The sliding hangar door where we had gone to inventory computers was only secured by a chain and padlock.  So I thought to myself that the other hangar must have some real important items inside to have such protection around it.  But when I asked my Boss about that, it was to my shock and surprise when he said &#34;they only store junk in there&#34;.  This made me curious and suspicious.  I called my Mother and asked her to send me that old book I had as a teen, that was in the bookcase in my old bedroom at home back in Texas.  She found it and mailed it to me.  Upon studying it again I re-read the case about an &#34;object that came down and hovered over a runway at the base I was! stationed&#34;...I think back about 1963, and in the event that pursued our people managed to get it to the ground, and dragged it off to a hangar in the West area and nothing more was ever seen or heard about it.  It was my estimation that if this event was correct as described in the book, that maybe I had &#34;found&#34; that hangar.   I did some checking around the base trying to find a way to gain access to that hangar to have a look around.  {At the time my rank was an Airman First Class.}  One day I was sitting at my typewriter working on a document in my office near the flightline.  My Boss was out to lunch, and the Colonel who was in charge of my office was gone to a meeting.  I was virtually alone in that part of the hangar.  The door and windows had dark curtains over the windows to keep glare out of the office both early in the morning and later in the afternoon.   So other than a desk lamp, the office was rather dark at times.  All of a sudden I noticed that the door to the office {which opened outward into the main part of the hangar} had been opened but I wasn&#39;t aware that anyone had entered.  My first impression was that it was my Boss coming back from lunch.  But after a minute or so it seemed odd to me that no one had come in, so I paused from my work to glance that direction to see who it was.  I did a bit of a &#34;double-take&#34; when I noticed it was an officer in &#34;full-dress blues&#34;.  I stood up and walked around my desk to face him at which time he ab! ruptly ORDERED ME to &#34;Attention&#34; {with a salute.}  {Now this was very odd because &#34;no one&#34; did things like this in Permanent Party situations on base, unless it was a special event outdoors, but not inside an office.}  But in my shock and amazement I went to &#34;Attention&#34; with a salute as this man out-ranked me and it startled me so.  As I stood there at Attention I stared at him in the doorway, as he appeared to be sort of &#34;siloutted&#34; with the daylight behind him.  All that I could make out at the time was that he was either a &#34;Major or a Colonel&#34;, and he had a &#34;three word name&#34; on his Name tag but in the dim light I could only make out two of the names.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Standing there at Attention for what seemed like forever...the man finally spoke and told me the following {paraphasing}:  &#34;Soldier...If you value your Air Force career and your life in general, then I hereby ORDER YOU to Cease and Desist from the search you are doing, as it&#39;s bigger than both of us, and could lead to a Court Martial and your ultimate demise&#34;...&#34;Soldier, do I make myself clear&#34;?  To which I said &#34;Sir, Yes, Sir&#34;!  And with that he &#34;concluded the salute&#34;, and shut the door.  I remember standing there &#34;shaking&#34; for several minutes until I realized he was gone, and then carefully opened the door and stuck my head out and looked around?   I saw no one.  I ventured out and walked around down to a couple of other offices nearby and asked the personnel in there if they had seen anyone in &#34;Dress Blues&#34;, but they had not.  I finally made my way over to the other side of hangar where the front parking lot was, and once outside saw &#34;no strange vehicles&#34; in the parking lot.  I just shook my head and went back to my office.  I sat down and took a deep breath, and realized that I was going to have to &#34;give up my search for that UFO&#34;!, as now I knew beyond a doubt that it was &#34;real&#34; but I did not have the rank to challenge it.  After a few mintues I calmed down and came to terms with what had happened...and proceeded to continue my work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a half hour later the office door again &#34;opened&#34; all of a sudden and like a chain reaction I &#34;jumped up to Attention&#34; and in-so-doing my knees bounced the typewriter off the table onto the floor, and the carriage fell off.  This time it was my Boss {a Staff Sergeant} returning from lunch, and the look on his face would have &#34;stopped a clock&#34; as he stared at me and said &#34;What on earth is wrong with you&#34;?  And then I just slumped into my chair with an almost feeling of collapse! As he bent over to pick up the pieces of the typewriter, I said &#34;Oh my&#34; and got down and helped him.  Then he sat me down in my chair and bugged me until I was willing to tell him about the &#34;whole event&#34;.  Once I was finished he got &#34;very upset&#34; and said &#34;he didn&#39;t care who it was, that the guy had NO RIGHT to order his people around&#34;, etc...He told me to lock the door behind him and not to open it for anyone until he got back, as he was going to hunt fo this guy.  I did as he instructed me but feared the Colonel would come back and get upset with me...but he didn&#39;t.  When my Boss returned I let him in the office and he said he looked all over and asked a lot of people but couldn&#39;t find anyone by the &#34;two names&#34; that I saw on this officer! &#39;s name tag, that was either stationed on base, or visiting that day.  So from that point on that event remained an &#34;unsolved mystery&#34; to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then...Some twenty-odd years later {about 1992} I was at my home and was going from my home-office to the bathroom when I passed through my bedroom where I forgotten to turn off the television earlier that morning.  A  Television Talk Show was coming on.  {it was 10am.} I heard the &#34;well-known&#34; TV Talk Show Host announce that the topic of discussion was the &#34;UFO&#39;S&#34;.  And I stopped and turned around...went over to the television, and grabbed a blank VCR tape and put it in the VCR, and pressed &#34;play/record&#34;.  Then I sat on the end of my bed to see who was on the panel.  There were several fairly well-known entertainers, and other&#39;s whom I had seen on TV before discussing this subject...but when it came to the last man on the panel, there sat a man with short, graying hair, glasses, a little on the chubby side wearing a brightly colored tropical sport shirt, and when he spoke his name...I FEEL OFF THE END OF THE BED ONTO THE FLOOR.  IT WAS THE SAME MAN WHO &#34;THREATENED ME&#34; way back in 1974 when I was in the USAF.  Once I gathered myself, ran to the bathroom, and came back and sat back down on the bed, I watched the whole show as I recorded it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In &#34;summary&#34;...that man&#39;s purpose on being on the show was to tell people there is NO SUCH THING AS UFO&#39;s and NO GOVERNMENT COVER-UP.  {But from then on I knew his &#34;real name&#34;.  I had only seen his first and middle name, but not his last.  And if I mentioned it here most &#34;EVERYONE&#34; who reads this would know it.  He&#39;s a retired USAF Major.}  This basically &#34;ends&#34; that event but in closing I wanted to say that since this event there were two well-known UFO Researcher&#39;s who came to my city and were on a Radio Program I listened to.  And afterwards I called the motel where they were staying and spoke to one of them at length.  I told him about this event and a few of my others and he told me he felt I was a credible witness, and very knowledgeable on this subject of UFO Phenomena and gave me a WATTS LINE for further reporting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The light in the rear of the formation left the formation and began moving down towards the ground. The other 3 maintained their places in the formation and continued moving across the sky.  The light that left the formation and dropped close to the ground suddenly shot across the sky back to the other lights and began spinning rapidly around one of the lights in the formation then shot to another one spinning rapidly around it also.  30 sec. - 1 minute later another diamond-shaped formation appeared behind me and travelled across the sky in another direction.  About an hour later 8 white luminescent discs travelling side by side in a row appeared, moving in the opposite direction of the first group.  They were silent and moved along a wiggly path, not a straight line.  Again 1 or 2 left their place in the row and rapidly spun around other members of the group.<n>

It was a summer evening right after a dinner party with a friend who has since passed away.  It was a very clear summer evening and as we were going to our vehicles to leave, 3 bright lime green luminous oval shapes went from north to south at a speed I would say is equitable to a jet.  The color was captivating and they were solid in color.  There was one in front and two at the rear, quite close to each other.  They were also, I would say, about the length of a Boeing 707, very large and actually quite low in the sky.  I couldn&#39;t even begin to tell you what height I thought they were, just that they looked low on the horizon and not quite straight overhead.  They went in a straight line of flight.  I have often thought about this and have never read anything that could explain what we saw.  There was no sound, which was strange for something traveling that low and that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

When the object reached its east position it drifted away from the hills and hovered for about 10 seconds,then it shot up vertically at a very fast speed and was gone from view in 6 or 7 seconds.At the time of the sighting the weather conditions were warm,clear night no clouds at all! it just faded in the 7 seconds or so both me and mother were excited at what we had seen and when we found father we asked him if he had seen the object but he had not!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was about 16-17 yrs old.   After picking up a girl in my car, we went to the local parking area. At that time it had the nickname &#34;Pregnant Point&#34; (how appropriate).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This area is located in Somersworth, NH between two roads that run parallel to one another:  Salmon Falls Rd and Rt 108 (the old Rt 16).  No more than a mile between the two.  This road today starts at the corner of a local tool crib and almost across the street is a gas station that once had the name Agway.   From Rt 108, going towards Salmon Falls Rd, there is a dirt road to the right and that’s where we had parked that evening.   Backed into the woods on the left hand side perpendicular onto this road we sat talking (completely sober) and while talking we noticed what appeared to be a star way off in the sky that would just grow bright and then fade and continue to do this for awhile.   We at first thought that it could have been a plane but didn’t move at all.   After a few minutes we had just ignored it.   While looking at one another and talking, I glanced back at the sky and went into a sort of horrific shock by the presence of a huge saucer hovering no more than 40 ft or so just above the tree tops across the dirt road we were on and no more than 25-30 ft away.  It was aprox. 75 yds or so in diameter, silverish from what I remember and had numerous lights revolving around the bottom rim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in such a state of shock, that I couldn’t even speak with tears running down my face and trying to speak but only had an open mouth with no words.  This girl whom I have no idea to this day who she is, didn’t see it at all at this time and kept asking me what was wrong.  She was kinda freaked by my state of shock.  This saucer made absolutely no noise and vanished in about 5-6 seconds maybe a little longer but not much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I was able, I started my car and still unable to talk, took a right back onto this dirt road and then another right back onto pregnant point (this girl kept asking me what the matter was).  I still couldn’t talk at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned left onto Salmon Falls Rd, she screamed like a blood curling scream from some horror film.  I knew then she had just seen it.  When I turned onto Salmon Falls Rd., she had spotted this UFO out the passenger window over the Salmon Falls River and the swamp next to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once in Rochester and no idea where I had dropped her off, I went home and called the Rochester Police to report what had happened.   All they said was, &#34;Thank you.&#34;  I was a little set back by the response but being young, I just let it go.   Who would ever believe me anyway?   I had told no one else until the next day because it was a little late that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, I was driving my car on Central Ave in nearby Dover, NH, and I tuned into the local radio station WTSN in Dover.  I hadn’t talked to my brother ((name deleted)) at all.  ((name deleted)) had just come on WTSN because he was at that time, he was the Strafford County ((deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> He had reported UFO sightings in numerous areas; Exeter Police reported sightings from officers themselves, Dover Police had sightings over the Junior High School, Somersworth Police had sightings over the water tower and Rochester Police chased a UFO up Rochester Hill Rd which is actually Rt 108 (the old Rt 16) just a few miles from where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To top it all off, a friend (whom I had no knowledge of where he worked at this time) was in the local newspaper: &#34;Foster’s Daily Democrat&#34; and had reported a confirmed sighting that night.  He was working at the Agway gas station no more than ¾ of a mile in parallel to where I was parked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few years ago, I had called the Rochester Police for police reports of that time and they told me that there were no records of my calling.  However, at the time of this writing I have physically gone in and put in a request for records.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later on had researched that time period and found ((name deleted)) report in the newspaper of Foster’s dated August 17, 1974.  Some years later his brother and I were at coffee and he remembers his brothers sighting who now lives out of state.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that time, I have told my story to WTSN in the late 1990’s on a live call in show called, &#34;The Open Mike&#34;  program and have also told my story to  &#34;The Bay&#34; (98.7) radio station on an early morning show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw is as real as you and I my friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today, the trees where I had spotted this UFO appear to have not grown as tall as the others nearby.  I hope that you can add this to your archives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for time for what this is worth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time of sighting is not indicated by witness.

It could have been a formation of several crafts, all I saw was a number of lights in a symetrical boomerang shape. No noise was made.  The wing shape continued into the western skyline and disappeared.  I was very excited and tried to wake my friend.  He didn&#39;t see it.  I stood there looking into the east hoping to see it again. I figured it might be coming around again.  It did.  This time it was much higher in the sky.  It streaked past again.  My friend missed it again.  Then to my surprise I saw it again even higher.

At that point I thought they were aircraft and joked with my little sister and cousin about them being UFO&#39;S.  As we got closer I coud tell that they weren&#39;t aircraft but looked more like the stadium lights at FIU (Florida Int&#39;l University).<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as we approached the intersection at 107 Ave., I realized that stadium lights were much farther.  When we finally gor to the intersection, I stopped my car, got off and directly above me was this huge bright and white cigar shaped light.  It didn&#39;t make any noise whatsoever.  Suddenly, a small green light started blinking and it silently began to descend as it drew away from us.  In ended up hovering above some bushes about a block away.  To make a long story short, after almost crashing trying to get close to the UFO again, I decided to drop the chase since by then my little sister and cousin were very scared.  A couple of days later I heard on the radio that there had been other reports of UFO sightings in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It continued up the street without a sound and we chased after it on foot but couldnt keep up with it. A block away my mother was in our drive way as she just arived home from shoping. She was pointing up in the air shouting for my father but when he came outside it was gone. She had seen the same thing as we did and to this day all three of us belive the object was &#34;not man made&#34; It was a perfect triangle with three equal sides,black and about 15 feet on each side and maybe 6 feet thick at the center but thinner at the edges.

8/15/74 20:00|Gold Beach|OR|Circle|30 seconds|Ball of light shining a cone of light on the beach.|6/12/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23058.html|16|ndxe197408| Ball of light shining a cone of light on the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My two friends and I were returning to college in Louisiana after working the summer in Washington state. I was driving along the coast highway at dust. Suddenly we all noticed a motionless hovering white ball of light, shining a cone of light on the beach. After approximately 10 seconds the ball of light shot off toward the horizon - west over the ocean - at an incredible speed. The cone of light remained, slowly becoming dimmer and assuming a &#34;smokey&#34; apearance while maintaining the cone shape. It gradually faded away. I do not know the time of the event, but it was dusk. It was a clear day and little if any clouds. The first impression (dictated by logic) was that it must be a helicopter with a searchlight, but try as we might, there just was no helicopter (or anything else) there - just a ball of light. The distance from us to the light is difficult to estimate, but in order to provide some context, I would guess it was between 70 and 100 yards away. The size of the ball of light is also difficult to gauge, again I would guestimate approximately 3 feet in diameter. The length of the cone of light was approximately 30 feet. We stopped at the next town (heading south), Gold Beach, Oregon, and reported to the police what we had seen. They told us that a lot of people had been reporting UFOs recently but what we saw was a meteor(!). With that, we returned to the car and continued on our journey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  If, in fact, the 1) object was hovering for a period of time, and 2) it was visible for 30 seconds, or so, we doubt that it was a meteor.  PD))<n>

It was stationary for a short while and then seemed to follow us if mom speeded up it did when she slowed down it did.  It followed us for about 2 or 3 miles down the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed sort of metallic and seemed to reflect the after noon setting suns colors of a light to dark burnt orange colors, and was circular or round in shape.  It most definitely was not a balloon there was no basket under it and what we could see from a side angle it was more of a disc.  Other then our friends we never discussed or reported it to any authorities .  After following us for a while it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared.  We checked around and nothing was in the news about it so that only reinforced our resolve to not report it.

It was no more then 200 feet in the air, it was silent and snuck up on us. It was a dark silver color and it had white and blue panels all around the edge, that faded from blue to white. We were standing there in amazement, we couldn&#39;t believe what we were witnessing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The u.f.o. wasn&#39;t moving no more than 3-4 mph, the width had to have been some where between 125-150 feet, and traveling east. We watched it until it went out of sight, over some trees. A few minutes later, my mother and my grandmother pulled up in the driveway. My mother asked if we had seen it, because she had already seen it coming along the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandmother got out of the car, and went into the house, while us boys got into the car with our mother, to see if we could catch up with it. We saw it again over a field, on south avenue ext. we pulled into a furniture store parking lot, and watched it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The u.f.o was hovering about 400 feet over the field. Then randomly, another disc that looked the exact same as the other one, appeared over some trees. We watched both of these discs for about thirty minutes. By now it was starting to get dark, and the stars were coming out. The second one that we had seen, always stayed higher than the first u.f.o. The first disc kept shooting down a light, like it was looking for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most amazing thing about this, is that these discs were only about 300 yards from the road. Cars had passed, but none had stopped. The lower disc moved up to where the higher disc was, and stayed there for about 3 minutes, and then they just shot off into the sky, at a very fast speed. By this time it was completely dark. The next morning, we looked in the newspaper about this incident, and the had a little write up saying that the u.f.o was a weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Immediately the lady started directing us to look West just above the White Tank Mountain range at which time she pointed out a rather bright glowing object located approximately 15-20 degrees above the peak of the White Tanks.  At first glance it looked somewhat like a star.  She kept asking us over and over &#34;do you see it, do you see it?&#34; to which we answered, &#34;no&#34;.  I wish to point out at this time that we lied to the lady.  We saw the object all too well.  But, due to the extremely heavy amount of paperwork we would have to undergo not to mention a psychological assessment we answered her, no and that was a lie.  To this day I regret lying to this lady.  The actual incident was as follows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was real and clearly visible.  It glowed orange to red and seem to move all about at approx 2-10 degrees each time it moved.  We observed this object for over a 45 minute period and suddenly, and literally in the blink of an eye it shot up and off to the right (North)at about a 15 degree angle off vertical and suddenly it was gone.  The object departed in what I call &#34;the speed of thought&#34;.  To this day my greatest regret is not validating the ladies comments who called us as she asked them and let her know her eyes were not lying to her but were real.  I at 66 years old that the UFO was as real as I am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I record this incident at this time to support the truth movement in UFOs and promise to support the movement from this time forward as I have for the past 20+ years.  As a former Staff Sargent in the USAF, and a Tower Crew Chief at the Luke AFB Control Tower, a Former Phoenix Firefighter/Engineer, Business Owner, a Jet Aircraft Mechanic for Lockheed Martin and NASA, a Husband, Father and an American Patriot I promise you these comments are true and honest.<n>

8/8/74 22:00|Lake Zurich|IL|Sphere|two hours|The objects I saw changed me forever|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54825.html|27|ndxe197408| The objects I saw changed me forever<n> <n><n> <n><n> color was burnt orange,like setting sun. objects had planned movement.they seemed to act as a group or a squadron on a mission. The globes did not just hover. One would move across the sky then just stop. moments later another would move,then stop. One would move towards another and stop. it seemed like they  touched,then 30 or so seconds it went back to its ariginal position. One of the objects did a strait descent over the swamp past our neighbors house. What was strange about the things that we saw is they made no noise. The objects did not resemble any aircraft that I was aware of. I just turned 10 years of age and I was raised during the vietnam war,and saw many aircraft fly by our house. I had seen many hot air baloons,etc. but nothing like this. WITNESSES, me,6 brothers and sisters, 2 friends of the family,drivers by that stopped at the road side, and finally two lake county sheriff deputies . what  confused us was that the deputies were called  to leave the premises shortly after they arrived. why didnt they stay with us! we had observed them for about 1.5 hours. one of the friends of the family was so scared that he had his shotgun loaded in our house when he called the sheriffs dept. my father always raised us to never have a loaded gun in the house. Our family were raised as hunters so saftey was taught as no loaded guns in the house. I think  that was justified that time. when the objects flew off they left a very short streak of light and instantly disappeared. Later that night I could not sleep. I kept looking outside the window and saw somthing in the big tree on our property. like I was being watched. My life has never been the same. Their has been other incounters since that I could not explain. Flashes of light by the top corner of my window where I use to live,when I was 30 -35 years of age. I visited a catholic priest.went in the church to tell him what was troubling me and at that moment when I said that I and now my ex girlfriend had been seeing flashes of light, in! stantly a huge flash of light went off in an ajoining room in the church. The father said I saw that one.we were the only two in the church at that time. my partner and I do concrete construction and 5 or so years ago saw a very shiny spherical object in the daylight sky at about noon or so.not a cloud in the sky that day.stayed motionless for 1 hour.the object stay in the same position but got smaller and smaller till we lost reference where it was. All of the witnesses that have seen these things that I have seen live normal lives just like I . I dont know? Is it normal to see these things. I wish that I never would of seen what I did so I can sleep better at night!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

This thing had the mechanics, details and lights. And of course it was dead silent!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date and time is not exact. It was summer and late, as we were tossing a beach ball around. A neighbor boy who was 7 and lived across the street of me to the left and my close girl friend who was 11 at the time (and lived 1 house north of the boy);and I was 8 years old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point the ball got away from me and landed just into the boy&#39;s front yard. As I picked up the ball, I looked up to see a glowing round (dare I say) saucer shaped &#34;thing&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disk was silent, floating above the full grown maple tree line; and from where I was standing, just above the boy&#39;s house. It seemed as if it was glowing, yet it did not give off light as a lit football field would on the horizion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The detail on this thing made us stand there in awe, watching it. There were mechanical &#34;things&#34; all around it, such as pipes, cylinders, and other devices. Much like a person looking at the workings of a cars engine. It was bright white in the sky, with the exception of a red flashing light. The flashing light was a slow strobe, and very rythmic. The thing we saw was not moving and never did actually move, yet no sound what so ever was heard. If you have ever seen a picture of Disney&#39;s Space Mountain, this thing would somewhat resemble it. The slightly domed top (lit white) {liken it to the lid of a pan or pot} and the details were round the item like a deep pan, and a flat-ish bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The duration of time we stared at this object seemed like an eternity, as we screamed for our parents. Unfortunatly our parents thought we were just playing and ignored us. As I ran into my house to retrieve my parents so that they could verify this thing we were seeing, and they finally made their way outside. The thing had disappeared. I asked my two friends, and they said this thing that was glowing disappeared, only leaving the red flashing light for a few moments. Then the flashing light also disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live very close to a small air field called Lost Nation Airport and I have lived with small planes, helicopters and even personal jets flying in and out of there as long as I can remember. I know what these things sound like, what they do and what they can never do. I also know that the only way in 1974 that the detail we saw on this thing could ever be duplicated is if you had a painted, detailed picture and projected it onto a large screen (such as a drive in movie screen)and somehow hung it high above the tree line. I am to this day bothered by this image and truely wish to know if the three of us were the only ones to witness this. Something like this could not have only been seen by elementary school aged kids in the middle of the suburbs!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mentor, even then, was a dense area of houses and it was a beautiful, warm night. There is no way that anyone else could have missed it (at all). I often wish I could have some way to draw it or recreate it, much like the movie Close Encounters. I also wish I was not treated like a looney for what I saw. This is why we never said anything to anyone (other than parents).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

At the time,  I assumedthat they must have been aircraft.  But it&#39;s been a long time since then,  and I haven&#39;t ever seen any airplanes,or whatever, that even remotely resemble the objects I saw.I have just recently gained access to the Web,  and being amused by UFO stories,  I found my way to a couple of theUFO pages.  While browsing at Rutgers,  I ran across some reports of &#34;triangular UFO&#39;s&#34;, which made my hair stand on end.  Up to that time,  I had not heard of &#34;triangular&#34;UFO&#39;s.  Here&#39;s what I saw in late August, 1974 while Iwas in the backyard of my house in Campbell, CA (South SFBay area).I was laying on the ground, looking through a pair of 20 power binoculars.  My feet were pointed east, and the binoculars were pointed slightly to the right of straight up,  at about the one o&#39;clock position.  Something went through my field of vision, moving right to left.  I caught up to it quickly,  and saw two objects flying in close  formation,  one behind and to the right of the one in front.They were both the same size, shaped like equilateral triangles with straight edges,  flying point forward. Their color appeared to be flat slate grey,  against a deep blacksky.  There were no features, and I saw no lights, or glow of any kind.  They appeared to be illuminated by the citylights.  It looked something like this:left (north)-                       .if this diagram doesn&#39;t-             -                .line up, select a fixed-                  -             .font (like courier). This-                      -           .line should be straight.-       .                 -          .-       / \                 -         .-       /   \                 -        .-       /     \                 -       .-      /       \                -       . I&#39;ve draw this sideways-     /_________\               -       . because it was a little-                    .            -  top . easier, and the proportions-                   / \           -(west). are more accurate.-                  /   \          -      .-                /     \        -       .-               /       \       -       .-              /_________\      -       .-                             -        .-                           -         .-                      -           .-                  -             .-             -                .-                       .right (south)There was something very peculiar about the way they looked as they flew. The craft in front appeared more steady than  the trailing one, and the distance between them fluctuated randomly,  varying from nearly touching, to a maximum of a triangle length.  When the rear one began to lag,  it would suddenly snap back to a comfortable distance from the front one.  My impression was that it looked as though they were being manually controlled by pilots, and as if they had very high power to weight ratio, and like they were somewha thard to control.I watched them for about 8 to 12 seconds.  During that time,they maintained a due north heading, and covered about 80 to 90 degrees of azimuth.  After I lost sight of them,  I waited for several minutes for any sound.  I heard nothing.The binoculars were 20x50, with a field of view of 157 fee tat 1000 yards. If you assume that the objects were about 100 feet long,  and took up about 1/3 of the field of view, then their altitude would be 2000 yards, or 6000 feet, and their speed would be 568 mph.  That seems pretty conventional,but I think I would have heard jets at that altitude.Furthermore,  what jets have a perfect equilateral sillouette?The closest thing I can think of (that would be flying in 1974),is the B58 Hustler.  But my view was clear enough,  that I could have seen the little bit of fuselage in the front and backof the delta wing.I probably blew the simple geometry I used for the altitude and speed calculations,  but I&#39;ve given enough facts that one could calculate height and speed for any craft of a given size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  As the reader probably has noted, the formation did not survive the transfer from our e-mail program to our website.

AT THIS POINT MY FRIEND AND I WERE SCREAMING TO EACHOTHER THAT IT WAS CHASING US!  WE TURNED INTO MY DRIVEWAY, GOT TO MY GARAGE, JUMPED OFF THE BIKES IN TIME TO SEE IT FLY DIRECTLY OVER US AND IN A BRIEF FEW SECONDS IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT.  IT WAS HUGE, AS BIG AROUND AS A MODEST SIZED HOME.  IT GLOWED WHITE WITH AMBER COLORED LIGHTS THAT CIRCLED AROUND THE MIDDLE OF IT.  IT MADE ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND AS IT MOVED QUICKLY OUT OF SIGHT.

I went upstairs to my room to get something, and happened to look out the window to see what I thought was a C-141B on approach to McGuire AFB. The approach pattern would have plane fly directly over our house at times. I noticed the plane appeared to be extremely low and barely above the tree line behind our housing area, ( Lake Valley Acres ). This got my attention and I watched the plane get closer and closer, but it was moving too slow and low to be a large aircraft. I turned my light out in the room and closed the door so my eyes could adjust to the night time sky. The whole time I was watching this craft, It had a bright, almost spot light like light on it that I mistook for a landing light, but their was only one. As it got closer, I noticed it was only slightly above the roof line of the two story houses, maybe 20-30 feet higher. I was really getting scared now because it was almost over my friends house directly behind our house. I went to open the window to hear it, but the window was already open. It was completely silent, flying at about 5-8 mph. It had a very bright half circle shaped light on the bottom of it, that was bright enough to prevent me from seeing details of the top of the craft. I could see the outline and it was about a 35-40 foot diameter circle with the light about 15 feet in diameter and about half that in depth. As it flew directly over our house, I could see the outline better as it passed. When I could nolonger see it I ran out of my room and frantically ran into the kitchen to ask where the Polaroid one step was. I think my mom gave it to me, but of course it had no film. I then ran full speed out of the kitchen, disregarding what ever my mom was yelling at me, and cleared the entire flight of steps, hitting the screen door handle at the same time and running into the front yard. I could see it real good now it was just crossing the street. I grabbed a couple o rocks out of my ! mom&#39;s fl ower bed and got ready to throw a few rocks side arm at the craft. Yes, it was that low, and yes, at the time, I was that good!! Just as I got ready to throw my first rock, and it was just over our neighbors house in front of me I thought, &#34;what if I do hit it and it stops?!&#34; Visions of disintergration, ( 10 years old, remember ) flooded my mind and I dropped all of the rocks and watched it fly towards McGuire AFB at roof top level until I could nolonger see it. I ran back in the house to tell my mom I just saw a UFO and she just said, &#34;That&#39;s nice, it&#39;s time for you to get ready to go to bed&#34;. I repeated my self and she repeated her self. I asked her why she didn&#39;t believe me and told me again to go to bed. I went to my dad down stairs and he listened to me but I think that was just a parent humoring  a child. I went to bed but did not go to sleep, occasionly looking out my window for another UFO. I think I finally went to sleep at around 3:00 or 4:00 am. At about 7:00 am my mom runs in my room, shaking me saying, &#34;Look what&#39;s in the morning paper!!&#34;, ( Burlington County Times, or Philadelphia Inquirer ). There was a picture of a man with black hair and a close beard and mustache with glasses smoking a pipe. The caption above read, &#34;Moorestown Man sees UFO&#34; I read the article and his description was just as I described, except it had multi-colored perimeter lights on when he saw it. The paper said McGuire was asked If they had tracked any UFO last night, and a base rep of course said their radar picked up nothing. I looked at my mom with a angry glare, and told her, &#34;I told YOU I saw a UFO!!&#34; She looked at me and her eyes where staring to well up with tears in disbeief. To this day, when I tell my mom to tell my friends about the UFO, she walks out of the room, or says, &#34;I don&#39;t want to talk about it&#34;, or says absolutely nothing. I wish I could find &#34;The Smoking Man&#34; or find the news paper article to prove to my friends and family I did see something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

8/1/74 21:00|Chester|CA|Triangle|2 minutes|Three white lights in equilateral triangle move across night sky, multiple witnesses, summer camping trip 1974.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78453.html|36|ndxe197408| Three white lights in equilateral triangle move across night sky, multiple witnesses, summer camping trip 1974.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On our annual family camping trip near Chester, California, my sister, my cousin and I would occasionally see what we thought were satellites floating across the night sky. It has always bothered me that I have never seen anything similar to these &#34;satellites&#34; since then. After stumbling upon an online account of  &#34;black triangles&#34; I came to the realization that what we saw was probably NOT a satellite at all. In fact, I think is scientifically impossible for what we saw to be a satellite. So now, 38 years later, here is my belated report on the &#34;three-star satellites&#34; witnessed over the Potato Patch Campground near Chester, California in July/August of 1974.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can remember it as if it were yesterday--one of those clear childhood memories that sticks with you in a very visual way. I remember talking about it with my sister as we lay there on our sleeping bags, looking up at the stars and wondering what those slowly moving triangle of stars were. We have talked about this as adults, though not in recent years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time we saw them, it must have been between 9-10 PM, as it was fully dark and the stars were out. We were just lying there, looking up at the night sky when we saw what looked like stars formed in the shape of an equilateral triangle drifting overhead. There were three white lights, one in each corner of a triangle. I could not see any body or an edge to a triangle, just the three lights. What made them unusual is that they moved, and that they moved together in such a way that you knew they were physically connected. It must have been really high up, because the lights looked the same size as the stars, slightly bigger, but also slightly brighter than the stars. Anyways, it moved slowly against the other stars in what I think was a northern direction. The three unified lights would speed up then slow down along it&#39;s path and slowly turn or rotate around itself. The movement was very graceful, not at all like an airplane. It just looked like it was floating and spi! nning past us up there in the night sky. It seems like it took about 2 minutes before it went behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can remember seeing this at least twice for certain, and probably more like 3-5 times though I can&#39;t recall the exact instances of each. I do remember that it became commonplace for us to see these that summer. I remember that we would lay out and look for satellites, and we were successful several times. We were not all excited about the satellites. I am sure a shooting star would have been more exciting. We certainly didn&#39;t think we had seen a UFO. We just figured they were &#34;three-star satellites&#34; (that&#39;s what I called them) orbiting the earth. But, satellites don&#39;t speed up and slow down, and as far as I know satellites don&#39;t come in sets of three that move synchronously about at various speeds across the night sky. In retrospect, If it were indeed a satellite, then it would have had to be miles wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not mentioned this Black Triangle correlation to my sister. Though we have discussed the satellite sitings as adults, I have not discussed this with her in any detail within the last 10 or 15 years. It would be interesting if a third party could interview her to correlate the details of this story as I remember them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was in 3rd or 4th grade, and I know it was the end of summer, and along with other facts, this had to be in 73 or 74.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking home alone to my apartment building around 9 pm going around the side of the building where I would enter the rear.  Our apartment building was next to a large area which had been graded for a new apartment complex, but there were some woods seperating our building from this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became aware of something behind me.  I don&#39;t know if I heard anything, or saw anything to make me turn around.  An oval object about 20 feet in diameter was hovering above the trees near me.  It seemed to be bathed in an orange light.  I couldn&#39;t make out any details on the surface of it, except an orange light, and there seemed to be brighter lights within it which could have been portals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved away from me deeper into the woods/new apartments site.  I walked along a path i knew trying to pursue it till I reached a clearing, when I noticed other people around me.  I can only remember my brother as one of them, and the others were neighbors who were looking at the same thing I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted it far off on the other side of the construction site.  It seemed to be doing some kind of manuevers, slowly rotating, or changing colors or something, hard to remember.  It then just went down, and I didn&#39;t see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of information elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was ten years old. It was just starting to get dark.  The street was a country-type road at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed an object in the sky and stopped our vehicle and actually got out of the car as did the people in the car in front of and behind ours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all stared up at a circular disk hovering at tree top level.  It was about the size of a station wagon.  It was silver with different colored lights around the perimeter.  It hovered there not making a sound for a few minutes while we watched standing by the sides of our cars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then just zoomed off at tree top level with a whooshing sound at a very fast, steady speed and disappeared quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t say a word to the other people watching (which seems odd in retrospect) and got in our car and attempted to follow it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We actually spotted it again about a mile up the road as it once again zoomed off from a hovering stance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never forgot the experience and ! have talked about it for years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Very silver and shiny metal surface.  I would only have been about 9 years old. I drew a picture and it was given to the police at the time by my parents.  I was passing in a school bus and saw it very low (maybe a few feet about the ground level) and stationary above a field where the hay had been cut.  I cannot remember very clearly as I was so young and wondered if others had seen it.  I remember trying to tell a friend on the bus to look but couldn&#39;t attract their attention quickly enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was awakened from bed by  bright lights and low rumbling noise.  I looked out my window and saw a craft hovering just above the trees moving at a slow pace.  It seemed to be more than 100&#39; in length and 50 wide.  Bright running lights on edges as well as underneath.  It had a flat bottom.  It moved a at a steady pace across my front yard above the trees and then soon disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
