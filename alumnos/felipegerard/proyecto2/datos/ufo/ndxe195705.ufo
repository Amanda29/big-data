It was jumping up and down 3 or 4 times a second and flashing at the same rate. It was moving very slowly SW over the swamp towards the edge of Round lake. Very suddenly it jumped up 6 or 8 feet and turned a bright orange still jumping and flashing as before. At this time I grabbed my sister and told her to look at this, ((name deleted)), it just changed colors, what is it. She said it was a kite and I said no it&#39;s in the swamp. Who is going to fly a kite in the swamp! Just then it jumped up another 6 or 8 feet and changed to a hot rose pink color still jumping and flashing and still moving slowly SW, now over land and into the large trees that lined the lake. It went in between trees but kept it&#39;s SW direction untill it was lost from sight into the heavy forest. I would estimate the size of the object as 5 feet high and perhaps 3 feet wide. It was a clear bright day with a light easterly breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Also, Rhinebeck, NY, I believe, is the site of an airport, where numerous antique aircraft are based.  However, the description the witness provides does not seem compatible with the sighting of any type of conventional aircraft, and in 1957, aircraft could not change their color.  PD))<n>

5/1/57 12:00|Canton|OH|Cigar|3 minutes|Cigar shaped object is motionless for more than a minute, then moves west at incomprhensible speed, then out of sight.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36535.html|3|ndxe195705| Cigar shaped object is motionless for more than a minute, then moves west at incomprhensible speed, then out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the eighth grade and walking home from school to have lunch when almost directly in front of me and above (about where I&#39;d expect to see a plane flying) appeared a stationary oval or cigar shaped object, silver in color. I was looking south, and the Akron/Canton airport was behind me to the north. At first I thought it must be an aircraft flying directly at me and only appeared stationary, but the shape of the object was not correct for this. My guess was that it may have been a mile distant and approximately 30 degrees up. The weather was sunny and bright with white fluffy clouds, but the blue sky was exceptionally clear. Frustrated that I could not determine what it was, I remember running toward it to get closer, but the bouncing of my eyes interfered with my vision, so I stopped and watched while standing still so I might determine some movement. There was none, and then suddenly it moved to the west (my right) at an incredible speed, much too fast for anything I had ever seen. It went behind a cloud and never reappeared from the other side. Immediately following the incident, I continued home for lunch and told my mother what I had just seen. I knew she wouldn&#39;t think I was making it up, but I doubt she agreed with me that it was a UFO. Except for the speed, I&#39;m not sure I would have thought it was a UFO. For years I pretty much kept this information to myself, thinking a rational explanation would emerge, but I&#39;m 60 years old now, and the only things that sound similar to what I saw are the descriptions of UFO sightings by others. Now, 47 years later, I can say I have not seen anything since that even faintly made me think I was seeing a UFO, yet I can still remember clearly the details of what I saw that day. I cannot, however, say exactly what day that was since I never mentally recorded it, so the date is a guess based on my situation at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
