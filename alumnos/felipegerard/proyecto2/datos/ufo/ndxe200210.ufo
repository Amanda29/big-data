It seemed to hover for about five minutes.  It was hazy out &amp; the lights appeared to fade back up through the haze after a few minutes.  Assumed haze was normal, but on the MD side of the Potomac River (that seperates WV &amp; MD in that area) was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I thought the red dot in the center might have been a plane, as the triangular lights appeared to move and rotate in synch, but I remember the red dot moving seperately.  The craft was at least as large as described in the picture, as it appeared over the town of Shepherdstown, WV while I was about a mile away from where it would have been hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a randon side note, there is a Government Wildlife Area that is fenced off, but does have an above ground facility (can&#39;t remember the name off hand).  When I just tried to find it on MapQuest, there is no reference to it. People in Shepherdstown report black helicopters and SUVs frequently, especially on 9-11-01.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I happened to glance upwards and saw lights in a v-shape moving from west to east slowly. I yelled at my wife to look. As we watched, the ufo came to a complete stop about 2 or 3 miles away and pivoted about 150 degrees on its front light. The ufo then took off at an extremely high rate of speed, disappearing in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

10/31/02 07:45|Seattle|WA|Light|five minuets|Small bright light around north face of Mt.

Rainier in clear view. I noticed a bright light against the mid-protion of the mopuntain (north face) that did not appear to move. I thought that it might be a plane coming in to Sea Tac with the sun reflecting off of it but when I look at it again it was still in the same place. A minute later, when my view was restored, the object moved to the west side of the mountain and, I think, at a lower altitude. After that, the object moved further west and then I lost view of it as it, from what I could perceive, moved to the south. Before I left to go to work, morning broadcaster report on KUOW (94.9)mentioned that a man called in the station to report a strange light in the Cascades. Traffic reporter could not confirm. Sighting repeated twice. Time of airing was between 07:10 and 07:35.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous, but we believe he is the same party who telephoned the NUFORC Hotline about this sighting.

Rainier (viewed on I-5 S in Seattle)on October 31. I do prefer to remain anonymous, however, I want to confirm with you thatI was not the person you suggested may have contacted NUFORC that day with a similar report. I only submitted my observation via e-mail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

We saw a orange ball that stretched out. We thought it was an airplane but when we saw more coming we knew they could not be airplanes. The crafts hovered for about 5 minutes, then they started decending together from 2 diffrent directions. thats all I saw because the bus came.<n>

When I went to the window, I heard wind gusts and saw lights. I thought it was a helicopter, so I ran outside to see. When I went outside, I looked up and was surprized to see a large trianglar shape hovering over my house. As soon as I ran outside, the triangle made a loud &#34;bleep&#34; sound and took off, unnaturally fast. And that was it.<n>

I was casually looking at orions belt in my backyard at 11:37 pm in boynton beach FLA.  Conditions were very clear, Orions belt was low, ~18 degrees above the horizon,quiet, relatively dark.  I have a relatively open view of the horizon looking East but north and south are restricted a bit, I was looking east. I am about 1.1 miles east of the Atlantic ocean.  I was about half way there at a 15 degree angle, trigonometry says I was ~half a mile away from a slow constant moving object~180 mph heading north to south (simular to the one videoed in Arizona in the late nineties) catches my eye (probaly 3 degrees below orions belt).  Boomerang or wing-like with definantly no tail(NOT A B-2),large ~wing span 120 ft or larger, width ~25 ft, nose to tail ~60 feet.   At the tips the wings were 25 ft horizontally wide and seemed to gain slight girth in the center behind the wings.9-11 large ovular lights on outer edges.  3 on the front of each wing, 1 on &#34;nose&#34;, 1 on each back of wing. Most Shocking,No noise at all!  Too low to not make a noise, flying less then 4000ft.  If there was a noise to here I would have heard it.  Overall I saw the object for 7-8 seconds.  Unfortunantly, between being stunned and not having time, I have no hard evidence.<n>

It occupied perhaps a 45 degree section of the sky giving the impression is not far above the tree tops. It&#39;s shape was very similar to the steal bomber, and living not terribly far from Whiteman airforce base I assumed that it was. Even the fact that we could hear no sound from it did not dissuade me from that thought. It wasn&#39;t until it passed between us and a bright star that I was in doubt. The star could be seen through the object. It moved very slowly across the sky and I had the opportunity to see it pass across several stars which showed through the body of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.

I Had picked up my load north of San Francisco and was heading to Nashville, TN for delivery.  Crossing into Arizona at some point I believe around 9:30 to 10:00 I noticed a huge ball of light fall straight out of the sky toward the ground.  I was on my cell phone to my father when it appeared and he shared my experience as did several other vehicals that passed by.  I thought it was the end me and everyone as this huge Ball with an orange and yellow trail streaked toward the earth.  It was huge!  If it was a meteor it would have surely been a global killer. It stoped before it smashed into the ground.  I was in shock and my father a 30 year Naval Officer listened as I described what I saw.  I stoped the truck parked and started walking toward the object describing what I was seeing to my father: it appeared as a blue perfectly round sphear.  Suddenly it seemed to cloak itself blending perfectly into the horizon and desert background.  Suddenly there was what appeared to be a bolt of lightning emiting straight up toward the sky from the cloaked object -- that streak stayed for what seemed like several minuets.  Finally, a perfect image of a large Blue Whale materialized and seemed to levetate in mid-air.  It was at this point that my father told me to go back to the truck and try to confirm what I had seen with other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness, and we found him to be quite credible.

Slow moving.  As it passed between me and the stars (very clear night) I noted that it obscured stars from view.  Spook-Alley beacons were aiming directly in its direction and didn&#39;t reach high enough to illuminate it at all.  It appeared as light reflected off its forward edge (but an edge designed not to reflect light). It may have come to a point or been a gigantic disc. If it was travelling at a high enough altitude to be out of the reach of the searchlights it was massive.  It may have not been affected as searchlights shined on it and been at a lower altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates a time of &#34;21:65.&#34;  We have changed the time to 21:30, which is an estimate.

The point of the cross was close to the left tip making it look like a backwards y. Under it a strip the enitre length of the wing was something. Thier was no tail or wing lights. It was fly so low that my flash light could hit it. Which I did and that is when i saw the strip on it&#39;s belly/Wing. The sound was a low pitch hum. sort of oscillating but not load.<n>

10/30/02 18:20|Santa Barbara|CA|Triangle|4 seconds|I observed three pale white lights spaced equalaterally rapidly moving in the the sky from east to west above Santa Barbara California|11/4/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25932.html|14|ndxe200210| I observed three pale white lights spaced equalaterally rapidly moving in the the sky from east to west above Santa Barbara California<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Santa Barbara, California at 6:20pm on Wednesday, October 30th, 2002 I observed three white lights, spaced equilaterally to each other, traveling at what seemed to be high speed, passing from east to west over the city across about 70 degrees of arc for about three to four seconds until they faded from view into the darkness. There was no sound. I was standing outside my apartment looking up at the night sky while the nearby football field lights illuminated and suffused the sky making it difficult to make out if there were a dense body between the lights. At first I assumed it was a single triangular craft, but upon reflection, I realize it  could have been three separate objects flying in formation. However the lights appeared to be disc-shaped and flat with a pale white glow to them more consistent with lights that might be built into the underside of a single craft. There were no usual red or green navigational lights or strobes at all. This group of three white lights would just fit behind my thumbnail held at arm&#39;s length or slightly larger. They seemed to slip through the air silently without reguard to their relative positioning along their lateral axis and were far off the normal flight paths of either high altitude passenger jets or of local air traffic. The spacing of the lights remained consistent throughout the viewing. I do not know if anyone else in Santa Barbara saw this. I have been watching for UFOs for over ten years and this is only the second one I have seen that qualifies as unexplained. Its only speculation, but I would say it could be very similar to the many sightings of triangular craft (minus the central red light) that have been witnessed increasingly since the Belgian triangle flap several years ago.<n>

Realizing it was extremely windy that morning, and that the craft would have been awfully low for even a blimp in our area, I sat and stared at it. It was in a large bluish gray cloud, and it was a dark grey in color itself. It traveled slowley, against the wind , coming toward my direction. It stopped, then moved in a downward motion toward the south, stopped and moved back to its origonal position, moved north, and then actually faded out of sight. This appeared over a local farm in my area, over a barn with silos. It happened less than a 1/4 mile from my position. Even though it appeared in a cloud, it was very distinguishable and formed.<n>

They hung in the sky in a vertical line and the one at the bottom was veering off to the right in a very slow motion.  The other three (on top) were not moving at all except that they were twinkling like crazy. I really have to stress how bright these objects were. They looked like little balls of orange glitter being hit with a very bright sun. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it--nothing that bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched these objects for maybe 60 seconds before I ran into the house to awaken my husband. I didn&#39;t even think to grab the video camera which is just as well because by the time we got out there, they were gone.  I ran out into our street in hopes of seeing them from a different angle but I saw nothing. They were gone that quick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I wanted to at least share what I saw because maybe someone out there saw them too.<n>
10/30/02 01:00|San Diego|TX||2 minutes|San Diego CA Marine Air Base Ball of Light|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73622.html|22|ndxe200210| San Diego CA Marine Air Base Ball of Light<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Marine veteran and I have decided to tell my story about a sighting that I experienced while working on security forces after the attack on 9/11.  My job in the Marines was TMO 3112. After the attacks on our nation I was detached from my unit and attached to PMO security forces.  I worked the graveyard shift from 1700-0600.  I was stationed at Marine Corps Air Station, Miramar, San Diego, CA.   The evening of my sighting I was placed on duty, alone, to guard a gate on the flight-line.  I can’t remember the exact gate number, I believe it was 15, but I do know that it was at the north end where the c-130s were parked.  I had been on Security forces for awhile and I had a routine way of keeping myself alert and awake.  It is a severely punishable offence to fall asleep on post. I would take caffeine pills throughout the night and practice drill movements if I felt myself getting tired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular evening I was very alert.  It was particularly cold that night, and being alone on post made me very aware of my surroundings.  The small shack that was my post was not heated, so I would frequently leave the shack and walk the small perimeter of the flight-line that was my post.   On the last of these walks I left my shack and began walking the flight-line.  Something above caught my eye.  As I reverted my gaze upward, I was astonished to see small, bright, circular, orb hovering about 200 yards above the flight-deck.  The object was no bigger than the circumference of my body. I am a female and I stand at about 65 inches.  In a flash, it shot down and hovered inches above the flight deck. It hovered there for a few moments, and then just as quickly as it came down, it shot back up into the night sky, and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unsure of how to go about reporting it.  I logged the sighting in my log book and radioed it in to my command post.  I was almost immediately relieved of my duty at that post, by a Staff NCO.  I was told that I was tired and needed to go home and get some rest, and to report back for duty the following evening.  Now that I have fully performed my contract with the Marine Corps I feel that it is time to tell people other than close friends and family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see little green men, or a flying saucer.  I saw what I believe was an unmanned recording device.  I have no reason to lie about what I saw and know that what I saw was real, and I hope that with this report maybe another Marine who was guarding another post on the flight-line that night will come forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is 2002 is approximate.

The relative size spanned the field of view of my thumb held at arms length (wingtip span same as length of thumb, forward to aft span same as width of thumb). The object brightness was approximately the same as average brightness of Pleiades. The dimness of the object prevented me from focusing on it to observe any detail. The sky was dark with closest street lights more than 100 yards away. There was no interfering noise such as traffic or aircraft. It was dead quiet as the object passed directly overhead from East-South-East to West-North-West. The object traversed a straight line at uniform speed and dissappeared out of sight 10 degrees above the horizon within 10 to 15 seconds from the time I first spotted it. I observed the object through approximately 100 angular degrees of the sky. The object moved into my field of view as I was observing Pleiades and thinking to myself about how clear the sky was and how well my vision was working that evening. I would not have noticed it otherwise. At first I thought it was a satellite but it was moving too fast and was too large. I was walking with my wife and when I said &#34;Look at that!&#34; she caught view of it immediately. All her impressions of the object agreed with mine. I cannot say what the alitiude of the object was but if it was at relatively low altitude (1000&#39;s of feet) then it was moving fast enough to break the sound barrier and if it was at satellite altitude then it would have to have been several miles wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a college-trained professional in a technical field.

I am a pilot and my wife and I had just returned from a flight. I heard the sound of a helicopter near by and looked up the check the type and location of this aircraft when I spotted a brilliant white egg shaped craft traveling at a high rate of speed going from east to west. I would guess the altitude to be at or about 5,000 feet. There was no sound associated with the passage of this craft and I would guess the speed to be just barely below the speed of sound. Shortly after the passage of this craft the sky was filled with white plastic threads, some of which were clumped together. Most of this material disintegrated upon contact with the ground.

I couldn&#39;t go back to sleep, I didn&#39;t even try. I was sitting at the computer about 15-20 minutes later when I heard something outside that I have never heard before. It sounded like a very slow moving propeller (almost what you would expect a boomerang in slow motion to sound like). There were other noises accompanied by the propeller sound one was a steady humming (vibrating) noise and the other was a static-electricity sound (like an electrical zapping sound) that was louder than the humming but not as loud as the propeller sound. The electrical zapping sound could be compared to a soft buzzing sound. The sound seemed to come from the northwest and moved off toward the northeast. After hearing the sound I scolded myself for not having gone outside to look. I realized though that the sound almost mesmerized me, and I didn&#39;t move the whole time I heard it. It sounded like it was right outside my window, directly above my house. It seemed to be hovering directly above for 30 seconds. Between the propeller sounds which were louder than the other sounds there was a 3-4 second gap which is how I heard the humming/vibrating noise and the occasional zaps/buzzes. I&#39;m certain this was not a helicopter, or anything I&#39;ve ever heard before.<n>

It seemed to come straight down, it was a very bright object and the trail behind it was a yellowish, orange with multi colors. It looked like it was going to hit the ground, but then it flashed , like a camera flash, and then there was nothing, no sound, no smoke , nothing. I was stunned by what I had seen. There were no reports of anything falling from the sky on the news. I still wonder what it was.<n>

It was whitish in color and very pronounced, raised up high on the skin. It started at the right side of her naval and curved down over her ovaries. There was no redness to speak of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She came into my room pointing at her abdomen at 7:00 a.m. and asked, &#34;mommy what&#39;s this?&#34; I looked at it and gasped, how did that happen?  She said, &#34;I don&#39;t know I just woke up with it.&#34;  I ran my finger over it and there was a substantial raising of the skin...sort of like the scar I had from my C-section years ago. I asked her if one of the animals had scratched her and she said no.  She said it wasn&#39;t there when she took her bath the night before.  I got my camera to photograph it but it jammed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When she got home from school yesterday I looked at it again and it was almost gone, her skin was smooth again, and there was only a faint red line.  Lastnight when I tucked her into bed I checked it one more time and that is when she told me of a recurring dream she keeps having of some really scary people surrounding her bed at night. She said they come every winter.  This is the first I&#39;ve heard of this dream.  I&#39;m quite worried and need to speak with someone but I don&#39;t know who. There&#39;s much more I need to tell you but don&#39;t know how private this method of contact is.  Would you please call me?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have attempted to contact the individual, but have not received a return call, yet.  PD))<n>

It flew from the south in a northern direction, directly over our heads.  It flew silently, lower and faster than any airplane normally would, and slower and longer than any shooting star I&#39;v ever witnessed.  It also traveled in a straight trajectory.  It was bright white in color with a slight blue tint and a tail behind it (maybe 4 times its own diameter).  I have never seen anything like it.

Strange energy field emitted, making it difficult to see clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date: 10/27/2002 Time: 17:00 Weather Conditions: Clear late afternoon, no breeze Temperature: 60-65º F Location: Lower East Side of Santa Barbara, CA Number of Witnesses: 3 Description of Event: Three of us were taking a break from work on a Sunday evening outside of our software development company.  I noticed something reflecting in the sky that hadn&#39;t moved in the last 30 seconds.  I have spotted many satellites in our skies but this was different, due to the intensity of the reflection and the time of day.  It was 30 + minutes from sunset, the time that satellites are spotted in our skies.  Also, unlike satellites, it was oscillating between reflections, as if it were spinning.  This struck me as strange and highly unusual for skies.  Something else of note is that we had all just commented on how much &#34;activity&#34; was in the sky.  Not vehicular, but almost as if the sky were alight with an energy that was beyond the usual intensity.  It had almost a vibration to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called to my co-workers to have a look.  It took a moment for them to spot it and once they did, they too commented on the strangeness of its pattern.  I had a pair of 20x binoculars in the car so I grabbed them.  I fixed on a stable surface and peered into the bright blue sky.  What I say was the unexpected.  It was a disc angled in such a way as I could see the bottom as well as a good deal of the top.  To best describe it, it looks very much like the typical &#34;UFO&#34; that has been depicted many times, by many people.  The Disk had a slight warble to it and it stayed in a fixed position.  There were dark spots around the upper half; they looked like what would be windows or some form of exterior ventilation.  I described what I saw and the others decided to have a look.  As a little background, I have extraordinary vision.  It has been rated at 40/20.  In other words, I see at 40 feet what most see at 20.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They stared with amazement.  Though they couldn&#39;t see the full clarity as I could, they could make out exactly what I was seeing.  We continued to take turns looking at it with the naked eye and through the binoculars.  As the minutes passed, the previously mentioned phenomenon of the increased energy in the sky began to grow stronger.  It was almost as if the color of the sky intensified significantly.  It became increasingly difficult to focus on the portion of the sky that the UFO was located.  We had to avert our eyes many times due to the power emitted.  Then, all of a sudden, it was gone.  There wasn&#39;t a trace.  The sky also resumed its normal brilliance though to our eyes everything took on a glummer hue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This may not be the most fantastic form of a tale but it really did happen.  After that, the three of us shared a couple of stories of previous encounters, or at the very least, we thought them to be encounters.  To this day, we talk about the strangeness of the event.  Was it some form of US military operation with a new high tech tool, or was it in fact what we really think it to be.  We may never know, but we figured we would share it, in the event others saw it too.<n>

I stopped in my tracks and just stared...I did not know what to make of this and I continued to where I was going.

I looked up and saw a low flying triangular shaped craft. The color being white. I called for my Daughter to come out and witness this strange craft. I did not believe this to be an ultralight craft as it was too large and too loud. There were no apparent windows or a cockpit. There was no apparent landing gear or propellers. It left no contrail. The sky was bright blue with few high thin clouds, none of which were above the said craft. The craft was moving fairly slow coming from the west and heading east. Less than one minute after the craft passed over my house a military helicopter followed the same exact flight path but was moving fast. I thought this might have been some sort of military drone but have yet to find any examples that fit the exact shape of the craft we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Might have been a VariViggen experimental aircraft, but that is a guess.

I was on Fanshaw Park Road, heading west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw to the left of me, off the main road and in a sub-division known in London as Richmond Hill, a strange object. I saw a series of 3 lights in a triangular formation. I thought at the time, it was the lights from a radio tower but I never remembered seeing one there before. (I drove by this area for many years.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> What struck me as rather odd was how low this formation was and the absence of sound.  It seemed to be about 40 feet above the road (over double the height of a hydro pole).  Then I thought maybe it was a helicopter hovering over this area...but again, no sound.  Plus it was very steady, whereas a helicopter tends to hover and shift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember nearly getting into a car accident because I slowed down and was trying to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately the traffic was too heavy for me to turn around to check it out more thoroughly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, I drove by the area and there was no radio tower...so I realized that this must have been an ufo sighting. The fact that it was low to the ground, the light was white and rather bright at the bottom of the ship caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, it was dark above so I couldn&#39;t see the top of it, but I believe there were 3 lights coming from the bottom.  I think there may have been a fourth light but it was red, which is why I must have assumed it was a radio tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I was traveling a good speed at the time so that detail was a bit hazy.  Plus it happened 2 1/2 years ago. I&#39;m sure I wrote this down in my journal.  But I&#39;m currently not living in Canada so I can&#39;t verify the details or the exact date.  I do remember the month because it was still warm enough to drive with the window down, which is why I found it so odd that there wasn&#39;t any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The object caught my eye because it was like a redish orange color and it seemed to move as if it was hovering and didn&#39;t appear to be a plane. The object moved back and forth many times. I have seen strange lights in the sky before along the same beach and that is why I have decided to post this sighting. I looked in the paper the next day but didn&#39;t see any reports although I would think that the people on the Sterling Casino boat would have seen the lights as the boat seemed to be realitivly close to the them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A plane was in the vicinity, and was leaving a smoke trail.  The Object flashed, and the plane made a dramatic S turn and began to chase the object.  The object disappeared, then reappeard a good distance to the right of the location it was first seen.  The jet continued to trail.  The light vanished again, only to reappear behind the plane, then vanish and reappear again quite a ways in front of the plane and it&#39;s second to last location.  The light climbed into the atmosphere and the jet continued to trail, with both shortly leaving sight.  I went back outside at fifteen minutes later and noticed two small objects in the vicinity of the starting point of our initial sighting.  They seemed to hover a small distance away from each other, and slowly floated upwords.  The first one climbed to high to be visible.  At that time the lower one stopped, seemed to float back down at a 180 degree direction, the headed back towards where the first one disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began a group called the Northern New York Paranormal Research Society.  I have been investigating many occurences like this, and this was the oddest I have seen.  I have not been able to contact any Air Force bases, or Fort Drum, which is in the direction that we witnessed the objects.<n>

We work on the State Campus which is located southeast of the Albany International Airport but within aircraft takeoff and landing patterns.  We were checking out the sky, discussing how unusual it looked with the different kinds of clouds.  Suddenly from the west we notice something bulleting across the sky.  It had a very narrow vapor trail which was so thin that I briefly thought if the puffy clouds were cotton balls it would pull them together like thread. It was also strange in the fact that the trail failed to scallop like the vapor trails of the jets we saw only moments before. The object made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it shot more to the northeast it was going to be blocked by the corner of my building.  I went down the steps just in time to catch a glimpse of the object.  It appeared to be football in shape only a bit longer and slightly deflated, with at least one fin on the top and bottom.  Its color looked dark metallic gray.  The air around it was a bit funny; gave the appearance it was traveling in a fuzzy bubble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the military has been active in our area since 9/11, I thought maybe it was something new they were flying so I didn&#39;t report the sighting.  I missed the orginal FOX report but my co-worker told me about it the next day.  When I didn&#39;t see any followup a week later I wrote FOX email info line to make an inquiry and report that we had seen the object.  To date, I haven&#39;t heard anything from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I work in a civilian capacity now, my background is law enforcement.  I was a police/peace officer/investigator for 25 years prior to my current appointment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The object photographed by the FOX 23 cameraman was visible for approximately 11 frames of video, or about one-third of a second.  We would be surprised if people witnessed the same object with the naked eye, although the object may have slowed at some point during its presence in the airspace over Albany, NY.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your quick response.  While my report stays the same in every other detail, I failed to check a calender when submiting the date of our sighting and it wasn&#39;t the 20th.  My co-worker and I work Monday-Friday.  Ours took place during  the week, the day of the evening report of the Oct 20 object by FOX to the public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do know that for sure as my co-worker came in the next day all excited because he had heard the report of the original object on the news the night before.  He said that FOX had done a report on the object we saw (last time I listen to him).  I didn&#39;t see the broadcast and couldn&#39;t  find anything on it until I found your site yesterday (I was using the wrong search word on FOX).  I apologize for this inaccuracy. However, it does not change the facts that I have otherwise reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You asked if the object made any maneuvers while we watched it.  No.  It was the vapor trail that first drew our attention to the object shooting like a bullet across the sky.  It wasn&#39;t until I ran down the steps and the object changed directions (from traveling due east to NE) that I was finally able to briefly get the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since we couldn&#39;t really see it before and I now could, I had the impression  that it tipped a little and  I was looking more towards the top of the object rather than the side.  It was just so fast I only got a glimpse.  The whole experience was almost surreal in that something that big should have made some sort of a sound but didn&#39;t.  Yet the vapor trail and its funny, fuzzy bubble around it told me it was really high up and something &#34;different&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been thinking about its vapor trail and the way jet vapor trails look.  This object appeared to be more seering the atmosphere than putting out exhaust..<n> <n><n> <n><n> You ask if what I saw was like what the reporter filmed.  His object appears to look more like a walking stick.  Ours was a bit fatter and the fins a bit broader.  It looked as though the reporter&#39;s object devoured half of itself, just that much fatter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ever since 9/11 when the hijacked plane turned right over us we have been sky watchers.  I have a window seat at work and  can tell when something is going on at the airport, note the flight pattern changes and every type of plane that takes off and lands, including the military.  ((Sentence deleted.)).  This was something I had never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I am following your instructions correctly on the degrees, it would be about 200 (coming from the W to NE).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I appreciate your taking the personal info out of my narrative, as I know my ((deleted)) and my supervisor would not appreciate the FBI coming to see me.  I work for ((deleted)) and we always have enough of things happening in the building without my causing a commotion over something like this.  My ((deleted)) would ((deleted)) me...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, please forgive me for not doing a more thorough job in determing the accurate  date.  I am usually better than that..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

The “apparent” size was about the size a dinner plate would appear if you held it out at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was strange was that our binoculars couldn’t focus on any of them. All we got was fuzzy light when the binoculars were aimed on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of minutes, the group slowly started off toward the west, the direction of the ocean. As it got further away, a V shape took place of the objects, like a flock of ducks would form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But here’s the peculiar thing. When the formation was quite a ways away, the binoculars could focus in a little better... and I would swear the objects now resembled creatures with wings flapping slowly... almost like winged dragons...<n> <n><n> <n><n> .and I felt our minds were being played with. And the formation  simply moved out of sight...slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Sitting in my backyard having a cigarette.  Fairly clear night but it did cloud over after the sighting.  Glanced to the north and saw a bright light shoot straight down. Looked odd.  It coud have just been a really huge shooting star.  But I don&#39;t think it was. It looked liked a big bright white headlight of a car but it was in the sky and it did not have a tail like a meterorite.  Plus it was quite big and it looked to be at a low attitude. Much bigger than a shooting star. About the size of a small pea in the night sky.  Moved very fast - disappeared from view behind nieghbours rooftop.  From my vantage point the light appered to be falling straight down but it might have been shooting across the sky in a northerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don&#39;t know what it was.  Just saw it for a second. I thought that I would post this just in case anyone else saw something more that night as well.<n>

From the east appeared two lights spaced from eachother. At first i thought maybe it was two planes flying next to eachother as it got closer the object looked like a giant submarine it then turned north. I went north filled with curiosity about this object and turned right on some road in a comercial area eventualy the object was directly above. Other cars in the area were all driving slow and gazing on up at the sky. I then found the object getting closer and closer above me i looked up and the object was giant probably around 300 yards it was all i could see above me naturaly this is when my fear set in. I then turned a u turned and the object continued north. During this whole event i heard a deep low frequency rumbling noise. After the object left my site i returned home and called my friend. The next day went by and we decided to go out and look for it again. We went out a little later then i had the night before and we saw lights off in the west. Shooting from one area to another with great speed. He then became very excited we drove around the area for two hours but failed to see anything else besides that first initial light. We will be back tomorrow night around the same time with a camera to see what we can. This is the weirdest and possibly the most terrifying/exciting event of my life.<n>

I had spent more time out in the woods than I had planned on, and the sun had already set as I made my way back to my Jeep, when I noticed a bright light in the sky moving in my direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was just an airplane and thought nothing of it. But then it suddenly stopped moving and began to pulsate, getting brighter and then fainter.  I noticed at this time that there appeared to be a slight haze surrounding the object. The pulsating increased in tempo until the object was flickering at a very rapid rate, when suddenly, a bright beam of light shot down from the bottom of the object to the ground below.  This was no searchlight.  Even a well focused searchlight tends to diffuse with distance, but this light was a tight, bright beam from top to bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As suddenly as the pulsating began, it stopped, and the beam also turned off.  The object just sat there motionless in the sky.  My Jeep was only about 100 yards away when all this happened, so I ran to it to get my camera.  I took a picture of the object as it hovered, and as I got ready to take another picture the object it began moving around slowly in a tight circle.  I took another picture, but before I could take a third, it suddenly shot straight up in the air at fantastic speed and was gone from sight! I&#39;ll attach the two pictures I got to an email message and send them in.  I cropped them down a bit to reduce the file size.  I don&#39;t know what this thing was, but I know I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before!<n>

I pulled off the highway several times on my way home just to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing things.  I have seen these bright yellow, white, and whiteish blue lights several times. They are the first to appear at dusk and the last to leave at dawn(if they don&#39;t leave before then) These lights hover in the sky for seems like hours or they bob around and zip back and forth and up and down.  They (the lights I&#39;ve seen) get brighter and dimmer and some fade away and come back in a different place but same general area of the sky,and some fade awayand never come back, and some fade away while dashing behind mtn. range.  Its crazy and really freaking me out.  Last night was the first time that I saw two of them following me.  All the way home!!!   The one in front would speed up so fast it was incredible.  Then I would stop, and they would too.  I shined my radar detector at the one along side/in front of me, and it quickly faded out.  Just to come back about 30 seconds later.

It seems presumptuous to pose the question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was most likely a meteorite or space junk, but it was the largest and brightest I&#39;ve ever seen.  Unfortunately I did not have a clear view of it. The sky was covered with thin clouds and the moon was visible through holes in the clouds to the southeast.  The object crossed the sky quickly (like a shooting star) over the course of about 5 seconds, moving from South to Southwest at about 40-45 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the clouds I could not directly see the object, but through the clouds a bright trail was briefly visible, the width of which was the size of a silver dollar held at arms length.  Its likely the clouds diffused the light somewhat, but that the trail was visible at all with the cloud cover is notable.  It seemed as if the object was either very large or passing close to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were at a bonfire party and a friend and I both saw it.  Other&#39;s were present, but not looking in the correct direction at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coincidentally, several people present at the part (including myself and my wife) got violently ill the next day.  I say coincidentally because it had all the symptoms of a stomach flu bug. My wife got very sick and vomitted throughout Saturday night as did the friend who hosted the party.  I experienced stomach cramps and terrible diahrea but no vomitting.  Again, this seems coincidental and most likely caused by other factors- like the Chili my wife sampled at the party (though I had nothing to eat).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m providing these details mainly to collaborate any other reports of strange objects in the vacinity that you might have received.<n>

10/18/02 05:30|Kotzebue|AK|Disk|10 sec|Saucer shaped aircraft taking off. Unbelievable acceleration. A bluish neon round light (glow) underneath the aircraft.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63577.html|93|ndxe200210| Saucer shaped aircraft taking off. Unbelievable acceleration. A bluish neon round light (glow) underneath the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not aware there was a site like this or I would have reported this earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working the night shift in Kotzebue, Alaska.  I don&#39;t remember the exact date of my sighting but to the best of my recollection it was in October of 2002 at about 5:30 in the morning.  My work was such that I had to spend time outside. There was some snow on the ground, but I don&#39;t think it was more that a couple of inches. Looking out to the north of Kotzebue, I noticed a saucer shaped aircraft take off from about I would guess 1 to 3 miles north of Kotzebue. It was dark but with a partial moon I was able to discern the outline of a saucer shaped aircraft.  It took off at about an 80 to 85 degree angle. It started up relatively slowly but when it was perhaps 500 or so feet in the air, it accelerated very quickly. The whole sighting was over within 10 seconds or so.  That is how fast it was. It accelerated so quickly it was out of sight within about 10 seconds.  The interesting thing was the neon bluish round glow (plasma)that was underneath the aircraft.  Probably about a quarter the diameter of the entire saucer. I assume this was some kind of exhaust mechanism.  You would think I would have heard a noise as this aircraft took off but there was no noise. Complete silence. Again a very unusual neon bluish light, plasma (glow) underneath the aircraft which I assume was some kind of exhaust mechanism or what propelled the aircraft. After I saw this I called the police station in Kotzebue and asked if they had also seen something.  No, he said that he had not seen anything.  I think they had only one patrolman on duty as Kotzebue is a very small town and he was probably watching TV.  When my boss came in at 8:00 that morning I also told him what I saw.  He had been in Alaska several years and said other sightings had been made in Alaska over the years. Now that I look back I wish that I had gone north of Kotzebue and looked for any signs that the aircraft may have left in the snow.  I also wish I had called the air force down in Anchorage or Fairbanks to see if they had seen anything on their radar b! ut I did n&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I can say is this really happened.  I never really gave much thought to UFOs before this incident as I didn&#39;t believe in them.  But this one incident changed my views completely. I now know without a doubt that there are aliens visiting our planet and they are far superior to us technologically. Again, the speed of this saucer was unbelievable. And whatever they are using to propell their spacecraft is not like anything we have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The Space Shuttle, Atlantis, had undocked from the Space Station, and the Shuttle was several minutes ahead of the Station, preparing to return to Cape Kennedy on the following day (October 18, 2002).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stood, scanning the evening sky to the west, searching for the Space Station, both of us witnessed a peculiar object STREAKING across the sky, covering an estimated 10-15 degrees of arc (from our vantage point), traveling from our right to left, in approximately 2-3 seconds.  The object appeared to have several point sources of light on it, perhaps 3 to 5 of them, each approximately the color of a green LED, and it subtended an arc of approximately one-half a degree, i.e. equal approximately to the width of a thumbnail held at arm&#39;s length.  At just about the time both observers commented on the object&#39;s appearance, it just faded from our vision in approximately 1 second, or less.  It appeared to travel at a constant angular velocity throughout the sighting, i.e. it did not appear to slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it was just past dusk at the time, the object was not easily visible to us, except for its lights, although it appeared to have &#34;structure.&#34;  During the short time we witnessed it, the several lights on the side facing us (its port side) did not appear to change position relative to each other.  Both witnesses were left with the distinct impression that they were looking at some kind of unidentifiable, solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object&#39;s high angular velocity across the sky rules out any type of conventional aircraft.  Any aircraft moving across the sky at that angular velocity would have had to be close enough to the observers that its engine(s) would have been easily audible.  I have held a commercial pilot&#39;s license for over 25 years (flight instructor for 10 of those years), and the object was strikingly unlike anything I have ever witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We discussed whether the object might have been a fragmented meteor in the extreme distance, following its terminal burst in the lower atmospere.  However, both observers felt that what they had witnessed was not consistent with such a scenario; there appeared to be some kind of &#34;structure&#34; between the lights of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do not know what we witnessed, but it was a striking image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Submitted by Peter B. Davenport, Director, National UFO Reporting Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The second witness may submit his report at a future date.  PD))<n>

It was flying in circles in the western sky and continued in a very similar flight path for the 45 minutes that I was observing it. As this is the first time in my 54 years that I have experienced such an event I moved location to get an unrestricted view. It was flying above the slight low cloud that was in the sky, but it was quite clear to see at most positions in it&#39;s flight path. I had the impression that it was flying at quite a height above the ground notwithstanding that I observed it at only a short distance above the horizon and I felt that it was some distance away from me. There was no sound coming from the direction of this moving light in the sky, but the amazing thing was that soon after my sighting I heard aircraft flying from the direction of the Benson Air Force base in the direction of this moving light in the sky. Could it have been possible that they detected something and scrambled aircraft to investigate ? ... Wow what an experience !!! ...<n>

It straightend it self out and moved slowly in my direction with the light starting to dim. I listened for a sound like that of a helicopter or plane but their wasn&#39;t any noise at all. It moved as if it were an &#34;underwater robot probe&#34;. Then made a SHARP, perfect right turn, at this point their was another big (round) light on the back side, and you could see that thier was a black silhouett shape to it, and the light seemed to be somewhat white with hues of red flashing like a fireball but again it moved so metodically. I ran from one room th the other to see if I could catch it on the opposit side of the house when I did see it, it was still moving as if probing and I watched it with the lights and no sound move further away but the the light sort of dimmed and went out.<n>

The diameter of the head of the SS was about 10 times larger than your regular SS.  It traveled in a downward direction toward the ground although it was still very high up.  It also had a longer brighter tail than a SS.  The color can best be described as a very bright lime green light almost neon in color. It was about as long as 6 full moons lined up in a row.  This is the second time I have seen this, once about 7 days ago in the southwestern direction from Austin.  It was the same description also headed down towards the earth.  How far away it was is hard to judge but it did not appear to be in outer space, more likely in the earths atmosphere.  It was very noticeable because it was so very bright and green.  It was very bea! utiful and unusual.  What it was I have no idea though.<n>

By this I mean it was drifting to the east as the star field behind it drifted to the west. Almost low on horizon to the N.E. in rural mountain area. Object through scope appeared to flash several colors in a random order although towards the bottom and to one side there was a constant flashing of orange similar to flames or corona coming out of an exhaust. Signaled S.O.S. using a 750,000 candlepower handheld beam. At this point the entire object diminished luminosity greatly for several minutes and then went back to full random flashing. Repeated signals and the same thing happened again. Slowly another very similar object moved into the background but lower on the horizon. After going back home (about a mile away) the individual who had first called to say the object was there called me again and stated that several, 7 or 8, were in the same area and 5 of these had formed a pentagon type of shape relative to his point of view. I&#39;ve observed stars, planets, etc., for most of my 4o some years and have never seen anything like this before! Very odd.<n>

It was the way they moved, jeting back and forth kind of like they were danceing,or playing together in a small pattern. The color of these object&#39;s was kind of silver metallic,or gray. It was hard to tell because of the fact that they jeted around so fast. I would say they were about 1/2 mile up at the most,and egg shaped.And they stayed in a tight pattern. They never came to complete stop. And they were solid, could not aany lights comeing from them. You know that vegas has a lot of light and distraction, I just happen to be looking i the right area.

One of my hobbies is Astronomy so I often look up to the heavens. I&#39;ve seen the Space Station, Mir, Space Shuttles, Sky Lab and countless Satellites. This Satellite was different though. It had all the characteristics of being a Satellite, such as altitude, flying in a straight line and speed equivalent to that of a Satellite. What I though odd about this object was that is was quite dim, which made it hard to visually track. I wondered why, being it was so high in the sky, didn&#39;t reflect the sun off of it? It most definitely had the altitude for the reflection. I kept watching it for about 12 seconds and then it did something I have never in my life seen a Satellite, or anything else do, it made a U-turn, angled itself upward at about a 40 degree angle, maintained it&#39;s speed for 4 more seconds and then it accelerated to a speed I don&#39;t think you could put in miles-per-hour. All I saw was a streak leave the area where it was cruising at the speed of a Satellite. Get&#39;s you to thinking, doesn&#39;t it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the estimate of the direction is correct, the object traveling to the northwest could not have been a satellite.

I thought it was a satilight at first because of it apparent high altitude and it straight track. As We lost the light in the haze about ten degrees above the horizon, it suddenly reversed its direction and traveled back to the portion of the sky where it was first observed. It them became stationary for abut three minutes and then would make short jumps at high speed in what apeared to be random directions. These jumps were aprox. three time the width of my thumb held at arms length. There was some variation this continued intill we lost sight of the object due to haze or high clouds moving in about fifteen minutes after first seeing the object. There was also commercial jet activity at altitude as well as one brief meteor burn. All were clearly different from what we observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the estimate of direction of travel is correct, the object could not have been a satellite.  Orbiting satellites almost never have a westerly component to their direction of travel.  Please see similar report from Portland, Oregon, for the same date.  PD))<n>

It was about 8:30pm and we were sitting around our campfire when I noticed two extremely bright lights coming over the mesa above us; I believe they were headed in a SW direction. The night was clear, moon and stars were visible. The two lights were extremely large, very white, not blinking, twice as big as any large planet I&#39;ve ever seen, and obviously following each other -- they maintained their distance from each other and traveled the same course. We were struck first by the size and brightness, but then by the fact that there was no sound --- we waited for any jet/commercial airline sounds to catch up to the visual, but it never came [several commercial airlines had crossed the skies earlier]. After a couple of minutes the first one started dimming, then completely disappeared.  The second light did the same a few seconds later.  There were no clouds in the sky, and all stars around these lights were visible the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The ISS passed over New Mexico at 19:31-19:35 hrs. on this date, to the north of Albuquerque.

What caught my attention was that these were the two brightest objects in that portion of the sky. It was a very clear night with no clouds.  The moon was very bright about 45 degrees above the horizon in the Eastern sky.  It did not take me long to realize that the lights which at first appeared as bright stars, one in front of the other, were actually moving on a straight course across the sky towards the Southeast.  At first I thought the two lights might have been connected.  I ran into the house and got binoculars.  By the time I came out there was only one light directly overhead.  Through the binoculars I could vaguely see some kind of structure illuminated by the single bright light.  As I was watching through the binoculars the light gradually faded out.  I assume the same thing happened to the other light (object) while I was getting the binoculars.  Although the speed across the sky was constant and similar to that of an airplane, there was no noise and no other lights.  It&#39;s not unusual to see the flashing lights of an airplane and not hear it.  I&#39;m guessing that the objects were about 10 thousand feet elevation.  Could this have been a pair of stealth fighters going into stealth mode?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The Space Shuttle, followed by the Space Station, passed over Savannah at 20:04 hrs. on October 16, 2002.

After several seconds it moved horizontally in an exact line, at a moderatly slow pace, then hovering to a stop behind trees where I could only see silouettes of its light through the branches. I then attemped to follow the object on foot, but not seeing it asked around in some stores near a local parkway about a blimp.

The flash being brighter then any brightest star in sky (approx size 1/4th a inch in size if holding a ruler at arms length), strong enough to cast shadow as we stood scanning the sky for the Shuttle/Station. We immediately trained binoculars on the area of the sky believing it to be the shuttle/station. Then at 7:03pm observed a second flash in same location, scanning the area again with binoculars unable to see an origin of the flash. We were convinced that the flashes were the reflection of shuttle/station an were about to return indoors disapointed. Juat then at 7:05pm The Shuttle and Station appeared in the NW sky between the 9 o clock 10 o clock positon NW sky and proceeded across the sky to the SE. (Which by the way was a fantastic sight to behold). Being that both of us are star gazers and pretty familar with the skys, we are unable to explain these two flashs or their possible origin. They were both 1-3 seconds in duration, and faded out instead of winking out.<n>

We could tell that the object was flying at very high speed even from a fair distance away due to the flickering of light... The light was constant and DID NOT fade in and out... we have a digital image of this image, however, because it was taken from afar, it is a little difficult to see (unless enlarged!).<n>

By this time I alerted my mom who had no idea what it is, and noted that she did see it also. It occassionally went from a bright silver to a dull gray (maybe 4 or 5 times.) We passed some trees, the object was still there, and we still commented on it. After the next clump of trees it had dissapeard. It was more like an oval-ended rectangle shape, than anything else. The sky was clear, and behind the object there were a few Jet-Lines which was quite odd. There were a few clouds, and it was over a river. It hovered maybe 20 feet above the treeline, until it disapeared.

It seemed to maybe change pitch while we were watching, but as our vantage point changed, it could have only appeared so.   It may have moved slowly or it may have just changed position with respect to the horizon because of orbit or the earth&#39;s rotation.   Was this the space station?   Whatever it was was big.   No way was it a planet, star or airplane.

My friend and i were smoking a cig in the parking of a church up on a huge hill about 200 feet above, 50feet inland of the 5 freeway. To the west was the ocean about 1 mile away.  Previous to the object (or light)catching my eye, I was facing the south(along the 5 freeway), My friend was facing north.  clear sky, not one cloud.  So anyway--then a bright yellow/gold light appears south of our position. I grew up in this town and it only has one freeway, so i know every inch of the 5 in SC. My best guess would place the object at first sight--about 1.5 miles south of the church.  I told my friend to look at it because it was very bright and rather unusual for a copper to be flying so low at 10pm. SC goes to sleep at 10pm-the city is dead till morrning.  SO we kept watching the light.  After 3-4 min. we agreed that the light was moving North directly toward our position up on the hill. NOW IS THE MOST INTERESTING PART---what ever this flying object was.  It took it 15 min to fly from south of MISTY RIDGE( the next huge hill south)To directly over our heads (1.5 miles away).  when the object passed over our position on the hill, the thing must have been moving less than 25mph.  It just appeared out of nowhere--cruzed at 15mph along the 5 freeway, went over our heads, and just kept on going. It made no sound--we would have known if it was a copper.  I&#39;m assuming that the craft was all black- because i could only see three gold lights in a triangle shape.   FOR REAL---IT MADE NO SOUND--not even the sound of the freeway could silence a copper flying right over our heads.  During the sighting the object was low in altitude.  i&#39;d say- 300 feet.  when the object flew over our heads it was NOT far away(we were up on a huge hill)--I&#39;m suprised that I couldn&#39;t see the body of the craft. i tried to make out the actual shape but i just  couldn&#39;t see the body (black/on black sky).  It just looked like 3 bright lights in a triangle formation. I watched t! he first 3 seasons of the X-files--so i asked my friend some questions.  We experienced no communication with the object. we felt no loss of time.  we didn&#39;t feel sick/nauscious. we saw it--it most likely saw us--it flew by.  That&#39;s my story. OH YA- SC is the southern edge of orange county--right on the border of CAMP PENALTIN and the TRW facility (trw-where the military worked on laszer guidence systems). My former highschool is located just 2 miles from the TRW facility. back in 1997-98, at night we would drive to a place where we could see the TRW plant and watch the laser fights.  NO JOKE- they were having lazer gun fights out there on the base. I saw all colors of little streeks zipping back and forth. looked like a water gun fight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

So I took the binoculars and started looking for myself and sure enough there were 3 round objects in the sky.  At this point they were in a triangular formation and their multi-colored craft soon began to change formation. Repeatedly for a long period of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their color was multi-colored, but it alternated between the colors.  I would say the most prominent colors were gold/yellow, purple/blue and red.  They almost seemed to pulse when they changed colors.  Their formation seemed as though it was a code or an S.O.S or something. They executed it so perfectly; making moves in all directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think I was out there an hour or better before they just completely disappeared as though they were never there. However, within 30 minutes of the crafts disappearing we witnessed many aircrafts ( the human kind) searching the area. You could with out a doubt tell they searching for something. The sky had been clear of crafts all night and then the UFO&#39;s came out of nowhere to do this beautiful light and pattern display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, at some points it looked as though the ships became one and split into three again before assuming the next pattern and rotation. I have NO photos of the incedents, however I do have drawings of the formations and colors on the crafts. The thing about three of the drawings is that I drew them maybe 8 years before I had these sightings and they are dead on as to what I saw. They are the exact color shape and texture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will not send any drawings via email, but mail or fax is acceptable if you would like to view them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There was great visibility for several miles since we were high in the mountains in spite of the rain and mist.  Straight ahead in the southern sky above the tree lined horizon we both noticed from 5 to 8 undulating, free-formed, fuzzy-edged, vertical shapes consisting of medium to light blue lights waivering back and forth.  Their length was approximately 1/16 of the total curve of the sky.  Our first thought was northern lights or swamp gas.  However, in a flash, these hazy, soft, undefinable shapes shot to the ceiling of the thick cloud cover overhead.  While still maintaining their fuzzy edges, they took on fairly distinct slightly curved rectangular shapes that together formed a huge broken circle that must have covered perhaps a hundred square miles. There were approximately 8 of these soft-edged blue rectangles with convex and concave ends equally spaced apart.  The whole circular configuration looked like a sliced, sectional donut of bluish-white lights.  As we watched, suddenly the lights began pulsating in and out, converging in the middle and then expanding back to the original size at approximately 1/2 second intervals.  In an instant it shot down to the right side of our field of vision into a smaller, pulsating formation, maintaining the same shapes while hovering about 1/3 of the distance above the horizon. It held the same configuration for about 15 seconds when again it traveled back to its original position into the same immense circular arrangement of rectangles.  After pulsating for about 5 seconds, the formation converged and flew over the sky to the northwest horizon, behind us.  At this point, since I was driving, I couldn&#39;t see it, but my husband said it shot up through the night in a semi-radial pattern with equidistant spaces between each pale blue wide beam of diffused light dissipating to black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several cars on the highway at the time.  We wondered if anyone else had seen this phenomena.  Lights from the ground cannot be an explanation since no source on the land could have sent its beams that far.  Besides the light seemed to come from above.  No aircraft could be spotted.<n>

I first spotted it in the sky southwest of us heading on an eastern path, which would have put it going from over Puget Sound towards Lake Washington, over the small cities of Shoreline and Lake Forest Park, just north of Seattle.  The moon was out that night so we compared the size of the object relative to us and it was about one fourth the size of the moon.  There were two airplanes to the south of us that appeared to change course and follow it to the east.  We saw the red &amp; white flashing lights from the planes, but never saw any flashes from the object that was quite a bit larger in the sky than the airplanes.  Just before it went out of site over the trees to the southeast of us, it just vanished, like someone turned off the power.  The two airplanes appeared to change course at that point and move west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning, I checked satellite information for the area on http://www.heavens-above.com.

Your photo shows a cigar-shaped body with two sets of flat &#34;wings&#34; (like short tongue depressers) near each end.  This IDENTICAL object was photographed in the area of Tyler TX about 3 months ago (maybe the same day?), and I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t remember the date.  I was watching the evening news, and it was reported that the camera crew of KLTV Channel 7 (phone 903-597-5588), which is ABC, while getting ready for another event, had caught this &#34;strange object&#34; on their cameras.  A still shot was shown on TV, and I saw it.  It was an overcast evening, and the UFO was dark, perhaps brown.  The announcer said she had no idea what it was.  I set up to tape it later, but it was never shown nor discussed ever again, nor was it mentioned in the Tyler Telegraph newspaper.  I figured then that the film would be confiscated and the news crew would be told to not talk about it, and that would be that.  I didn&#39;t know at the time that I could report it to anyone.  But I wanted to let you know this in case you want to pursue it.  I know nothing more about it, but I&#39;ll keep my eyes open.  If this should happen again, I&#39;ll report immediately.  Incidentally, we get MANY chem trails over East Texas, and often--all sorts of patterns--and everyone complains of &#34;allergies.&#34;  Even the dog&#39;s eyes water most of the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

When the photographs were developed, I was suprised to see what appeared to be a winged flying pole. It did not appear to be connected to the contrail I had observed. I showed the photo to some at my workplace on 10/29.  They told me the same object had been seen on a news story on local channell 8 news on 10/28. It appears to be an identical object.<n>

I looked up because the sun glinted off an airplane very very high in the sky.  Below it I noticed a very dark, but not totally black, object moving southwest slowly in a straight line. It looked small - because of the altitude, I suppose, though I had no context to determine its true size or altitude.  Holding my arm straight out and up I&#39;d say it appeared 1/4 the size of the nail on my little finger.  It was a dark rectangle, almost a cube.  It appeared to tumble slowly once in a while because sometimes I could catch a glimpse of blue sky as if it were not just a cube, but a very thick U shape.  Hm, that sounds weird.  Maybe it would be better to say that the solid shape had a bite out of the edge and I could see the blue sky through it when it presented that face to me.  It did not reflect light, it had no wings, there were no lights on it, and I couldn&#39;t hear it.  There was no trail.  It was high off the horizon and traversed maybe 50 degrees; it was never near the horizon.  When I first noticed it, it was maybe over Lake Forest Park or Lake Washington.  I was looking north.  I watched it until it got to a bit south of NE 104th St where I was standing on 15th Ave NE, but farther west.  Then it appeared to stop, though it could have been going due west and only appeared to stop since I was looking west by then.  Then after 15 seconds or so, it very slowly, slower than it had gone southwest, started going north, though it may have only looked like it was going so slow if it were actually going northwest.  It was slowly getting smaller.  At that point the bus came and I stopped watching. I thought it might be a weather balloon (not that I&#39;ve ever seen one) but the shape was not round and unless there were upper altitude winds blowing straight southwest, the line of travel didn&#39;t seem consistent with a balloon drifting around.  That&#39;s my story and I&#39;m sticking to it.  P.S. I am not a UFO enthusiast.<n>

We had just got to her place and instead of swallowing my pride and haveing her take me back home, I decided to walk. My home was about 12 miles away, it was a dark over-cast night with the moon breaking out now and again. I knew the gravel road very well from my childhood days of walking to town to go to a friends house, so it wasn&#39;t a big deal. Anyways, about 3 miles out I came to this, not sure how to describe it, Double 90-degree corner in the road. As soon as I came around the first 90 I herd a rummble, turned to look and saw a soft white light. At first I thought nothing of it. I just assumed it was my girl friend giveing in and searching for me along the county road. I didnt feel like being found so I hopped over the Barb wired fence and into the Cattle pasture. I knew there to be cattle in the field but, being around cattle all my life, had&#39;nt gave it any thought. I stayed focused on the oncomeing light so I could try and tell what sort of head lights they were and so know if it was her. But the light dimmed. The rummble grew louder. I followed the sound and as it crossed a small stream in the pasture and saw a flash of light, as if the moon light had struck a smooth metalic surface of something flying not over 5 feet above the ground and only 30 yrds from me. It could&#39;nt have been doing over 10 mph which ruled out an Air plane. So I&#39;m thinking a Wisper, a common sight that the people of the area has seen often enough to give it a name. I get into the reason for the name in a second. Anyways, I watch the triangular object slowly fly away down the pasture when I notice the rummble still grows louder. So I turn just in time to see 50 head of cattle stampeding directly for me. Now if you have grown up around cattle you have seen cows run. I have chased cattle on a Four wheeler. They will run but it isnt like there in a big hurry to get anywhere. These cattle were running for their life. They ran strait for me, ! stoped, ran away from me, stoped turned and ran right through the fence. So naturally, I jumped the fence and got as far away from them as I could. Not a quarter of a mile on down the road I caught sight of the object again. This time it turned, gained some altitude and flew over me several times. The whole time fading in and out as the moon broke and the low cloud cover. The wind would pick up right as it would pass overhead and die as it went. It made a sound, not sure how to describe it other than radar....as if you could hear the sound a Bat emmitts to capture a bug. Another way would be to say it sounded like squeaky breaks on a car at the level of a whisper. It wasnt a plane...was flying to slow. Unless they have recently created a helicopter that could just barely seat one person but other wise incapable of lifting him off the ground due to its size and is almost totaly silent...it could&#39;nt have been a Helicopter. Could you maybe give me some info on what this could have been? I have played it over and again in my mind for a year now and I am stumped. Please feel free to contact me by email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have no idea what the object was, but it sounds quite interesting to us, and makes us wonder whether the sighting might have been related to a missing cow, or a mutilation case.  PD))<n>

They seemed to possibly be about 1 mile away from us I suppose (it was hard to tell this). They hovered for a while. Eventually, as time went by, at least 7 lights were seen by both of us. I used binoculars to try and see more, but all I could make out was the orange lights and nothing else, except for what seemed like smoke/steam/exhaust? coming from them at times. This stream of exhaust seemed to go up into the sky quite a ways. We heard no sound and the night air was calm.

As it hovered, it seemed to be rocking back and forth like a bell would do ,in fact,the top of the ball seemed to be narrower  at the top like an upside down funnel (but without the spout).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness remains totally anonymous.

At 8:15 PM he went outside. He called my wife out to look at an object. He then called me out also. We were on the White River, at a spot that we had been camping at for 10 years. In the NE sky at an altitude of about 2,000 feet we saw a stationery object. We noticed that it was flashing. We got a pair of binoculars from the car to look more closely at the object. My wife looked first, and couldn&#39;t believe her eyes. My son them looked at the object and said, &#34;what in the earth is that? I have never seen anything like that before!&#34;. When I looked at the object, I could see flashing lights. They were extremely bright. Almost like strobe lights. The colors were; red, yellow, blue, green, and white. They appeared to be in a cone shape. The red light was on the bottom left. The white light was on the bottom right and slightly higher up. The Green light was even higher up and in the center. the blue light and the yellow light were further up over the green light. The lights flashed in rapid succession, and seemed to be in a pattern. The speed and intensity of the lights were intense. We were all sure that this object was nothing that we had ever seen before. It was not an aircraft or weather balloon. When I returned home I reported the sighting to the Air Force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The bright star, Sirius, also known as the &#34;Dog Star,&#34; is in the northeast sky at the time and date indicated.

As it was near the Newcastle airport planes frequently crossed over, so we new it wasnt an aeroplane. It was oval shaped and seemed to stay in the same place for at least 30 minutes. It flashed white, red, orange and blue in no particular sequence, but it looked like the colours were circling the object.There seemed to also be a red cicle around it like an aura. Then after about 30 minutes it started to sway from side to side. Then it dropped at what seemed like a high speed, but it could still be seen. Again it started to sway then after another 10 minutes it circled in the sky. There was only one in the sky. My friend got her binoculars out of her house and we all saw that there seemed to be four dots of light around it and on the oval itself there looked like there were zig-zag patterns. It also looked like it left a slight red trail behind it.At about 1hour into the sighting it seemed to get smaller and smaller, but not that quickly, this took about 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspce a twinkling star.

Somewhat like a rocket launching, but with a glowing trail of exhaust and no visible fire coming from the rear.  It was just after dark, there were some clouds visible, but they were not glowing, even though they were in the same area and plane as the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object traveled at a constant trajectory for approximately 10 seconds, then appeared to slow dramatically, emitted a bright aura, somewhat like a firework just before the big &#39;pow,&#39; then appeared to change trajectory and disappear straight up into the clouds.  It didn&#39;t vanish suddenly.  It was more like it faded out.  Like a flashlight in the fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glowing trail remained for about 10-15 minutes.  It was extremely bright.  It did gradually dissipate.  As it did, it emitted several different colors around the edges of the trail. (Blue, green, purple) The moon was south of us, the object west.  They were not close together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a Trekkie or UFO freak, I am only reporting what I saw.  Living near Nellis AFB I have seen many aircraft ranging from the Stealth, to F15&#39;s to single props.  I have never seen anything as large as this, or traveling in such a manner.   The glowing trail and sudden trajectory change to me is unexplainable.  The nearest thing I have seen is a space shuttle launching, but this was much different. There was no visible ship, just a very bright corona/aura. What the hell would the space shuttle be doing in Pahrump, Nevada?  Did anyone else see this?  It wasn&#39;t late and Vegas is a big town.  Surely someone else saw this other than my girlfriend and I.  Is there an explanation other than an UFO?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Vandenberg rocket launch.  PD))<n>

My grandson, who lives 7 miles S of my location, called and said he saw it, but saw a red glow that I could not see from my location.  The object looked similar to a Minuteman Missile Launch that we saw on 10/2/99 at 19:08, when we were 5 miles above Prairie City, Oregon (see NUFORC).  I checked the Vandenberg AFB Launch Schedule website which indicated a launch was planned for this evening at 19:00.  I called the Redmond Airport, but they were closed.

At a certain point the trail began to expand and became a huge expanding circular envelope resembling mist. From the bright centre it seemed like four bright white streaks were spreading. At its maximum the cloud was maybe ten or fifteen moon-widths across. The speed did not seem all that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Gradually the bright centre burned out. The phenomenon must have been very high up because it remained white throughout although the sun was well below the horizon. Also, given the height, the white mist cloud must have been really enormous. Parts of the trail became red (presumably as they sank lower) but one part was also green/turquoise. At first I assumed this was a sizeable comet fragment but the four white streaks and the green coloured section makes me think it was maybe man made and the cloud was unused fuel (though I wonder why it was not burning).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Vandenberg rocket launch.

Saw a very powerful, wide, white light 40 minutes past sunset that must have been playing some unusual tricks with the clouds.  It was dark, and very cloudy (marine layer).   The light was bright as a star, but about 5-10 times bigger to my eye - a bit bigger than a golf ball, but much smaller than the moon. There was an odd shaping of lit clouds or some sort of light trail forming fast off both sides, starting narrow at the ball, and getting wider as it went out, but changing shape rapidly.   I pulled my car over, saw what looked to be what I call a &#34;God&#34; effect, with light piercing through a tunnel hole in the clouds, creating sort of a corona on the sides.  I thought it might be the sun going through an unusual hole in the clouds, but it happened at 7:00, well after sunset.  The cloud trails reminded me of missile testing i&#39;ve seen before, but the sky was too cloudy.  I never thought helicopter because I didn&#39;t hear anything - so it&#39;s a mystery.  I then continued to see bright light lighting above the clouds in one patch until I got to my house three minutes later.  Then it faded.  I kept checking every 5 minutes or so, but did not see anythiong.  Then, 20 minutes later, I went back outside with my son, who asked what the blue light was above the clouds, which were turning the otherwise gray   marine clouds blue in a small area, which was the same direction I was observing the earlier white light.

Looked up at sky (toward the south and facing general area where Portland airport might be) and saw a very large bright, round white light emitting a very wide, fan shaped vapor or trail behind it. Object was moving north, toward me,  straight across the night sky (which was very clear, no clouds)at a slow, steady speed. It was about as high in sky as a major airliner would be having just left Portland airport heading north.   I pointed it out to a friend I was with, and we both watched the object for several minutes, which we originally thought was a plane with its headlights facing us.  We both found it very strange that this object, if it was a plane, had such a strange wide fanned out trail or tail  behind it - almost like a comet.  All of a sudden the bright light just disappeared, followed by the disappearance of the fanned out tail/trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very strange.  When I told my husband he said it sounded like a piece of space junk disintegrating in the atomosphere.  I would be curious to find out if anyone else saw this as it was very noticeable and still early in the evening where a lot of traffic on roads would be aware of it.  Could you please inform me of your findings on this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Vandenberg rocket launch.  PD))<n>

At the head was a very bright cirlular object with a very long, bright tail trailing behind.  My wife thought it looked like a rocket and I thought it looked like a shooting star.  It was partly cloudy and the tail grew and then it seemed to suspend in the air and then just disappeared and left behind a glowing trail.  Then it was gone as if it wasn&#39;t there at all.   I checked the Camp Pendleton website to see if there were any reported military activities from the base which is on the other side of the Santa Rosa Mountains from where we saw the lights and nothing was being reported as being planned for this day.

It was very high up and looked similar to a helecoptor searchlight, yet many times brighter and there was no motor sound.  It weaved back and forth slightly.  As we watched it, a small plane flew through the beam and was fully illuminated by it.  The beam of light was intensly bright, yet diffused over a broad area.  At the end was a bright, indigo blue line of &#34;smoke&#34;.  Another friend came rushing up and said she had seen it from her car where she watch it move straight up with the bright light at the back of the craft.

I really did not see any kind of craft at first and I just stood there looking at this cloud of white and orange light and after a while I did see a round orange light a very small light which appeared to be a half inch to an inch in diameter. While I looking at this phenomenen I thought to myself that perhaps it was the moon behind that cloud or maybe some kind of solar refraction but the time was considerably past sunset and also I looked up into the sky to my left and the moon was there.  The lighting in the cloud has the look of the sunset on the horizon except that this light was considerably above the horizon and there was also white light in other parts of the cloud. I strain my brain to think of other possibilities but cannot think of any. I watched the phenemenon for about 10 to 15 minutes during which time the white and orange light got progressively dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Vandenberg rocket launch.  PD))<n>

We stopped the car and turned off the engine but there was no sound (country road and very quiet). The fan of light swirled and slowly dissipated and there was no further sign of anything. It was certainly not a star, airplane, or helicopter. The evening was completely clear with good visibility and no cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Vandenberg rocket launch.  PD))<n>

I was 59 years old when I observed the UFO. I have a Masters degree and was a Professor of Art for two decades , before I resigned to operate an artist studio. I am now a commodities transporter, a professional driver. My wife and I are an owner/operator team of an express truck for a trucking company based in Florida. We deliver loads throughout the United States and Canada. Being a rational person, I have been unable to explain what I saw in this report, only that it was indeed unidentified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the best of my knowledge, this incident occurred on October 14, 2002 after we had picked up a load in California.  This trip was to be an all night drive, so sometime around midnight, we turned off of Interstate 15 in Utah, and turned unto Interstate 70 eastbound, heading for Denver, Colorado. In the daytime, the first 50 miles of Interstate 70 is one of the most beautiful drives through a canyon on the interstate system, but at night, this can be one of the lonely stretches of highway in the US.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, it was around 1 or 2 o&#39;clock in the morning, I was driving the truck through the Fishlake National Forest area, just west of Joseph, Utah. My wife was asleep in the sleeper, so I was driving in the cab by myself. I was winding my way through the canyon pass. All I could see was the canyon walls, as my headlights swept across them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw a green light about 50 yards down the road. My first thought was that it was a transformer, of some sort. When, suddenly, this green light passed over my truck. The green light appeared to be a horizontal triangle, with beveled edges. I couldn&#39;t see anything around the light. It was pitch black, and there were no other markings or lights. Since this happened so quickly, and due to the fact I was still going 55 miles an hour through a winding canyon pass at night, I could not stop the truck, to see where the object went after it passed over my truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However there was one observation that I was able to make: the object was quite small, no wider than my truck. In other words, if this was a flying vehicle, it appeared to be big enough for only one, or two, occupants.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, I would like to mention that I have driven this stretch of interstate twice since then. Once in 2003, and once in 2004. Both trips occurred during the daylight hours. Neither time did I see anything on the highway that resembled what I saw on October 14, 2002. All I saw was a winding stretch of interstate and miles of beautiful canyon walls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Object had 3 soft white lights at the vertices which shone downward.  Approximately 40 feet in width.  No other discernable lights or charactaristics.  Moved in a south by southwesterly direction at approximately 150kts.  Appeared to be about 1500 feet AGL.  Made no sound, though it appeared close enough to be audible if it had jet enines.  Left no contrails.  Observed maintaining straight and level course for about 5 seconds, then rolled right to a 45 degree angle which caused the downward lights to shine brighter, as they were directed more towards the observer.  After 1 second, object then rolled left back to a straight and level position.  Object never appeared to change course or altitude during this rolling activity.  Lost track of object due to distance and the horizon.  Event took place near the intersection of Highway 13 and County Road 42 in Savage, MN while facing westward, and up at about a 30 degree angle.  Background was a dark sky with a few visible stars, including Orion in the east.  Highway 13 was illuminated, but obscured by a small hill in front of the observer.  Slight glow seen over the crest of the hill from these lights, as well as the columns of light from        Lake        to the west.  Object was just west of Highway 13, but certainly east of        Lake, as it was observed passing in front of the beams of light from the casino.  Observer is a pilot and is familliar with the air traffic around Minneapolis International Airport, about 20 miles to the northeast.  This object did not conform to any recognizable aircraft lighting or flight patterns around MSP.  No navigational lighting, beacon, or landing lights were observed.  Object could not have been part of the air traffic pattern from MSP, as it was far too low.  Also, the sudden rolling activity seemed very uncharacteristic for commercial aircraft.  Lack of sound and contrails is very curious.<n>

(The house is just 3 houses from the Atlantic Ocean). I observed a small black isosceles-triange shaped object. It was approximately 40 feet long. It had one solid white light on each corner of the triangle. I would estimate it to be about 400 feet above my head. It was cruising very slowly, in a due south direction, I would estimate it to be about 20 mph. It did not make a sound. I watched it continue in a completely straight path until I could not see it any longer.

It slowed down from its usual speed and separated into three objects. It made about four rotations, then went back to its normal appearance.  This oject travels NNE to E on its regular path.  But that night it didn&#39;t behave like a satellite.  As an amatuer astronomer and a scientist, I find that what occurred was a rarity and I would appreciate it if someone can tell me what I captured on film that night.  I might add that I have taken what I recorded on my Panasonic 700x digital camera and converted it to vcr then to digital camera and then to comuter so that I can download if needed.<n>

When we first saw the object it was pulsing-red,blue,green,purple,pink, yellow these pulses gave the object a white light characteristic.. as the object got closer to us, we could see it had a slight triangular outline. As the object got closer and passed above us we could see it was not one large pulsing light but a combintion of &#34;4&#34; lights. 3 lights in each triangle corner and a large clearly pulsing light(that seemed suspended inside the center of the object.The object moved slowly and stopped above nearby Eglin AFB.

I live close to the Langley airport and have single aircraft flying experience. I was observing how clear the sky was and how prominent the constellations were, when directly above me, (Approx. 5 to 8 thousand ft.) an object flew over. The object was V-shaped and had six rectangular lights underneath. The lights were faded rather than bright. It was moving very fast. I could definately see an outline of the V shape. I was listening for sound to determine what kind of craft it may be (ultralight, glider,etc.) but there was absolutely no sound at all. As I watched it crossing in front of me the lights totally disappeared and I could no longer see the shape or any existence of the object. I called the local police to see if there were sightings reported on that night but their records showed no calls on the subject. I also called Langley airport to see if they had any kind of search lights or strobes that would reach my location, although there was no cloud cover or mist in the sky that would have caused a reflection.They were not aware of any calls. I know what I saw, and it was definately nothing I&#39;ve seen before. I felt very baffled and looked like I had seen a ghost according to my family. I keep mulling it over in my head trying to imagine what this could have possilby been. If anyone had a similar experience on the evening of Oct 12th and living in the Murrayville, to Aldergrove area, I would really like them to share it.<n>

The aircraft made a very low-tone humming sound, and I was able to make out its shape due to its lights. It was triangular because it had three lights on the craft, one for each end of the three sides. There was one light that flashed between blue and white, and the others were white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ---The pictures I took of the craft weren&#39;t very good. It was all black except for the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ---I also filed a report at the police station, and spoke to an officer who has had a similar experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> --Also, my cellular phone has never worked the same since.<n>

We look up and saw plenty of what we thought were stars.  But then they started to move.  Then they would all stop, a just a few would move.  They would move up, down, left, and right, and also they would just stop completly.  They were so high up, that they were just a speck of light.  Some were brighter than others.  We saw about 40-50 of these all on the eastern side of the moon.  So were near the moon others further away.  After the movie, midnight, we only saw 2 or 3 moving around.  We didnt know if there was more then, because the stars were visible.  This happened in the rich city of Boca Raton, FL.  It was just a white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect stars would be the first possibility to be ruled out.  PD))<n>

Then I saw it come into plain view and I stopped and it was about 50 yards from me just hovering there silently, above a resturaunt.  I got out a took pictures of it and as I did it started to slowly move west again and then it took a northwest approach and finally it was gone in a matter of seconds.  It was a black triangular one. It had two blue/white going from blue to white and one in the front that was just white.  I have black and white pictures of the craft but all you can see is the lights in the various positions that clearly make out that it was triangular.<n>

It was orange (with flames) but was not on fire. The shape from the side view was  something like a van, with the side open. Later, when it turned, the back was squarish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking into the object&#39;s interior and through the flames could see what appeared like moving anthropoid type shapes. Below at the back of the object a row of deep red lights moved forward and back repetitively.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was quite silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After minutes the object began to move forward (south) for some metres then did a right turn, (west). When it turned I could no longer see the flames. Coloured lights were on the back and I watched it travel slowly across the undulating (rural) country during which time I rang my brother who lived in that direction, to advise him to go outside to watch for the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A wide band of fairly dense cloud had come up from the western horizon and the object went behind the cloud, disappearing from sight. The sighting had lasted seven minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: At the beginning of the sighting I heard children&#39;s voices calling out so they may have seen the object but they were called inside by their club leader.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a history of contact and have also done considerable research plus investigation of other witnesses&#39; sightings over many years, also have friends who will vouch for me.<n>

What I saw was a little more than a half circle of light, with the brightest section facing the direction of movement, kind of like you would expect a meoteor to look as it was coming down through the atmosphere. It appeared about the size of a quarter from my perspective.<n>

As I was watching them form in the sky, I was watching one particular plane go by when something caught my eye. There was a blinking dot, that was not blinking in any sequence I have ever seen on a plane. It was behind the jet that flew by and was in now way a satelite or another plane. The direction I was facing was South-Southeast, the sun was at about 60 degrees off the horizon to the West. This object was not reflecting light from the Sun however. The blinking pattern was like this: Flaaash,pause,pause,pause,Flaaash,pause,pause,pause,Flaaash - The flashing was longer than a standard strobe flash and the movement of the object was kind of hover like, slow movement towards the West/SouthWest. I ran inside to get my video camera and when I returned, the object was still there. The size of this thing and relative distance would be about the size of normal star in the night sky. It was very small for certain, but at such a far off distance, could easily have been 30 feet in diameter or more? I tried zooming in object as I could see with naked eye, it was behind chemtrail, but against clear blue sky part, each strobe was noticeable only if you were looking right at it. Otherwise, no chance in hell you could spot it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a TOTAL luck shot, like one other occasion where I was looking up, and equally as exciting. Had to report it as it happened...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that &#34;chemtrails&#34; are, in fact, normal contrails behind high-flying aircraft.

I was watching an air show from this vantage point looking north towards the Golden gate bridge. All of the jets were flying between the Golden Gate &amp; Bay Bridges these jets were several miles north/west of my location. I was waiting watching when a glint caught my eye. I watch as three miniscule points drifted east at about 10 to 15,000 feet? Nothing strange about that...Then the three started to circle and formed a separated triangle shape. At first I thought maybe they were birds circling but it seemed really high... but when they rotated the sun glinted off of a metallic surface, which caused them to glitter. They were very very small and hard to track against the blue sky. Suddenly out of nowhere a fourth appeared and they started heading east in a straight line one right after the other away from the city. This all happened directly above the South Of market area of San Francisco between Potrero hill and Bernal hill. Meanwhile the jets were twisting and twirling over downtown and the Embarcadero. One of the tiny metallic objects stayed behind for several minutes circling while the others headed east. Then after about a minute took of after the others and headed over the hill and I lost site of it as I was standing on the west side of Bernal Hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Straight ahead of me and about 45 degrees above the horizon a spot of light appeared, streaking straight down toward the ground.  Then it flashed brightly as if it had exploded, but then continued on its dowaward path unitl it got within about 15 degrees of the horizon.  At that point it faded out and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This entire event lasted only about a second. I just happened to be looking the right way when it appeared.  The object was white in color and left a straeking trail behind it.  There were aircraft in the skies over Dallas, and this light was much brighter than the lighes of air traffic and was traveling much faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I almost expected to next see an explosion on the horizon, but there was none.  At first I feared that might be a rogue ICBM.  (Shows you what kind of times we live in now.)  When I saw no explosion on the horizon, I decided it must have been a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking it must have been a huge meteor, I turned on the AM news station to see if there were any news reports of the incident.  There were none.  I thought that I would certainly read accounts in the newspaper of many people observing the object--especially since it was so brightly visible in the middle of a big city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Surely scientists must have detected such a large object entering the earth&#39;s atmosphere.  And surely earthquake sensors must have detected the impact.  But over the next few days I saw no media reports at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may have crashed into the earth in the next county, half a state away, or into the Gulf of Mexico.  It was not a flying saucer, but it was certainly unidentified, so that makes it a UFO.  I have looked at reports posted on this site and I&#39;m amazed that nobody else near Dallas has reported seeing this bright object.<n>

Above the Lufthansa which was banking northward toward Logan Intn Airport from the east, was another, higher altitude aircraft heading in an easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Farther up, above the higher aircraft I noticed what appeared to be an orange light.  It wasn&#39;t much more than a speck in the sky and I&#39;m amazed I had even spotted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very high up but seemed to be reflecting the sun&#39;s light making it appear as an orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun was on it&#39;s way down but the sky was still bright.  Nothing was giving off that orange glow when the sun is setting, not even the higher altitude jet-liner which was just white(no vapor trail).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light appeared to just be hovering.  I sat and watched for maybe 30 seconds when I had decided to run in the house and grab my 30X Spotting Scope and alert my brother to what I was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both got outside and the light was still at the same spot in the sky.  As I tried to get a better look at it with the Spotting Scope, it began to slowly move NNW which caused me to have to jump of the back porch to keep it in my sight as I feared it would go behind the tree overhead.  My brother was having a bitch of a time spotting this thing by the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I wormed my way through off the deck, the object stopped just at the edge of the leaves of the tree, luckily, since I was nearly pressed up against the house trying to get the thing in my scope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it stopped, I managed to get it in my scope and saw it to be a cylindrical object, orange in color, possibly from the sun reflecting off of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I had my brother jump of the deck as well and used the leaves as a reference point for him to look and then he finally caught sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds later, it slowly drifted off to the NNW and dissapeared behind the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran out to the front yard but failed to find it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was thinking it to be possibly the International Space Station but, to my knowledge, the Space Station doesn&#39;t stop then move on again,,,does it?

He distracted me and forgot to check again. I was looking almost straight up while watching a white jet lay a &#34;chemtrail&#34; going from north to south. It passed overhead and slightly behind it I noticed movement. I saw a small white sphere at high altitude going about half the speed of the jet. It was travelling east to west. It moved much like a satelite looks at night. When it was almost staight overhead it seemed to slow down. It came to a dead stop almost directly overhead and stayed there about 5-10 minutes. I ran into my apartment and grabbed a cheap disposable camera and took a picture. Then I ran back in and grabbed my binoculars. The sphere was still overhead and I tried once to spot it thru the binoculars but failed. I found it again but before I could bring them up to my eyes the sphere started moving west again. It picked up speed for a short way then blinked in and out of my vision about three times and disapeared. It was a clear blue sky where it was located and I was looking north. It stopped shortly after crossing the north to south chemtrail and seemed to be at a much higher altitude. Size: if I held my hand out at arms length it would be about1/3-1/2 the with of my fingernail.<n>

A shape was discernable. It was roughly an acute triangle with points of greater brightness.  Color was bright green with gold overtones.  Sparks were flying off the thing tangential to direction of movement.  It traveled roughly from an 11:00 position to almost the horizon in a north-northeasterly direction. Color of sparks ranged from gold to dark red.  It looked like it had a plasma surrounding it.  Size: about 16 millimeters in length and about 4 or 5 millimeters in width at the widest as observed by the naked eye.  There was also some structure evident in the shape itself with some longitudinal lines of brightness, almost a gold red, running through the basic shape.  It was quite striking.  I observed it from the driver&#39;s seat of my vehicle and was startled enough to come to a complete stop and contemplate what I had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded quite credible to us.

This is the truth, my friend and I did, exactly three years ago, Oct. 2002.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in a park and we saw a large star in the East sky the star grew in size instantly, and held size then grew instantly and held size it did this repeatedly about six times till it grew 3/4 the size of a Full moon, but at the brightest point it shot an INTENSELY BRIGHT white light down to earth, &#34;the beam of light had thickness it was about 1/2 as thick as a fullmoons width.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> then it repeated its stair stepping but was getting smaller, holdingsize, getting smaller... about six times till it was the size of a Large star again, then it started moving it flew in an S shape up then back and  around smoothly, then it just shot like a shooting star straight, like light speed and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This changed my life, I don&#39;t know and I know I don&#39;t know... but I do know there is more.  I would like to learn more, do you think that you could help us?  What we saw, NOTHING in Nature, or Nothing Man made that could do that, Humans just do not have that type of power and it was not an exploding star or something one could explain away. ... I am wondering all the time. What we saw was a show of control and power, There must have been other people who saw this, Its a big city a big state... but one problem is &#34;people don&#39;t stop to look up&#34; they are stuck watching tv... ?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.

He works and lives in downtown Cincinnati.  On his way home some women asked him if he saw the UFO, which he he then looked up in the sky and saw the object.  He said it was shaped like a stop sign, (octagonal), had a red light in the center and blue lights on the rim.  He said one of the rims was extended off of the object, which he saw move into place, so the object was then symmetrical. He said it was fairly high up in the sky, and he said it seemed there was a haze around it, making the lights &#34;dim&#34;... or not as bright.  He said it was large, the size of a dinner plate in scale to his extended hand.  He said there were multiple witnesses, and when he got home neighbors from his apartment building were told and they went out and saw it as well.  He said he also told a police officer in the Kroger store who ignored him and thought he was a &#34;crazy&#34;.<n>

The light was at a 30-35 degree angle horizontal from or location. It apeared to be a sphereical light becase when it flashed the light came out in all directions and i can allso tell that it was below the clouds because when it flashed it lit up the clouds behind it above it and below it. I have lived here many years and have never seen a light like that before . We could also see it moving slowly we could tell this because we compared it to a tree branch by it and the light of the radio tower. it seemed to spit one flash but by the time the next flash took place it rejoined to one; possibly could be tight formation at long range doing maneuvering and the rejoining formation. Sorry for the miss spelling but i am a little shaken up. i hope i included all infromation. needed.the event duratoin is only how long we were out there we just came in and it was still there we&#39;re kinda freaked out sorry if that affects the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether there might have been a revolving advertising light in the area, but that is only a guess.

10/9/02 23:45|Port Charlotte/Punta Gorda area|FL|Unknown|6 to 8 seconds|Blue object seen in the Port Charlotte Florida area.|11/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26026.html|221|ndxe200210| Blue object seen in the Port Charlotte Florida area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Port Charlotte, Florida. On the night of October 9th, 2002, at about 11:45 EST, while walking the dog, I noticed a blue colored object moving across the sky very fast. There were no blinking lights or any other colors on the object, just a solid dull blue color. When I first noticed the object it was almost directly in my line of sight (I was basically looking straight ahead, then noticed it) and was at about 50º in the eastern sky. I really don&#39;t know how far away it was, but if I had to guess I would say it was maybe 2 miles away at an altitude of between 5,000 and 8,000 ft. This object was about the size of an asprin at arm&#39;s length. There were two commercial jets in the area at the time. One jet had passed directly over head about 30 to 45 seconds before I saw the object, at about 15,000 feet, if I had to guess. The other jet passed over about 45 seconds to a minute after I saw the object, at about 70º, and and altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. All three were headed in a southerly direction. More than likely both jets were headed to Southwest Florida International. This object did not leave any type of trail nor did it descend at any time; instead it kept a steady path across the sky, parallel to the ground. I could not hear any noise from the direction of the object, however the faint sound of the first jet that passed over could still be heard during the sighting. I could really appreciate the speed of the object when the second jet passed over. The jet seemed like it was just crawling across the sky compared to it. I was able to view the object for a total of about 6 to 8 seconds. The conditions were completely clear at the time. I really couldn&#39;t make out any definite form or shape but if I had to label the object as resembling any distinct shape, I would lean toward it being more ball shaped than anything else. It definitely did not appear cigar or tube shaped.<n>

But as the helocopter flew west, out of sight and sound to the mountains above Denver, I looked up at the sky....<n> <n><n> <n><n> A vague set of contrasted shapes, in the shape of a &#34;V&#34;, seemingly flowing the path of the helocopter&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically, they seemed to be the reflection of city lights shining on the bottom of some very distant bird formation. But, as I focused the shapes interacted uniformly, as if they were fixed on the front of a Stealth Bomber (&#34;flying wing&#34;)... making a slight turn and straightening manuvre; but with no complete form... just the fixed, hazy dots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought maybe some geese were flying over silently, and as they passed I would see birds; but it flew way too fast and silent. The tipping of the form, uniformly, alarmed me that birds don&#39;t usually make such manuvres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, just after the slight manuvre, they passed over an active/lit-up baseball field, and I stared, to see if I would see a &#34;V&#34; of birds fly through the lights. But they were much higher than they seemed. Because they went out of view in the light, this showed great velocity.<n>

I observed an airplane heading  in direction to west. A starlike object, which may have been a satellite was at same time heading in a eastern direction. The airplane and satellite(?), met right on. It looked like the satellite passeed under the airplane. A few seconds later, the  light of the satellite faded away quickly and was gone. The airplane, was flying very high altitude. Absolutely clear night. What made me question what I saw, was the direction this satellite was heading, and to my eyes, it looked like it was passing directly under the airplane. This happened on the western sky , about 70 degree above horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a coincidence.

10/9/02 15:21|New Westminster (Canada)|BC|Circle|25 - 30 Seconds|2 Disc shaped gray objects seen over New Westminster|10/15/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25496.html|225|ndxe200210| 2 Disc shaped gray objects seen over New Westminster<n> <n><n> <n><n> This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve sent in a report to your website.  I&#39;m kind of dissapointed that over the last 2 months I&#39;ve witnessed several bizzare objects in the sky with a witness, but didn&#39;t report them to you and I should have.  I&#39;m a very observant of the skies due to the fact that I&#39;ve seen many of these ojects in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today, on my last coffee break of the day 3:15 P.M., I wondered down 7th Street in New Westminster, B.C., Canada.   This is how my sighting transpired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed in the sky what appeared to be some floating garbage or black balloons of some type which seemed to be liked together like a cluster of balloons with a definate arrow shape to the mass.  This seemed a little odd and puzzling this shape.  The distance of this floating garbage or ballons when I first spotted it was probably 20 stories high compared to the height of a high rise building.   Whatever this was flying up in the air, I just thought, it&#39;s got to be garbage and didn&#39;t think anything much of it, but I did continue to watch this (garbage) float upwards with what I assume was air currents moving it upwards.  As my head was looking up towards the sky in an easterly direction at this floating garbage, I caught sight of a disc shaped grey object moving rapidly skimming the clouds and moving fast and steady from an easterly direction towards a south western direction.  It moved smoothly across the sky from the East and curved on an angle towards a South Westerly direction.  I watched it move across the sky till infinity (I couldn&#39;t see it anymore).  I had a fix on this object for at least 30 seconds crossing the sky.  It wasn&#39;t a bird or small plane.  Stunned at what I saw, and frankly, if it wasn&#39;t for that (garbage thing) floating upwards, I probably wouldn&#39;t have seen this object at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked in the sky where I originally had first spotted the object (which was in the easterly sky) and about 45 seconds to 1 minute after the pass of the first object, there was a second flying object of similar size, heading from an Easterly direction towards a definate Southern direction.  At the moment that I spotted this second object, there was an airliner in the sky heading towards Vancouver airport.  This object was much higher than the plane, and this 2nd object also was skimming the clouds as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s all I have right now, plain and simple, but I wanted to get this one to you for sure this time.<n>

Some how the craft had the ability to generate a strong magnetic field as the electronic devices in my vehicle were acting mysteriously as I stood and stared with disbelief the craft revealed itself in its full glory.  It must have been hovering at least 250 – 400 feet above; it totally obscured a huge cloud and had to be at least the size of an aircraft carrier.  It had multiple rows of lights (I would estimate 12-15 rows). The lights ranged in colors from a pale yellow all the way up to a deep dark purple.  The lights pulsed in a unique symmetrical way, yet some how it seemed to follow some sort of code.  Somehow I felt as though it was communicating with my inner soul, I was not afraid yet I felt at peace with the universe.  I had been trying to re-establish contact with the beings but somehow feel that my neighbour’s loud music is interfering with my cosmic karma.  The alien aircraft had an unusual disproportionate wedge shape when it originally uncloaked and after about 10-12 seconds, additional micro-pods began appearing as though attached to its starboard and aft sides.  I discovered the following day that I was photo-sensitive and had minor vomiting spells.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as being experienced with electronic circuits.

ON VIDEO!<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were sitting on high ground looking at a mountain (large hill) and witnessed a bright light rising from the base of the mountain which we both first thought to be some sort of strang off road vehicle or equivalent going up a road we were not familure with.  It rose gradually and slowly at first up the mountain towards the west at about a 45 degree angle.  It then past the silhoulet of the mountain and kept rising in about a 45 degree angle into the sky.  It was then my friend and I kinda looked at each other and said out loud that that wasnt anything normal.  Not a plan nore a helocopter of any sort.  There were NO SOUNDS and NO BLINKING LIGHTS like on plans.  I can only describe it as a ball of orange/yellow flam.  Or a spherical orange ball that seemed to pulsate at times.  (moved in all directions; up, down, left right)After it traveled a bit to the west, it stoped, hovered, then changed directions slowly to the east.  It was at this time my friend and I became a little uncomfortable and desided to start back to my home.  As we ran back to my house to fetch the video camera we kept an eye on it, stoping a few times to see what direction and speed it was taking.  I rushed into my house (which was about 75 yards away) and woke up my family and got my video camera.  I was followed by my father, sister and mother out into the front yard to gaze.  I was so exited that the camera jared a lot at first.  However, I was able to get it trailing off into the west going up and then burning through the atmosphere.  MUST SEE VIDEO!<n>

10/7/02 21:03|Eugene|OR|Triangle|7-10 seconds|Triangular boomerang shape, dark gray/shadowy color, low altitude, silent,|10/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25763.html|234|ndxe200210| Triangular boomerang shape, dark gray/shadowy color, low altitude, silent,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing on the back porch as I often do, facing north, waiting for the dog to finish his business for the evening. It was just after 9pm. As I stood there, I looked up into the night sky as I often do, admiring the stars. It was a clear sky, and off to the far north-northeast, something caught my eye. It looked like a distant shooting star, but that soon became unlikely to me, as it was moving horizontally in what seemed then to be from north to south, and it did not burn up and disappear as would be expected. About two to three seconds elapsed, and I found my eyes focusing in on a silent, shadowy, blur approaching my location overhead. It was in the shape of what resembled a boomerang, about the size of a hang glider, or even slightly smaller. I was surprised to realize that it was actually at a very low altitude. I felt myself grasping to identify it, and trying hard to decide that it was simply a flock of travelling birds. I believe that what I was trying to call birds were actually 5 or 7 small, dull white lights, and as the object came nearly directly overhead, I could easily see that these lights were on the V-shaped outer edge of a dark gray colored craft. In fact, the craft appeared to be made of a similar material to a B-1 stealth bomber, although it definitely was not a B-1. It was traveling north-northeast to south-southwest, at perhaps 75 feet above the treetops. The craft was moving too quickly for a flock of birds, and yet considerably slower than what would ordinarily be the stall speed of an aircraft, perhaps 45-50 mph. Again, the object was completely silent as it passed nearly directly overhead, very stable and steady in course, at an altitude which I later realized would have been below normal radar detection. My experience was of an object that was only perhaps 8 feet across at best, and this was most puzzling of all. I would not say it was large enough to carry people. I live in a suburban area, and watched it disappear over the neighbors&#39; treetops soon after passing over my! head. T he lights may have changed color, but I am not certain of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curiously, I&#39;ve only had one other UFO sighting in my life, when I was an older child laying in the yard looking up at the stars, maybe fifteen or twenty years ago. That object was almost exactly the same as the one I saw recently, and I finally feel vindicated that the sighting I had then was indeed not a flock of birds.<n>

The cloud system to the Southwest was dark and this was a strong indication of dangerous gusty conditions for flying PPG&#39;s.  Our friend, decided to launch despite to weather conditions.  He was sitting in the seat of his PPG and I was standing on the pilot&#39;s left. My other friend was standing on the pilot&#39;s right.  As I was checking the pilot&#39;s riser connections I noticed a bright green light illuminating the clouds to the Norhtwest of where I was standing.  I shouted, &#34;Look at that...look at that...look at that!&#34;  My friend who was helping the pilot as well turned and first saw the fireball as it was passing through the second, but much smaller cloud system.  I saw the green and orange fireball come out of the main cloud system from the Northwest as it travelled eastward and entered the second smaller cloud system and then the fireball exited the second cloud system.  It was at this moment that the  pilot turned and looked over his left shoulder as he sat in the PPG and saw the last moments of the fireball as it discintergrated with a final burst which created an orange and greenish ring.  The fireball was falling at angle of approximately 5 degrees.  The object covered an arch of about 45 degrees from the first moment I saw the fireball to the last moment before it exploded. The object was not moving as fast as the typical meteor, because I had time to say look at that three times and then a moment to watch the last stages of its destruction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Noting it out of the corner of my eye, another appeared about the 7:00 position below it. I picked up my sis and we sat in the car with a clear view of the west, and noticed the bottom one started zig-zagging left and right. At least two other ones appeard below the large bright one and did the same. The bright one dimmed dropped down even with the other two and shot back up. The lights changed from brigh to dark several times and then one dark one shot across below those, much closer. We observed this activity until clouds rolled in and obscured the view..

I know it was low because I could see the raised top of the object when it got some distance away). The object didn&#39;t appear to have any wings. The object did NOT make a sound, as I would have expected an aircraft to do. It was dark coloured/black. It appeared to have light coloured concentric rings around the circumference of the underside. It was moving at an apparent constant speed. I told my friend to keep watching it while I ran into my house to fetch my binoculars. When I returned it was too far to make out anything new... although it could be seen on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was over the horizon after around 2 minuets. It was a clear afternoon, dropping cold and there was very little cloud. We were not under the influence of any type of drug (alcohol, e.t.c.) I am an intelligent person, 19 years of age. I am not saying that this thing we saw in the sky was a flying craft controlled by aliens, nor am I saying it’s some secret military aircraft of some type simply because don’t know what it was. I am just reporting this because I found it unusual and was a little shaken by it.<n>

The sphere was of an unmistakeable copper finish.  It was not emitting light but reflecting it.  It turned black &amp; shadowy on its lower half  intermittently giving an impression of undulation.  It flew a straight and consistent flight path SW-NE maintaining altitude of about  300 feet. Its trajectory and path was too straight for a balloon to maintain for the duration that I witnessed.

It then lost its green glow all together and shot across the sky due south at an extreme rate of speed as a large ball, like a meteor.  It was rather large, I have seen a few meteors before that were suspected of hitting ground, but I had never seen anything of this size before.

But one particular evening we were sat under the gazebo (we were doing this because he smokes and grandmother forbids it in the house)and we were discussing stars, so got up and as usual started showing me them adn we were looking for one star in particular (we had a star named after my grandpa)my grnadmother came out and joined us and suddenly a fast moving red, ball of light was gliding across the sky, my uncle (fantasic mathatiction) pionted out that it must be extremely high even though i could see this clearly. We all folowed it with our eyes it passed across the sky vry quikly, before we knew it we were all running into the front garden to watch it and get a better look and we watched it for as long as we could as it passed over the housing estate (clay lane). the experience lasted a good 50 seconds which was long enough to see it had no tail it was not a plane, it was moving extremely fast, faster than a satelite (my uncle pionted out).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second sighting ive posted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Butler, a former Grifton volunteer firefighter, was sitting in the old Red and White parking lot about 11 p.m. Friday. He was there with three fire department friends when the sky around them lighted up, coloring everything from the ground to the trees to themselves a strange shade of green and blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light passed over them, he said. And when they looked up, it was so blinding they couldn&#39;t identify the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;We all just looked at each other like, &#39;What in the world was that?&#39;&#34; Butler said. &#34;I&#39;ve seen meteors and space junk and satellites. I ain&#39;t never seen anything that color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;It had some good size to it, too, and it was up in the air pretty good,&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His first thought: the light had come from a UFO. His second: another country was firing missiles in the direction of Pitt County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Maybe it was government-related. If it was, we&#39;ll never know,&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the fire-rescue scanners mounted in the volunteers&#39; trucks, calls came in from Ayden and the Pitt County Sheriff&#39;s Office. Butler heard patrol cars being dispatched to check for something that had fallen from the sky in the area of Jolly and Abbott Farm roads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sgt. Marty Burroughs sent three of his deputies to survey for damage, or possibly, a spacecraft between the Ayden Police Department and the two rural roads. They didn&#39;t find a thing, not even a small piece of space tin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;The main thing we checked were houses to make sure nobody had been hit by anything,&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Deputies found the houses to be safe and left the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Burroughs had a dispatcher contact Lenoir and Greene county sheriff&#39;s departments to see if a craft had crashed beyond the county line. But nothing was reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A deputy in Ayden and several Greenville officers reported seeing the peculiar light near Pitt Community College at Fire Tower Road and N.C. 11<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;They just said it was moving and it appeared to be descending,&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Asked if he thought the light was a UFO, Burroughs said, &#34;It could have been. I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sheriff Mac Manning jokingly chalked the sighting up to the work of a shiny red sled and nine flying reindeer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I thought it was maybe Santa Claus making an early run, but we ruled that out pretty quick,&#34; Manning said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparently, he said, the light was bright enough and big enough to attract quite a bit of attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Manning said the sighting of whatever-it-was isn&#39;t a big deal. Deputies patrolling remote areas of the county report seeing things in the sky all of the time, he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, it scared J.K. Butler — and his buddies. For two hours they watched the night sky, looking for something, anything that could help complete the puzzle to what they had seen; whether that be little green men or a plane with similar lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was asked if he&#39;d recently been watching the Sci-Fi channels series on UFOs called &#34;Taken.&#34; He said he&#39;d never heard of it, and after being informed of the show&#39;s angle on alien abductions, he said there&#39;s no way he&#39;s watching it now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Email this page to a friend<n> <n><n> <n><n> By using this service you accept the terms of our Visitor Agreement.<n> <n><n> Registered site users, to edit your personal profile, click here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> © 2002 Cox Newspapers, Inc.<n> <n><n> The Daily Reflector and Cox Interactive Media<n> <n><n> Privacy Policy <n> About this site <n> Write to us<n>

I was just watching TV when I saw a flash and looked out the window.  I had been looking for several seconds when I saw a circle shaped light out in the distance but fairly high in the sky.  then it turned green and dove for the mountains where it disappeared.  I kept watching the horizon but nothing else happened.  It freaked me out because it reminded me of the footage I have seen of bombs in the middle east.  thats why I had to report it.<n>

There was a Bright &#34;star&#34;. Then we saw it slowly but surely moving to the north. It was in the east. We looked through binoculars and saw red, green, white, yellow and blue lights. it was an oblong or disk shape. It was moving pretty fast. We tried to take pictures. My camera made some weird sounds and shut down after 4 shots. My mother, me, and my stepfather observed it for mare than an hour. We found it was too late and went to bed. But right before we left, we saw it bouncing around through the binoculars. I also thought i saw something bright shoot from the &#34;ufo.&#34; There was a slight haze around the object and it left a tiny trail. At time the object owuld also change light colors. We also saw an airplane race toward it. But then the airplane shifted lower, below the object.<n>

They moved at slow air speed. Each appeared to release what I thought might have been two parachutes. But I saw no person attached to them. Instead, I saw what looked like two tear-dropped, transparent shapes, almost the consistency of a bubble a kid would blow. After a minute, they vanished and the aircraft moved west. Then, from behind a cloud, came three more planes of the same description and they formed a five-across formation and headed west toward Morristown, N.J. Two minutes later, I heard a jet sweep through, but it was hidden behind clouds. But it sounded as if it were in pursuit. Five minutes later, four fighter jets joined the chase. That&#39;s it.<n>

There was one &#34;star&#34; in the sky at about eye level, not high or low, that was so bright that I assumed it was a plane.  No.  No other lights on it, just one bright white glow.  I stared at it until my eyes watered and I would look away for a moment close my eyes and re-open them, look back and stare again...same thing.  It seemed to hover but then move quickly slightly to its left then right.  It was far away and the distance it seemed to travel so quickly ruled out my second idea that it might be a helicopter.  So with nothing better to do at three in the morning I went outside, leaned on my car in the driveway and stared, unobstructed by the window screen into a clear clear night at this bright object...still there and I noticed at times a sparkle of light to its left and right or maybe my eyes tired from staring, I don&#39;t know.  I gave up and dismissed it as &#34;whatever&#34; until I found that there have been many reports of objects in Long Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We feel that a twinkling star, or stars, would be the first possible explanation that would have to be ruled out in this case.

Het licht stopte ook en bleef boven ons rondjes draaien. Dat heeft zich een keer of zes herhaald. Als wij stopten, dan stopte dat ding ook.&#34; &#34;Toen we linksaf richting Bladel sloegen, sloeg de ufo ook af. Het was een heel helder licht. Geef maar een flinke peut gas, zei ik tegen mijn vrouw. Maar het bleef ons volgen met een enorme snelheid, een streep licht. Toen wisten we zeker dat het geen laser kon zijn. Mijn vrouw werd bang. Ik durfde niet meer naar huis.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> First we thought that it was the lasershow of a nearby disco and we joked about it but when it kept following our car we realised that something wasnt right and we put the car on the side of the road. The light circled above us. When we drove again it went with us. This repeated for six times. When we went left, the UFO went left. The light was very bright and my wife said pull some more gas but that didnt make any difference. As we drove faster the ball shape craft transformed into a stripe of light. As we became more and more afraid and too frightened to go to our house, the light disappeared.<n>

The object shot across the sky very much like a shooting star, but part way through its flight, it suddenly made about an 80-degree turn and continued very quickly in a westerly direction across the sky.  It then went in a circle and seemed to zig-zag before it shot off across the sky and disappeared in the light pollution on the western horizon.  The object moved very quickly, and appeared to be very high up, leaving a faint tail.  It was bright and appeared to flash briefly once or twice.<n>

They then formed into a hourglass shape or two triangles and remained that way for about 5 min. Then changed again to a inverted L shape and started to travel east twordes the lake.They then changed again to two rows of two or  five on top of five with the outside two being farther north than the others. They stayed this way until out of site about 15 min time total. Approx. 5 minutes later two more came directly north to south past us at a much closer distance ( still one on top of the other) so we could see the shape was a triangle or possibly diamond.

The view was most sharp and clear, and the cylinder was probably more than 10,000 feet up, and perhaps several thousand feet below our plane (maybe much closer, depending on actual size).  The visibility was clear and sunny - I could see the farm squares below.  The object was a deep but bright orange-red.  It didn&#39;t seem to have a real cone of a nose, but more blunted.  There were no wings and nothing being exuded out the rear.  I pictured something like an old fashioned cylindrical 500 gallon water tank but twice or three times as long and painted red.  The paint didn&#39;t even give a feeling of sophisticated, just heavily enameled. I thought of a large military missile, but could not conceive of how it would be propelled in the air.  Because of the plane motion the object almost appeared to be still, but the ground scenery way below changed at a different rate as the ground relative to our wings.  I saw it for perhaps 30 to 45 seconds - when you are observing something that doesn&#39;t belong, time can be a difficult thing to judge ... I did not look at my watch, though I specifically examined its relationship with the plane and the ground.  I looked back and forth from the ground out from front of plane to back, I looked at the other people in the plane, and noone was paying any attention, then I went back to observing the object.  The scenery below was farm rectangles, with rare farmhouses and barns, which were tiny compared to the relatively near cylinder.  It struck me as odd that since I was in the air, not my normal world (I am a land lover), then perhaps it was wrong of me to make any assumptions about what was right or wrong about the appearance of this object in the air below the plane.  The noise of the turbo prop was so loud that it was impossible to talk to anyone else, and by the time we landed around 4PM in Fort Smith I was totally absorbed w! ith the new terminal which had just opened that week.<n>

Two smaller lights almosts appeared to be &#34;flapping&#34; and changing color but I could not say for certain because it moved so fast.   Light faded and dissapeared as it got further and further away.  My only terrestrial explanation would be a supersonic military aircraft (Edwards Airforce Base is in the desert about 50 miles from L.A.) but such craft usually do not fly over metropolitan L.A. and I would have heard a lot of jet noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The ISS did not orbit over L.A. on this date.

It seemed to fall a little way and then burn out like very large flare. Then Ilooked to my right and saw what at first resembled fireworks. Bright white, rapidly flashing lights. First I realized the the lights were not falling and burning out like fireworks. As my line of sight changed do to the road curving I could see that the light were aranged in a very big circular patternand were hovering high above the ground in one place. They never moved and eventaully they were obscured by the landscape. There were a lot of cars on the road and I know Im not the only person who saw it.

While I was turning a corner, a very brief (like just a split second) red laser like light went through a small cloud, turning the cloud an erie red color.  The light stopped for about two seconds, then resumed again, but this time it flashed (kind of like morse code) for about five more seconds.  If any of you people out there know morse code, it would have looked somewhat like this on paper ( -....--...---..----. ).  I was down wind from the light, and a small breeze brought kind of a sulfer like smell with it, but I&#39;m not quite sure if that was due to the light.<n>

When I got out of the car, The laser started again but this time it just kinda kept flashing like it was broken or something, but it kinda had a pattern to it.  While it was flashing, I followed the laser with my eyes up through a cloud it went through and I could see that it was coming out of a rectangle shaped craft.  It eventually stopped, and I kept on going home.  About two minutes later, a friend called my cell phone saying that he saw the same light from his house.

High above CA State University Los Angeles I saw what appeared to be UFO.  What I saw matches the photo of the UFO photographed in Las Cruces, NM.  It looked like a dome top and it was circular, it had lights around it and looked like it had an upside down triangle shaped bottom.  It was at a slight angle as it hovered so I was able to see it clearly.  I believe others on the freeway could see it as there was a bit of a jam and cars were slowing down, I believe, to look at it.  The evening was a bit hazy but I could see that there was something hovering over the university.  It was fairly high up and about the size of a small house, definitely bigger than a car.  I lost sight of it as I was trying to drive on the freeway and look for it.  It appeared that there was light emanating from the craft, I couldn&#39;t tell if the light was coming from the ground or from the craft itself.  If anyone could help and give me some info via email I would greatly appreciate it.<n>

I was not overly suspicious intially, however, when I walked past my large bedroom window nearly an hour later, the 3 objects were still &#34;in a holding pattern&#34; and had not moved much.  My curiosity took hold and I continued to watch these objects more closely, noticing slight vertical movement and some side to side, as well as a turning motion, detectable by a &#34;spot light&#34; appearance that was easy to follow.  You could visibly see the beam of light it cast on the tall pine trees, and other objects it hightlighted as the light moved around on the ground.  I made my husband, whom has aa pilot&#39;s license, take a look at what I was watching. He is comfortalble with his knowledge about aircraft and the type and colors of lights used and he was not sure what it was...??? He said, jokingly, maybe the Airforce has Stealth&#39;s out doing training missions, and decided not to let this mind go crazy with what he witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These three objects also cast a large triangle &#34;spot -light&#34; image together, as well as alternating red and white flashing lights.  These objects continued to hover but noticeably moving about mainly an up and down pattern.  I couln&#39;t believe what I saw next.  It looked fairly close in proximity, however it was grounded&#34; or in the tree-line but definately not up in the air.  Viewing what I would describe as some kind of communicating, interacting, or transfering of energy, or light, or light source, electricity, or something.  They were responding only one at a time with the &#34;ground source&#34; with flashing, mirror like explosions of light with the ground source giving off an orangish, red but yet silvery strobe bright light that was visible for miles.  After this went on for 30 min or better, the object seemed playful in moving around a bit more in relevence to distance moving.  Then if slowly ascended into the southeast rising higher and higher, I was very amazed an unsure of what exactly I was wathching, and before I went to bed I took note of how the other 2 objects were still flashing and spinning slightly, and I noticed they had remained pretty stationary, with a slight pull towards the place of the prior object.  I wish I could have waited this whole ordeal out.…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are baffled by this report.  Ordinarily, we would first suspect the witness was observing twinkling stars, but if the one object did, in fact, rise and drift off, at least that object was not a star.  PD))<n>

The others flew away at an amazing high speed.  Some kind of military personel took the rubble away it was like they didnt want anyone seeing what had crashed.

I saw a flash or light that appeared to be at a very high altitude. The light would flash rather brightly every 1-2 seconds, as the object moved across the sky at a very high rate of speed. The object flew in a straight path with no unnusual maneuvers. What really got my attention was the intensity of the light flashing, and the high rate of speed of the object. I am a licensed commercial pilot, and I am familiar with the flight characteristics of both civilian and military aircraft, and I am not familiar with any aircraft that can travel at that rate of speed. The flash of light was different than the high intensity strobes you see on aircraft. It was more like a yellowish/red pulse. The object was not visable between flashes, but it was amazing the distance that the object traveled between flashes. The object traveled from the west to the east, and the trees finally obscured my vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your interest. The object (light) was moving from the West to the East. The object appeared to travel in a straight path. The speed of this object makes me doubt that it was a satellite, or other debris in orbit. When I first saw the object as it flashed, I fixed my eyes towards that location as it disappeared. I was shocked to see it reappear much further away from where I had originally seen it.<n> <n><n> I have had two other unusual sightings in the past, so I am kind of keep an eye out for unusual activities in the sky. One of the sightings was in the 1980s when I used to fly a considerable amount. We were flying a Piper Navajo to Key west late in the afternoon and we witnessed an unknown craft of rather large proportions at 10000 feet. It was partially obscured by the clouds but seemed to be stationary. It was definitely not a Lenticular cloud. The sighting was very brief. The other sighting that I had was in 1997. I was traveling on Hwy 278 Near Savannah River Site in South Carolina when I saw a glowing object maneuver at low altitude at a slow steady speed, and abruptly shoot straight up into the sky. Again the sighting was very brief.  This about sums it up. Thank you for your attention. Regards,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END FOLLOW-UP))<n>

I stopped the lady getting out of the car next to mine and had her look at them she looked at them for a second  said they werent  ufos and walked away. I asked  her if they mighet be birds and she said they looked very high and were just little black dots to her. well I do not know  what they were but thought  you might be able to find out from the airport if they had any strange flights high bove the air port  that day. I thought they might be large bird and not thet high but the formation they flew didnt sit  right with me.I am a military brat and spent a tour in the Navy sort of remember how planes fly and grew up duck hunting in Louisiana done quite a bit of watching birds fly also. cant say it wasnt birds but would like to  hear if the air port  says they had anything on their radar<n>

Movement was steady and very fast. I know what airplanes look like in the night sky. This was entirely different. I never have seen anything like this before. I saw several other objects moving at rapid speed with unusual movement just minutes after first sighting.<n>

As we got closer we realized it was not a plane but a rectangular figure. We slowly came to a stop. it was headed south. when we stopped we noticed it had very bright lights. the lights were greenish blue, white, and  red. Sudenly the object made a sharp 180 degree turn. this made the object come right for us. when it got above us it started to shine light on us. Since my friend got really scared, she told me to go as fast as i could and go into the garage. But i did not listen. instead i went up my driveway and noticed that the object had turned anither 90 degrees and was begining to follow us. So my friend and i got off the 4 wheeler and went to get my mom and brother. By this time the object had picked up speed and shot across the sky. I begged my friend to get back on the 4 wheeler and when she finally did we went to the other side of my house where the object went. we went back to park it and my friend got really scared and got off the 4 wheeler and ran in the house. As i was parking the 4 wheeler i noticed the lights again. so i called for my friend, but she did not come. As i looked at it more it began to dissapear. it did not go out of my sight. it never move farther along the sky. it just vanished. we haven&#39;t seen it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise present!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

I looked up at the sky and saw a large, egg shaped, glowing orb in the sky. It slowly moved around in a clockwise motion, as if it was hovering over or searching for a specific object. It was glowing very brightly, and that made it hard to get a clear view at the object. I checked the sky and saw that the sun was not yet up, so it could not have been that. It lasted for about 20 seconds (23estimate) and then disappeared, moving faster than I have ever seen anything move before.<n>

10/1/02 22:30|Riverton|UT|Unknown|2 minutes|Red and blue flashing lights, low to the ground, behind my car on a deserted road in Riverton, Utah.|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57990.html|306|ndxe200210| Red and blue flashing lights, low to the ground, behind my car on a deserted road in Riverton, Utah.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling South on Redwood Road, coming up on the area of Camp Williams military base. I passed another car that was headed North, and I remember feeling really bad because I left my high-beams on, because the headlights in my car would only work in the high-beam position, and only if I held it in that position manually. The car passed, though, and went around a bend, and there were no other cars on the road. I remember it was very dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, I began to see the flash of red and blue lights illuminating the area. I thought I was getting pulled over for leaving my high-beams on, so I started to look for a safe place to pull over. As I slowed down, I looked in my rearview mirror, and I could see actual flashing red and blue lights, and I looked over my shoulder and saw them in the rear window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute, I found a place where there was enough of a shoulder on the road to pull over. I pulled over and put the car in park, and then I noticed that there were no longer any flashing lights. I looked all around. There was no car behind me. I was completely alone on the road. I just sat there, wondering what that was all about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I sat there, I replayed the incident in my mind. I could visualize the red and blue flashing lights as they appeared through my rear window. All of a sudden it occurred to me that there were no headlights. There had been no headlights below the red and blue flashing lights! I started to panic. In fact, I was just plain terrified at that point. I knew that something very out of the ordinary had just happened to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so scared, I didn’t know what to do. I grabbed my cell phone and called my husband, at home. I explained what had just happened, and he told me to put the car in drive and drive home fast. He was scared too. As I spoke to him, I tried to gather my thoughts. I tried to tell him all the tiny details of what had just happened, so I would remember it all. I was scared and confused, and felt like I needed to go through it all and figure it out. In doing so, I recalled distinctly that there had been no headlights. There was no flash of white light, as it would have appeared if a car had turned around and their headlights swung around in the turn. There was no indication of a car pulled over further behind me, although it was very dark and I may not have seen it if there was. Everything I recalled then and everything I recall now is just completely puzzling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living near Camp Williams, in Eagle Mountain, had afforded us many opportunities to see military helicopters of all sorts. For a few minutes I thought that perhaps it might have been a helicopter, but I have been below low flying helicopters before, and I know what that sounds like. I was even buzzed by a low flying Blackhawk one night as my husband and I drove down the highway, so I know how it sounds when one is close. The thing that kept coming back to me as I recalled the bizarre occurrences of that evening is that there was no sound. As close as those lights were to my vehicle, I know I would have heard the sound, if it had been a helicopter. It was close enough that I saw the source of the flashing lights in both my rearview mirror and in my rear window. Whatever it was, it was very low to the ground and very close to my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always held a neutral position regarding the ideas of extra-terrestrials and UFOs. I have neither believed, nor disbelieved in them. I’ve enjoyed watching sci-fi shows, but it was always just silly fun to me. I’ve never really considered myself a “believer”. That night my skepticism really dropped to an all-time low. I’m still not really what you would call a “believer”, but I’m a great deal closer to it since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I noticed a sattelite, nothing out of the norm. Then right near it another sattelite. I expected the two to drift apart, but they moved together. I assumed I was looking at two stars and I saw some sort of optical illusion. Until I noticed a third object. The three formed a near perfect isosceles triangle and moved in perfect formation from west to east. As they travelled east and reached near the zenith point in the sky, almost directly above (not a menacing abduction type above, but a general straight up), the lead object appeared to stop and vanish. As the following two reached the same vicinity they too vanished. The objects were very high in the atmosphere, if not above the atmosphere.<n>

It was illuminating beneath almost like the cars with the neon lights below. It was just hovering there, I almost wrecked my car twice because I could just not take my eyes off it. It was just hovering there! I felt fear, my heart started pounding in my chest and I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe and almost broke a sweat.

Oct1st at 7:45pm myself and a good friend were in our backyard watching a US fighter jet patrolling the airspace above New York being this was the 1st game of the Yankee Playoff series with Anaheim.  On it&#39;s first pass it made a loop coming from over the harbor, then just passed the Verranzano, looped back around the Verranzano and then back over the harbor, over Brooklyn, creating a circle pattern that was quite obvious..the 1st pass was normal, the 2nd pass was normal also..but on the 3rd pass we saw something that wasn&#39;t normal..and immediately I said to my friend &#34; Do you see that green light follwing that fighter jet !!&#34;  he responded ,&#34; yeah, it looks like a bright green star !!!&#34;..And what we saw was what appeared to be a bright green star following directly behind this fighter jet..., only by a short distance, but to the lower left hand side of it...and every move the jet made, this thing was right there with it, flying almost effortlessly..in addition we only heard the engine sound from the one jet..we had watched it make two prior passes..<n> <n><n> <n><n> the lights on the jet were blinking white &amp; red on top and had visible port and starboard wing lights...the object that was tailing it on the third pass was a bright green light only..it followed the jet as it turned back towards the Verranzano and on the fighter&#39;s 4th pass, the light was gone..and my friend and I were astonished as to what we witnessed...I surely hope we weren&#39;t the only people who saw this..<n>

Time aproximately 3pm and the date was somewhere between late winter of 2002 and early spring of 2003.  It was a bright beautiful afternoon. We were driving south on hiway 95 and we were just about {either just before or just after the county line}  The hiway is two lanes heading to the south and one lane heading to the north.  It is a rural area and the hiway is lined with tall trees and farm land on either side.  We were a[pox. 4 miles north of them small town of Athol.  As we rounded a bend to the left-hanging in the sky at just about tree top heigth was something unusual.  It was not moving.  And it didn&#39;t make a sound.  It just hung there.  It was long enough to stretch from one side of the hiway{3 lanes} to the other.At tree top heigth. Not moving and totally silent.  It was tear drop shaped and seemed to be a high polished chrome color. No windows were visible. And there were no wings. It cast a hugew shadow on the ground in which our carm passed through.  As we reacherd the other side we could see other cars veering off the road so I know we were not alone in this sighting.  As we looked back after passing through the shadow we couyld see nothing...as if it had never been there at all...We heard nothing as it left.  At first we hadm a hard time admitting even to ourselves what we had seen.  But we know by the other cars pulled off the road, we were not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I know this was around the time I earned my driver’s license, but the date may be off by a year or so.  Sorry for the inconvenience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, I was living in Winslow AZ, and two friends and I were driving to Flagstaff in the late afternoon to catch a movie.  I was sitting in the back seat, passenger’s side. We were traveling west on I-40, coming up on the Leupp exit. This is the first exit after Winslow, traveling west.  At this exit, there is a large butte.  I’m not sure how tall the butte is, but here is a link to google maps where you can see the actual google photo of the butte.  There is a car and a couple of road signs in the picture to help with the scale of the photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=35.065833,-110.825272&amp;spn=0,0.084543&amp;z=14&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=35.069161,-110.834558&amp;panoid=--tNYYmSTeVgXLV4q9Gpgw&amp;cbp=12,0,,0,5<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached this exit and butte, we were startled by the sight of what appeared to be a hovering commercial airplane to the right of the car.  Just an average airplane, only without any insignia or markings.  We could clearly see the windows, without people in them.  Not only was it hovering, but it was incredibly low.  Only two or three times the height of the butte off the ground, less than 1000 feet.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said, this took place during the afternoon, and well within the sight of the highway. It was practically hovering over the exit ramp.  There were tons of people pulled over on the side of the road, going in both directions.  They were talking about it, some on their phones, others were taking pictures. We were too scared to stick around to see what would happen next, so we kept driving.  I remember turning around in my seat to watch it out of the back window.  It stayed in the same position until I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How many people must drive on that major interstate in the afternoon on any given day during a 15-30 minute period? My guess is about 500.   Everyone who drove by saw it, it was impossible not to. I’m hoping one of those people will remember seeing this too, possible post a picture.  I have never been able to find any documentation of the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/1/02 13:35|Karavostasi (Greece)||Cross|1 minute|a look-through aircraft a la 'predator'|12/14/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40974.html|316|ndxe200210| a look-through aircraft a la &#39;predator&#39;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a danish citizen, and the observation happened as I was on a vacation in Greece. Being a reporter I felt, that I had to report it to some &#39;professionals&#39;, and I&#39;ve tried that, but learned the hard lesson that nobody really cares.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the first of October 2002 on the isle of Folegandros, which is situated in the south-western Cyclades, I observed a strange aircraft while I was lying on my back on some coastal rocks a little south of Karavostasi. It moved south at a relatively slow speed at an altitude of about 3000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was completely transparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to point out, that I have often seen how aircrafts under certain weather conditions seem to blend into the sky - even a clear blue one. However, living in cold Denmark you go out and splay yourself in the sun as often as you can during summer. The beach I use is one mile from the Int. airport of Copenhagen, so I&#39;ve studied aircrafts a lot lying on my back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed this one as it ploughed through a lowhanging white cloud. I was puzzled by it&#39;s shape, which I could see as a shadow on the &#39;belly&#39; of the cloud. It looked like a big fat cross, the nose and wings round like the shape of a trefoil and the body rather plump and short.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it might be some kind of veteran aeroplane, so I waited for it to emerge from the cloud. When it did, the &#39;mouth&#39; of the cloud seemed to start whirling like a washing machine, and I was shocked to see, that the &#39;thing&#39; coming out was completely look-through or invisible apart from a tiny blurry outline much like that of a soap-bubble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The background sky was blue with fleecy clouds, and I could see these clouds right through the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed over me, and I was struggling to keep my eyes on the ghostly thing, it cast a shadow on me too. After a very short period I simply couldn&#39;t see it anymore. And when I say &#39;see&#39; I mean the blurry outline.

It seem to be going around my same speed . I was going around 60 or 70 mph. it would speed up and go slightly ahead and then slow down again and stay with me. I at first thought it had to be some odd reflection but it then abruptly stopped and darted off to the west . I followed it until it was to far or too fast to see. That first encounter lasted about 5 to 7 mins . I was calling a friend to tell them of what had happened when suddenly it was back again. It again stayed about 5 mins and then shot off like nothing i had ever seen and seemed to be gone for good. I never have seen anything like it and i wonder if anyone else had seen something similar. i was sure it would be on the news or something but i never heard a thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One particular evening, the object appeared in the southwestern sky, clearly visible in the twilight. I observed it slowly (very, very slowly) moving from south to north for a period of about ten minutes (to hazard a guess, I would say it moved about an inch from my perspective in the sky). I walked into our barn to feed our animals, and about three minutes later when I walked out, the object was due west, having moved significantly in that short amount of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It can also be observed off to the southeast sometimes in the morning, and it usually does the same thing. Look away for a few minutes, and it will have moved significantly across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know for sure that it isn&#39;t a form of aircraft (such as the MedFlight that flies around every now and again) because there was no sound emitted.

It swept across only that part of the sky and was moving in a slight arc at a fast, constant speed. It most resembled a meteor, except for its bright green color. It had about the luminescence of a Fourth of July &#34;sparkler.&#34; At this time, to the north, a &#34;northern lights&#34; display was occuring, so I figured at the time that a meteor had been colored in some way by that northern lights event. Then I heard on the radio that a green object had been spotted south of Seattle earlier in that 5 o&#39;clock hour, so I thought I would contribute this perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable meteor.

I stopped to look up at the Orion constelation and find a star that usually appears to be flashing red, white and blue this time of year just bellow and north of it...I dont know why i do that... it is just is interesting to me.  This time I saw something that has permanently changed my mind about all the UFO stories. Just the south of me i noticed a VERY faint pumpkin orange glow and thought i was going to get to see a meteor start up as i turned my head slightly i realized that there were 5 very square shaped glowing patches in a v shape heading north slightly south and east of were i was standing. I intently tried to focus my sight on this and realized that as they were moving the stars behind were blocked out in a very black v area behind them and that the faint orange squares were more rectangular and bent over the leading edge of a wing like structure...try as i might i could not get any other visual ques as to the exact shape of what was going by right in front of me. I was trying to get an idea of the trailing shape but could not because as the stars would reapear behind it they seemed distorted, like in a mirage, by wave like disruption of the star light. I stood there fixed in total disbeleif of what i was seeing! As it passed almost over me and in front of me it made NO SOUND what so ever! I would guess that it was was about half again bigger than a stealth bomber(which i have seen flying over head at the Air Force Academy graduation twice, only about 40miles from here) and about 1500 feet off the ground, I had the impression for a second that it was a stealth bommber gliding but it was a little too big and there is no where close in that direction for it to glide to. as it passed to my left the orange glowing patches became almost impossible to see on the bottom edge of it and became smaller as though they were on the front edge of a wing but still absolutely no sound! I couldnt keep an eye on ! it after a few more seconds since there were no more visable stars in that area to see it blocking them. I stood there for 5 to 10 minutes looking all over trying to see if it would come back, but it never did. I would guess that it was traveling about 2 to 3 times faster than the C130s we have fly over us all the time and was about twice the wing span. I couldnt tell any thing beyond that it looked generaly like a flying wing since there was nothing but the 5 orange patches and the blacked out shape behind them. The orange patches were extremely faint, less bright than the stars of Orions belt, as if they were reflectors instead of lights, but i cant figgure out what they could have reflected since it is still pretty dark at 5:30am. I would love to know what it realy was if anyone knows. I would guess it was putting out a lot of heat to make the stars seem wavy but how does it do it with absolutely no noise? If thisv is government or visitor??? I would be quicker to beleive a government secret but I may never know for sure. If any-one does know please tell me mysteries drive me nuts!<n>

I was always very observent of strange weather so I watched the fog &#34;roll&#34; in.  In the fog I noticed a bright light peering thru the fog.  I just thought it was a helicopter flying low because of a car acciedent or something.  I continued to watch it and began to grow brighter and brighter like it was getting very close to my house.  When it was in the air over my neighborhood it was so bright I couldn&#39;t see the helicopter I thought it was.  All I thought was the spot light on it was pointing my way.  I left the window and turned on the scanner to listen what was going on and nothing indicated any thing was going on, in fact the chat on the scanner was very odd.  The police and station personel were laughing and joking around with no normal police codes being said with very personal like conversations going on.  When I went back to the window was when a stunning, in shock like feeling came over me wi! th what I saw then. A brillient gold like light was hovering approx. 20&#39; above the trees and I yelled fo my girlfreind to come look and when she got to the window, before I said anything about what I was seeing I asked her what she was seeing.  When she explained the &#34;light&#34; as I was seeing it I grew terrified.  Then I saw another light not as bright but still brilliant gold like and the same size.  With this one I could make out the shape of the lit up object.  It was a crooked tear drop shape, moving slow and not realy in one direction or at least not in a straight line.  Finally I heard somthing that made sence on the scanner &#34;do you guys see the light up toward the hill&#34;?  I waited for a responce but nothing.  Infact, nothing the rest of the night.  But back to the &#34;lights&#34;, and third one apeered and this time the three I could see were shining a &#34;super&#34; spot light or beam in a patrolling like matter toward the houses, ground, and trees.  No sound realy came from them b! ut, I could almost feel them flying kind of like a train in th! e far di stance that you can&#39;t hear but on a calm quiet night you can feel a train coming.  I ran from windo to window looking for more of the &#34;lights&#34; but couldn&#39;t see any out the other side of the house.  What I did see is light in the air like a stop light colors, three total. I huddled in the corner for some of this night terrified the spot beam would point see me.  The presun rise was starting to light up the sky and the fog and the lights all disapeared and the scanner went back to normal.  There are other details about other strange things I saw that night like I could see in the distant the line of tail lights toward the highway all seemed to be parked or stopped.  I don&#39;t know what I experienced that night but this site I found tonight seems perfect to get this of my chest and see if I feel better about it.  If I try to tell someone like a friend about this they look at me like I am on drugs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

But the fire went out and through the dark I could see a circular object moving through the sky still at a fast rate of speed.  This thing was moving.

The formation is wave like shape with many small lights within the formation. The formation moved forth and back in a westerly direction. The formation flipped around each time as it moved back and forth. However, each time when it flipped, I couldn&#39;t tell its exact shape. As the formation moved over Exchange Square, my view was blocked. However, in a matter of minute, I noticed the formation moved high up above the Exchange Square. As it moved high up into the sky, the formation broke out into smaller crafts of different shapes...some in sort of triangular, and some round.... The lights from each craft also lessen somewhat. The crafts flew into opposite directions of each other and disappeared into the sky at speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an investment banker working at a Chinese Bank in a ((deleted)) Director level heading off the ((deleted)) Dept.
