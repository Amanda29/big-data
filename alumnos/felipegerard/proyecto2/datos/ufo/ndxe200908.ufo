The thing is, is that we have seen it three times now.  Tonight it was around midnight, on July 23, it was around 11pm, and we saw it first in June.  It was around midnight again, but we thought that was going to be a one and only sighting!  Seeing it again in July made me start logging it down. This light spends several minutes at a time  just sitting in one position.  Then it leaves, all three times in a different direction, at a good rate of speed.<n>

It was at a low altitude (approx. 5,000-10,000 feet)and moving at a high rate of speed and with no noise.  I followed it visually until it passed out of sight behind the tall hedges at the rear of my property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I doubt it was a meteorite since I have seen plenty in my time.  The trajectory was all wrong for this altitude since it was travelling across the horizon rather than downwards. I have also witnessed a natural fireball fall to earth and this lacked the material (&#34;sparks&#34; and flames) trailing behind it. I have seen countless types of aircraft (military, private, commercial) travelling at all sorts of altitudes, at all times of day and in all weather conditions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not an aircraft.  Travelling in front of me left to right, I should not have been able to see the cockpit light or the landing lights that brightly from the side. I did not see any standard anti-collision lights either which would have been plainly visible at that altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I doubled-checked my glasses to see if I had mistaken the sphere for a reflection off the lenses of my glasses from the moon. I couldn&#39;t recreate the effect myself.<n>

Most of the time they are just riding the wind and will make a few turns. The thing that caught my eye here was the fact it was flying in a straight line with no evidence of any wings moving. I tried to see if there were any wings at all and there were none. I watched the object between 1 and 3 minutes fly from south to north against the wind! The temperature was about 78 degrees and winds were 5 to 10 from the north and a little east. It was difficult to tell how high the object was, but my estimate would be between 1000’ and 5000’. The size of the object would have been that of an airliner flying at about 10,000’.  The object I observed was jet black, not shinny.  I do not know if there was any sound because I was running equipment on the back of my work truck.  I think I have a photo on my cell phone but am not sure how to transfer from phone to computer.<n>

We observed what we thought was a bright star as we were driving down the road, all of a sudden the bright light turned bright green and shot straight down into the woods near by. At first I thought it was a flare but there was NO arch on top. The object looked like an orb or a circular light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t fall to the ground, it shot to the ground fast. It was the brightest green I have ever seen. My wife, both my children and myself saw this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With-in a few seconds we saw an approaching aircraft flying towards the airport near our city, it appeared that the object was getting out of sight. This wasn&#39;t a firework or flare as we could tell, because of the straight line it made into the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Near sunset, so the reflection seemed a copper color; at first they were spread apart but then grouped tightly in a formation.  I thought it was birds at first but way too fast.  Most profound was how totally quiet it was.<n>

I counted at least 7 but there could&#39;ve been as many as 12.  The lights would come and go like fire-flys.  It looked like bee&#39;s swarming around a nest.  They were all moving at incredibly high speed doing loops and rolls, but not like an airplane could.  All the turns were incredibly tight.  It&#39;s been about thirty minutes and its still going on.  I wish I had a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Jokingly I mentioned they were UFO’s.  We both watched the lights for a while believing them to be airplanes passing through cloud cover, headlights reflecting on the clouds (although they were fairly close to each other).  The intersection was coming off a dead-end road and it was 1 in the morning, so it wasn’t busy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were quite large; we watched them drift with the movement of the clouds, nearly matching its pace.  The light being emitted covered large spaces in both locations, though no craft could be detected.  The light’s intensity made it seem that it was too bright to be a star reflecting on the clouds, especially since it was visible in two different but close locations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less than 2 minutes of watching them their intensity began to fade until they disappeared, shortly after we noticed 1 either appear or reappear quite far away but in the direction tha! t the clouds/craft were moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first I thought it was lightning because it was kind of muggy out but when I turned around to see if it might be I looked up and I saw a bright trail of light that slowly dissipated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trail of light lasted about 30 seconds and disappeared.

My roomate and myself were smoking a cigarette. He jumped up and exclaimed &#34;what the **** is that!?.&#34;   Looking up, we both noticed a cigar shaped line of neon blue, almost LED lights.  The lights stretched the entire width (from what we could see). The lights would also start to glow brighter, then dim back down.  This happened throughout the entire event.  The craft was coming from the North, East of us, and slowly heading South. Because it was dark and the moon was out, after a few minutes it was hard to keep an eye on without using our peripheral vision alone.  The last thing we noticed, was the craft did not follow the curve of the earth as it went south. It stayed in a single location in the sky, yet grew smaller and harder to see.<n>

The light seems to change color and hovers and then makes eraatic moves no known earthly craft can make. It makes vertical, circles and drops that in the given time frame and distance to the object it would not be possible even for a scramjet aircraft. The g force would cause a blackout.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did get a still shot with a 10 megapixel camera. It did not show up well on the video when I tried to sue the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stopped the car, put on our flashers and exited the vehicle to get a better look.  There was a procession of approximately 20 to 25 of these lights that seemed to be travelling from the southwest and moving northeast across the night sky in clusters of two and three at a time with short intervals in between. They were definitely not airplanes or helicopters. They were clearly visible, yet there were no distinctive markings. The color seemed strangely ambiguous. They seemed both white and red at the same time, yet not flickering. That was my personal perception, although my wife seemed to perceive a faint flicker. They each disappeared off into the clouds one by one in the sky northeast of us. There was absolutely! no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both witnessed this event.  Neither one of us could come up with a logical explanation of what we were viewing.  Although several cars passed us, no one else stopped or slowed to take notice of what we were looking at. I doubt highly that there is any connection of significance to the fact that we heard consistent gunfire in the area, but I will state it here as a point of fact.  We are in an area where there seems to be frequent recreational gunfire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called my sister to describe what we were seeing, but she did not see any activity over her house roughly 30 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in the town of Greenville, NY 12771. We share a zip code with Port Jervis, NY and obviously are very close to that town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not feel threatened or scared by what we saw. It was a spectacularly uncommon site. If there is a logical explanation for it, we’d be curious to know what it is. If not, we feel very fortunate to have viewed such a unique event.<n>

No real detail 99% of the time with some brilliant exceptions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I routinely see UFO&#39;s in the Chicago skies.  On this particular night I saw at least seven from approx. 21:30 to 22:30 hrs.  What I have observed is that in that time frame from one to three objects come in from the south going north and decend at the same place every time I observe this (between hwy 83 and 355).  I can only guess but if these objects are in fact landing the only place where there is any cover to the north within that &#34;corridor&#34; is a large forest preserve - Busse Woods which is about 15-20 miles to the north.  I use a 10X-50 Nikon binocular to track these objects.  Last night as I was following one going north I observed another much higher going to the south cross in my field of view.  This is so common with a few observations being so remarkable all one has to do is position a time-lapse camera in the night sky and capture the &#34;traffic jam&#34; in the Chicago skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved at a moderate pace, like that of a satellite, across the sky and glowed as if it was on fire. There was no distinct tail like on a comet and it was much slower than a falling meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it traveled westerly towards us from the east it grew slightly bigger.  Closer to the middle was extremely bright orange.  It continued to move westerly, than started turning in a southerly direction across the sky and began to slowly get smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, a satellite traveling in a northerly direction passed near the unknown object.  There was a distinct difference between the size of the tiny satellite and the large object.  At the same time, a plane was traveling easterly, toward the unknown object.  The plane was blinking in the night sky and was distinctly different and smaller than the unknown object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The unknown object continued in a southerly direction as its large glow dimmed  and eventually the object was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked up the Space Shuttle and International Space Station logs on NASA website for viewing times in our area.  We observed the object at 9:30 pm U.S. Central time and on the NASA website it shows that shuttle is viewable at 5:05 am and the international space station is visible at 4:50 am.  These times do not correlate to our sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We were very surprised to find that the last three photos show two deer being &#34;spot-lighted&#34;. by a bluish-white beam from above.  The beam first shines on both deer together, then on just one after it moves to the left, then on the other back to the right.  The beam definitely moved and encompassed only on the deer themselves, and never lighted the ground beneath the deer.  In two of the pictures it appears that the camera flash reflects off the beam.  We have no explanation for the beam of &#34;light&#34; that appears in these images.  What is shown in the images is exactly as they came off the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The images were taken with a Moultrie digital game camera.  The camera is mounted on a tree 6 feet above the ground and about 20-25 feet from where the deer were standing at the time the images were taken (an exact measurement to the inch can be taken if needed).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled the chip about 4 hours after the time on the photos and noticed nothing odd at that time.  I have since gone back and taken a digital photo of the tree canopy from the location the deer were standing and looking up at about the same angle the beam was coming down.  As close as I can tell the beam came from an angle about 20 degrees south-west of nadir.  The canopy at that location is almost solid as shown in the additional image taken a few days later.  In our opinion, there is no way a helicopter spotlight could possibly have generated the beams caught in our digital photos.  Also, we considered the possibility of an insect on the camera lens, but since the lens is separated from the flash, an insect on ! the lens should have just made the image blurry and would not appear as a bright light following the deer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Images 1-3: Deer and beam Image 4 : Tree canopy Image 5: Normal image from this camera<n>

It was about 4 times brighter and about twice the size of what Venus is viewed as from the same viewing location. We watched as the light (indiscernible shape due to brightness of light) moved along and through the treetops seemingly not far from our home location. It swooped back and forth as if scanning, or &#34;looking around&#34;. It seemed as if the light was mostly on one side because as it swooped it the light would seem to face away and then back towards us. But not like a helicopter, it seemed as if the whole face of the thing was light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the sun came up I noticed a couple other small crafts seemingly interacting with the larger one. They were the size of what we observe as satellites on other nights, but one seemed to be orbiting the large light and the other went off to the right of the light and came back to it within minutes. The craft moved in a climbing pattern to the right over about a 15 minute time period and then we watched it get smaller and smaller as we could tell it was leaving but it was leaving directly away from us, we lost visual as the huge bright light (still immensely bright even with the sun rising) became a speck in the upper outer atmosphere..<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other odd thing about this sighting (not sure if it is related but I feel worth noting) was that the whole time there was a glowing orange light off to the left that we thought might have been a neighbors light (even though it DID seem closer than the nearest neighbor..) but we haven&#39;t seen it since that morning.<n>

( the previous one was east) It was pretty bright. it had had a slight green glow around it. after these sightings we spent a little over an hour watching the sky, there was no more activity so we went home.<n>

It was VERY STRANGE.. all of us KNEW it was not a blimp or some human type of aircraft.  It almost looks like a ball of fire yet it was &#34;flying&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling in a direct south direction and as I said was totally silent.  I know it had to be a UFO, all of us did.  I have checked online for any other reports and have not come up with any.  This was by far the trangest thing any of us have every seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took about 10 minutes to travel about 1 mile south of us.  We had a LONG time to try to figure out what it was.  The longer we watched it the more were were convinced it was something NOT from earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Really cool to see and I&#39;m glad I wasn&#39;t alone and then having people think I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date corrected above.

We watched for about 40 seconds trying to figure out what it was when suddenly it sped up and disappeared out of site. Whatever it was made no noise whatsoever.We are used to a lot of airline traffic overhead and helicopters coming and going from the local hospital but if there is no sound the aircraft is very high and the lights very small and this seemed low enough we should have heard it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A day later someone reported in the local newspaper that they saw an orange flame in the sky. She was directly south-southeast of us by a few blocks. I imagine what she was seeing was the craft when it sped up and it became a blur before it disppeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is there a military craft with lights like this that makes no noise? One that can also move slowly and then take off at warp speed?<n>

I wasn’t going to report my sighting, mainly because I was unsure of what I saw, but after viewing this television program, I instantly changed my mind because the orbs that were shown in the show were the same type of orbs that my boyfriend and I saw in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend was driving me home one evening, I’m not too positive on the date, but I’m sure it was between August 28th and September 10th, and I’m almost positive that it was on a Saturday or Sunday.  The time was around 9:00pm central, when we came to an intersection and saw these orbs in the sky.  There had to have been at least 15 of them, but no more than 30.  Due to the fact that we were on the road, we were unable to stop, but I was able to turn my head to keep my eye on these objects. I pointed them out to my boyfriend who saw these orbs as well.  The orbs didn’t appear to move, but just sit there in the sky.  Some were a bright, bright bluish color, others were white with a reddish-orange tint to it, the rest were simply white.  All of these orbs were illuminated. The area of the sky where the orbs were seen was lit up with almost a reddish-pink glow.  I could tell for a matter of fact that it could not have been aircraft from one of the neighboring airports due to the la! ck of mobility in the orbs and the simple matter that there were far too many in the sky to be aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued driving down the road, and I had these objects in sight for at least 7 minutes until we turned down my street and went down a hill.  As we neared the bottom of the hill, I got a clear view of these orbs again, trying to get my boyfriend to pull over so I could take a picture, the only problem being I had to be home at a particular time, and time was running terribly short, so short that he couldn’t stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned to my house and went inside due to my curfew, fearing that I would be grounded if I was late.  My boyfriend and I never went back outside to look for these orbs, frankly, because we were both too scared of what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 17 year old female and a senior in high school.  I have no occupation of any sort, nor do I participate in any extra curricular activities.  My boyfriend is a 20 year old male who dropped out of high school and is searching for a job.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

This was probably around mile marker 65 on I-35, but at the time I didn’t think to check my exact location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 8:40 pm, a light was visible out the front window of my car, but toward the right side.  I’d estimate it was approximately 30 degrees right of straight ahead.  This means it was probably approximately straight west of my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was dark.  I saw a white fireball descending diagonally as it moved from right to left.  It looked to me like what I would expect a meteor to look like, and initially it moved in a straight line.  It produced a white light and had a tail of “sparks” behind it as it moved, like a comet.  It looked something like certain kinds of fireworks I have seen that carry a flare and trail sparks behind.  From time to time, it appeared that a burning chunk would break off and fall behind into the tail because the main light would flare up a! little bit and a brighter portion would then be visible moving into the tail portion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So far, it appeared to me to be a meteor.  However, after it descended traveling from right to left, it leveled off and proceeded to the left while climbing again.  Once it had climbed again, it appeared to stop in the air for a while before moving down and to the right.  It moved around several times, remaining visible for what was probably 2-3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally it rose up, stopped trailing its tail, and became small and indistinguishable from a star in both size and color.  It was then obscured by some trees I drove past and I wasn’t able to determine if it was still there after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t see it move again.<n>

From there one can see the sun set over Cape Cod Bay, making it one of the few spots on the east coast where one can see the sun set over water, though in actuality it may be setting over the Massachusetts mainland about 30 miles distant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear evening, as a high pressure area had just arrived within 24 hours. There were no large clouds to speak of but the normal atmospheric haze of pollutants made for a beautiful sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun set about 7:10 pm EDT, and about 10 minutes after that I began scanning the western horizon with binoculars to glory in the subtle shadings of red and orange in the vicinity of the sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On one particular scan, I was panning left (south) and came across what to me initially looked like a passenger plane descending in the direction of Boston’s Logan Airport. It was about the right size for a large jet in the distance.  It was about one binocular field over the water. By the way the binoculars are 8 x 40&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made the mental note of “plane” and continued panning south looking at the subtle atmospheric shadings as well as at boats and sea birds. I then began panning back to the right (north) and came across the ‘plane’ in what seemed to be the exact same location as before. I looked more closely at it and could detect no wings, it looked like a very dark rectangle set against the lighter orange-red haze. It was above the lowest darkest haze lines, the rectangle shape was distinctive, outlined against the lighter orange colored haze – definitely an object over the water – but closer to me than the coast of Plymouth, MA, visible in the far distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked myself if this could be a plane after all, but I looked even harder to discern any movement against the background and saw none. In order to test this, I took my binoculars off the object and scanned straight down towards the water line and beach to get a fix of where the object was. When I came back, the object was still there. I said to myself “too bad you don’t have your birding scope”, for in that I would have had a very good view. I again tried my experiment of fixing the object against the water and beach, but when I came back a second time the object was no longer there. I scanned to both the right and left to see if it had moved but there was no object in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I can’t say I saw a UFO, because I saw no odd movement, but I am quite sure there was an object out there, apparently over the water and not moving. It was definitely not a structure in Plymouth or elsewhere on the Massachusetts coast.  It was just an odd sighting, perhaps explainable. If only I had my birding scope!<n>

On my way out of Boulder City, Nevada, at approximately 12 noon PST I saw a motionless object in the sky.  It was located over the Mountains as you drive on Veteran&#39;s Memorial Parkway heady out of town.  The object was darker than the hazy afternoon sky and appeared to be square in shape.  It had definite lines and was not a cloud.  When I first saw it I thought it was a kite or something caught in a power line as I tried to judge my depth perception.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued driving I watched it sitting motionless.  It became more apparent that this was actually something in the sky above the mountains and not some sort of optical illusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object as I was parked at the stoplight at Boulder Highway and Veteran&#39;s Memorial Parkway.  I was anxious to get a better look at it by getting on the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before the light changed to green the object start to move.  It moved away very smoothly and disappeared into the hazy cloud cover.  It gradually disappeared almost like fading away.  It was moving towards the Las Vegas valley when I lost site of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove into Henderson I looked to the sky but there was no site of it.  Though its hard to be sure, it appeared to be very large in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what I saw that day but I will never forget it.<n>

I backed my truck into my drive way and started to get out.  My truck was facing East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to the left/North to get out of the truck and I looked up at the sky.  I was staring at the stars and saw what I thought was a bird but as I kept looking at this object I noticed it was a triangle.  I shouted, &#34;Oh My God,&#34; at this point my 12 yr old son shouted its a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both watched it go toward the San Mateo Bridge which would be West.  We both stared at this object until we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was what a perfect triangle with lights at each point.  It was silent and moved very fast.

It continued to get smaller and smaller until finally disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my partner were walking home when we saw the strange object, we are unsure of what it may have been but both agreed it was not an aircraft as it was a single orange non flashing light that moved too fast and made no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately it was too dark to capture any footage on my camera, despite the light from the object being very bright.<n>

It was sprinkling rain and there was a cloud cover blocking any view of stars as is common in Alaska.  We then viewed an odd cloud formation traveling alone and lit up, not like the other clouds at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made mention of it and we started watching it.  It seemed to be moving right toward us and we honestly thought it was going to come right over our heads, very very low to the ground.  Where was the light coming from?  Then it stopped moving toward us and started moving away (west) and seemed to dissipate.   Soon after it was there again, but not as close.  Still oddly lit up unlike the other clouds and it seemed to move and stop at will instead of moving with the breeze.  No opinion or clue of what this was, but we are not given to looking for weirdness in the sky, and this scared us silly!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They were in a random pattern moving northwest and made no noise as they passed by. Their color was light amber to off-white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no explanation for what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to my brother, these lights held a V-shaped pattern just prior to my coming outside.<n>

While sitting in my back yard, I noticed the objects first moving over our house in a V-shape formation. After about a minute of watching the lights, I then ran into the house to get my brother. Upon returning to the back yard, we both noticed that the lights had changed their pattern to a random configuration. No noise was heard from these objects as they moved overhead, a very thin cloud cover or haze was above and the lights seemed to emit a glow through the haze, their color was off-white. They moved off in a northerly direction and faded away into the distance. Each light was approximately the size of an eraser on a pencil held at arm&#39;s length. The entire V-shaped formation was approximately the size of two full moons.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These dots appeared to be at a great distance due to the small size.  Six were in a cluster formation with the seventh trailing a short distance behind.  The dots were moving from the southwest to the northeast.  I was able to view them for approximately ten (10) seconds.  From my backyard they were viewed directly to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dots were at a great vertical and horizontal distance from me.  I have military experience with aircraft including the SR-71 Blackbird.  The dots remained in the cluster formation the entire time of the viewing.  It was not a military formation or a formation of any pattern.  The dots were red or orange and appeared to be slightly larger than the size of a medium star as viewed from this area.<n>

Overlooking the West Side of Mt. Adams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnesses: 4 adults, 1 teenager.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of Sighting:  At roughly 0100 on the morning of August 28, 2009, five people were star gazing on a U.S. Forest Service road on the east border of the Indian Heaven Wilderness.  We had a fairly good view of the sky towards the East.  A person sighted a blinking white light.  This person alerted the rest of the group and all five people began to observe this light.  It would blink on, then blink off.  It seemed as if every time it blinked off, it would blink on again at a different point in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it seemed to have a general direction of South to North.  However, after 4 or 5 blinks it moved in the opposite direction.  Every blink had the same intensity of white light, however altitude and direction seemed to vary.  It made one final blink, turned off and then an even brighter white light came on and accelerated at a downward trajectory towards us.  It seemed that it was going to hit us when it angled up into the sky at thousands of miles per hour leaving a reddish white trail that arced across the entire visible sky.  The composition of the trail the craft left behind seemed to have a reddish white, very bright dusty appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. Upon returning from our trip, I was looking at my digital camera pictures.  I have found numerous photographic anomalies in 5 or so pictures of dark objects in the general direction of our sighting over and in front of the Western side of Mt. Adams.  I would be willing to send these photos via email upon request.<n>

A plane happened to fly by in the direction of the moving object, that appeared to be a ways off in space, and the plane was much slower than this UFO and I could hear the plane but not the UFO.  It did not move in a pattern but very swiftly back and forth, in circles, and just around in general.  The UFO stayed in the same area of the sky between Jupiter and the North Star around the little dipper in the south west at about a 30 degree angle of elevation.  Would split off in two occasionally and would disappear for a second or two then reappear.  It lasted for over 3 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD))<n>

VERY BRIGHT. I thought it was lightning aqt first because it was about 3 bright quick flashes. Told my husband and within seconds the light flashes started again.  This time they were VERY bright and non stop and with them was SOUND. Sounded like a very large electrical sound.  It hummed in time with the lights and then it all stopped. My husband and I both heard and saw it. My 9 year old daughter who was sleeping was woken by it.  She  heard and saw the same thing. We all saw the light source in a different direction though.  I saw it brighter in the back of the house, my daughter from the front and my husband from the side.  I went outside and there was no smell or lights and NO police or fire sirens, as something that big and loud had to be a transformer or something large and electrical...no reports last night or this morning on the local news.

I was looking at the Bid Dipper constellation, and a previously still and fainter star nearby began to move.  The star like object made a short, slight awkward movement downwards, then accelerated about 5 inches to right in the sky according to my perspective.  After accelerating very quickly to the right for a short moment, it disappeared from view.  No flash or anything, just disappeared.  The object appeared just like a star in the sky, white and twinkling.  I am a recent college grad and interested in the ufo phenomenon.  The object did accelerate in a way that is consistent with some other videos of lights moving I have seen.  Slow, then very quick acceleration.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But it looked to be glowing or burning?  The first thing I said to my girlfriend was,  &#34;Hey, look at the moon, it looks like it&#39;s on fire!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> She turned around, and we both looked in amazment as the burning sphere in the sky shifted its light source within itself.  At first the entire object was a red/maroon color. over the next two minutes the object seemed to transform the light within, shifting it downward and then upward within the sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes the object dropped in the sky and we could see it through some trees approx. 3 miles from us.

It made wide circles about 100 feet under the other craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both craft made small changes in altitude and direction, but generally stayed in the area above our neighborhood for about 15-20 minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A third craft (with blinking red and white lights on it) started to close on the higher craft, and this one looked more like a conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point it flew between the two craft (below the higher one and above the lower one). At that point the lower one (with the bright neon-blue lights on it) began flying in a fast semi-vertical circular pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third craft continued on, and eventually the higher-flying craft began to fly away in a northwestern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to my house and got my camera, but by then they were all gone.  I checked, and no else had a camera to take any photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Modesto Police Dept. to see if anyone else had reported seeing the lights.  I was told that someone else had called in, but no record was made of the call.  Nor were they interested in making one of my call.<n>

They were not rounded turns in any sense of the way - straight out right angles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for about a minute, it then turned and traveled for about thirty seconds or so each time before turning again, and after the third turn we watched it for about 20 seconds and it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Original date was flawed.

I witnessed a bright, white, circular light (without a tail) that did not flash like an airplane, yet moved not unlike an aircraft.  However, the object moved faster than any of the planes usually flying in the area (Portland has an airport across the river from Camas/Vancouver).  I saw the light move from through the front window in the car, then flying from the center of the sky toward the horizon and vanishing.  The object moved incredibly fast; faster than any of the jets I had seen in the area  The object was not a shooting star: the object had no tail, and moved like a solid, bright object across the sky.  The most mysterious part was the object&#39;s sudden disappearance once it reached the edge of the sky.<n>

It was clear out with very few clouds and the sun was shining.  I noticed the object and told my husband and we both watched it fly north and after a minute or so, it quickly diminished in size and then completely disappeared right in the middle of a clear blue sky.  It seemed to be lower than a plane would fly but still up high.  I&#39;d say it was as long as a normal commercial plane, but 3 times the width.  It seemed to cartwheel as it flew north before it disappeared before our very eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They spread, shrank &amp; faded away never going over the horizon but away from Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were coming back from a late night of grocery shopping at the 24 hour Biggs arriving home at about 12:30 am .<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stepped out of the car and looked up into the night sky (as I usually do looking for satellites, shooting stars and such),  I saw two lights evenly spaced, horizontally from about two or three fingers apart at arms length at first sight to about five fingers apart at the middle of their path across the sky moving from east to west at approximately 45 degrees in the northwestern sky, back to about one finger apart when they faded from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife over to see them and she noted as I did that they were moving faster than the satellites we&#39;ve seen. They traversed the entire sky in about two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound and their brightness was comparable to that of the North star or the planets. They were larger in appearance than the point of light that you get from a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not think that they were in our atmosphere because they were illuminated by the sun almost like the satellites I&#39;ve seen.  These lights dimmed as the satellites do from the illuminated sides moving out of sight but these lights did not seem to be in orbit but moving away from the planet.  These lights never went over the horizon but rather became smaller and dimmer until they were no longer visible.<n>

Modesto|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71889.html|77|ndxe200908| Two crafts spotted over Westfield shopping cntr. Modesto<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 crafts 1 with bright lights across could be cigar or saucer shaped. Other was cigar shaped deep bright neon blue glowing. It would glow and then fade out and come back.  The other one hovered up and down quit a bit and side to side like having engine trouble. The blue cigar one stayed close as if to make sure the other was ok. A police or military white I think with markings plain stayed close by flying between them. Then they faded out. The hight I would say would be about 15 to 20 stories up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a very bright yellowish or amber color.  It would increasingly get brighter and fade out.  It would be about 10 second intervals and then light back up again.  This occurred for 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can tell you that it is not a plane or helicopter.  First of all, the light was vast.  I have seen many planes fly behind my house and their beacons and strobes are green and red like most all planes.  It would also stop in the air for about 15 seconds and then continue its circular pattern.  It was also right over this field in the country.  I would estimate about 2-3 miles out due NNE. I would also say that it was 10 degrees above the horizon.  It made no noise so it definitively was not a plane or helicopter.  I hope you guys look in to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for believing.  I am sure that there is life out there as much as you guys do.<n>

The color was a consistent burnt orange similar to arcturus but brighter, the lights were located about 10 degrees above the horizon in a eastern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes past when the orange light appeared a little higher and to the left, this time a sustained light output of a single orange light was witnessed which lasted about 7- 9 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 15 minutes later in a northeastern direction, orange lights were witnessed, this time several lit up at once in different locations, taking place within the parameters of a 1 foot radius at arms length, some were sustained, some were slow flashes, at some moments it seemed there were 4-6 separate lights shining at once.  The lights all seemed to be about 2-3 miles in distance uring the events.<n>

I usally go out on balcony to see the sky since ages. i usally watch shoting stares and aeroplanes on high and low skies. in morning time, it was dark sky without moon, on east skies of the Hague, i first time spoted the small fast blinking oval shaped crafts, in organized manner, one craft on the side behing of other, same like fighter jets, which appeared in the high skies on east side. I was really stunning and i was not able to move when I watched that seen. I had thought that these UFOs are just the dramas and might be secret military expriments, because I am not a supersticios person and still I am not. As i am on legal intern at International Criminal Court at the Hague for 6 months, it is really diffrent now for me and i cant belive my eyes that really there are supernatural or extraterritial beings more intillegent than humans or any race of humans, which are watching ! this human race.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I is very easy for me to diffrenciate the objects on the skies because I am watching the skies keenly since my childhood and have seen many many times diffrent kinds of shooting stars, or moving objects in the skies, but i spoted this time was compleatly diffrent. As i was thinking I am in supernatural world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i can compare it like a very very fast small blinking oval shaped stars, if it appears on the black LCD screen of your laptop , moving so fast stright from one end of screen to other side of screen and disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This object made no sound, nor did it have any running lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it slowly cross our night sky for a second or two, I asked my husband to look up and see if he sees what I&#39;m seeing.   He acknowledge he did as the object slowly left our field of vision heading southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was large (compared to our planes in the sky), and didn&#39;t appear high in the atmosphere.<n>

I was in the process of driving a U-Haul truck from Albuquerque, NM, to Sacramento, CA.  I was on Highway 95 in southern Nevada, perhaps six miles north of the town of Beatty.  An overnight stay was planned later, in Hawthorne, NV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traffic had been light, but leaving Beatty and heading north, the traffic all but vanished.  Even the local traffic had disappeared.  I was all alone in the night, half-listening to George Noory on the AM radio.  Noory promised his listeners a &#34;UFO Extravaganza,&#34; later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly to my left, I saw a light in the sky, heading south.  The light looked like a very bright planet - like Venus - but in motion.  I did a double-take, thinking it might have been a reflection in the driver&#39;s-side window of a stationary light located to the right of the truck, but that was not the case.  Something was flying south through the air, not very high, and not very far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is quite plausible that the light belonged to a small private airplane.  There is a small airport located just south of Beatty, equipped with flashing beacons for nighttime travelers, and the airborne light was heading in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But still, private planes are supposed to be equipped with colored blinking lights for nighttime flight.  This light was not blinking at all.  Was the cockpit light on for some mysterious reason?   If so, why were the external blinking lights off?  That would be an unsafe condition, especially at low altitude!  It was all puzzling.<n>

I saw what at first I thought to be three planes, two in the southeastern sky, and one in the southern sky. Then I noticed that they were brighter than usual. They were not blinking; they were like stars but about two times bigger and brighter, and a more orange-yellow color than a star. They were moving east slowly in the sky. Two were moving at the same pace, but the third was slower and farther behind the others. After about 35 seconds the objects went behind a tree and did not reemerge. There was no sound whatsoever that we heard. I had never seen a UFO before and was not sure what to think of this. It wasn’t like any other aircraft I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I went to look at them, I saw for myself a very bright star shaped object in the southwestern sky, just above the tree line.  In my confirmed excitement, I turned to the objects she was pointing at, and noticed they were the same size and shape, but more of an orange color, while mine was white. The two were headed eastward and traveling much slower than any aircraft around here.  The two grouped together were staying the same distance apart the entire time and moving in the same direction.  I turned back around to look at the object I initially saw, and observed it gliding behind the tree line in a more southerly and downward direction, at the speed it was going, it should have reappeared within two or three seconds, but it never did.  When I turned again to see the pair of lights, they had already gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light I initially saw looked to be about the same shape and color of a star in the night sky.  To my best estimate, it was about 400 yards away and lower than the regular aircraft around here.  None of them illuminated the area around us from their light.  Their true speed I can’t say, but it felt to me they were going the speed of a slow helicopter. They were about the size in the sky as that of my thumbnail with my arm fully extended.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This complex is on Hwy 260 in Show Low, AZ, approx. two miles south from Deuce of Clubs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Distance:  Approx. 100 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time:  Just after 5pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Appearance:  Object was a glowing, bright white light, approx. one foot in circumference.  Sighting lasted less than one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sound or other emanations:  None.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Vector:  Object was moving approx. 60-80 miles an hour in a unchanging Southeast direction coming down over the trees covering the hill on the West side of the complex, across the valley and toward Mt. Baldy area, maintaining approx. 100 foot height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observations:  When I saw the light, I excitedly tried to point the object out to a woman who was a former customer of mine and had just gotten off work at Cell-One and was sitting in her vehicle.  She would not consent to raising her eyes to look at the object, saying it was probably “just a plane”.   I commented that I have seen plenty of planes and this was much too-close to be mistaken for a plane, and was right over our heads, and that she should look at the object.   She ignored me, and I noticed that she behaved lethargic, almost in a drugged state, and would not get out of the vehicle or look at the object.  The object became difficult to see as it past over the field East of us, and I lost track of it.  The woman’s behavior then appeared normal.  I reported the incident to the publisher of my newspaper, who informed me that these sightings of small lights above or in the trees are quite common in the White Mountains, and are often reported to a couple of the local n! ewspapers that she was affiliated with.  She recommended that I not write of the incident, counseling that I would lose credibility if reported publicly.    Also, there were no planes in the sky until approx. 30 seconds after the sighting.   A small propeller plane was moving in a southerly direction appox. A mile high, and I commented to the woman in the vehicle:  “See, that’s a plane”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

8/25/09 06:30|Beverly Beach|FL||40 minutes|those two perfect circles appearing with the small sparkling lights all neatly arranged|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71869.html|98|ndxe200908| At the ocean edge, on the beach, just prior to day light, the sky was dark with only one very bright light in the sky.  It was larger then a star but very bright white.  It was far off but seemed to just stay in one spot, like a star.  I took a picture of it but it only came out black as it was still dark.  (later I took a picture in day light but at this writing the white light does not seem to show in the picture)   As day light turned brighter and became full day light, the sky was clear light blue with only the bright light in the sky.  The light seemed to be moving away from the earth. I got my binoculars and then view two separate lights close together.  The bigger light, 3/8 inch in size was on the right and looking with the binoculars the left side had a much small 1/8 inch white light on the left, just next to the bigger light.  With time both had slowly moved 2 inches away from each other all seen using the binoculars.  Looking at the light without the binoculars appeared to be one light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this is the strange part, the 1/8 inch light on left appeared instantly with a group of about 24 lights, smaller then the 1/8 inch light, which formed a 12 inch diameter circle.  Inside the circle the 24 lights each seem to be spaced very evenly, like a diamond display or a 4th of July fireworks that spreads out in a designed circle.  That 12 inch circle stayed behind the smaller light, on the left, and stayed at the 2 inch space from the light on the right.  After about 15 minutes both seemed to be moving further away from earth. A little later, the bigger 3/8 inch light on the right then also instantly produced the same type circle with all the arranged small lights only this circle was only 4 inches in diameter.  We viewed this 2nd circle for about 10 minutes along with the 12 inch circle with the small light on the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time the sun was not up, just day light, all clear blue sky when some clouds from the south came and finally blocked the sight of the two white lights.  After the cloud came, we never saw the lights again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange part, in summary, were those two perfect circles appearing with the small sparkling lights all neatly arranged.  All this was seen though my binoculars by my wife and myself.<n>

It looked like a star at first but then began to move, dipping up and down in a firefly-like fashion sometimes, sometimes accelerating upward for a while and then plunging back down.  Sometimes seemed to have a tail or a curve of lights in front of it, like something you might see in a photo of a meteor entering the atmosphere.

8/24/09 23:30|Hillsboro|OH|Unknown|2 minutes or so|Three blinking lights, high in the night sky.  Conducting what seemed like "games" of tag.  Incredible speeds and incredible turns.|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71870.html|103|ndxe200908| Three blinking lights, high in the night sky.  Conducting what seemed like &#34;games&#34; of tag.  Incredible speeds and incredible turns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out in my front yard, talking on the phone with my best friend.  It was approximately 11:30 pm and the night sky was absolutely clear and you could see hundreds of stars.  I noticed what I thought was a shooting star but it blinked, so then I thought it was some kind of aircraft.  I realized in just a second or two that there were three objects alike, in the same general area of the night sky.  All three were darting here and there, many times turning on a &#34;dime&#34;.  More than once, making a 90 degree turn.  As they danced around a large portion of the sky, they would blink realy quick, sometimes.  But not constant.  They seemed to almost be playing &#34;tag&#34;.  Their speed was phenomenal, and much faster than anything I am familiar with.  Plus, they could change direction in a blink, and &#34;we&#34; have nothing that can do that, at that speed, to my knowledge.  I was describing all I was seeing to my buddy Gary, and we were both trying to come up with an answer th! at made sense for what I was seeing.  I sometimes did not talk when he was asking me questions because I was entralled with what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About two or three minutes (maybe less) into watching this, they &#34;zipped&#34; away in different directions.  I kept talking with my buddy and kept watching the sky.  About four or five minutes later, I observed one of those same objects, heading north at an incredible speed.  Behind it but far back was an obvious airplane, probably a military jet because of its speed, going in the same direction.  I had the impression that it was trying to catch or keep track of the &#34;object&#34; in front of it.  The airplane was going really really fast, but was &#34;dusted&#34; by the object in front of it, which seemed to be traveling at approximately 1 1/2 to 2 times the speed of the airplane.  They both disappeared to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was observing these three objects in the beginning, they often would blink really quickly, a white light with no discernable colors, but would not constantly blink.  The blinking was very fast.  Faster than helocopters of airplane lights blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But sometimes they would not blink for a second or two.  When they were not blinking, I could still make out an object in the direction of travel at any given moment, which appeared to be a dull grey or silver in color, streaking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were very high in the sky.  What I would describe as &#34;outer space&#34;.  I can not explain how I could see them when they were not blinking, as there seemed to be no light other than that which blinked.  Maybe it was a reflection from the moonlight.  I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never before observed something I could not explain, prior to this.  I served 8 years in the U.S. Marine Corps and 4 months in the Navy.  I am 56 years old and a retired Cleveland police officer.  I retired as a Lieutenant, and I was recognized by the U.S. Congress (108th Congress) for my service and career.  My buddy who was on the phone with me at the time, is currently a working police officer in Cleveland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have spend 24 hours or so, replaying in my mind and recollection, all of what I observed last night, and can not come up with a logical explanation.  I have told no one except my wife, who is visiting our son in Texas, and my buddy Gary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will add that in my area, we get a lot of military aircraft that conduct manuevers above our home.  There are usually two but sometimes three, always in the daylight hours, apparently practicing.  On one occasion, my wife and I actually observed one of the planes shoot an object, but we do not know what it was or where it went.  This shot object disappeared into some clouds.  Every once in awhile these military aircraft break the sound barrier and rattle our home.  We just assume these military jets are from Wright Patterson AFB, which is not to far from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh, one more thing.  When I was observing the three unknown blinking objects, there was absolutely no sound.  When I observed the one streaking north, it was also silent but I could hear the loud coming airplane that was way behind it, going in the same direction.  My &#34;feeling&#34; is that the airplane was a lot lower in the sky, than the object it was following behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t have anything else to add.  Please let me know if you get any other reports frm my area, during that same time period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am just amazed and confused.  I need glasses to read but my long range vision is very good.  I can not come up with a logical explanation for what I observed.<n>

Then, it looked like it &#34;zoomed&#34; upwards (the large dot decreased in size quickly while sweeping over the sky in a curve) and disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the bridge for another hour to see if I would see it again, but nothing happened.  I was with a group of people at that time, but they all had their backs to the bridge and didn&#39;t seen anything.  I wear glasses but I know what I seen was not glare, or any other lights reflecting on my glasses.<n>

I told her to look and it was gone. So, we sat on the deck and watched in same area and a few more showed up and faded just like before. I went and got my husband and he as well seen the same thing although they were generally in the same area they appered in different locations. They did not move just got brighter, lighter then faded away. Also, the next night we seen them again just not as many as the first night. There are no military bases and we live in the country. Has anyone else seen this before it&#39;s driving us crazy!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
8/24/09 21:50|Proctorville|OH|Other|1 minute|Strange silent object with bright amber light flying over Huntington WV|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71852.html|106|ndxe200908| Strange silent object with bright amber light flying over Huntington WV<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were outside our home at about 21:50 on 08/24/09. My wife asked me about what looked like a star in the west. Then she told me she thought it was moving. The light was amber and looked like a landing light on an aircraft except for the color of the light. As it got closer the object seemed to get lower. We started to notice blinking lights of an orange, red, and green. We thought it was still a plane at this point. As it came over top of us however, we noticed and unusual pattern to the lights. There were light in front back and sides, not the pattern of a plane or helicopter. As it came closer still, it passed directly over us. I could make out a dark shape something like a 6 or 8 sided octagon-like shape. The amber light was in the middle, lights close together in front, spaced on the sides, and spaced to the back. Another shocking fact is that there was absolutely NO SOUND! As the object moved to the east and across the Ohio River, I gained ! perspective on it&#39;s size and speed from the time it passed over me until it moved between and over the hilltops on the other side of the river. I would estimate it was moving about 150 mph and was about 30 feet in diameter. It actually seemed to slow as it came over our town and lowered in altitude. This was in the almost opposite direction of the local airport. I have lived in my home for years and am in the glide path of one of it&#39;s runways. This was unlike anything I have ever seen. Also, at an estimated 1000 to 1200 feet in altitude, I did NOT hear any noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then all of a sudden, it started moving horizontally very slowly, and then it shot off vertically into the atmosphere, at I guess what you would call warp speed, and leaving behind a streak that disappeared within one second.  It was extremely fast, I&#39;d only seen a craft move that fast in science fiction movies.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were in between Medford and Phoenix, perhaps the outskirts of Medford, around Campbell road, when I noticed a light flashing in the sky in front of us and a little to the right (East).  It was flashing in a strange way, so I pulled to the side of the road.  We got out and watched a UFO move steadily in our direction but somewhat to the East over the mountains.  At first I thought it might be a plane, but the entire craft was flashing, as I said, in a strange way. It was about 2:30 pm, so it was broad daylight, and the light needed to be fairly bright in order to flash that way.  The way that it was flashing gave me the impression that various parts of the craft were rotating.  The whitish light was continuously emanating from it, but in different intensities and from different parts of the craft.  So, the craft continued along and passed us, continuing South and a little East,! when it suddenly just stopped. I then knew definitely that it wasn&#39;t a plane.  It sat there stationary, and still flashing, for about five minutes.  We watched it for those five minutes until we had to go (we were late for something), so I have no idea how long it stayed in that position.<n>

It is approximately half a mile walk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always look up on a clear morning to find a shooting star or plane. I also watch for the ISS when scheduled. On Aug. 24 the ISS was scheduled to appear in the NW at 4:21AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was leaving my house walking north I noticed a group of 3 stars similar to Orion’s belt but this was near the north star in the sky approximately 45 degrees N in the sky. The Orion constellation at this time should be in the lower ESE sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I was walking all the stars appear to be moving but of coarse it is due to my movement. So I stopped walking and noticed 2 of the 3 stars moving east in a parallel formation. As they moved easterly they stayed the same distance from each other (about the same distance from each other as the Orion’s belt) and became dimmer until I could no longer see them approximately 20 degrees NE. Their brightness resembled a medium size star when first noticed. Not as bright as the ISS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the ISS appeared later in the morning it was lower in the sky (about 20 degrees) and brighter than the stars I had seen earlier but at about the same speed in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not appear to be planes. There wasn’t any flashing lights. Just a steady glow as a medium star. I did see a plane in the sky but it was approximately 80 degrees E in the sky and traveling E in a much slower speed with a red flashing light. I also saw a shooting star later in my walk approximately 70 degrees W in the sky lasting only a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/24/09 01:39|Auburn|WA|Triangle|2 hours|Lights in the skies over Auburn, Wa - Changing geometric shapes.|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71846.html|116|ndxe200908| Lights in the skies over Auburn, Wa - Changing geometric shapes<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the sighting, two adult males (My son and my nephew) and two adult females (My daughter and myself) were walking outside in Auburn, Washington at 1:39 AM as my daughter was going home next door.  Since we are in a rural location and it was dark out, we were seeing her home safely.  She happened to point out that the stars looked different -  We are all avid sky watchers - and all looked up to consider what she said.  She then said that she had never seen a certain tiny constellation in the Southwestern sky and we all looked to the area she was indicating.  My nephew asked if it had changed shape, and all four of us noted the change from a &#39;ladle&#39; shape to a square and then a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stunned, we watched the shape chnage further into a rounded heart shape, a line, a zig zag, and I told my daughter to get her camera which she had left inside my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While she was trying to video tape the object, I went into the house, got my camera, and turned all the lights out.  I went back outside and we watched and did our best to document what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If the ground were at 0 and directly above us were a 10, the object would have been near the 7. As we stared towards the South South East, the Pleiades was at a 9 and to our left (East).   At arm&#39;s length, it would have taken a nickel to cover it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought the lights were shifting into the repeating shapes, but as we watched over 2 hours, we realized it was a saucer shaped object with the lights along the edge and the ship was rotating, causing the light pattern to shift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object drifted to the East very slowly, and then drifted back to the West.  We could not judge the size very well, but for some reason we all thought it was huge.   We watched a Sattelite go from the south west to the north east and I would guess that the object was about the same level as it, as the lights were of a similar size.  It could have been smaller and much closer - It was impossible to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also noted several shooting stars, including one that &#39;shot&#39; slower and did not fade as it curved from the area of the object and went East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried very hard to remain calm, but we all felt a sense of awe and gratitude.  We all sent mental messages of  thanks, for what it may have been worth - and we all felt excited and nearly euphoric.  We all agreed that what we were seeing was beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although we took dozens of pictures and videos, which we will gladly send in if requested, the lights were apparently not strong enough to be picked up by our cameras.  Maybe someone has a program on their computer that can help see what may have been picked up in the videos.  We did enhance one of the pictures and discovered that what we thought was a saucer shape was actually triangular!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we were impressed with her eloquence, and her apparently serious-minded approach to the sighting.  Under ordinary circumstances, we might conjecture that a report of this nature might have been about a sighting of stars in the night.  However, given the exceptionally high quality of the written report, and given the apparent skill of the witness at viewing the night sky, we are impressed by this report.  PD))<n>

The Sphere is a very bright white and appears to be hovering in place. It is brighter than any star or any planet around us by at least 10 times. The object appears to be moving in a small triangular shape with very jerky movements. We watched it for approximately 14 minutes before the light completely shut off. About 3 minutes later it was there again seemingly to appear out of nowhere, as if the lights just got turned back on. There is no sound and it looks to be at a very high altitude, much too high to be a firework, airplane, or helicopter of some sort. This light has also been seen on 08/04/2009 at 0:22 (12:22 am), about the same time as this one started. Both events were exactly the same, but the one on 08/04/2009 was to the far east and appeared to be over the Alpine area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I determined they were stationary because after only 30 seconds of driving down the road they were almost behind me. Also they were flying extremly close together and very low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only find this odd because tonight was completely cloudy, you couldnt see a single star at that time. Strangely these two objects looked like stars, flickering and very bright. Once again let me stress that there is absolutely no way that these objects were stars, it was just too cloudy. They were flying too close to eachother, and were moving too slow for them to be airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It exited some clouds and then began to fly in an erratic manner. It was flying in a zigzag away from us, making 90 degree turns without slowing down. It made at least 5 90 degree turns and then turned around and headed back towards us. It slowed down, flew in what seemed to trace a semi circle across the sky back and forth several times and then continued to fly in a zigzag pattern away from us until it disappeared behind a building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in a hot tub at the time, stargazing. It was partly cloudy. Neither of us were wearing glasses or contacts. We were not under the influence of alcohol and neither of us has a cold that would affect our vision or hearing. We are both graduate level students in science.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I say the looked like satellites because they looked just like one at night only these objects we close to each other one behind the other and ive never observed two satellites travelling the same direction, same speed, so close to ach other.  I know these were not aircraft because the light that was given off was not of a strobe or landing light nature.  More of when light reflects off of metal and this makes since because the sun had set only an hour before so you only have to go so high before you reflect the suns light.  What makes this case interesting is after a minute of observing these two objects travelling north the began to change direction and over the course of about 30 secs went from travelling due north to due south.  About 15 secs before we lost sight my father and I both saw one of the objects split SE while the other object continued south.  Dont really care if this is credible or not i know what we saw.  No way it was a satellite because of the course change that was made by both objects and I know they were not aircraft because there was no strobe light and without that you cant see an aircraft at night with no moon:) 3rd sighting in 3 yrs for me here in SC KS and the 2nd for my father in 2 yrs.  Many of the locals here have observed similar or different cases.  Might not be a bad idea to check the area out if this website hasnt already.  I myself am 28 yrs old and my parents well in their 50&#39;s this is not a prank/joke.  Took the time to write this because I think you should know.  What you do with this is on you.<n>

The road was very dark, and I was the only car in this stretch of road. It was between La Collina and Irvine Blvd at 10pm.  No street lights at all. In the distance I saw large yellow and red lights across the 4 lane highway. There were probably 10 lights on the pavement. It looked like a police barricade or road work. When I came closer, all the lights disappeared simultaneously. It was spooky. I mean they disappeared before my eyes. There was no one else on the road. I looked to see if the lights were there, but turned off, but nothing was there, only the street. I looked up at the buildings and there were no lights. I was freaked out because it was so odd. I have never seen anything disappear like that. They basically vanished into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/23/09 21:30|Chicago|IL|Fireball|1 hour|August 23, 2009 Seven Chicago Witnesses view strange Orange Red balls of light in night sky.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72014.html|124|ndxe200908| August 23, 2009 Seven Chicago Witnesses view strange Orange Red balls of light in night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August 23, 2009 at about 930p seven eye witnesses watched two orange balls of light slowly appear from the sky then slowly disappear. Their pattern of flight began from the South East and moved North West over Chicago. It was a very clear summer night many stars and different easily identified aircraft could be seen. The two balls of red/orange light appeared then disappeared. I could see as one elevated very high in the sky then resembled a star that began streaking West. About 5 mins later a line of orange/red lights then began to appear and slowly move into a triangle formation. Each light then slowly faded out. After the lights disappeared a variety of terrestrial craft small planes, jets, helicopters began to move into the area above NW Chicago where the lights had been. After about a half hour a large red and green triangle solid object began to make schedule circles around the NW side of the City in the sky possibly over Lake Michigan. All of this ! was witnessed by seven different adults and none had an explaining for what was seen. They were not meteors because they were transfixed at times and moved in others. They were not Chinese lanterns because they came down from the atmosphere then projected back up. I tried to capture to image on my Cell phone video camera but the phone camera was not adequate to film something with such low light. I did manage to catch a small amount. My friend then did get her camera and managed to take some video and photos of what we were witnessing. In my video (the bad one) you can faintly see the triangle formation it made but also listen to the peoples reaction of it. In my friends video you can see the objects in the sky and here the same reaction. Here is my friends link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aYx1IiTc68 and my link is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=334Yh9r09K0 both videos and sound are from the same occurrence (date/time). When I first saw them my first feeling was of terr! or because I had no explanation for what it was then I was hop! ing alie ns were not preparing to invade Earth. It made me very nervous. Three of my friends and myself that were witness to the encounter work in the aerospace industry and have never seen anything like it before. The ages of the witnesses are from 25 to 55. I have searched &#39;Orange balls of light&#34; on YouTube and have seen different various videos of exactly what we saw in Chicago but filmed all over the world. The night we saw them there were at least 6 to 7 objects in the sky total.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

WE all gathered and watched the orange/red spheres move across the sky almost like they were moving in our direction.  If they had continued across the sky I could of thought of a few possible explainations for the occurence but they didnt... they stopped.  One by one, 4 of them arriving at first.  One stopped sharply and held its position while another went up and stopped and another dropped lower to its position.  The last of the 4 went straight up and stopped.  It was still really calm out and there wasnt a sound to be heard and were all used to airplanes &amp; h! elicopters flying over us, this wasnt the case this time.  All 4 UFO&#39;s held that position for at least 5 mins until 2 more red/orange spheres appeared from the same North Eastern direction as the other 4... and joined them by finding there position in what seemed to me to be a flight formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All 6 spheres held that position for at least 10 mins as we watched them all slow pull away out of the atmosphere until them looked just like stars... then disappeared. During part of the sighting I ran and got my camera and took the pictures that I will include, I&#39;ve also made a short youtube video of the original photos and some blow-ups of the objects... simply amazing!<n>

I went out to the deck and observed seven orange/red objects that looked like planets- these were oval, large, there was no blinking, no noise.  They came in from the northeast, gathered into a circle, and did not move, then two- three disappeared.   I grabbed my camera and started taking photos then got my video camera.  We heard people on the street and went outside to the front, where many of our neighbors were looking and observing as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were NOT anything I have ever seen.

The officer came to my house and witnessed the pictures/video&#39;s and told me to send them to the media- this was the real deal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were orange objects with red centers. very amazing experience to have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There was no sound of a burner as with a hot air balloon. A second and then a third one of them rose getting smaller and disappeared. The last two remained for a while longer.

When we were finished we went down to the lake and sat for a while.  We were facing north.    It was around 2:00 p.m. on a calm sunny day with a few cumulus clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband looked up and asked, &#34;What is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and a metallic object was traveling from east to west at an extreme rate of speed.  It was approximately 20,000 to 30,000 feet up.  It flew just west of us and stopped suddenly at the edge of a cloud.  Just stayed there motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it started gyrating like a plate would do if you spun it on its edge and the motion it would make as it started to slow down.  It then stopped gyrating and stayed there at the edge of the cloud for approximately 5 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly it came down at about a 45-degree angle at an extreme rate of speed and went behind the tree line.  I thought it was going to crash but we heard nothing and did not see it come up again.  It was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not determine the exact shape of the object but it was not cigar shaped or spherical.  It appeared to be somewhat triangular when it was gyrating.<n>

Through my driver’s side window I observed a huge object in the sky.  I’d estimate it was at about 5,000 feet and  moving slowly in a northerly direction.  The amazing thing was how large it was and also the shape of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was rectangular, just a little bit wider than high.  It seemed to have some kind of a band running around the center of it but was hard to make out the detail.  I took two quick shots with my cell phone camera.  The first one was off as I was driving and just trying to point and shoot.  The second one I got a shot of the object as it was almost touching the northern horizon and appeared pretty small by this time.  The shocking thing was the size and shape of it.  I was initially, I’d estimate, 4 or 5 miles from it and it was easily over 300 feet wide and 200 feet tall.  The color seemed to be a dull battleship grey.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I seen a star like object moving slow in the sky at some points it would speed up. It was also going dim then bright as it zig-zagged in the sky. it seemed real close to the ground and it made no sound it was really quite. It all lasted for around ten minutes till I lost it in the trees. As I lost that one I noticed another larger one. Same thing a large star like object real close to the ground but just hovering doing the same thing getting dim then real bright at times.

8/23/09 03:17|Fairfield|IA|Oval|3 minutes|5 lights in shape of oval traveled from southwest to northeast sky which looked to outline one object at 3:16 AM.|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71820.html|136|ndxe200908| 5 lights in shape of oval traveled from southwest to northeast sky which looked to outline one object at 3:16 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 3:16 to 3:17 AM, I went outside before going to bed, and within a moment I noticed the sky was clear and saw what I thought were airplane lights moving in the sky.  I then noticed there was an oval or ellipse shape formed by what looked to be 5 or more lights moving through the sky.  The size of the lights were like small, not particularly brilliant stars, but bright enough that their movement against a dark clear sky were apparent.  There could have been more than 5 stars but with the small size and distance and movement I was only able to count 5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This movement caught my attention immediately. I saw the movement was slow and steady. I went quickly into the house and shouted to my brother to come immediately.  He came out and also watched the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Pleiades were to the south of this object and higher in the sky than the object.  The object moved on a track toward the northeast horizon.  If I were to draw a line to track its trajectory backward, if it had traveled a straight line; then it started west and to the mid heaven side of the Pleiades.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a notable gut sense the object was very large and quite a distance away, higher in the sky than perhaps one might think.  But, there was no visual reference to verify this sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are in Southeast Iowa in a small town of 8000.  If there were no city lights we would have had a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched to see if any star lights were obscured by its passing over them, but the lights of the object became dimmer as it traveled closer to the horizon was such that we never saw any stars crossed and we lost view of the object before it got low enough in the sky to have its view blocked by the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought of calling the police to report this, it being so unusual; then decided not to bother as the object had passed.  I reported this sighting to my ex-wife and a friend by email so that I would have a time stamp to record the time; then thought to look on the net to see if other had seen an object like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So far I have not seen a picture which matches what we saw, but only looked on the net for a couple minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are occasional sky watchers by habit when we go outside on occasion, and have many a time observed satellites on occasion. This was new and different. The low side of the ellipse was on the left, on the north side, rising to the right (south) as in the picture below. No sound was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 55 and my brother is 49.  We were not under the influence of any drug, but we did have a half beer each about 7 hours earlier, which surely did not cause this strange observation.  Quite interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

On Saturday night/Sunday morning - Aug 23d 2009, I awoke around 3 AM and saw strange bright lights out the window.  There was a light to medium steady rain that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke my wife and we went outside on the deck where we both observed 2 very bright orbs of light (or fireballs as they are called on this site) that were visible over both the water and beach in the area near and around Briggs March and Warren point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The balls of light did not seem to be attached to any craft or structure, they were large and bright whitish-blue colored (almost halogen-like), they made no noise and emitted no beams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they were car headlights on Warren point because they moved together in parallel and they were very close to the ground (if not on the ground), but then they rose into the air and separated.  They were also too large to be headlights.  They made figure eights in the air and moved in many directions, they stayed generally close together as they moved but did not keep any constant distance. We saw them rise vertically and go horizontally faster than any machine could have done for the distance we saw them at, and they were in the air but stayed fairly close to the ground (my guess is that they did not go higher than a 100 yards off the ground.  They rose and fell as they moved, and in my best way of describing it: they appeared to &#34;dance&#34; or &#34;act playfully&#34; together.  They were clearly in some kind of intelligent control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them move together until they disappeared toward the water behind some trees that blocked our view.  The whole thing lasted about 2-3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my wife and I witnessed this, we are both 25 and were not under any kind of influence of alcohol or anything else.  We are physically and mentally healthy and only she has eye problems, but while witnessing this she did had her glasses on. It was early morning and we were both sleepy, but seeing this strange sight instantly made me quite alert - this was no sleepy induced imaginary figment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have ruled out every natural or man made thing we could think of.  The lights were about a mile away, and due to their size, brightness, location, and movement we have ruled out: people with flashlights, car/motorcycle headlights, planes, helicopters, spotlights.. etc  I have absolutely no explanation for what I saw, I hope someone else saw this too and will report it.<n>

My husband and I went to go have a cigarette before we went to bed.   When we went outside to the back yard we instantly noticed this huge blinking light.  It looked to be over HWY 31 about 3 miles from our house.  I instantly thought of an airplane.  Then my husband brought to my attention that planes only flash red and green lights.  This object was flashing red, green, blue and orange lights.  Not just dull versions of those colors but the most beautiful vibrant version that you can ever imagine.  Also it wasn’t moving except for the occasional sway from side to side. I had never in my life been in such a state of awe.  My husband ran and got our camera and binoculars.  Of course my camera wouldn’t catch the object but when we looked through the binoculars you could see clearly that it was the most perfect circle ball shape ever.  It stayed hovering in the same spot for the hour that we stayed out there watchi! ng it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point during the hour, 3 smaller versions of the light circle also producing the same vibrant color flashes came to the left side of the larger color circle and disappeared.   I wrote into the local news on Monday asking if there was any other sightings that night and I have yet to get a response.   I was reading where in the neighboring city of Daphne in 2008 someone reported that they saw a hovering circle flashing the same colors that we saw!   This was no airplane, helicopter, weather balloon, or new military aircraft.<n>

A few minutes in, I saw a chevron formation of lights streak across the sky directly overhead.  The lights were orange in color and were not round but rather looked like stunted bowling pins.  There were about 4 or five on each side for a total of 9 to 11.  They appeared to be low enough above the tree tops that at first I thought, &#34;cool bats flying in formation!&#34; after which I quickly thought, &#34;no, bats don&#39;t fly in formation, maybe they&#39;re ducks.&#34;   Then of course almost instantly I realized that neither bats nor ducks glow orange and that it must have in fact been a vessel of some sort which blocked out the stars behind it.  Then, while it was still in a visible spot, unimpeded by treetops, the lights went out and that was it.  I did not notice if the stars continued to be blotted out in the same trajectory, as it all happened so fast.  What was mos! t noticeable was the speed at which it moved across the sky-- 2-3 seconds heading from north to south and the fact that there was absolutely no sound associated with the movement.  Could that have been a stealth bomber? And would it fly  at such a low altitude?<n>

I noticed a bright double strobe of light in the N-NW sky about 80 degress in altitude. I dismissed it as nothing but kept looking at the &#34;star&#34; in which it originated. It double-strobed again. About 2 seconds later, another object about 10 degrees away to the south appeared to give a &#34;reply&#34; double-strobe. Both objects were stationary and had a magnitude of about 2.0 when not flashing. Immediately, both objects started slowly moving toward the SE. The lights faded to dark within 10 seconds and I didn&#39;t see anything else. The amount of distance covered when both objects faded to dark were not consistent with normal satellites moving into the earth&#39;s shadow. This means that the object&#39;s light source was not created by the reflection of the sun at that altitude. I assume the altitude was very high since none of the stars in the direct path were eclipsed by the ! object. At the presumed altitude, the objects went from a standstill to the speed of an orbiting satellite in under a second. I have no other supporting information of this sighting nor were there other witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They were too slow for planes, and made no noise so could not be helicopters (you can always hear a helicopter here from miles aways) I watche dthem and counted as more and more appeared i got to 40 before some disappeared behind a cloud, i watched for about 5-10 minutes as they slowly moved round to the side window of the house and disappeared behind a cloud. I tried to take a photo but my camera is not very good in the dark, by the time i remembered the camera had a video setting there were only 4 lights left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can honestly say i have never seen anything like it it would not look out of place in an alien movie. 40 flickering orange lights, too slow for a plane, and too silent for anything else, a formation that i could draw but not describe. the sky was a darkening grey but with dark clouds (typical english night) no stars out yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i did not see anything else in the sky at all not even the normal flicker of planes,<n>

I was just stargazing, as there were a few nice meteors. I noticed as I looked southeast a large, red/orange ball flying east at approximately 1500 feet, going fast. The object was in my sight for approximately five seconds, before leaving my view by going behind some trees. As I had been looking in that direction a few seconds before, and saw nothing, then looked west-northwest for a second, then looked back to the south when I observed the object, I have no idea where it came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up and went into my home to get a camera in the hope of seeing it again, but it did not come back this way. I live on a hill overlooking a pasture going down a valley to the south for two miles. I have a great view of this valley, with the east and west being blocked by woods. This area is not a flight corridor, with the exception of three to four C-130’s that fly over during the week. This was not a plane.

Am I seeing what I think I&#39;m seeing... what do you see?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> She looked up and said, &#34;Yes, it&#39;s a light doing figure eights zipping around real fast.&#34;  She says it was 1 light but I thought it was 2 because it looked that way to me since the light was zipping so fast.  My sight is much poorer than hers, so I only put 1 as the number of craft seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The airplane flew normally and the light stayed as it was when I first saw it, making zig zag patterns in what seemed like a small span of space until it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time either of us ever saw anything &#34;weird&#34; like this.  It&#39;s my estimate that the whole thing lasted about 10 seconds. Thanks for the chance to report it.<n>

I looked up to see how heavy the clouds were and noticed the lights, which were each about the size of a moon but with fuzzy edges because they were above the clouds.

Then I looked for a beam of light which would indicate they were searchlights from the ground but saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nervous, I returned to the house and watched them from the deck.

I told my friends to check that out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took about 6 seconds to fly from 1 side of the sky to another. It looked like boomerang, had 6 lights, 2 at one &#34;wing&#34;, 2 in the middle, 2 at the other &#34;wing&#34;.  But it was not very clear, it looked a little foggy. it flied right above us, its speed was so fast that it took only like 6 seconds to fly across the sky. with absolutely no sound. i couldnt say what was its height, hard to understand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> e went back to room... when finished watching a tv show, then we came out, checked the sky again, about 2 minutes after checking we saw 2 cube like things flying, they made extreme turns and moved like.. ahh its hard to explain in english for me. it was like 1 side of it was real and other was in mirror. they moved very similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3rd time occurred maybe 3 minutes after last one, then there was, i think, 3 objects (it could be 1 object aswell just maybe the lights under it moved), all looked  like cubes and once again moving very close to each other and making those &#34;calculated&#34; moves. it is impossible to explain how did they move by typing it down, all i can say is that all that is known to a civil person about flying objects, that was not one of them, these things are sure unexplained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> me, myself always been a skeptic, i still want to believe that they were some kind of secret government aircrafts or something...<n> <n><n> <n><n> i hope this information helped u<n>

They moved in a different way than a plane and the planes here do not have orange lights. They were not moving like a helicopter either. They were a different shape, almost like an oval-ish triangle. They moved horizontally and were low in the sky, then changed directions and made a diagonal shift upwards then again until they disappeared. We watched them for a good 10 minutes. There were 2 of them that we noticed. They were not moving simultaneously and they were a slight distance apart.

These suckers were big and low to the ground, hovering around 500 to 1,000 feet above the ground, drifting in and out of the clouds passing. There were two groups, one consisted of only three and the other had four in it. Making a total of 7 BIG ORANGE LIGHTS IN THE SKY NOT TOO FAR UP!!  No flares,no trails,no blinking lights,no sound..and they moved eastward and the other group moved north east. Both very slowly and in different directions. It was ODD to say the least! They look liked glowing oranges in the sky and hovered below the &#34;LOW&#34; cloud line. My first thought was hey maybe they are planes getting ready to land, but no blinking lights, and they looked like HUGE ORANGE ORBS! I dont know what to say, why has this not been talked about yet, many cars pulled over along the roads to see this!<n>

By the way I do not believe in UFO&#39;s and I am an elementary school teacher who has never saw anything out of the ordinary in the night sky.  While we got jupiter in focus we noticed a couple of its moons and could faintly see a couple rings.  We sit in the lawn chairs and began to talk at how clear the sky was and all the stars we could see.  As we talked my step dad asked me to look at a group of stars and pointed for me to look at the bright one in the center.  It was not Jupiter.  As we looked at it it flashed like a camera had just took our picture.  It never moved and only took 3 seconds to dim again.  This happened 3 more times during the night to other faint stars we looked at.  I don&#39;t know what it was, if it was other objects crashing into eac! h other.  I just know it was wierd to see.

In a large clear patch of blue sky approx 30 degrees to the South of due East I noticed a shiny white metallic object that I assumed was an airplane.  The object was clear against the blue sky, as an airplane would appear on a clear day.  The object appeared silver-white and shiny as it was clearly was lit up by the sun.  I estimate the size of the object as equal to a passenger jet, maybe 150’, and estimate location above Lake Erie, 1-2 miles North of Sandusky, OH at approx elevation 25,000-30,000 feet.  Estimated distance of object from observer: 5 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have assumed the object was a plane had I not noticed that the object was not moving as an airplane would.  It appeared stationary in the sky.  After watching it for approx 5 seconds I could see it was “drifting” slowly from right to left (South to North).  There was no vapor trail associated with the object, as I had noticed on airplanes the day before.  There were no airplanes in the area that morning while I was observing the object to compare the object to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had clear sharp edges, and appeared to be metallic.  It had no wings or tail fins like an airplane.  The object emitted no noise.  It was not unlike the fuselage of an airplane but slightly thinner at the left (North) end than the right (South) end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was staring at the object, that was still clearly visible against the blue sky, it disintegrated (became invisible) before my eyes.  It disintegrated from top to center and from bottom to center.  It took only about ½ second to go from a completely solid object to completely gone.  This disintegration is what convinced me beyond a shadow of a doubt this was not a plane, but an unexplained sighting of a solid object that was visible one second and gone the next.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total time of observation was approx 15-20 seconds.<n>

He has a picnic table so I lied down and looked up for a few minutes, saw a shooting star and kept looking up.  At 3:23 a.m. I noticed 5 dim non blinking yellow lights in a pattern moving over the top of a tree headed due south toward downtown.  They were arranged in a V pattern and I could see the black out line of the craft barely against the black sky. It made no noise, just cruised almost directly over me for about 20 seconds, then I lost sight of it when it flew behind a tree and into the light coming from the downtown area. Dyess AFB is just a few miles away and I stay up every night so I know this was no airplane, we see those all the time.  It made no noise and traveled about as fast as the little planes at Abilene Regional Airport, just casually cruising by.  Thats about it.<n>

For a brief couple of seconds, I witnessed a bright orange ball of light in the southern sky, that seemed to be traveling in a north-easterly direction. The light had no trail behind it, of smoke or sparks. It seemed to travel in an arc towards Chicago, and I lost it behind the clouds over the city. The ball of light was as bright as Venus or Mars at their brightest in the night sky, and traveled about 40 degrees of the sky faster than any airplane could silently, and at an altitude above the cloud cover. The object was clearly visible despite the city&#39;s light pollution of the night sky.

It was DEFINITELY NOT a falling star as it did not lose altitude but swept across the night sky with a speed I have never seen.  It was the size of a satellite, to the observer of such, a came out of the south (from the direction of the NY airports), but at the height of a satellite) with great speed (also unlike tracking a satellite) headed north.  I followed the sighting for a few seconds until it was no longer visible then turned quickly toward the west and saw the same thing, for perhaps two seconds.  I am not sure that what I saw for a second heading west was also the same object but since I was keeping a careful eye in the sky was also able to catch that brief sighting.  The entire three or four second event (including three seconds from south to north and one or two in the west)was an object very high in the sky the size of satellite.  However, it was differentiated by the speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an educated woman (Smith College graduate) who studied astronomy and has visited numerous observatories.

What occurred was by far the strangest thing that I have ever experienced. Its very simple to describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son, my daughter and myself were on out lanai behind our house. We began to hear a “rumble” type of sound that was very steady yet faint in the distance. I guess you could describe it as the sound of a distant jet taking off. However, the sound became louder and more clear over the course of about 45 seconds. We walked outside the lanai door to see what it was. The sound was moving above us through the air but we could see nothing but stars. As the sound approached us, it was less like a rumble and more like the sound of &#34;feedback&#34; from a speaker turned way up. Very steady and deliberate and definitely not the sound of any combustion type engine. It sounded very “bassy” and it felt as though you could look straight up to see exactly where the sound was coming from but there was nothing there at all. My son said “the air smells like a penny…like metal”. I smelled it too but I would describe it more as an electrical smell.  At one point, the sound then became more general a! nd it was very difficult to tell which direction it was coming from. It was disorienting almost making me feel dizzy. You could still tell it was coming from above and now moving away from us from the West to East. It eventually just faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was definitely something in the sky. We never seen a thing but it was without question coming from an object up there none of us could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Moving at the same pace it turned away and then looked to travel upward(as the lights got closer together and dimmer).   It kept traveling into the milky way until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  We never heard sound at any time.  The lights were white (like headlights of a car) and did not change color.<n>

The image was moving in different directions, but maintained relatively the same position in the sky.  No noise was heard and an aircraft (possibly commercial) was spotted east of the object, moving from south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was facing almost directly west, looking up towards the Big Dipper, when I saw a bright flash out of the corner of my eye.  I looked where I had seen the flash, in the constellation Hercules, near the star Sigma, and saw a reddish point of light traveling south through Hercules.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood up, watching it, and said “What the **** is that?”  My mother looked up where I was pointing, and as she did so, the object flashed again.  The flash was extremely bright, and it charged up first, flashed bright enough that it almost hurt the eyes, and then dimmed back to the reddish color again.  It proceeded to do this 2 more times as it traveled through Hercules, past the stars Eta and Epsilon, and then continued without flashing until it faded from sight.  I can’t imagine that anyone in the area looking at the sky that night didn’t see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later, I was outside by myself smoking a cigarette, and a small reddish light that I believe was the same object came back through the sky going the opposite direction, coming from the southwest, curving around Vega and then continuing northeast until it passed behind some clouds.  A flash was seen behind the clouds, but I can’t be sure that it wasn’t lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I don&#39;t know if it was a plane or what, I just get a feeling that it wasn&#39;t.  It was moving, at a regular pace, just king of moving along.  The flat edge of the triangle was at the front and the point with the white light was at the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was with me but he was sleeping.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But this week my friends mom, sister and niece reported strange lights in the night sky of our neighborhood for the last week or so. They stay out to watch it nightly till 1am. It was foggy in the SFBay last night so I waited until tonight. From San Leandro, CA looking in the direction of San Mateo (probably beyond)they called and said to look at the star in the sky. Upon further observation with the naked eye, I can confirm movement on behalf of the &#34;star&#34;. It has a light rotating around it and every now and again it would move in circles and other intelligent patterns. At times it will expand and grow faint for about 10 seconds and then reform itself into the red and white glistening &#34;star&#34;. It&#39;s pretty intersting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/20/09 21:00|Lyle|WA|Changing|4 hours|Multiople haloed domes, orb with lightning bolts, beam, rectangular structure, 7 dancing  objects in formation twinkling white and red|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83493.html|190|ndxe200908| Multiople haloed domes, orb with lightning bolts, beam, rectangular structure, 7 dancing  objects in formation twinkling white and red<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I are no strangers to UFO’s and other oddities, both from an early age.  We have experienced these alone and in the company of others.  By far one of the most dramatic sightings occurred on the night of August 20, 2009, preceded by a strange observation on August 19th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 19th, we went to our favorite local star-gazing site, about 20 minutes from our home, on Fisher Hill Road above Lyle, Washington.  This is on the west edge of the Klickitat River gorge.  The sky was clear.  We arrived as the sky was darkening, and set up our recliners to observe the sky for meteors, planets, and satellites in our usual manner.  Various aircraft pass over the area.  There were surprisingly few satellites in evidence that night. We saw a few meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We rotated our chairs for several vantages, finally settling on facing the northwest sky.  It didn’t seem like we had been there long before we observed a bright white light appearing and traveling toward us from the NW, at about 45 degrees. It quickly expanded into about the size of a quarter at arm’s length, quite bright, and of an iridescent quality, with brilliant rays surrounding it. We were excited, when suddenly it took a sharp turn to the right, shrinking down quickly to a speck as it disappeared to the north. Figuring that was the best we would see that night, we decided to head home, and were both surprised to find that we had been gone for 5 hours. It seemed like much less, perhaps 2 at the most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night we both had a strong desire to return to the same spot. We arrived at dusk, observing a few small, scattered cumulus clouds low in the west. To the north, although the sky was clear, we saw sheet lightening, so set up our chairs facing NE up the Klickitat gorge, where we could see the west edge of Grayback Mountain. As we watched, the sheet lightening expanded into 4 areas of inception which did not move left or right but rather expanded toward us. The nearest area appeared to be right behind Grayback Mountain, the next closest in the direction of Mt. Adams to the NW, and the 2 other areas much farther to the north, northeast. It was an entertaining enough show, coupled with our usual stargazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the sky darkened, so began the oddest show either of us had ever seen. Enormous haloed domes began to explode behind Grayback. The interior was a brilliant iridescent white, perhaps twice the size of a large full moon on the horizon. The halos were about half the diameter of the domes, and about half the brilliance. There were so many of them we could hardly keep our eyes still. They also began to explode from the next closest area to the northwest, but the most action came from  behind  Grayback at first.  We began to see enormous lightning bolts emerge from the domes to the east, then arc back toward the center. Some would connect, and some would not quite, ending in forks. The duration of the domes and the lightning was uncommonly long, so that we could actually study them for a good moment. Throughout the night we heard no thunder whatsoever, and it was quiet enough to hear the occasional passing plane. It was thrilling. As a long time fire-fighter, trained in meteoro! logy, I had never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while I noticed a bright light toward the top of Grayback, a distance west of a few residencial lights that we sometimes see. I observed for a while, wondering if it was a star rising, when my husband said “Has that light always been there?” I said I didn’t think so, I’d been watching it for a while to see if it was rising. It seemed odd. We pondered it a bit. The domes were going crazy, and as I observed them slightly to the east, my husband cried out “Whoa!” and my eye was drawn back to the diminishing light of an enormous white beam that he had seen shoot out from the small light toward the northwest, extending high into the sky.  After it retracted, we watched the light turn bright red for a long moment, return to white, then  rise slowly above Grayback,  growing in size and brilliance, resembling the light we had seen the night before. Then it sank slowly down, contracted to its original size and position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As if things weren’t odd enough, the light began to exude a sort of mist toward its left edge, which gradually brightened and expanded, revealing a huge rectangular structure atop Grayback, impossibly large, perhaps fully the width of the domes, which were still exploding.	The rectangle had clearly defined edges, was silver-gray in color, and had vertical lines dividing it into five even segments. We were afforded a long look at this object, asking “Do you see that?!” before it melted again into a mist that gradually retracted into the original white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The domes were really picking up now, exploding over the horizon from the area northwest now as well, backed by the constant sheet lightning from the two more distant areas. Occasionally a plane would pass over, clearly heard. We do not recall if the domes were evident at those times, perhaps only the sheet lightning. But things got even stranger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A white light blinked on to the northeast, perhaps at 30 degrees. It appeared as the light of a low small plane, blinking and twinkling at irregular intervals, yet it remained stationary. Occasionally it would blink red. Then we noticed other similar lights blink on to the east and west, moving south as if to surround us. Indeed they did. There was  a total of seven that surrounded us in a horseshoe pattern, open to the north, blinking wildly. We stood up and turned to look up at them as they moved into formation around us and stopped. Then they began blinking and bobbing about wildly in a sort of dance, and we both lifted our arms and danced with them. We had the feeling of complete exultation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the dance, they slowly glided off on each side of us, one by one disappearing into the area of the domes, except for the first light which never changed position. We settled back down to watch the dome show, which was really wild by now. We kind of watched our sentry as we called it, the first blinking light. Suddenly I realized that it was a small plane, moving toward us from the east, which could be heard.  As we thought “What the…??” the plane passed, and our sentry blinked back on. After a short time a plane approached it from the west, and we watched it blink off, then reappear after the plane had passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The domes became less frequent from the Grayback area, and emanated from the northwest area more.  The activity gradually lessened.  At one point my husband turned his back, and I saw a full, brilliant haloed globe leap high into the air, with a perfect arched bolt of lightning reconnecting to it. It appeared slightly more concentrated than the domes, as one might expect of an object cleared of the horizon, the size of the sun at least. It was amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As things slowed down to occasional sheet lightning, our little sentry friend glided north toward Grayback, disappearing behind it.  Finally my husband said, &#34;I think our work here is done.&#34; I agreed. We packed up and drove home, both surprised again to find that we had been gone for 4 hours. It didn’t seem that long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A weird story, I agree.  But that’s what happened. We’ve searched for descriptions of this sort of lightning, but have never found anything even close. I’ve never seen bolts of lightning without accompanying thunder, although none of them hit the ground, they all arched back into the domes, or the globe.  In spite of our many weird experiences and sightings, including a huge green  fireball sighted  a month earlier in central Oregon, and a large, slow, low-flying orange globe observed by at least 4 others later in the summer at the Lewis River, we have never seen anything so incredible.  We just had to finally share it. We welcome any input.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have identified our viewing location on GoogleEarth and can give you the exact location.<n>

I was looking up periodically as I usually do trying to see any shooting stars when I noticed what  I at first thought was a satellite moving across the sky. I am a Chemical Engineer and was getting ready to leave for my regular morning workout before work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is quite common to spot satellites from my house and I enjoy tracking them across the sky and so am quite familiar with how fast they travel and what they look like (basically look like a moving small star). The ones I usually spot are typically moving in a West/East direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I focused in on the moving object in the southern sky I realized that there were actually 3 objects. Two were adjacent to each other and the third was following behind about 5 to 8 times the distance of the two that were adjacent to each other. They looked very much like a satellite would (like small moving stars) and took about 30-40 seconds to move across the entire visible sky. They were traveling in a North to North West direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is how they were aligned in the sky: + + +<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Since the Miami airport is also visible from that point of view, I first thought they were far-off planes, though no other planes in the sky radiated anywhere near as much light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately dismissed this first theory when I noticed the lights start hovering freely around the skyscrapers, sometimes in a circular manner, other times floating from the base to the tip of buildings (and vice versa) in a matter of seconds. I&#39;ve never seen a human aircraft of any variety move so freely and quickly as these lights did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They continued to circle the buildings for about 15-20 minutes until they both suddenly rose into the sky together and descended into the bay/ocean.<n>

I asked my family (4 members all above age 17) “What the heck is that?” By this time the craft was on the right side of my van hovering low over a field and I could no longer watch because there was a lot of traffic. My kids were freaked out!. According to them – the thing then had red and green lights and was flying very low and keeping up with us. Then my daughter-in-law and my daughter saw the thing drop two colored balls onto the ground. The thing kept up with us for about a half to 1 mile and then just disappeared. While I have seen a UFO – 30 years ago – my kids had never seen anything like this. They wanted to go back and look for it. But the traffic was too heavy and not many places to turn around. I know that a lot of other people on that road that night saw something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish they too would report it. My kids are now believers.<n>

It was after 11:30 at night and pretty much a clear sky.  I saw what looked like a very bright star in the NE . To the naked eye, it was brighter then the other stars around. I had binoculars which I used. I saw a sphere like object that was primarily red with white and green and some blue.It almost looked like a firework that went off but a much smaller effect. It also was pulsating.Did not really move a great distance but twitched. It would change from the sphere to the bright point. I called for my husband to take a look. He was not sure either what it was. My husband took a picture of the object next to a light. Two red lights can be seen along with steak of white light.  We live near O&#39;Hare flight path but most of the flights had stopped by that time. We have lived in the area for 22 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object appeared to be over the Gulf of Mexico.  I live in a small town just north of Tampa called Weeki Wachee  I was by myself and at first I thought that I was seeing a very bright sparkly star throwing off a lot of light, mainly blue, red and white.  I looked at other stars in the sky to see if it was just me and I looked back at this one bright star.  I was definitely different.  With my naked eye, I could clearly make out a red, blue and white light, flashing like night aircraft lights.  I questioned myself and thought, this has to be a plane but it did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside at the time, so I came in and looked through a strong pair of binoculars.  How I would describe the object is as follows; the object was quite some distance away from my home over the Gulf of Mexico.  It appears to have a shape similar to a box kite.  Two rectangles, one at the top and bottom and some kind of connecting piece, thin, between the rectangles, just like a box kite.  The red and blue color flashes switched between the top and bottom rectangles while the connecting piece remained a bright shining white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to witness this for at lease 10 minutes before the object went behind the clouds and never reappeared.  I did not see the object again until last night, 8/31/2009 at 10:30 pm EST.  It appeared in the same spot in the sky, mid way up on the horizon.  This time my wife was home and she too witnessed this flashing light.  Same colors, no movement and like before.  It stayed visible for at least 10 minutes before it disappeared behind the clouds.<n>
8/19/09 22:00|Vale|OR|Triangle|30 minutes|Before I go into any detail about our experience, I would like to preface this account with a description of the area we were in. O|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72574.html|202|ndxe200908| Before I go into any detail about our experience, I would like to preface this account with a description of the area we were in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our campsite is nestled in a stand of trees in the southwest corner of a huge rock bar in the Owyhee Canyon area, south of Vale, Oregon.  The rock bar is approximately two football fields in length and I would say close to three hundred feet wide.  Next to the river’s eastern edge sit’s a small hill about 100 feet tall.  Due west of our location is the ridge line near the Owyhee Breaks, approximately 1 to 1 ½ miles away.  South of our campsite, around five miles away is an area called Birch Creek.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a wide open desert area, where we can see for long distances in most directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were sitting near the river’s edge that evening, we noticed two red lights above and beyond Red Butte.  This is a volcanic mesa with an elevation of 4584 feet and is around 7 miles northeast of our location.  The two red lights were huge; in relation to the stars behind them, they were at least twice the size.  The lights were perfectly parallel and were heading our direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had a campfire burning that night and our curiosity was piqued as the two lights continued their approach.  As we continued watching the red lights, we began to hear a “soft” jet noise.  Jeff made a comment that he believed they were two military jets headed our  way to check out the campfire.   As the lights began to drop lower into the canyon and slow down, I disagreed with Jeff’s assessment of these lights being military jets, as the lights were going far too slow.  From Red Butte to our location,  had they been jets, they would have arrived at the rock bar in a very short time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the two lights continued their advance toward our location, their steady drop in elevation and deceleration became more noticeably evident.  It was becoming quite clear there was something not right about these lights.  The noise did not fit the bill of military jets either, they weren’t loud enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is what bothered me about the noise.  The jet noise of the two advancing lights was similar to that of conventional aircraft, but what I can relate as only “soft” jet sound, nothing near the decibels you would expect for a low flying military craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another thing that wasn’t quite right was that we have seen numerous commercial and military jets fly through this area, but NEVER have we seen military aircraft out at night at this location; an area we have been visiting for almost a decade. The commercial planes flying at night and at day are what you would expect to hear given the planes respective altitudes.  However, the military jets we have witnessed doing maneuvers in this area, are ALWAYS during the daytime and generally flying much higher  and are remarkably louder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights reached a distance between one and two miles away, they had descended to an elevation of maybe 1000 to 1500 feet and the closer they approached the lower the elevation and slower the speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somewhere around 1000 feet away, the altitude of these mysterious lights dropped to what I believe is 500 to 700 feet in elevation and began to literally float like a blimp towards us.  I was unnerved to say the least and completely fixated on what I was seeing.  “Military jets can’t fly this slow,”  I said to Jeff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this time that I got out of my chair and approached my four wheeler, which was approximately 15 feet away.  Prior to this, I had been sitting about 10 feet from the river and 8 or so feet from the campfire…I wanted a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the two lights began entering the north area of  the rock bar, I became transfixed.  My heart was racing as these lights were slowly making their way towards us, all the while emitting the “soft” jet noise.  The altitude had dropped even more, to somewhere around 100 feet above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What in the world is going on, I thought.  As it continued getting nearer, my mind was trying to make sense of what my eyes were seeing.  The sound, the speed, the color of the lights, the fact it was floating…nothing seemed logical…and it was big whatever it was.  Jeff and I were flinging  commentaries to each other, but I haven’t a clue what he said until…  The lights were almost directly overhead when Jeff began yelling something about two red lights.  I was mesmerized and began moving further up the rock bar, my head craned directly up.  As the lights were just barely past me, it was here that the realization hit me.  I could see a solid structure between the two red lights.  I began yelling at him that, “It’s not two red lights, it’s a solid object!!!”   “It’s solid, the lights are connected!!!”  I stared in utter amazement.  I could not see underneath, it was as black as the sky, I could only make out the structure between the lights.  (My estimate as to the width of the craft is 100 feet, based on how much of the rock bar it appeared to cover at it’s apparent altitude).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jeff yelled again and said, “No, no…look up higher and to the left, there’s two more lights!”  Not wanting to take my eyes off the object, I quickly glanced up and left and there they were, two more red lights, another object identical  to what I was seeing directly above me.  This one however, was at a much higher altitude…possibly one to two thousand feet.  I quickly diverted my attention back to the one above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stunned!  What I had just seen didn’t make any sense.  With the realization that these lights were one solid object, a craft, I was left bewildered.  There was no transition between the approach of the two lights and the departure of the two lights.  I never saw two coming and two leaving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I didn’t have time for this passing thought.  I was truly in awe of the events transpiring at the time.  Thoughts and emotions were whipping through my mind and body at that moment.  I didn‘t want to take my eyes off it for anything.  “Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, do you believe this?”  “No one is going to believe this,”  I yelled to Jeff.  I was overwhelmed, astonished and excited.  My body began shaking and my knees literally went weak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Grab the camera!!!”  Jeff yelled.  I ran back to the four wheeler and could not remember what side I had put it in.  I was fumbling around in the dark, trying to watch the object and feeling through the myriad of items I had in my atv.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was nearing the far south end of the rock bar, while I was still searching feverishly for the camera.  On the back of my atv, is an added seat that has two storage units on either side.  I am an avid rock hound and both sides were full of rocks, water bottles, towels, clothes and snacks.  I ran from one side of my atv to the other trying to locate the camera.  Minutes were passing by and the craft was disappearing down the canyon when I finally found the camera case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shaking so bad, I could barely unzip it.  Trying to watch the craft and operate a camera with my mind racing and trying to function normally was an impossible mission at this point.  I finally did open the lens of the camera and thought I was hitting the shutter button when I had actually hit the off button.  I was exasperated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned the camera on again.  By this time the craft had picked up speed and altitude and was now nearing the Birch Creek area.  Pointing the camera towards the craft, nothing was registering on the viewfinder…the screen was black.  I yelled at Jeff , “…nothing is registering.”  I hit the zoom, but still could not find the lights in the viewfinder.  I realized it was a fruitless attempt, so I turned the camera off and put the handle over my wrist as I continued to watch the craft depart down the canyon.  (I had just purchased this camera in May and was unfamiliar with all it’s settings).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this juncture that we were to witness an amazing exhibition  that left me completely awestruck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft went beyond Birch Creek, it had gained considerable altitude and had met up with the other craft.  We could no longer hear them.  While the  initial craft always appeared to be much larger, I am unsure whether this was due to the fact that it was always higher and farther away.  While I know this is the logical train of thought, the second sighting has me in doubt of this presumed fact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden both crafts apparently turned and when they did, we now saw three red lights each on both crafts…both vessels were now triangle shaped!  An isosceles triangle to be precise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crafts stood still for a moment and in almost slow motion pointed their noses relatively straight up, sat momentarily and then shot off into the night sky like a rocket, the smaller craft first and then the larger one.  They moved so swiftly that within seconds we lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, and with much fervor I exclaimed, “Oh my God, do you believe what we just saw…this is the stuff you see on TV,” such was the discourse upon witnessing this spectacle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jeff and I were conversing loudly and excitedly to one another for the next few minutes.  After ten or fifteen minutes of our impassioned discussion, we heard jet noise again.  It couldn’t be…but it was.  Slightly southeast over the small hill across the river, came two red lights.  Not three in a triangle shape, only two like we had seen to begin with.  This time however, it was flying at a few thousand feet in altitude.  I would hazard a guess at roughly three to possibly five thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Camera still in hand, I turned it on and began clicking.  I made the same faux paux I made before and accidentally turned the camera off.  Regaining my composure, I made sure this time my finger stayed on the shutter button and I began clicking away.  Still…nothing was registering on the viewfinder.  I quickly realized I needed to change the camera settings and began flipping the dial as I tried to get the lights in the viewfinder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found the “night” setting, but still nothing in the viewfinder, so I just pointed and shot.  The craft was crossing the canyon at a much faster speed this time and I was having a hard time keeping watch of it and trying to shoot photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After snapping several shots I lowered the camera.  Since I could see nothing at all through the lens, I at least wanted to see with my eyes.  It was then we noticed the second craft.  It was once more flying at a much higher altitude, escorting the first and larger craft.  They  crossed almost due west over the rock bar in very short time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they reached the west side of the canyon, the speed slowed to a near halt and again they turned.  Once more we could now see two triangular shaped craft, each possessing three lights.  Again, one craft appearing much larger, at least two to three times larger than the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The larger craft slowly lowered itself to just above the mountain top, hovered momentarily and then began a series of maneuvers.  The second craft turned to horizontal and remained stationary, as if watching or waiting for the larger craft.  While viewing the objects at this location, which is barely a mile or so from the rock bar, we did not hear any noise coming from the crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The larger craft tilted what would seem to be it’s left wing or side up and then came back to horizontal.  It then slowly maneuvered it’s nose up and again back to horizontal.  In it’s final movement, it tilted the nose down…and back again to horizontal…hovered briefly and then sank slowly behind the mountain as if it were landing.  The second craft did no maneuvers of any kind, it slowly descended down, almost in sync with the large craft as if it too were landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (While the craft was just passing over me when we were on the rock bar, I did get a spectacular view of the rear end of the craft.  I have since drawn diagrams and images.  Please see attached).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The story doesn’t end here.  A couple of odd things happened the very next day.  While we didn’t see any craft the following day, what occurred on Thursday has definitely made me wonder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 9:05 a.m. when I was taking a stroll through the stand of tree that surround our camping area.  I heard an extremely loud jet sound and looked up.  There above me, flying at only a couple of thousand feet was a Stealth Bomber and it was heading directly towards the location the two craft had appeared to land the previous night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How odd, I thought…is this just a coincidence?  For as long as we’ve been coming here…never have we seen Stealth in this area.  I came back to camp and asked Jeff if he had seen the Stealth…his reply was no…although he did hear the jet noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 10:00 a.m., Thursday, August 20, 2009.  We’re cleaning up the breakfast dishes when we hear noise on the mountains behind our camp.  Behind us are two roads that traverse this recreation area.  A lower road, which is directly 20 feet behind our tent and then the upper road which is maybe a hundred yards further up toward the base of the hills.  Both roads run north and south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Inspecting the noise, Jeff had walked out of camp to the access road that leads to the road behind us and stated there were two rigs coming down the hill.  “You’re kidding,”  I said, surprised at this development. As far as I knew, this road was nothing more than an atv trail, a fairly steep one at that.  I made my way to Jeff’s location and for a brief time watched in amazement as these two vehicles slowly made their way down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here again was another anomaly.  In all our years at this area, a place that we come to at least twice a year, only once have I seen anything on this hill, and that was a four wheeler - an all terrain vehicle.  Although I was surprised that two vehicles were on this road, I didn’t give it much more thought…I returned to camp and began to prepare our atv’s for our morning ride.  My thoughts were due to change promptly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While loading the atv’s with the necessary items, it struck me.  I grabbed our Oregon Road and Recreation Atlas to see where this road leads.  This steep desert road takes you to an area in the general vicinity where the crafts seemed to land the previous night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly thereafter, with both Jeff and I in camp, we heard the vehicles getting nearer…very near.  Within a few seconds, the vehicles were coming down the road directly behind our camp.  Jeff and I quickly walked out the short driveway that leads to the road behind our camp to see what was up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first vehicle we observed was an older model jeep, white in color I believe, and the second rig was also an older model blue pickup with an atv in the bed.  Both men were middle aged, I would say early 50’s or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was so peculiar about this encounter was that as the two men drove slowly by, within 30 feet, they did nothing but stare.  There were no hello’s, no waves…nothing but a stoic gaze.  We have ran across or met a few people in our visits here and with one exception everyone either waves or stops to chat, but not these two.  Another odd thing was, it seemed pretty obvious to me that the two vehicles made a bee line to our location.  But why?  If you’re hunters (antelope season had recently opened) and you’re checking to see if this camping area is available, you would have noticed this location was occupied when you were directly behind our tent.  There would be no need to slow your vehicles down to a crawl and stare as they did.  Granted these thoughts are mere speculation as to the motives of these two individuals, it was nonetheless strange behavior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two vehicles proceeded to the upper road, headed north and we never saw them again.  Now had they been hunters interested in bagging game in this canyon, there are only a few other camping areas available and we would have either seen them, heard their vehicles or atv and in all likelihood heard gunshots.  Neither occurred that day.  For within an hour, Jeff and I rode our atv’s a few miles past Red Butte, passing all the camping locations along the way.  There were no sign of the men or their vehicles and no indication they had taken the road we were on as there weren’t any  fresh tracks on the road that goes due east past Red Butte.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now whether these two men are witnesses to the previous night’s events, I can only conjecture.  Their sudden appearance and quick disappearance seemed odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next occurrence was at 4:00 p.m. that afternoon.  After returning to camp from our ride beyond Red Butte, we headed for the rock bar.  The day was hot and we wanted to be near the river the remainder of the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a very short time, we began to hear jet sounds again.  I was in the midst of my hunt for rocks and Jeff was in the river on the float tube.  Every time we have visited this locale, the military jets do their maneuvers directly south of us about two to three miles above a place called Griffith Ranch…but not today. Today the sound was very loud and close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking up, I spied only one jet.  It’s not at the usual altitude either, this one is flying lower than normal and is crisscrossing the rock bar at an east and west trajectory.  Here again is a peculiar thing.  In all our years camping here, we have always observed two jets executing maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the jet momentarily and returned to my rock hunting.  As the jet proceeded to traverse the canyon, I went to the river to cool off.  What happened next is another unusual event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you recall the small hill I mentioned earlier in this report; this hill is no higher than 100 to 150 feet.  I was standing in the river, a mere stone’s throw from the base of this hill cooling off, when the noise of the jet became extremely loud.  Looking up, the jet had changed his flight path and was suddenly approaching from the south at an extremely low altitude.  As he neared, he flew directly over the small hill around 20 to maybe 50 feet above it’s peak.  His air speed had slowed to the point that when he flew past, I could see his headgear, oxygen mask and upper body.  He turned his head and looked directly at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, I was bewildered by this action.  I yelled to Jeff, who was about 50 yards downstream saying, “Did you see that?”  I met up with Jeff within a couple of minutes and we discussed how unusual this incident was.  We both pondered the pilots odd behavior and speculated on the possibility of being photographed, as nothing of this nature had ever taken place before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the end of the remarkable events we witnessed during our time here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have given much thought to the depth and length of the craft I witnessed over the rock bar and have been unable to determine the measurements.  Possibly with those who possess knowledge of geometry this issue could be resolved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a side note, a possible witness to be contacted would be the caretaker(s) who man a residence at Birch Creek.  While we haven’t been to this residence in four or five years, there used to be an elderly couple who manned a small ranch at this locale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following information is stated to give the reader(s) more information regarding the area where the sighting occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Near where the craft initially appeared, which as I stated is above and beyond Red Butte, is a very big reservoir called Lake Owyhee.  (Pronounced o-y-hee).  According to Trails.com, Lake Owyhee is “53 miles long and 139,00 acres, with an average depth of 80 feet and a maximum depth of 117 feet”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Different internet sources state contrary information regarding Lake Owyhee.  (A report from the Argus Observer, June 27, 1991 cites, “In some places the lake is nearly 500 feet deep and even in the worst of the drought Owyhee had 250 feet of water for 40 miles”).<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to the Oregon Bureau of Reclamation, “Owyhee Dam is a concrete, thick-arch structure which was designed to carry about three-fourths of the water load by arch action and the remainder by gravity action. The dam rises 417 feet above foundation in the river section, and 530 feet above the low point of the excavated fault zone. At the time of its construction, Owyhee ranked as the world&#39;s highest dam. The arch section is 623 feet long, and a gravity tangent extends 210 feet to the right abutment. The total capacity of Lake Owyhee is 1,120,000 acre-feet (active 715,200 acre-feet).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This site further states that, “…Hydraulic height (the normal operating depth at the dam) is 325 feet”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> See link:  http://www.usbr.gov/projects/PrintFacilityAttributes.jsp?fac_Name=Owyhee%20Dam  Another observation I noted while perusing our Oregon Road and Recreation Atlas, is a location called Ben Odell Reservoir which is not too far from where the crafts appeared  to have landed.  I have researched this small reservoir and can only find latitude and longitude information of 42.27922 and 117.60444 respectively.  I did find one small map that leads me to believe this reservoir is approximately ¾ of a mile long.  I have yet to find any more information.  This, as I stated previously, is in  the same general area the two unknown men came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the photos I took.  Having downloaded the images from the night of the sighting, I did manage to click the shutter 14 times and only captured one image of what appears to be a single point of light…possibly Mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the accompanying images, drawn by the reporting witness, please note that only the 3 red lights (per craft) were visible that gave the crafts their triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first image is what I witnessed upon seeing the craft pass by while on the rock bar.  The outer ring on the lights were a bright red/orange.  The inner ring was a lighter orange/red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bottom four sketches are the maneuvers the first and larger craft accomplished over the western ridge line before seeming to land.  All the maneuvers were done at a relatively slow pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> #1.  Shows the craft’s first maneuver, in which it appeared to lift it’s left side up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> #2.  Second maneuver was to lift the nose of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> #3.  The craft lowered the nose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> #4.  In it’s last move, the craft went back to horizontal, remained stationary for a moment, and then accompanied by the second craft sank behind the ridge line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reporting witness is a 51 year old licensed, but inactive real estate agent.

8/19/09 22:00|Albuquerque|NM|Cigar|3 hrs|Short cigar shaped object with rays of light eminating from one end; stayed in the sky for 2 hrs+.|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71762.html|203|ndxe200908| Short cigar shaped object with rays of light eminating from one end; stayed in the sky for 2 hrs+.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially this was a white light that emitted periodic white starburst-like rays that stayed fairly close to the center point of light. It would periodically move in a jerky manner and then stay completely stationery for a while. When the object came closer it appeared to be a stubby cigar-shaped tube and continued to emit light rays periodically from a central light point. At one time, for about 20, minutes a central point of light would appear (like a stamen on a flower) and the object would rotate around as though it were a satellite dish scanning the area below it. I went and got a neighbor to see it so I could be sure I wasn’t losing my mind or something. He didn’t know what to make of it but didn’t really seem to care and went back inside. I sat in my truck bed, realizing it was not a man-made object, and opened my arms wide and tried to mentally will it to come to me (if this makes any sense). To my amazement, it moved almost directly overhead and mov! ed closer, at which point I could no longer see the object but only the radiating light. It came closer to me and became like a cat or fox’s face with the light rays being like whiskers or something. It would come closer, actually very close, and immediately recede if I moved arms or blinked, as though it were tentative or shy. It seemed to prefer it when I crossed my arms over my chest rather than spread them wide. After ~15 or 20 minutes of this the cat’s face transformed slowly into almost the classical “alien’s face”. Then it seemed as though I was looking down the wrong end of a telescope; everything became dark around the outside and a narrowing circle of light was at the end with a being at the center who became increasingly wrinkled as the circle closed. I felt almost paralyzed but really started to freak out so I waved my arms and the whole thing retreated immediately. It then came closer and retreated but with the “alien face,” not the cat’s face. I watched this f! or probably 30 minutes and then figured that while this was a ! unique a nd weird thing going on there was no point in watching it any more and went inside to go to bed. I did look out the door a few times and the thing stayed around for maybe 10 minutes and then was gone.

I was facing roughly southeast, toward the Atlantic Ocean, which was approximately 5-6 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I saw some faint movement ahead of me in the sky that caught my eye.  They appeared to be a few different objects, at about a one o&#39;clock position in the sky from my point of view.  At first I thought it was a flock of large white birds (egrets or heron, I thought) illuminated by street lights from the ground because they didn&#39;t appear to be self illuminated, nor bright, for that matter.  It was not uncommon to see either species flying at night, but what occurred to me was that I&#39;d never seen them fly in flocks together, so I kept watching to figure out what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving in what appeared to be a straight line and as they got closer, I realized the motion they made was sporadic, not like the motion of birds flapping their wings in a somewhat rhythmic pattern.  I realized they weren&#39;t birds at this point, but I still couldn&#39;t make out exactly what they were.  As they got closer, I realized that they were definitely not birds or any common man made aircraft.  They were moving slowly toward me, travelling in a straight line from approximately south to north.  I realized when they got close enough, that there were three disk-shaped craft, travelling at what appeared to be a low altitude and they were completely silent.  That fact probably made the biggest impression on me, that they made no noise whatsoever.  And the fact that they appeared to be flying at a low altitude suggested they weren&#39;t very large craft at all.  They were flying close to each other but not in a uniform formation like military aircraft do. In fact, their posit! ion relative to each other changed slightly from the time I first noticed them to the last glimpse I got of them.  They were illuminated on the bottom by a very pale bluish white light, not very bright at all, which appeared to come from within the craft themselves.  This was the only illumination coming from the craft (on the bottoms), there were no lights on top, so that they almost appeared to be flat.  The illumination didn&#39;t light up the entire bottom of each craft at once either, but sort of danced around slowly and in a seemingly random way around the bottom surface of each one, lighting only portions of the bottom surface of each craft at a time.  The only reason I could tell they were a disk shape was when the illumination would reach the edge of the craft, I could see a distinctly circular shaped edge.  When the areas on the bottom of the craft weren&#39;t lit, I couldn&#39;t really see anything at all, because the unlit areas of the objects and the sky were both very dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They continued roughly in my direction, then were obstructed for a few seconds by a pine tree, then passed overhead to my left, in an unobstructed area between the tree branches and the side of the building I was standing in for about another two or three seconds (I realized there were four craft at this point) and they passed beyond the roof and were no longer visible.  I&#39;d gotten a good enough look at them to determine that they simply could not have been anything other than UFOs, at least nothing that I know of.  I&#39;d never seen anything like that before or since.<n>

We don&#39;t know exactly where we were but we were definitely in central California, deep in the boonies. As we were heading South, on our right side of the road we saw a diamond shaped flying object. It had red and green lights that surrounded the object. The object was first low then it tried to fly away but it seemed like something pulled it back then it went like 3 feet closer to the road then it went lower again. Thats all I could see, we were driving too fast for me to see if it went in the sky or not. The object was definitely close to the ground, maybe about 4-5 feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not good at describing how it moved but it certainly moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My fiancé said what is that? I looked up and saw a triangle shaped aircraft flying extremely low. It was moving unlike any aircraft I have ever seen, approximately at the same height that a helicopter would fly. It had one blinking light at the nose so I wanted to believe it was a military plane but I just don’t see how it could be. It was a very distinct triangle. No wings, no noise, and it looked to be gliding instead of flying. When I looked directly above me through the sunroof, I saw that it was clearly a triangle, and it was something I never saw before. It was hard for me to say it was a UFO at first, and actually I really wanted to believe it was a military jet (especially since there is a big naval base in Jacksonville), but it just didn’t seem to be one. Looking in my rear view mirror we saw the light for another minute or so just gliding away from us. I never thought I would one day en! counter something like this and now that I did, I see why so many people can’t explain some of the things they have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As i was looking up in the sky the flash happened again but very low on the ground and it looked crisp white and rectangular in appearance. It actually looked like a camera flash from about 250 feet away. There area that this flash occurred is an old garden plot grown up in weeds. A big clear field behind that. No houses for 1/4 mile. I saw it flash bright one more time and I went to the bedroom and told my wife there was a a strange light in the backyard and I was going out there to see what it was. She got up and went to the window and I heard her say, &#34;I just saw it too, what is it?&#34; I told her I didn&#39;t know but I was getting my flashlight and going out there to see. I walked out through the back yard and pointed my light all around. There was nothing , no sound either. Then as I ! was shining the light out in front of me my wife said, hey did you see it. I said no, she said to your left, and I pointed my light off to the left. Nothing. Then she said can&#39;t you see that? I did it again, same spot. Nope I didn&#39;t see any flash. About that time my hair stood up on the back of my neck. I began walking back to the house and I saw the flash reflect off the house. By this time my daughter had awaken hearing her mom talking in the dark bathroom out the window to me got her curious. She saw it also. I then walked back out toward the flash and it looked like it was now right next to the ground as I could see the outline of the weeds in the light. It flashed twice right next to the ground. Then a few minutes passed and I saw it flash but this time it was like a beam that pointed up in the sky away from us. Then it flashed again but very dull. Well, I had had enough of guessing what it was and decided to get in the car and drive around the block to the back of our! property and shine the car lights out there. My daughter went! with me and she stayed in the car and I got out with my flashlight. I walked all over the area where we saw it. Nothing. I drove back to the house and it had stopped flashing. My wife and daughter went to bed. I continued to watch out the bathroom window and for about 45 minutes nothing happened. I had given up and just as I stepped out of the bathroom into the hall it flashed two more times. And then two more times after that. That is when I came to the computer and wrote this out. I saw it flash 11 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was not raining and the temperature was about 20 degrees Celsius.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was walking to the parking garage, I look up and noticed a black cylinder shaped object that was crossing the sky in front of me (between a 45 and 50 degree angle upwards in the sky, traveling in a left to right (west to east) direction.  I wouldn’t dare guess at its length but with my arm extended it would be about the width of my thumb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching it sunlight momentarily reflected off of it’s surface for about 3 or 4 seconds then stopped, at which point I noticed it was rotating in a counter clockwise manner.  It resembled a cylinder in shape that appeared to have flat surfaces down the length of it (like a stop sign).  There were no wings, no propellers, no contrails, no markings or lights, and most importantly no sound of any kind!  At this point I thought it was maybe a satellite but determined that it couldn’t be due to its low altitude.  Its trajectory was smooth (like a satellite in space) with a hint of intermittent acceleration within its forward motion; it definitely appeared to have no problem maintaining its altitude and velocity (which tells me it was not a falling satellite).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sunlight reflected off it again for a moment due to its counter clockwise rotation and by this time it is now to my right at about the two o’clock position.  The reflection then stopped because this object was traveling underneath the cloud ceiling.  A few moments later it ultimately disappeared into the clouds themselves.<n>

It had many white and red lights and was very quiet and to low to be an airplane.I stood there watching and in my head trying to reason &#34;this can&#39;t be.

We had been moving into our new house all day and after being completely exhausted, we decided to just go to bed and hang up the curtains the next morning.  We have a large, beautiful window in our bedroom which looks out to the mountains.  On this night we were lying in the dark on the bed on our stomachs enjoying the night sky and talking.  I would say it was almost one a.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were looking towards the mountains we saw three lights in a horizontal row in the sky. White in color, fairly large and round.   Could tell that the lights were attached to some sort of a triangular craft.  The lights didn’t blink or change color.  The placement of the lights did move on the structure.  Three lights on the bottom, the middle light went out and re-appeared on the top so that the three lights formed a triangle.  Then the top light went out, moved back to the bottom and two additional white lights appeared on the bottom for a total of five. It was big but not very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were shocked and speechless.  We jumped out of bed  and ran outside to see if we could get a better look.  The craft wasn’t moving, it was at a standstill in the night sky and it was eerily quiet outside.  There were no blinking lights, no red lights or blue.  It wasn’t an airplane because it wasn’t moving.  It just hovered with us staring at it for about ten minutes and then it started floating away slowly and then before we knew it, it zoomed out into the night sky.  It was shocking and unbelievable.  We had heard of the Phoenix lights before but we were always skeptical.  We have since talked to several people who have said they have experienced strange sightings while camping in the mountains and out where we have lived.  I don’t know what it was in the sky that night, all I can say is that it was strange, foreign and bone-chilling.<n>

It had just gotten dark with a barley noticeable hint of light off in the sunset horizon. The parking lot was slightly lit with a few street lights but still dark. From one split second to the next, a very bright glowing object caught my eye from behind one of the tree tops, slightly to my right. I immediately grabbed my girlfriend and pointed it out to her. It seemed to take a quick second before it registered to her, then as I remember her words, &#34;Oh, my gosh.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this moment I thought I was seeing a flaming meteorite coming toward the mill creek area from the North West sky. I thought it was going to impact upon Mill Creek (a small suburban area adjacent to the South end of Everett). It was heading south east toward the ground. A second object followed directly behind the first in the exact same path. The airborne objects proximity seemed to be approximately 1-2 miles away, seemly closer to a mile. Their estimated size was impressive appearing the equivalency of a small to medium size two story house. If I were to extend my arm and hold my thumb in the sky to its location it would have easily doubled the size of my thumbnail, if not larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 8-12 seconds of first sighting, it became vividly apparent that this was defiantly not a meteorite. There was a brief moment where I wondered if this object was an aflame, out of control aircraft. After 15-20 seconds of continued observation, I identified the object as a controlled, somewhat slow moving object that was not a part of the natural occurring environment. Shortly after continued observation the object did appear to have flames coming from it, however they were not out of control. It appeared to have a spherical globe around it containing and controlling the flames. It’s steady, even and concise movements quickly made it apparent that it was not aflame. Moreover, the spherical globe around it became more visible. These observations were taking place as the object stopped its downward movement toward Mill Creek and began an upward climb out of the city. Its movement was so clean, even and precise that its rapid accent was one of the most intriguing points abo! ut the entire sighting. It disappeared without seeming like it was moving fast. In an instant it was gone as it appeared to move directly out of our atmosphere. The second object followed suit exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> TO BE 100% CLEAR AND UNSWERVINGLY CLEAR ABOUT THREE THINGS: 1.	This was not an aircraft even remotely resembling any aircraft within the worldwide public aeronautics industry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.	This sensory experience defies many laws of physics and rational thought. I am a scientific mind and have always required tested proof to accept something as fact. These beliefs have all been challenged with this experience. I am forever affected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.	I now know for a fact that there are things in our reality that we don’t have a clue about, that we cannot comprehend. Even if the airborne object I saw was government owned, it was far beyond explanation. I am finally at peace.<n>

We started to see a couple of orange lights flash on in a row and then turn off one by one.  We thought they were flares at first, but we didn&#39;t see any smoke coming from the lights.  We were getting a little sad that we didn&#39;t have enough time to grab the camera and catch it, when all the sudden more lights turned on.  Excited and a little scared, I grabbed my camera and started recording.  These lines of lights showed up a few times but I always managed to miss it all due to the fact that when they appeared it was only for a couple seconds.  This is the best video that captured exactly what we saw.  There was no noise at all, no sounds of planes, and no smoke coming from the lights.

When we got out of the water, we were drying off on the dock. My BF said, &#34;What the h__is that?&#34; About 30 degrees above the horizon, there was a large,intensely bright cirlce of light. It was still daylight. The light was so bright it reflected in the water, casting a reflection like a full moon-- but much brighter. Out camp is in a remote area. There are no close neighbors. It was absolutely silent. The water was flat calm. We watched this for 1 to 2 minutes. Then it disappeared. It disappeareed as old TV sets used to turn off. Quickly going from a full bright circle down to a pinpoint of light, then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither my Bf or I had ever seen anything that could have been a UFO before. We have always been skeptical of sightings. I am 57, my bf is 66. He is an optometrist. We both have 20/20 eyesight. My bf has had a private pilot&#39;s license for 35 years. There is no explanation taht we could think of for this object.<n>

The aircraft did not posess normal characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never experienced an incident in which the sight of something unfamiliar in the sky has compelled me to believe it to be foreign to Earth. However, I do seriously entertain the idea that there is intelligent life elsewhere in the vast depths of space, albeit with a small dose of skepticism. I do not want to jump to the conclusion that what I just encountered was truly an alien aircraft, but it&#39;s behavior puzzled me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 18:40 PM on Tuesday, August 18th of 2009, I was at work and decided to take a break for a cigarette. I was seated on the loading dock, facing south, when something in the sky caught my eye. The sky was very clear, almost cloudless, and I distinctly saw a white shape, which I first believed to be a normal commercial airplane, traveling west. After further inspection I realized that the object did not resemble any airplane I had seen before, as it had no markings on it. It also didn&#39;t have any distinct shading, by that I mean to say that I could not concretely identify any appendages that would normally be visible, such as the wings. It was also traveling at a higher speed than a plane like that normally seems to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was quite far away, and I do not have the best eyesight. I could not hear the roar of any engine, but that is most likely due to the distance. Also, there was no cloudy trail left behind in the craft&#39;s wake. While I was still inspecting the object, keeping it in my line of sight, it vanished. I got off the loading dock so I could have a better view of sky above me and searched for the object, but I could not find it.<n>

I assumed it was a “advertising “ balloon, then it hovered and I noticed it going horizontal,  I drove about a mile and the ufo was hovering above another subdivision.  I figured it was a &#34;remote control&#34; ship of some sort, but it was clearly larger than that. I watched as it moved effortlessly against a darkened sky (it had been a rainy afternoon).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept driving and when I got to my daughter’s school to pick her up I noticed it behind some woods near there.  I wanted to take a picture/check it out with my binoculars, but it went behind the woods and that was the last I saw of it.<n>

Then I made this video of the images. I took one hundred and twenty three images, this object was in only two.

I heard two jets so I looked up and saw that they were really close, and then I looked back up and saw that they were following something. The UFO was a white dot it kind of looked like the international space station does when it goes over. It had no blinking lights like the jets. It looked peaceful, moved slowly it looked to me as if the jets were escorting it somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live close to the airport and it has an air defense base, I heard jets take off about ten minutes before, they were heading north then turned east, when I saw the two jets following this craft side by side they were head south west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember the time being 9:03am because that is when I twittered about it.<n>

Englewood Colorado<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing my on my front porch which faces north. I had gone out to have a cigarette and was looking at the sky listening to crickets. I saw an object in the sky approximately 80 degree angle from looking horizontally. I was almost staring straight up when I saw what at first what I thought it was an aircraft of some sort, but it was moving too fast to be an aircraft. Next I thought it was a meteorite slowly coming into and atmosphere moving west to east but as it cleared my position it made a hard angle like turn to the northward direction and disappeared behind the tree my neighbor has. There were no flashing lights on the object like aircraft would have. There was no sound emitted from the craft and I knew meteorites do not usually make hard left hand turns like this had done. This left me with a feeling like I had seen something quite unique and not of this world. I knew I should write this out so that I may save the utmost detail of the event. I also wanted to ha! ve it on record should someone else report something strange in the skies about Denver on this morning. I am available to contact should you have further questions about this event. Current time of this writing is 04:17 on the same day.<n>

I had gotten my dad earlier because i thought i saw something moving, but this time i got his camera from him to see if anything showed up. thats when i got a big suprise ! there was something in the sky. in fact right over the other side of the lake ! there was 2 to the left one in the middle, and 4 to the right all hovering way above the other side of the lake, and they were different shapes, one was cigar shaped, one was a triangle, one was just a ball, and the other was a sphere. I started to film then moving about the sky, and a bit later every one from my family came to see, my brother, dad, and mom. i continuted filming and got a couple good pictures, plus 20 + of film, by then it was just me and my mom, and thats when we heard a loud sound, it sounded like air being moved or a loud jet, and we looked up, there was a triangler shaped ufo with 3 lights going right over are cottage about 50 feet up, it was pretty crazy ! after that i got my d40 out, and got 2 really good pictures one were you can see 2 weird lights, and one were you can see 3 lights and make out the shape. that was all for that night. 2 days later though i was by myself and i heard the same loud jet sound and a red flashing light came down to tree level and started skimming the edge of the lake as if it was looking for something, this time i was freaked out and booked it back inside the cottage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

8/17/09 23:00|Marysville|OH|Triangle|1 minute|Triangular craft, 5-6 red lights on edge|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71740.html|234|ndxe200908| Triangular craft, 5-6 red lights on edge<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out the back door and looked to the left (westerly) and noticed 5 or six bright red lights (in a row) just hanging in the air above an antennae with a  white strobe light (strobe light on the antennae).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to my wife and she did the same thing I did. She first said it was an airplane, then when I mentioned it wasn&#39;t moving, she said it was a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was thinking about getting my camera the object began to move. It came toward us, then turned to our right. It made a sweeping turn then began to decend. It did this without banking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red lights were not fuzzy on the edges, they were well defined, and they all moved as one solid object. As the object began to move I noticed partial green lights above the left 2 or 3 red lights. Also as the object turned to the right, and later to the left, it didn&#39;t bank as a normal aircraft would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights seemed to have a perpindicular dark color in the center, and faded to a lighter color on the edge, but the edge was still a cherry red color, the green appeared to be the same type of lights...(my wife said she did not notice the green lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reporting this strange observation, I must also include the following information: 1. The Union County Airport is in the same direction as the object appeared to go, and I haven&#39;t had the chance to follow this possibility up. (I will do so in the morning...08-19-09).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. I have not taken photographs of the area where the sighting took place..(Again, I will take daytime and nighttime photos).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. Each light on the object appeared to be approximately 1/8 inch in diameter, for a total of 1+1/4&#34; in width.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. The only reason I am reporting this without having the opportunity to &#34;investigate&#34; the possibilities is that when I asked my wife what she saw, she said, &#34;It was triangular...&#34; and then she talked about the red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was not wearing my watch, so the time of 11:00PM is only a guess, but I judge to have been in bed about an hour, having retired about 10:00PM. We were on the fifth (5th) floor of the hotel; our room faced west, facing the ocean, and the drapes were partially open to allow a cool breeze to enter the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear, as it had been most of the day, because I could faintly see stars. I was lying in bed and looking out the door to the balcony. I had a clear view of the sky, though somewhat narrow because of the doorframe on one side and the edge of the sliding glass door on the other side, perhaps 4 feet in width. The room was dark. There suddenly appeared a long, bright light that appeared to be on a parallel course with the coastline and heading north, then suddenly made a sharp, 900 right-hand turn without slowing down and headed inland. I am not a good judge of altitude, but this thing was either flying low or it was very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am red-green color blind, but the object appeared to be a bright green in color. There was absolutely no sound whatsoever, only the faint sound of the ocean, but the object remained very bright for the short amount of time I was able to observe it. The bright color trailed behind the object, much like a long tail on a kite. I couldn’t see any more than that because my field of vision was obstructed by the doorframe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared cylindrical but with no clearly marked back end to it. I observed this object for about 3 seconds before it disappeared to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am retired from the security industry as a Field Supervisor, and during my twenty years I learned to be very observant of my surroundings, and to look for details. Prior to that I was in the U.S. Navy stationed aboard an aircraft carrier. During my years of watching jet aircraft of all types, I do not remember seeing any jet make the kind of maneuver that resembled the one I saw this object make. Nor do I recall seeing any jet aircraft of any kind travel at such an extremely high rate speed.<n>

Lights were way to large to be associated with man made craft and too stable to be a shooting star, etc.  Estimated distance from shore was about 12-15 miles.  Distance between the lights was at least 1/2 mile. Lights were not flares.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following morning there was a great deal of light flashes in the clouds where the first set of lights first appeared.

Within another 20 seconds, it again became bright, then suddenly disappeared altogether.  Obviously, I have no clue if it what it was, possibly a weather balloon for all I know, but it was interesting, and most unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object seemed to leave the earth and proceed straight up at a rate that far,far exceeded the rate of the hundreds of various launches I have witnessed growing up a few miles from kennedy space center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear and we watched this object through binoculars for at least 6 to 8 min and could see it in relation to steady stars behind it in the night sky. I was left with the impression that it absolutely left our atmosphere and went into space. Again having witnessed many launches, there is a point when the manmade crafts begin to go down range, as to say you eventually see them moving with the curvature of the earth  I am convinced this object far exceeded the capabilities of any man made craft known to me. It didnt seem to produce any flames or smoke usually associated with liquid or solid rocket fuel used in NASA launches.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I followed it to the north and it stopped, changed to pink and moved in the opposite direction.  Then I saw another flashing red, white and blue light .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lay down on my chaise lounge and looked up with my binoculars and saw what appeared to be a fuzzy white type of sphere much larger than the lights or stars move from east to west and then it suddenly started flashing the red , blue and white lights right in front of my eyes.  I called out my fiancee’ who also watched these lights move from one area of the sky to another, mostly in the south now.  My son came home and watched with us and we all saw two of the strange lights follow an airplane heading southwest—same direction.  At first I thought maybe it was President Obama’s plane with escorts or something, but he spent the night here, so it wasn’t that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights moved erratically faster, slower, up or down not in a straight line like an airplane.  I saw many airplanes and could distinguish the difference.  When the flashing occurred you could not see a shape, like I did when it was not flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were many of these throughout the hour in different locations, and they just disappeared after 10 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son saw groups of these lights in the early morning hours of August 16 around 2 am.<n>

We live in the Sierra Mountains about 4,200&#39; elevation.  Sitting at the table and looking due south thru a huge window, we saw a long silver triangle (jet or plane [?]) close at a low elevation.  What is unusual is we live under a flight plan for Fresno - Las Vegas &amp; back.  These go north of our home.  This craft appeared to be 1 mile or closer and low, almost equal with our elevation.  At most I estimate it might have been 5,000&#39;. It was headed west and when it tilted it was totally sleek from pointed nose to the tail which was completely straight across.  No wings, just a very long thin triange shape.  We ran to the west deck &amp; couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  Did our eyes deceive us? No noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possible fighter jet, w/no markings, but no noise.<n>

We decided to take a canoe to see if we could get a better look from the pond. When we got to the other side of the pond we noticed another light in the exact opposite side of the sky. Once both objects were in view they appeared to be the exact same type of thing. The objects were so bright we could see them until the sun came into view.

Britt Minnesota.  August 15-16<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were traveling north approximately 10 miles north of Virginia MN when we came into a clearing on the west side of the highway. Just beyond the clearing there was an intense Blue/White light that was pulsing.  At first I was thinking it might have been an airport light off track. But the closest airport was 20 miles away to the north.  I noticed it was keeping pace with us at 45 mph.  The light was so intense you could not look directly into it. The light tracked with us for 12 miles up highway 53 north and it took a due west heading out of sight.  I proceeded to drive highway 53 another mile and right before my turn. I spotted the second light floating right above some ones house on the west side of the rode.  I was able to see the light pulse from the first sighting off in the distance so this was a new light I drove to my turn onto Biss road. I pulled over to get a better look to my south approximately 25 yards away from us this light was above a home. I shut the truck ! off and rolled down the windows. There was no sound at all the light burned your eyes to view.  We sat there maybe 15 minutes and decided to go on our way. I drove 5 miles up the rode and decided I had to get another look we drove back and watched the light for another 10 minutes.  It appeared to me to be maybe 5 feet around. The light was so bright that it was impossible to see what was above it. The persons yard was like daylight. I continued to my cabin 15 miles north west of Britt and was still able to see the pulsing in the night sky to the southwest. I will have my son and his friend write their accounts as soon as possible. Also my car radio would not work while we were watching the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be exceptionally serious about his sighting, and sober-minded, by nature.

It looked circular in shape but it also had a star-burst/multi-star spike shape on the front of the object.  The distance from the ground to the object seemed fairly low (approx 1 mile up)  I have never seen anything like this before, it looked odd.  One of the other observers mentioned that it could have been some sort of satellite coasting the sky, but I have never seen one, so I cannot comment one way or another.  By the time I went to get my camera, the object had passed on and could not be seen.<n>

The object then slowed and appeared to descend to about 1500 ft.  The was no noise.

Suddenly, a bright yellow light &#34;came on&#34;.  It was as if someone had turned a huge light bulb on in the sky.  It took a second to achieve full brightness and then it was gone but it stayed light long enough to tell it was also moving east to west.  At its brightest, it was about the size of Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 5 seconds later, it did the same thing only a little further to the left, or west of where it appeared the first time.  Same thing...came to full brightness and then vanished. Was a yellowish-white light but definitely had yellow in it.

8/15/09 23:00|Campground Kendallville|IN|Unknown|3 hours|Two objects were observed in the Eastern sky as well as the Southern skies.|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71684.html|262|ndxe200908| Two objects were observed in the Eastern sky as well as the Southern skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August 13, 14 and 16th, my girlfriend, I and her three children observed two objects in the sky adjacent to the campground we use during the Summer months. The first was massive and closer to us than the second. It was extremely bright in the sky and moved forward and back, slowly. On the 13th, it was very close to us but not close enough to view a shape with the naked eye. It did not display colors with the exception of a bright white light. It was viewed in the Eastern sky. The first night, it was very close but the remaining nights, it was much further away. The second was in the Southern skies and displayed flashing red lights.  It moved in a strange pattern, forward and back and then up and down. When it was moving forward and back, it was moving in a clear elliptical pattern.  Mindful that most UFO sightings are generally planets and stars, we used two stars as points of reference. At times, it would be above the plain between the two stars and within ten minutes or so, would transverse to the left, nearly covering the star on the left.  Then it would travel to the right, obstructing our view of the star on the right. Within thirty minutes or so it would drop below the plain between the two stars we were using as a point of reference. It followed this pattern repeatedly over the next hour. We watched this event on three separate nights for a minimum of one hour each.  On the 15th, the object was not visible.  Radar indicated that there was no cloud cover and all stars were visible.  It was a very clear night.  I spoke to a family friend who works for an Aeronautical company and he confirmed the information that I gained from my Father.  Satellites do not move in a pattern like what we observed. It is physically impossible for a star or planet to display the movements we witnessed. No alcohol or intoxicants were involved during the events and cloud cover was nonexistent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I intend on taking a telescope to the campground before the end of the month to see if I can view the objects again. I will file a second report with the new information, along with pictures (it’s a sweet telescope).<n>

Now we were not drinking or on anything at the time and we are not even old enough to do those things.  But as we were walking we heard what sounded like a jet flying by. We looked up and didn&#39;t see anything and just kept walking.  But then it happened again and as we looked up this time we saw three jets flying in a diagonal pattern. We thought it was pretty cool but were shocked when we saw what they were going towards.  At first it just looked like a bright reddish orange star moving slowly..  But as we watched it disappeared.  We looked back to the jets and they were about to pass where we last saw the light and as they did the light reappeared but was heading the other way. It did that for awhile and then was gone again. By this time me and my friend didn&#39;t know what to do.. We were at a lost of words and I almost fell over bec! ause of how crazy this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then showed up again after the jets were out of sight and thats when it started doing thing we knew no jet or anything man-made could do. It would fly from one spot to another so fast it was hard to even see, then it would change direction with no problem at all. Then it would shoot down to a lower level and just sit there looking like any other star in the sky. By this time our other friend showed up and was asking why we were standing in the middle of the parking lot staring at the sky. When we told him to look up and stare at the light he just said it was a star but then he watched with us as it seem to get smaller and at one point looked like it was moving out of the atmosphere and had a tail like tight coming from below it... To this day we talk about this and have not seen anything even close to what happen that day. Its almost scary knowing that the government is lying to us about these things..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were hosting my son&#39;s birthday party and were in the backyard enjoying festivities.  There were about 40 people in attendance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing by the pool when someone called my attention to an odd orange light in the sky that was varying in intensity like a fire.  It was moving towards us at the right speed and altitude to be a small plane and was heading from south to north.  I then noticed my son standing next to me looking at it as well. I thought at first it was a plane on fire.  As I watched I noticed that there were no other lights on this object like an aircraft should have, just a chaotic dimming and brightening orange light.  We did not hear any sound from the object but we did have music playing outside that could have masked any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object travel across the sky, behind a large pine tree, and back into view.  A few moments later it started dimming and then went out entirely and we could see only dark sky.  The whole event seemed to last about a minute but my better judgment says about 30 to 40 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds in the sky, no unusual weather conditions, just a calm cool summer night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the news on both the internet and local paper today (the morning after) but have found no reports of anything that would explain what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A horizontal moving flare?  Ball lightning?  A troubled aircraft?  Others must have seen this which is why I&#39;m reporting it, so that perhaps it can be resolved as to what this was.<n>

It was a full moon and a crystal clear evening.  I had taken my dogs out and put them to bed and went outside onto my porch which faces to the west. I went out to have my last cigarette for the evening like i had for the last several years.  I looked out to the southwest to enjoy the clear evening sky and take in all stars and the evening air.  I thought i saw just another jet flying one of the usual flight patterns that fly over my house, but upon closer observation i realized this object was far to low to be a commercial airliner or private jet.  As it got closer I saw that it was&#39;nt any higher in the air than 1500 to 2000 feet.  When the vehicle got to within a quarter of a mile from where i was it slowed down to maybe 100mph and banked to the right 30 degrees, when it did this the moon lit it up and i saw for the first time the size of this vehicle.  At the same I also noticed no sound no jet engines no propeller no helicopter blades just silence, you could hear the crickets it was that quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it slowly passed overhead i did notice a f16 chase plane in full afterburner trying to catch this thing, when the F16 got to the vehicle it banked left and started a shallow left turn circular flyby pattern, after seeing this I ran into my house and yelled at my wife and mother in law to go to the front porch of the house and help me find the camera!!  They asked me why and I said &#34; there is a huge UFO fying over the house and I need to get photos&#34;.  They ran onto the front porch and both screamed Oh my god!!  I could&#39;nt locate the camera so i made it to the front porch and got as many visual refrences as I possibly could.  My wife and my mother in law saw the vehicle pass over the house and it also exited the area at a very high rate of speed and no sonic boom.  When the vehicle made its right turn to exit the area the F16 came around on another pass coming in behind the vehicle, it left and the F16 tried to pursue! but gave up quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Estimate within 100 feet of ground, we were in top floor of house approx 40 feet above ground. Took one picture on mobile which does not appear to show the lights, swtiched mobile to video funtion but did not record (think I did not press correct Button).<n>
8/15/09 22:06|East Grand Rapids|MI|Light|00:00:95|Bright orange light in Eastern Sky 90+ second event|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71672.html|269|ndxe200908| Bright orange light in Eastern Sky 90+ second event<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:06 PM at 42.949780,-85.603561  we witnessed an object in the Eastern sky moving from approximately SSE (150 degrees azimuth) to N (010 degrees azimuth) at an elevation of 30 to 35 degrees.  Our iPhones did not have the ability to resolve the image.  The object passed below a bright object (assumed Jupiter) and was two to three times its brightness and its observable arc width.  It was significantly brighter than any other object in the sky.  We were in a boat at the time, and the reflection of the object in the water was distinctly apparent.  The object displayed variable random intensity as if a glowing fiery ember, consistently appearing orange to amber in color, and slowly inconsistently dissolved at the end of its track.  The entire event lasted approximately 95-110 seconds. It is also notable that the object seemed to alter course by 5-10 degrees east of track at approximately 65-70 seconds (030-035 azimuth) into the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We contacted http://www.nuforc.org/ and were subsequently advised that this object was seen in the same time frame from Massachusetts to Chicago, possibly fractured into multiple objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were advised that this is too slow for a fast moving meteor atmospheric impact or grazing event.  We saw several of these (meteors) which are very white and short lasting within the preceding sixty minutes.  This was not an aircraft, displaying normal anti-collision strobe lights and red, green, and white navigation lights.  This was not a satellite in low-earth-orbit transitioning from day to night.  We saw several of these pass into the eclipse of the Earth’s shadow prior to this event and the object did not behave as if reflecting solar light.  Also, it would be abnormal for a satellite to orbit in this Southeast to North Northwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are four people that witnessed the event on this boat.  I am an experienced Airline Transport Pilot with 6000+ hours flying and have not witnessed anything similar prior to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be unusually sober-minded, and he seemed to be an excellent witness.

The altitude and the speed were too consistent to be either.  It should have gone over our heads in the direction it appeared to be heading, but then it turned and went around us.  It was a bright fiery orange light that gave off a very soft humming noise.  It was visible for what felt like two minutes before it faded away and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the light in the sky vanished, I saw what looked like lightning in the distance around all of the trees on the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were coming in to dock the boat, I looked around the lake one last time and saw some flashing lights on the ground and they were orange also.  It was like fire that flashed 5 times, and then disappeared and moved to another spot then flashed again and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was amazingly terrifying!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from Grand Rapids, MI, for the same time and date.

Some of them appear like an orb but they all seem to have a black hole in them. Some then are single, some grouped in 2 or more.  On some of the objects you can see a precise ring of lights.  There is no question looking at my pictures what I am getting in the sky every night.  Last night I started seeing them as the flash went off.  They were in my face and all around me.

I had not been drinking and nobody that saw it was drunk.  leaned back in my seat and saw three large green lights in a triangular format. it was slowly moving across the sky from east to west with a slow rotation. unable to distinguish its altitude I can say how big it was. I said holy shit look at that then everybody looked up and watched it as it moved. my sister-in-law tried to take a picture and it showed up on her camera&#39;s digitle display but after taking the picture it didi not appear in the picture. any way after moving to the left it stopped then proceeded to rapidily rise then move to the right and then off out of view because of the trees. I put on my sneakers to run down the road to see if I could continue to see it and in the distance it was hovering counter clockwise circle. Two airliners were approaching from two different directions but bot! h traveling west to east where at that time it disappeared during the time I looked at the two airliners,<n>

It probably lasted nearly a minute for the whole sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We’ve had rain tonight and I checked the weather and the clouds are at 3,700 feet so it was somewhere below that level but at least 2,000 feet I would guess.  There was no sound whatsoever so I know it wasn’t a plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called local police to see if they had any reports, he mentioned meteor showers tonight but there was no way that was a meteor, moved way to steady in flight in straight line and height and too slow across sky and below the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First time I’ve ever seen something like this and it was most incredible!  I am the editor of a local newspaper so i&#39;ll most definately be sharing this experience with my readers.<n>

It came from the west between our house and the house next door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lay there terrified by the fact of the volume of the noise, but also the fact the noise was moving towards us.  I lay afraid to look out and afraid for my grandchildren.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I was very alert and focused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The noise continued and I realized we were all awake- listening and terrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The noise lasted for several seconds, and then moved towards the alley, then quickly down the alley until it was gone.  It was obvious the sound came from an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved to the house and began calling in the sound to the police and talking about it with the 2 adults who were now also awake.  We had the same description- exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not go back to sleep, and spent the next day talking to neighbors to find out no one else heard it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is over one year later and I know what I heard was not from this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot sleep on the deck anymore, and I am not normally a frightened person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time above are approximate.

The lights appeared to weave from one side of the estuary to the other in a matter of seconds which leads me to believe that what we saw was no aircraft, but is more likely to be an aerial phenomenon or UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both watched the lights for nearly three minutes.  After this one of the lights appeared to zip off north-east over the horizon.

We watched  and wondered what it could have been......? I&#39;m an airplane and space enthusiast and I can say with certainty what it was not !! It was not an airplane, it was not a satellite, it was not a commit, or not any kind of falling space junk. This is the first time in my life I can say with absolute certainty that I could not identify a flying object.......I would hate to say it was an alien craft because I don&#39;t believe in Intelligent extra terrestrial visits at all ! I was flying at a high altitude I would say as high as a! commercial airplane perhaps 30-40 thousand feet.silent completely for the duration we witnessed it. We were amazed of the speed and the strange shape....I would guesstimate the speed maybe twice or three times the speed of a satellite . So this is my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He said,ya that&#39;s weird. I saw greenish lights and what seemed to be fog around it. i looked at it for about 5 seconds then it just took off at a rate of speed that made me realize that there was no way this could be a helicopter.

It was about 4:45 p.m. on a Friday late afternoon.  The sky was overcast with low dark clouds with a hole in the clouds on the right side.  The sun was showing through the clouds and there was light illuminating a large rectangular shape that was below the low clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun light  showing through the  opening of the clouds was at about 2:30 in the sky. The object was to the left and center of this below the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rectangle shape was huge.  It was at an angle with the top part somewhat back and the lower area forward to me.  The outer quarters of the rectangle were brighter but no distint light showing. The edges were distint with the corners showing a definate angle not at all curved or fuzzy.   After observing it for about a minute and a half the center area of the rectangle became less light like a dark strip formed from top to bottom.  This area faded slowly.   At this point it looked like two separate long rectangles.  I was able to observe this for for about another minute and a half  before I drove into the town of Coleman and the trees and city house began blocking  my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before Coleman city area I drove up over a bridge over highway M-10.  It was at this time the light in the center began to slowly fade.  The rest of the rectangle remained the same.  There was no noise and no movement of this object while I was observing it.  The only things on the ground under this were trees and  homes.  No large parking lots or fields that had flood lights reflecting upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 10 year old grandaughter was in the back seat.  I asked her to look up and tell me what she saw.  She told me the very same thing that I observed but I had not said anything to her about what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later I asked her to draw me a picture of what she saw and tell me again.  I did not tell her what I observed and again she told me exactly what she saw at the time of the incident. Her picture was exactly the same as what I had seen.<n>

IL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a passenger in a SUV on a country road between Rock Falls, IL and Prophetstown, IL. I think the date was August 15th, 2009-give or take a couple days. It was very cloudy for several days in a row. That particular day there were large fluffy couds -some dark rain clouds, others white- some sat low, while others were very high in the sky....I think there was a cold front. In between some clouds I could see slices of blue sky in a few areas. When I looked up at one slice of blue, a very shingy round/oval/disk object darted accross the sky on a sort of hair-brained odd path that was wavy (almost the way one hops accross stones on a creek). It would be straight one minute, then changing direction like it was changing its mind. It was extremely high in the sky and would be hidded for a moment here or there as it flew above the clouds. It did not look or act like any plane or man-made vehicle I had seen, but it was flying at a high rate of speed it seemed and! , as I mentioned, almost irradically or at least, in an irregular fashion from the way planes fly, particularly considering its high altitude. I eventually lost track of it when cloud cover blocked my view. I will never forget seeing it that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Towards the north I spotted at first what I described to my sister as a plane on fire but one I exited house an viewed it from yard it looked more like a cone/triangle shaped object that shifted forms somewhat as I viewed it. It was sometimes more triangle shaped than cone but the light on bottom remained what looked like a sphere of fire. After about 30 seconds I got off phone and told my sister to call my mom and tell her to look outside. I then called up my neighbor and talked to him for the duration of event. Unfortunatly he was not home at the time but wanted to listen to my descriptions. I was honestly so amazed and scarred at what I was seeing I was glad to have his presense over the phone. I watched the 1st object for 2-3mins move slowly eastwards and hover before it slowly moved upwards and northeast gradually going over horizon. I rememeber telling my neighbor it was ! gone but I couldn&#39;t stop watching sky. My skygazing was rewarded about 30-45 seconds later when another similiar object appeared. This one hovered in sky near the location where 1st one did for about 1 minute before moving north and upwards thru the clouds. My feelings during this event were that I was seeing something I wasn&#39;t supposed to be seeing. A ufo here? How come theres not hundreds of other people able to see this. I left event deluding myself into writing it off as a flare and maybe it was. I&#39;m no expert in non commercial aircraft. Lately I&#39;m feeling that I was lucky to see it. Glad to share.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They appeared to resemble stars at first but ultimately shifted in color and position unlike normal celestial bodies.  They seem to be constantly in their relative positions but &#34;bounce&#34; in the sky when zoomed in upon.  In addition, while observing these lights in the sky strange points and flashes of light were noticed above the trees and closer to our group, some as &#34;shooting stars&#34; with curved tails.  Two members of this sighting team are members of independent paranormal research collaborations.<n>
8/15/09 01:15|Golden Valley|MN|Teardrop|30 seconds|A teardrop shaped UFO rose from a small pond, hovered for a moment at the treeline, charged up, and accelerated into the SE sky.|9/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113304.html|293|ndxe200908| A teardrop shaped UFO rose from a small pond, hovered for a moment at the treeline, charged up, and accelerated into the SE sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a somewhat boring evening with 3 friends and I, we decided to go climb speak the word baptist church in a somewhat secluded area in Golden Valley. We picked this location because it was between a pair of ponds and there were limited residential homes so we could be loud and attend our activity freely. We parked about 2 blocks from the church (on kentucky ave s) in order to avoid getting the attention of any passing police vehicles that commonly passed the church parking lot. As we headed southbound on kentucky ave s, I noticed that through the thin tree line, there was wider than tall tear drop shaped object rising out of the water at a rate of about two feet per second. The object had three lights in a triangular arrangement on the bottom; facing about 30 degrees from a vertical plane equally away from each other. The lights were bright enough to see the beams clearly, and we were about 200 feet away at this point, as we were walking toward the object! which was directly through the thin tree line at the end of the block. My friends were distracted by conversation, but as I walked about 20 feet behind them I began to call out &#34;hey! guys look at that!&#34;. At roughly seconds within that moment the object had reached a stand still, hovering barely a foot above the tree line. Just as my friends were attempting to locate the object I so clearly witnessed rise from the water, a charging sound came from the object, similar to &#34;zwooooOOOP!&#34;. Then the sky was illuminated by a flash from the object and the object accelerated away towards the south eastern sky in a 20 degree incline at a horizontal plane at an astonishing rate of what seemed to be just below the speed of sound. The only reason I state this seeming speed is due to the chugging brake like sound that came from the object as it accelerated from hovering above the pond. Any faster rate of acceleration and a sonic boom would have likely made for a rude ! awakening of the residents in the area. We proceeded to discus! s the ev ent and climb the church anyway. I will never forget what I saw that night, especially the minute I witnessed the scientifically unexplained event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was midday, bright (even though the sky was covered uniform grey clouds).  The ufo came out of the sky and followed a valley with a river in it. At first i couldn&#39;t really be sure what it was, but than it came down from the clouds and i could see it better (the trees and ground cover of the other side of the valley gave good contrast, we were about 3/4s of the way up on our side of the valley).  it was oval, white metallic, and at one point i thought it changed shape but couldn&#39;t be sure.  I&#39;d guess it to be about as large in width as 5-6 feet, but couldn&#39;t judge the distance well enough.  after flying through the valley, it flew up into the clouds again and got smaller and vanished. What was weird was that my friend complained that she was feeling weird and threw up a little under a minute before it passed by... does nuclear stuff/magnetic fields do that to people who are sensitiv! e?  We saw 1 other group on that whole hike, it&#39;s a very isolated place.

He came running in the tent and was screaming for us to look at the sky. 5 strange crafts changing shapes and colors every 2-3 seconds that were traveling close together in a triangular shape.  They slowed down and eventually stopped for about 5 minutes, and then stopped changing color and shape.  They were green in the shape of a circle. After, they turned red and triangular a second before  they landed in the woods next to my backyard kilometer away.  We watched as a metal staircase descended from the ship.  We saw 3 little human-like creatures walk out and greet someone who looked like a human male.  He walked onto the ship, and the door closed slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft elevated about 30ft and took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Hoaxed report.  PD))<n>

It was moving much slower than the shooting star that I had seen 10 minutes earlier,  but much faster than the planes I see fly over all the time.  The green fireball had sparkles coming off it, and had a long green trail behind it.  It was a very strange thing to see.  I cannot say for sure how high up it was, but it appeared to me to be fairly low, certainly lower than the shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing lasted maybe 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would really like to know what that was.

The object was nothing but light i could not see any shape or body. Brightess thing in the sky. The object shot up at a rapid speed and started dimming and stopped and hovered for about 30 seconds. Then it dimmed to nothing then suddenly started blinking red and blue, with 4 to 6 orbs on the object. It was smaller then it orginaly look when i first seen it, or it moved very far away to the west, it really hard to tell. The object propelled at an amazing speed across the sky about the height of a jetliner going northwest. The path was very eratic bobbing up and down and blinking red and blue simutaniuosly. It when across the whole horizon from southwest to northwest in maybe 20 seconds. Extremely fast then i just couldnt see it any mo! re.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were no blinking lights on the object.  It was larger and brighter than all other objects in the sky.  The object moved fairly quickly through the sky and there was no trail like a &#34;shooting star&#34; would leave.  There were a few airplanes in the sky (common occurence here) and it was not an airplane.  The object was far enough away that we would have heard no sound even if it was making one.  We did not get any images of the object.  There were trees in the way that shortened the duration of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It stopped 500 ft away hovering just above the corn and changed its lights from many colors to very bright white landing type lights some pointing out and some below this enormous object. We froze, it was all happening so fast I started breaking the car and the road suck down and the corn blocked our view briefly, the next thing we saw a few seconds later was the lights go out and the object disappeared. Our windows were down it wasnt far away and yet we heard no sounds at all. We turned the car around went every direction around that field to find it and it was gone. We are still trying to wrap our minds around what we witnessed and how it appeared and disappeared before our eyes so fast.

I noticed a very bright light in the sky kind of a giant headlight. I noticed it kept getting closer to us as if it was traveling north. Then it began to separate into two lights as we drew closer.  This went on for about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon I could see it was an enormous object in size so I asked my office manager to pull off an available exit. As we watched then it was over a mountain and looked like a tower because it had a red flashing light on top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I asked her to pull back on the highway. We had been in a large dip so when we pulled up it was just arriving. I asked my office manager. So what do you see, is that a UFO? She studied it as it approached us at what seemed like a fairly slow speed, it was like floating for a few seconds, by now it was very close and you could see whatever it was it was enormous. It looked like at that point a giant car floating through the sky with headlights probably 20 or 30 feet around that turned with the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was swooping towards us so I said “pull over” as she whipped out of traffic traveling at 80mph with lots of traffic that had to be witnessing the same thing.  My wife pulled over behind us as she was following us. I was jumping out of the truck as she was slowing,. By now it was beginning to pass us overhead but it slowed to nearly a stop, like floating as I stared straight up at the bottom of it. It nearly blocked out the sky from where I was standing. I quickly measured it with my eye in comparison to the width of the freeway and decided that if it were to land there that it would cover the whole freeway both sides and probably hang over both sides by 2 or 300 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimated it to be about 600 feet or more. I have 30 years in construction so I usually have a pretty good eye. If I were to have held out my arms to the sky I would guess they would be at about a 45 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so wrapped up in getting every detail that I couldn’t take the time to take a photo with my cell phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like two huge pontoons on each side of a disc or saucer shape and all over the bottom I could see like rectangle windows (or what appeared to be). Each window was surrounded with a very soft light that I would say was a glowing greenish light. And the whole perimeter of the bottom seemed to be outlined with this light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was probably 500 to 1000 feet above me as it slowed to almost a stop over my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed I could not hear any sound at all. The pontoons were hard to make out other than I could see the shape how they blocked out the stars and they also had white corner marker lights. In the very bottom of where the saucer came to a point in the bottom there was almost like a slit where it looked like a door would be. Underneath everything seemed to be outlined with that soft greenish light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it flew over it started to gain speed and elevation still heading north only probably about 10 miles from Norad and slightly veering to the east as it disappeared I could see again its enormous size and the white marker lights on all the corners and also one red light in the center of the peak of the saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back in the truck and we pulled out onto the highway and I noticed there was another one that was approaching on the right much smaller in size probably about 1000 feet or so in elevation and about 1500 feet to my right. This one however was completely different; it seemed to be more like a cubic shape by the marker lights that were all white, except a large blue light in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No red light on this one, it stayed on  the west side of I-25 as it headed north, where as the other one crossed over the freeway still flying quite parallel to the highway. I thought this one was skirting Fort Carson for some kind of security for the large ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In comparison to the moon this craft was probably about the same size as the moon at it closest point. It seemed a little larger than a large military helicopter but it seemed more awkward. Although it seemed cubicle it also seemed to have other cubicle dimensions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am doing some drawings of what I saw but I am In the mountains and away from my scanner and will be scanning them in and sending them in the next couple of days.<n>

So it was a particularly dark night, but with the brightest stars that I have seen since I was a kid growing up in Monticello 60 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects in the sky first started appearing about 8:30.  They would first appear just over the horizon in the SW.  They approached at the speed of a high flying plane.  They were always in pairs of two, one following in the path of the other, and each the same size and shape as the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they got to a vertical height of about 60 degrees above the horizon, they would gradually turn black and disappear.  Moments after they would disappear another pair would start appearing over the distant horizon.  There were five sets of two that appeared this way, and then they was a time lapse, and then 3 appeared at once.  Their general appearance to the naked eye was that of a ball of fire. The shape changed when they neared the height of their visible flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to zoom and get six pictures of different sets at various stages.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 5th picture in particular, shows the degree of similiarity in size and shape between the two objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what they were, but I would definitely categorize them as &#34;Unidentified.&#34;<n>

We came over a hill in the Wells area and instantly noticed a bright white light just off to the left of the highway up around an estimated 1000 ft. It was hovering over a mostly rural area and we thought initially it may be a helicopter, but would seem somewhat out of place given the area. As we got closer we could see it had some very erratic, and bright, small square lights flashing in a bizarre linear sequence. It was unlike any aircraft lighting scheme I&#39;ve ever seen. The lights also didn&#39;t seem to illuminate (a very humid evening with much haze) as much as just shine brightly. As we passed it we could see three red lights on each tip of an isosceles triangle and could hear no noise of engine or rotors since we had all the windows down. The driver confirmed the lighting being on three corners and also concluded it wasn&#39;t a plane or helico! pter. Estimated to be the size of three fighter jets nose to nose. It was way to large to be a kite. No visible craft was seen but the lights did look attached and static compared to the rest that were visible. The larger lights did not blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were so many of these trails that it peeked my curiosity and I began watching the aircraft with a pair of 10x binoculars to the point they were very clearly seen as they were flying all over the sky. As I was scanning the sky and watching these &#34;smoke trails&#34; I began to look at a small area of natural clouds, directly overhead but out of the general area of flight of the aircraft, which was one of the very few places left uncovered by the smoke trails and it offered a glimpse of the clear blue sky. That is when I noticed a solid white object hovering in the sky right under the natural cloud cover. It was just stationary in the sky with no movement or sound,Just sitting there as if it was observing all these aircraft which were laying down smoke trails.! It was solid white just the was the same color as the cloud it was near like it was using it as a camouflage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I handed the binoculars to my wife and she was unable to find the object. I grabbed them back from her and I spotted the craft once again. I handed them to her to let her see and she was unable to spot it due to her vision and inability to focus the cheap binoculars. I took them from her again and looked at the craft and it disappeared into nothing. The aircraft made one or two more passes from horizon to horizon and then I didn&#39;t see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe the UFO was there observing the aircraft as they lay down the smoke trails or possibly the aircraft may have been hiding the presence of the UFO from the sight of the public by laying down smoke to obscure the sky..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever the purpose was I know the two were connected to each other..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They were vertically parallel, and the bottom one was slightly bigger (ie. closer). Because I&#39;m deathly curious and and a UFO/alien fanatic, I immediately turned in that direction. Gradually the bottom orb increased in size as I twisted through the neighborhood I&#39;d entered, and before I knew it I was almost directly beneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No longer appearing as an orb, the UFO was extremely close enough to the ground; I&#39;m not great with measuring distances, but to give you an idea, to my vision it was about the size of making circle with your index finger and thumb. It was rather egg-shaped, if the egg were on its side, and it appeared to be black, although it was hard to distinguish color in the dark of night. I remember the arrangement of the ship&#39;s lights looking rather like three, bright bug-eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I raced through the suburban streets to keep pursuit, the UFO slowly flew overhead at a constant pace. Eventually it decided it was done there (or as I like to believe, wanted to lose me) and picked up speed so it was impossible to continue the chase. I watched it fly away from me, and suddenly it was above the hills on the far side of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hopeful to see more, I drove in that direction, and during this drive I saw two more very shiny orbs hovering on either end of town. After waking up another space-loving friend of mine to watch the two, I changed course for a nearby set of hills one of them seemed to be over. When the orb didn&#39;t get any bigger after a short hike, I gave up, but from that hill I had a fantastic view of one of the UFOs directly above the center of the valley. From this view I also noticed a human aircraft flying over the valley but at a lower altitude than the UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 6am, when the sky was finally starting to lighten from daylight, I returned home on the outskirts of town to clearly see another orb over the neighboring city. With such a clear view in the morning sky, I woke up my parents to witness the UFO as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On 8/15/09 at 04:00 hours. There was a bright object with blue, yellow, green and white beams of lights shooting from it and what looked like a halo around it and at times, I could see beams shooting from it. I grabbed my camera and took a  picture but it would not appear in the photo. I then taped a mini movie of the object and what I saw on camera was not what I saw with the naked eye. I witnessed what I feel is that same ufo on 8/16/09 at 04:00 hours, these objects stayed in the same place in the sky for over 2 hours on those two occasions. The next night 8/17/09 at 12:30 myself and a friend witnessed a similar bright multi colored  object in the sky but closer to us than the other 2 nights. This UFO appeared to be hovering over something and slightly swaying back and forth shooting very bright beams from it. At 01:30, we both saw two other objects in the sky that were fu! rther away. While the bright one gradually moved toward the other two they all appeared to be flashing beams of lights at each other simultaneously. This is all happening now while I am reporting this to you. It is now 03:00 hours and these objects are still in the night sky, but it looks like they are descending father away from us but they all are still visible and the multi colored beams of lights are still visible but are not as bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/14/09 01:00|Brinnon|WA|Circle|6 seconds|Fast moving round white light over Hood Canal, stopping and changing direction on a dime|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72094.html|317|ndxe200908| Fast moving round white light over Hood Canal, stopping and changing direction on a dime<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn’t going to report this but felt compelled to since I can’t get it out of my head.  I would like to remain anonymous though - I will be as descriptive as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My two friends and I were camping in Dosewallips State Park in Brinnon, WA where the Dosewallips River meets the Hood Canal.  We were the last ones up at roughly 1am in our area of the campground and we were chatting and star gazing by the camp fire, facing the northern sky.  We had been drinking, but were fairly sober and lucid at this time before we went to bed – only slightly buzzed.  We are in our mid to late 30’s and don’t drink a lot in any given sitting anymore.  My one friend and I were looking at the sky and I was watching a high-flying aircraft (pin point of light but larger than a satellite) moving slowly across the sky from the west to the east.  It was partly cloudy that night so we could only see the brighter stars (no satellites).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly out of the corner of my eye I saw a round white light shoot from the eastern horizon to the center of the sky directly above us and slightly north.  It was many times larger than the aircraft but still as high as the cloud cover.  It seemed like it was lower than the other aircraft, which at this time was still way over in the western section of sky moving slowly toward this fast moving object, but I could not tell how much lower (it was hard to discern).  At first I thought it was a meteor entering the atmosphere – it moved that fast – a second or two to cross half the sky.  But there was no trail of fire and it was not red or orange in color.  It then stopped on a dime, remained hovering for 1 second above us in the center of the sky and then suddenly changed direction 90 degrees and took off toward the northern horizon, making a couple counter-clockwise loops in the sky, slowed at the end of the second loop and then sped up and shot off to the eastern horizon aga! in faster than it had come into view.  I think the entire event lasted no more than 5 or 6 seconds.  We didn’t have a camera anywhere near us and it happened too fast – even my third friend didn’t look up in time to witness once my second friend and I started exclaiming when it changed direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was happening, my mind tried to make sense of it, and once it changed direction I considered the possibility that it was a laser light from someone further away in the camp ground.  But the light appeared to pass over, through and even behind the cloud cover (there was dimension to it in comparison to the clouds) and even passed through the clear night sky.  The light was not &#34;reflected&#34; on the clouds.  I would expect a laser light would not have these characteristics, but could be wrong.  Also, typically the path of a laser light is a bit erratic and the movement of this light was intentional in nature – it was very smooth and almost gave the impression of propulsion.  I do know that there have been instances of people shining laser lights at airplanes near the SEATAC airport and blinding the pilots - they apparently have been trying to catch the culprits.  But we were nowhere near the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend (a psychotherapist) and I were left speechless.  We simply starred at the sky until I finally asked if we had both just seen what I think we did.  She slowly said: yes, I think we have.  Our other friend was not looking up to witness.  We discussed afterwards for a period and later in the light of day, and we still remain confused by what we saw, but certain we saw something quite advanced if it was aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously I am aware that this may have been some sort of military aircraft (we were located on the Hood Canal near many military and airforce bases), and that the military is very possibly capable of designing aircraft that can go that speed.  The strange thing was that the bottom of the aircraft was all light (I could not make out the shape of the aircraft in the night sky – it was merely a light) – it was not headlights directed through the sky – the light faced us on the ground.  Also, the speed at which it changed direction was astounding.  If we do have military aircraft that can accomplish what my friend and I witnessed, our military capabilities are far more advanced than I had ever imagined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure if it is of any consequence, but the next night (8/15 - maybe midnight) we witnessed something else.  Facing the same direction we were looking up at the sky on a very clear night, watching the satellites and stars.  Third friend, a massage therapist, saw a flash of light from a satellite in the western sky (as if it took a flash picture of the earth).  It continued to move across the sky to the eastern horizon, and when it got to almost the same level on the horizon as before, the third friend and I witnessed the flash again (very visible – twice the size of the object itself).  It then disappeared slowly beyond the horizon.  I assumed it was the sun reflecting on the satellite.  No flash from the satellite could be this bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I called my friend who lives probly a mile or so down the road.  He went outside and thought the same thing about the lighting of this craft.  It was Red, Yellow and White I would say but its like you could always see one of the lights flicker (but it wasnt a really quick flicker near the slower end for a flying object) Red then yellow then white then red etc, but this craft was out of sight in no time at all, it went from pretty much not moving to out of sight within about 15-20secs. I came inside thinking it was all over but the friend I called, contacted another friend about the incident he lives about 2miles from us. They went back out approx. 15mins after the initial sighting and they saw two of this same craft with the same lighting scheme in the sky now.

I have always enjoyed looking at the night sky after turning out the lights, before getting in the bed. I noticed an object beyond our tree line in the western sky that was showing different colors. At first I thought it was an airplane, but noticed it was in the same area and not moving across the sky. I was intrigued by the changing color scheme- red,blue,white,green coming from the object. All of a sudden the object zig-zagged downward, then a sharp turn to my left and then back up where it originated. I was amazed and realized this was not a helicopter as I had thought a few seconds before. 	I immediately awakened my husband and excitedly told him to look in the sky and see if he was seeing what I was seeing.  As we stood there watching the object, it would repeat the pattern I had seen previously, and would also move from left to right and then right to left in a! matter of seconds.  He was amazed also and said he could not figure out what it was.  I then said we were looking at a ufo. Since it was hovering in the sky about 5 – 10 miles away, we decided to go about a mile down the road where there is open land and observe the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we sat there watching, we noticed over a period of 30 minutes, 3 other aircraft moving across the sky and I pointed out to my husband the difference between those aircraft and the object we were observing. The object started moving to our right slowly and was descending slightly as it was moving.  We noticed the lights were only white then. From the pattern of the moving lights before when it was somewhat stationary, we concluded the object was circular in shape. Whenever the object stopped and moved in a zig-zag pattern, I noticed what look like exhaust coming from it. It was hard to tell because it was, we concluded around 5-10 miles away from us. Around 12:10 am, we noticed the object was starting to slowly move away from our area and we went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is a self-employed plumber/electrician and I am a pharmacist.

It was the same type of craft as before, in the same location, with a few differences. It was between I-265 and the watterson. I was observing it from LaGrange Road, in front of the Kroger, while stopped at a light.  It was again, an equilateral triangle of white lights, surrounding a red flashing light.  There were no other visible lights. This craft was heading right to left from my perspective. It appeared to be flying higher, or farther away, probably 500-750 feet. It was hard to judge because it was night. But this time, there was another craft following it, by my estimates, way to close to be 2 planes. It was closing the entire time until the disappeared behind some trees. The following craft could easily have been a small terrestrial aircraft. There appeared to be 2 other aircraft in the sky, but at a glace, they appeared terrestrial, and my attention was on the seemingly extra-terrestrial aircraft. I am an ! 18 year old college student, with a lifelong interest in aircraft. In High School I graduated with an over 4.0 weighted GPA. I have always been extremely skeptical of UFOs, and am searching for answers.<n>

I was laying down and noticed an airplane flying across the sky (to the point were the red and blue flashing lights were completely visable from the two side (wing) lights. Around 23:00 3 orbs traveling together like a triangle passed over the sky headed NW. The triangle of orbs passed over an airplane traveling the same speed and keeping the same distance. The orbs (each) were 3 times bigger than a commercial airline (like the wings and the under light mesh togeather) at high to maximum altitude. I rushed downstairs and told my wife and upstairs roomates what I saw. Not more than 5 minutes later we spotted a satilite traveling the same orbit that the 3 lights were headed the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Once in a great while I check this sight because on two occasions in the past I have seen grey, airplane-like objects with no lights or markings or sound, gliding over Chicago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never bothered to submit a sighting until now, noticing that what I saw recently matches the descriptions of other entries with coinciding dates.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving Eastward down Irving Park Road in Chicago and I looked out the window and saw a Triangular shaped object (with rounded corners) with approximately 6 orange lights around the perimeter on the bottom of the object. No other or flashing lights at all. It appeared to be the size of a commercial aircraft but definitely lower than one should be flying. It also appeared to be just hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that area is common for aircraft coming into O’Hare airport from the east at lower altitudes so I took that in consideration. I also took into consideration the speed I was driving. It also occurred to me at that time that the Chicago Air and Water show was in a couple days. I&#39;ve never been to the Air and Water show but I do not believe anything like that is part of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over and watched it just sit there, hovering. I had the window down and could not hear any noise other than the traffic. Then it started to slowly move to the South West. I looked over at the bus stop and saw a man in his 20s staring up at the sky with his jaw open (giving me validation). When I looked back up it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The light sequence happened about 6 or 7 times.  It was hovering, but moving towards the west, in what seemed to be in spurts, always lighting up in sequence.  Suddenly, it started moving south, then it disappeared within seconds in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s the most amazing thing I’ve ever experienced.  I was never a believer of UFO’s until this day.  I will never forget it.  Neither one of us was under the influence of any drug or alcohol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened at approximately 10:20 pm, Thursday, August 13th, 2009 in Silver Water, Ontario, Canada, above Silver Lake.<n>

Saw a object like a star that kept changing color from blue red yellow to white.  Looked like a star.  Then it kept slowly moving to the west.  It was a long way off.  It looked like it moved up and down and then would move back to the east.  Am on flight path of Midway airport and see lots of jets all of the time.  Not a jet.  It finally went behind a tree and was gone.  Just wondering if anyone else saw the same thing.  It was in the south part of the sky. Thanks<n>

The first picture I took was to the north towards a cloud, I took a second one in a close up because I perceived that there was something moving inside.  In the third shoot I captured the presence of a light.  To the left (west), a plane was passing by.  At 12:25 pm, I again saw a light moving from north to east, and I shoot another picture.  I captured the light- object very clear in this sequence of pictures.  As I perceived its movement I took a close up. This one is a little bluer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever phenomenon occurred in the sky was very interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called Pearson Airport to ask what was flying at the time of my observation and pictures taken.  They called me back and said all that they had in their radar at that time (12:23pm) was a propeller aircraft that had passed a mile or two distance away from me.  Depart from Pearson Airport flying northwest to southeast.  I knew about the airplane because I saw it and had taken a picture of it.  The light remains a mystery.<n>

It had 3 dots on it in each corner where it looked like lights should of been but they were off. It had no lights on it which made it more strange. Right away we started freaking out cause it was unbelievable and we both were saying &#34;We werent just seeing things&#34;. It was scary and unlike anything we both have ever seen. It was like it appeared out of no where n flew slow above us for a second and it started to go faster and then we don&#39;t know where it went. It must of been silver but it looked like a brownish color and was lighter than the night sky. It was so crazy that tears just started rolling down my face. Me and my friend both were freaking out and got scared. We both are not the type of people to lie . Right after it happened I calle! d my boyfriend and he came with 7 people and we went back to the parking ramp because we were scared to go alone and we were even scared to look at the sky after that.  After we got there and told them about it we felt like they didnt believe us except for my boyfriend because he is into UFO stuff. A little later we saw this sphere that looking things that looked like it was turning in the sky. There was no lights on it or anything and most of us saw it. It was moving fast and then disapeared it was also the same color as the triangle ufo. We didn&#39;t know what that was because again we never saw anything like that. A few minutes later we saw this worm looking things. Everybody saw that one. It would move like a caterpillar and shrivel up then stretch out. Each time it would shrivel up different though. It was long maybe 30 feet, thats just an estimate. I thought it was something falling out of the sky or a shriveled up blimp but as we kept looking we realized it wasn&#39;t anyth! ing like that. It was moving kind of slow and it disappeared a! fter abo ut 4-5 seconds. I couldn&#39;t believe it because that was the third strange thing we saw that night. After that everyone believed me and my friend that we saw  that triangle object. The triangle object was the most weirdest  thing out of all of those. SO was the worm like thing because none of us have ever seen anything like that and the next day I tried to look it up and couldn&#39;t figure out what it was. None of these objects had lights on it. The triangle ufo looked like the lights were just off. That experience opened my mind up . All of the things we saw were all silent and wouldn&#39;t of been able to be captured on camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved overhead from north to southward direction towards Lake Ontario.After taking five still shots-it just vanished before my eyes.The weather was calm-no wind.The skies were unusually clear in observation.I had a psychic feeling I would witness something un~natural today.I will also send you the short v! ideo clip along with two pictures that captured this strange WHITE TRANSLUCENT object.Please note: that today is a Last Quarter Moon.I have witnessed many sightings depending on the moon cycle * PS The other three still shots, did not capture this unknown object ? .PSS It was six years ago exactly today- August 13,2003. I confirmed of being taken, as a young child in Scarborough 1963-1965.Happy Anniversary to confirm once again that feeling.That there is a presence happening here in my observations **** Possible contact once again<n>

About three miles away from where I was, on his porch, there was a bright (almost as if it was a headlight) blue sphere in the sky.  It was probably two football field lengths distance away from the top of the houses.  It was foggy out at that time so I could not make out specific details of the &#34;object&#34; but the fog had a blue haze from the sphere.  I&#39;m not speculating whether or not it came from Mars, but it was a very odd event to witness.  After about one minute the sphere immediately disappeared and the blue haze with it, although the fog remained.  It left me feeling a little nutty because the object was so bright and had form to it and then it was like you blinked and nothing was ever there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Around 1 o&#39;clock, the clouds began to roll in. The shower was supposed to be at 2 I believe.  At 1:26, I witnessed the craft come into view from my left, behind me.  It was very low to the trees. I turned around and watched it go left across the sky.  It was absolutely silent.  Being accustomed to all types of planes or helicopters flying over head, I knew what to listen for.  But there was nothing.  It had two white lights on the front, and then three more white, yet somewhat smaller, down the side. These lights would strobe on and off. In a pattern.  The first would light, the second one would light, then the third would light. Each of these would fade as the next came on.  It was somewhat cigar shaped, but had a wider front end. I watched it slowly glide to the left, and then slowly arch back to the right, over the tree tops, and slip out of sight.  The craft was going very slow.  But it felt so! close.  Literally 500 feet away from me.  I should&#39;ve taken a picture, but I was too captivated by what I was seeing.<n>

Two objects flew east to west across the night sky.  They were flying very straight and in a sort of formation, one first and the second on on his left flank.  Flying lower than the normal cruising altitude of commercial aircraft, the lights were too big to be that high up, but not low enough to be coming in to land at the local airport.  They stayed the same distance apart the whole time we could see them.  They had one distinct bright white light and two other blinking lights, possibly red or orange. They were flying slow enough that we were able to watch them for a couple of minutes before they were out of site.  Absolutely no sound at all.  We live outside of town and it was very quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights stayed in perfect unison and did not appear to be very high up (maybe 1000 feet or less on a guess). The odd thing was that although it seemed to be a perfectly clear night the 3 lights appeared to have a large haze around them and it also seemed that there was a slight glow in the middle of the triangle. I can&#39;t really judge the speed but it was comparable to a slow and low flying jet except for the fact that there was no noise what so ever (but this also depends on the true size of the suspected object).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was an Electronics Technician in the US Navy from 00-05.

I immediately realized that there was an area of solid cloud cover obscuring the stars at approximately 2,000 ft. AGL. The object was below the cloud cover. I estimated its speed to be 50-60 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no discernable sound, and had no apparent shape or nagivation, wingtip or landing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing the object for approximately one minute, the object entered a cloud for approximately 10 seconds. When it emerged, it had changed color from white to solid red and had changed heading to north-northeast, about 060 degrees. At that time, I called my wife to come see it. By the time she came outside, the object was some distance away, but she was able to see the object&#39;s color and direction of travel. We continued to observe the object until it had passed out of sight behind distant trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The local television station, KXLY, reported a story regarding observations by other witnesses in the area of the same or similar objects in the same timeframe on August 12.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have worked in military and civil aviation for more than 20 years as a maintenance technician and aviation consultant. In addition, aviation history is a hobby of mine. I have observed most types of commercial, military and civil aircraft operating in many different types of weather and lighting conditions. The appearance of the object I observed is not consistent with any type of fixed- or rotary-wing aircraft with which I am familiar.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed what I thought was a very bright star, but it was moving and appeared to be blinking. It was followed for about 15 seconds by a smaller looking red dot, which disappeared. The first star-like object was making very erratic movements, which appeared to be twirling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came close enough to shore that I could make out the outline of a disc shaped object which was clearly spinning, with red and white lights around the edges of the middle section of the disc. The UFO then flew further away, but we could still see the light from it which seemed to blink from the rotation of the craft. A second one joined it, and began to follow it very erratically. The second one then began to ascend to the upper part of the sky very rapidly. After a few minutes, two military planes tore across the sky in pursuit of the craft, which took off. At this point both crafts disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now, we had all been following the crafts for 45 minutes. When the two planes (clearly planes, as the flight pattern was very straight and had no inexplicable, rapid fluctuations unlike the other two lights) came in pursuit the two discs took off. A very low flying plane closely followed the two jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 minutes later, we witnessed something hovering stationary over the water for roughly 30 seconds, then slowly move forward towards the beach. Once it reached the shore, it flew sideways, and then began to move forward again. It had two red lights, one on the left and right sides of the front of the craft, and a white light in the middle of the two red ones. There was also a white or orange light possibly on the underside of the craft flashing downwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family and I have been going to this same part of Salter Path for 19 years. Never before have we seen anything like it. All of us are used to seeing planes and helicopters flying at night, as there is a military base in the vicinity (Johnson Air Force Base). The motions of the lights were such that it would be impossible for a plane or a helicopter. Furthermore, we identified a disc shaped object to be the source of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Sometimes it would move from side to side and then make a full stop for a few seconds before continuing.  I watched it for about ten minutes (trying to comprehend what I was seeing) then ran in to call my brother outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He looked up and could see it right away.  He confirmed that it didn&#39;t look or act like any plane or helicopter he&#39;d ever seen, either.  It was very difficult to determine the shape of the object, but to us it seemed either circular or spherical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what we could see it didn&#39;t have lights in the usual sense, but seemed that the object itself was lit.  However, it could be that we were unable to see the whole object. At one point the light was vibrating or dimming and brightening very quickly; my brother said he thought it was changing colors, but I was unable to detect a color change.  But we both agreed that it was clearly pulsating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved around in a random pattern, almost aimlessly, but always remained within clear view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 40 minutes my brother went back inside and I watched it for a bit longer.  I noticed that it moved back and forth several times, as though someone repeatedly driving a car forward and reversing.  It began pulsating heavily (the light seemed to be making patterns, but I can&#39;t be sure my eyes weren&#39;t playing tricks on me).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that it moved into a cloudy area and it became far too overcast to be able to spot it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a note:   Afterward I thought it might just have been a man-made satellite, some of which are visible to the naked-eye in certain conditions.  I read through a lot of information online, but from what I&#39;ve gathered a satellite&#39;s orbit does not match the behavior of this object.  I have no idea what we saw, but I&#39;ll be watching the sky far more often.<n>

I stopped to take some pictures of my companions from the top as they summited this pass.  All five of us saw or heard nothing unusual.  Previewing my images days later I saw something in one shot over the far ridge that was out of place, zoomed up on it and WOW, what looks to me to be a UFO. Images taken before and after of the same view show nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Photographer and use Photoshop alot and I know imaging, but I haven’t messed with this image at all other than to zoom up and clip out the UFO section and enhanced the resolution a little.  Looking closer I became more convinced that it was something out there in the sun and was 3 dimensional, not on my lens or a digital blurb.  The mid day sun was high behind my left shoulder about 15-20 degrees and looking at the clip the object seems to have highlights and shadows matching the sun&#39;s position.  It also has what seems to be a dark band around it&#39;s middle and a light area (aura if you will) around it, especially under it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What do you think?

After a look at the planet, I was looking up at the sky and saw what I thought was a satellite moving northward directly overhead.   It was as bright and as big as the brighter stars and moving slowly.  &#34;Cool&#34; I thought and brought my glasses up to my eyes to get a better look.

The report showed that 3-4 AM would be the time of the most significant shower sights.  We had been watching since 2 AM and consistently witnessed showers.  Right after the clock hit three we  we witnessed two more showers, and out of nowhere we noticed what seemed like a star beginning to slowly move through the sky.  We saw a faint blinking red light aside it at first and assumed it was a distant plane.  But soon we had a change of mind as the object which was close to or as distant as the stars flew from one end of the sky to the other in less than forty-five seconds.  We also noticed as it descended from our view that it had a diamond shape and there were acually 3 red lights flashing from one side to the front.  I had thought that UFO&#39;s were just made up crap by crazy people. Not anymore.<n>

After I awoke from a cat-nap around three o&#39;clock in the morning two conjoined lighter-that-air-balls of very bright white light floated around the tail section of my 24&#39; ft. rental truck.  The round spheres were the size the of two softballs, and they seemed to examining my truck body.  I was freighted  ((sic.  Frightened??)   -to say the least. I had no idea of what I was looking at.  My mind did not want to accept witnessing this strange sort of energy phenomenon.<n>

There were very few meteors that we saw, but still enough dazzle us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When sitting, I saw an oblate circle/oval shaped object fly by.  I looked at it, and I was about to neglect the continuation of looking at it since I thought it was a bird or airplane or something.  Then, I realized it was moving at incredilble speed.  About five times faster than a normal plane would make at that elevation.  It was an orangish color (around the color of the clouds) with no lights or sound.  It moved very fast and smooth and my brother and I had to stand up to see it as it was about to go past our field of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it disappear into the clouds.  It headed around the direction of South.  It moved in a straight path.<n>

We went to a large open field by where i lived.  Meanwhile my others friends decided to watch the meteor shower also but at a different location then us. Im staring up at the sky looking for meteors and what i thought was just three stars bright in the sky, turned out differently.  I see the lower &#34;star&#34; moving from left to right and back again.  At first i thought it was my eyes but at that exact moment my friends at a different location called and asked me if we saw the moving star too.  So i started to look more closely and it started moving in a circle and then it looked like a bouncy ball bouncing onto steps the way it moved in the sky.  And then to confirm that it definitely wasn&#39;t a meteor or star, it&#39;s lights would turn off and then turn back on.  All three of these lights were moving and turning their lights on and off.  Never seen anything like it before in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

My husband stepped out onto the porch  and after a couple of minutes he called me to the porch. The storm was really bad and no light should have been viewable in the sky other than a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He pointed to the  eastern sky and ask me if the bright light was moving. I watched for a couple of minutes and  we both agreed that what ever was in the sky that night was not moving. It was a large bright light just hovering  in the middle of the storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went and got the binoculars and  we took turns looking at the object. Through the binoculars you could see that the object had  a rectangular shape with orange lights running down both sides. We knew that no helicopter would be just hovering in one spot during such a powerful lightning storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the storm grew worse the object became brighter and still sit hovering. It hovered there for about 56 minutes and suddenly it was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have no answers for what we saw Tuesday night. It was a frightening , yet intriguing site.  I am afraid of bad storms but  even I could not resist watching this object during the storm. I am wondering if anyone else happened to see this spectacular site on  08/11/09 between 10pm and 11 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was a full scale model of an F-35 being transported to England from Lockheed in Fort Worth, with a military escort. The loud booms and lights in the sky were fireworks from a nearby racetrack in Kennedale, Tx. at 10:30pm to 12:30 am. It turns out the emergency vehicles in the parking lot of the supposed crash were part of a candlelight vigil for a skateboarder killed the night before on the access road of I-20 at that location. The two incidents were separated by 3 hours, and the military convoy just happened to pass by at the time of the vigil, around 9:30 pm, and there were entrance ramps to the freeway at that location blocked for the passing of the oversized load.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were using intermittent, seemingly random, fairly bright flashing strobes of red and white.  They were moving in circular patterns.  The strobes would stop completely which made the jets was very hard to fallow by sight, then they would be bright again.  Then I noticed a similar strobe light that was not a jet aircraft.  It was flashing red and white randomly, it would move then disappear and then reappear in another part of the sky.  It&#39;s direction was never constant it seemed to wonder around the sky. It seemed that the jets were trying to get close to it.  Then, I noticed another smaller white light that was moving, (I thought it was a satellite at first) I then noticed another white light, the first white light proceeded to do a course change towards the second object and quick and smooth did a complete circle around this object.  Both objects were white lights and m! oved away from each other and faded up into the night sky.  All this happened while military jets were in the area circling.  I noticed the original (not jet aircraft) flashing object move west away from the city area.  The jets fallowed, I watched the sky for about a half hour then the Jets went back over quickly to the East of the Des Moines area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was cloud on the sky too, but when I looked at the monitor of my camera, I was surprised to spot a bright light over the horizon. Before I take a second snap it disappeared.

Ft. Myers, Florida, I observed an illuminated phenomenon high in the sky which was so very distinct and unusual, i have felt compelled to report it.  I have never before seen anything of particular interest in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The atmosphere was particularly clear at the time, and the moon barely halfway rising to zenith.  I originally noticed a light to the north, which i initially assumed to be the lights of a large aircraft coming in to land at our local international airport, which happens here frequently.  But when i focused clearly on it, what i saw was so unusual that the image was simply confusing.  It moved in a perfectly striaght line, horizontally, from N.N.W to S.S.E, on a trajectory not far below the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How far away from me it was is difficult to say, however, i would guess from my judgement of its depth of field for it to have been approximately level with the bottom of an average summertime cumulonimbus cloud, although it could have been higher.  It moved very rapidly, far faster than any jet-plane, but not nearly as fast as a meteor.  I estimate that i saw the object, which was originally quite far away, for perhaps 10 seconds.  It was coming toward me, passed in front of me, and then my view was obscured by tall trees nearby to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object (or objects)are difficult to describe.  The closer it came, the more complex and strange it seemed.  I would have to describe it as a long ribbon of translucently glowing light, much like a chemtrail illuminated by moonlight, which had imbedded within it, a series of very bright lights, perhaps a dozen or more.  The lights were brighter than the moon.  The appearance of this thing reminded me of notes on a musical staff, and as the various closely spaced objects moved along together, they left short luminous trails, with all the objects in perfectly placed  rows, yet spaced apart from each other horizontally at irregular intervals.  Their trails connected directly to the ones traveling behind them.  Two were especially large, and the others of variously smaller sizes.  They were moving very quickly, and seemingly perfectly horizontally to the earth.  It appeared there were more forming as they passed by.  There was no associated sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While this may not be of help, from my fully extended arm, if i was to hold up a ruler (and i&#39;m of average height, 5&#39;8&#34;),the entire object or phenomenon appeared to be approximately 10 inches long horizontally, and 2 inches high, so it/they was very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were traveling at a good speed not to fast I had time to second guess myself at least 5 times. They were moving and had a stream of light behind them not the same amount of brightness but as if it were giving off light or heat as it moved. It was like a bright ball with ___________________________________________________________________________ that much of light behind it. They were traveling in a group but no in a straight line. They were kind of staggered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> x x  x  x            x   It was incredible! I Know it was aliens.. It HAD to have been!!!!!!!!!! They pass  me but not directly over head.

8/11/09 01:00|Brantford (Canada)|ON|Circle|all night|orbs, orbs, orbs|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71600.html|361|ndxe200908| orbs, orbs, orbs<n> <n><n> <n><n> i&#39;m not surprised to see a brantford report on this site , because from what i&#39;ve seen we have had a lot of strange happenings in the sky this week.just a few days ago (aug 5th or 6th) around 1am i left my friends house and out of the corner of my eye i noticed the brightest &#34;star&#34; in the sky was moving... you could see it popping in and out of the clouds.  After adjusting my eyes, i realized this was no hallucination.  it was like a bright ball, seemed like an orb-- this is how it appeared from the ground anyways.  I swear this thing was playing hide and seek; hiding behind dark evil chem clouds (5th day of major aerosol operation)  Sometimes it would drift out and sit ina a &#34;hole&#34; (HAARP?) in the clouds right in the open like it wanted to make its presence known.  it always moved in liquid motions, very graceful. 10 mins after the sighting a helicopter (black- military i presume) came from the direction of hamilton and was heading directly at the craft a! nd kept flying.  during the arrival of the helicopter i noticed the orb was gone.  i continued my walk and within minutes not only was the orb back but there was at least 2 much smaller crafts flying faster weaving in and out of the clouds moving across the whole city.  these ones were much smaller and not so blatant, and they were always moving .  for the whole 40 min walk home the biggest orb always kept appearing, dissapearing behind grey clouds always in the same general area which was in the vicinity of the moon.  Before i went in my house i checked and it wasn&#39;t there.  i played on my computer for a while and thought to look out my bedroom window, and the thing was right where it was before.  it was never out of site for the entire night, but after 330 it seemed to just sit there and act like a star.  i went to sleep just before dawn and it was still there...  one thing i forgot to mention is that when this ball was next to a cloud that wasn&#39;t as thick you could see a! red/orange glow projected from the object onto the cloud.  al! so at ti mes  light on the craft would pulsate especially when maneuvering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t see anything for a few days and then last night (aug 11) i was working at 3am (on lunch outside) and noticed several orbs again.  i had a friend watch them too and he couldn&#39;t believe it.  during lunch conversation i noticed what appeared to be a shooting star- but it couldn&#39;t have been because it shot one way and then reversed and disappeared.  this was all in a flash, so fast that i pretty much saw a &#34;&gt;&#34; in the sky ( like a zig zag)  anyways there were three big balls of light this time that mostly creeped in there own areas, posing as stars for the most part.  again they couldn&#39;t have been because we watched one start creeping, we lost him behind the cloud, then he slowly rose above it in plain site.  only one person at the lunch table was bothered to even look up ONCE... they were trying to tell me that it was stars, satellites etc without even looking up.   i really don&#39;t care because i know from chemtrails that bringing up anything &#34;outside the matrix&#34; just ma! kes you look crazy... even on a spray day with the sky in a grid pattern and magnetic cloud anomolies.  Anyways, around 5am i was hanging at the side of the factory with the other witness throwing cardboard in a bin and we decided to watch the several suspicious stars that were all out of place from a few hours earlier.  we noticed one slowly creep upward through a cloud and sit above it.(they seem to do that a lot...) the witness said &#34;holy shit, look at the red  light&#34;! as it passed through a thin edge of the cloud.  it sat above and it was pulsating, got brighter and it either changed shape or the shape of the craft became apparent- which was sort of like a small case &#34;t&#34; without the bend on the bottom.  anyweay i finished my shift, and when i left it was sunny, clear and the chemtrail planes (2) were already starting for the day.  nothing else was in sight in the sky.  i have never had an interest in ufos until recently, i just couldn&#39;t help seeing it out of the corner ! of my eye the other day.  now that i&#39;m watching the sky it see! ms appar ent that there&#39;s a lot going on we have no idea about!!!<n>

They both moved along side together at a slow speed and would stop and fade in and out.Both seemed to be traveling the same course as the first one but would turn direction a few times then stop fade out turn again then head south again We watched them for about four minutes or so before they just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both sightings were at same altitude going in the same direction with no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was fairly clear with some clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were talking and I happened to notice something wierd to the northeast of us in the night sky.  The object was flying from north to south over Troy, Mt. and I said to my fellow officer, &#34;What the hell is that&#34;.  We were watching it and the object&#39;s front end;ie, cockpit? was glowing with an dull amber light and their was an red pulsing light under the craft.  Also there were white lights around on the craft. Can&#39;t remember if lights were blinking or not.  Seems to me that the lights were steady.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not tell the shape of the craft as it was dark in color against the night sky. We did not here any sound from the object, but there was a diesel generator running nearby. It was definitely not an helicopter as the object was to big to be one.  It could have been some type of military aircraft but It sure was strange looking.  The &#34;wings&#34; if it had any, did not have and green &amp; red strobe lights on the edge of the &#34;wings&#34;. it may have had white steady lights though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object flew south of us I went over quick to the other two security officers at the other work site about half an block away and pointed it out to them.  All they seen was the back end of the craft as it went over the hills to the south. The object would have been flying just to the west of highway 56 if any one else noticed it from the area.  It was heading towards highway 200.  I had an cellphone with built in camera on my belt and could have taken pictures of the object but spaced it out, But we were to entranced by the thing.  Oh well, next time, maybe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh, my fellow office mentioned that the object looked square in shape, kind of boxey looking, but we were not sure and I could tell it was fairly long in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BTW, The moon was in the sky, it was an half moon.<n>

It appeared to be moving over the Ford plant. The craft seemed to be about 300 feet off the ground, judging by the trees. It was an equilateral triangle, made up of 3 white lights with another in the center. Two other flashing lights that switched from red to white were between 2 of the points of the triangle. It appeared to be moving left to right. I was unable to judge the size because of a lack of reference points. I am an 18 year old college student, I was driving alone that night, but it is in a densely populated area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our house is located out in the country side, on a hill, that overlooks a large valley.  We were parked , outside the car for about 3 minutes just starring at the object.  It had  two bright lights on it, and was circular in appearance.  The object just kind of stayed there as if it saw us.  Then it started to move, I heard a humming noise as it went over head.  I hoped in my car and drove 100 feet and turned my car around.  By this time the object was almost out of sight.  I tried to catch up to it, but it was to fast.  It went about 2.5 miles in the matter of 20 seconds.  The object was sighted after a large thunderstorm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source does not indicate date of sighting.

8/10/09 22:30|Minot AFB|ND|Triangle|45 minutes|Triangle UFO with a mysterious lead pod/craft, accompanied by approx 30 yellow lights in a swept-wing formation observed at Minot, ND.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92049.html|369|ndxe200908| Triangle UFO with a mysterious lead pod/craft, accompanied by approx 30 yellow lights in a swept-wing formation observed at Minot, ND.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 10 Aug 2009, at approximately 22:30 PM (CST), I was inside Minot AFB, ND, while physically located at the parking lot of the temporary lodging facility (TLF).  The sky just turned from twilight to dark when I looked North East in the sky and saw a peculiar object fluttering what I thought at first was a moth directly in front of my face and tried swatting at it.  As I continued to stare at this thing, I noticed it was flying towards me and was actually materializing what I could describe best as possibly from being invisible to visible, such as a cloaking device that re-materializes after being invisible.  The object was flying overhead towards and adjacent to the base&#39;s main gate traveling from East to West when I suddenly realized as it flew closer to me and directly over my head that it was triangular in shape object and had an altitude of approximately 3,500 feet.  It flew very slow, perhaps my best estimate was 150-200 mph, maybe slower.  If I wasn&#39;t! looking in the sky at the right place and time, this object would have flown right over my head without me ever knowing or recognizing it, because the object had a dull/ginger/stealth-like radiated light s on each corner, perhaps more lights in between them (can&#39;t remember specifically as this incident occurred 2 years ago) and was also totally silent--made no noise.  Strangely, this craft was lead by a smaller vehicle of some sort.  It was dark now in the sky and I couldn&#39;t make out the exact size and shape of this craft, but realized it was what I could describe best as a small &amp;quot;pod&amp;quot; perhaps.  The pod was approximately 50-100 meters in front of the triangle UFO.  After the triangle and pod flew over my head, it took about 5-7 seconds for me to realize and sink in my head what I actually saw.  I yelled for my 16 year old son to come outside and help me look for these UFOs in case they flew over my head again.  I explained briefly to my son what I had seen and fo! r him to look for anything flying nearby that looked suspiciou! s and re sembled to what I explained to him what I just saw.  My son recognized and saw both vehicles fly right over our heads again exactly on the same course and direction as they flew over me the first time.  I believe both crafts flew over us approximately 3 or 4 times total as I remember on one of the passes it appeared the triangle briefly stopped in mid-air directly over us and then proceeded to fly onward.  My son and I saw how creepy/dull/ and distorted these &amp;quot;ginger&amp;quot; lights were on the triangle UFO, which gave us an eerie feeling about this entire encounter.  What I thought turned out to be only a few passes over our heads of this UFO incident, actually turned-in to be what I still refer to my son to this day as a &amp;quot;UFO air show&amp;quot;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 15-20 minutes into the sighting, I looked straight East in the sky and recognized a swept wing formation of approximately 30 small yellow lights flying directly over the main gate and just South of me bearing a straight East to West trajectory.  Their altitude was also approximately 3,500 ft and were traveling about 150-200 mph as well (it was dark so there is a high probability of error on the exact altitude and speed on all UFOs seen on this evening).  As the objects continued to fly closer to me and my son, they began to perform an inverted barrel roll as all lights maintained and were strictly aligned and clustered in varying degrees from each other while maintaining the swept-wing formation.  After the objects completed the roll, they were directly positioned South from me and my son, when all of a sudden all 30 lights were &amp;quot;zigzagging&amp;quot; amongst and between one another without touching.  The objects continued to travel South and out of sight and r! emained in their swept-wing formation until we last saw these lights, the stealth-like triangle UFO, and lead &amp;quot;pod&amp;quot;/craft lastly traveling together in a pack as they were East of me and my son, bearing a straight Northerly direction and flew away until they were totally out of sight.  My son and I remained outside and watched the skies for approximately 15 minutes longer as I estimated the entire UFO sighting lasted maybe 45 minutes total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been interested in aviation and UFOlogy as a child, to present as I am now a 48 year old adult (46 at the time of this sighting) being retired US Air Force, after 24 years total active duty service.  What I saw, especially due to there being no sound and the stealth-like appearance, radiated and ginger colored lights located on this triangular UFO has made me determined this was not the stealth bomber as I have seen it physically fly in-person twice in my life time while on active duty in the US Air Force, but remarkably I can&#39;t relate how this lead &amp;quot;pod&amp;quot;/craft tied into this sighting accompanied with the swept-wing formation of approximately 30 small yellow lights. I attempted at first to call the Operation Squadron&#39;s control tower to see if any on-duty personnel witnessed the incident, but decided to change mind and refrained from calling after thinking twice about all this since I was on active duty service at the time.  I refrained from reporting ! this sighting as I didn&#39;t know exactly who to report this incident as my friend knew and referred me to your agency for reporting purposes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Thought it was a satellite at first as it was very small and seemed to be traveling at the speed I am use to seeing from a satellite. The odd thing was as we were watching the small dot it suddenly started to glow with a very high intensity light so much so that I thought it was a helicopter spotlight. The light only lasted for a few seconds then went back to normal and the craft continued on a southerly course at the same speed before fading out. I have an aviation background and do not think it was an aircraft given the small size, the speed of the object and the brightness of the flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I approached me from the East as I awaited it to change course to the South West, the norm, as it never did I suddenly realized it was something different! The clock was 9:14 Luppini time, only found in Jessup, PA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After stopping for the Stop sign, I traveled about 600 feet and pulled off the road just as another car passed me. I was across from an inspection station garage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of the car as the Orange Ball was descending toward the ball park&#39;s high tension power lines that cut right through the middle of the complex three fields plus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could hear an electronic type crackling noise very similar to a continuous mosquito zapper as it approached closer in the near still quiet! A sliver in the clouds opened up leaving me with a clear overview! The Orange Ball was headed toward the top of the high tension electrical lines for sure! My immediate view was now looking straight up under it as if it were an ultra-lite type aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was stepping downwardly by first floating forward and slightly upwardly in a jerking type motion going out about 50 feet or so with four or five jerks then dropping down sharply at a very steep slope rapidly coming to a stop (similar to a mountain climber descending a steep incline) It then repeated this over and over again step by step coming down slow but surely and cautiously! I seemed to be aware of my presence as may have been the reason it was so cautious. I observed this for about 8 to 10 downward steps now having descended about 800 feet and still coming down! I immediately rushed back into the car to dig out an old 35 mm camera in a box in the back seat and tried to get a shot using the camera setting in place as it was dark and I had no light! While doing this I missed the low point of the Orange Ball as it was already stepping upwardly reversing steps and I only got one shot because as I rewound the   sudden down pour of rain was unbelievable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The clouds closed up and in upon the Orange Ball as I dove back into the car all wetalong with the camera! It should be noted that when first sighted the size appeared to be about half the)size of a car (elev 2000&#39;)and about the size of a car at its lowest point(elev 500&#39;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s apperance was multi colored 1) black nose, 2) then dark red behind the black, 3) then red behind the dark red, 4) then dark orange behind the red, 5) then  bright orange behind the dark orange, 6) then bright white light behind the bright orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Orange Ball made no noise with exeption to the electrical crackling and zapping as it moved very slowly in a floating like motion! I think it was gathering the lose EMFs from atop the high tension electrical power lines like maybe rechargin itself! Last fourth of July two groups both before and after the fire works display observed the Orange Ball! Over the last 40 or so years many have reported white blob type sightings usually under 200 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It acted like a timmed animal when being fed some food off the back porch as it was so-so cautious as it knew it could not come in contact the electrical power lines and unable to see clearly in the low lyng rain clouds, but!probably needed to recharge or die! If only I had my binoculars as at its lowest point (400&#39; elev) I could have really seened the detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went down Hill Street to the Convient Mart to see if the local Cops were on their coffee break but no one was around! I then proceeded to Frank&#39;s in Simpson for a late dinner another place were some type of UFOs come and go up the Lackawanna River Basin toward the headwaters in Arart, PA, their  apparant area of interest when traveling through! The total time of this sighting was about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DATED: 8/10/09<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes himself as a professional engineer.

It moved slowly at first and then before it disappeared moved quite rapidly.   At first it moved quite slowly, drifting to the right and then arcing over to the left.  Then it took a straight line to the left and quickly rising and eventually disappearing.  The light was solid and then quickly flickered before it disappeared.

It was probably a few miles ahead, and it looked pretty low in the sky... It was a real cloudy and rainy night with lots of lightning. I pulled out my phone right when I saw it, and as I drove through the intersection I was getting closer and closer, but the light was so dim, and with the rain, it wouldn’t show up on my phones camera... when I get to about 2 miles past the intersection, it was to the left of me… I look back at it and it wasn’t one light anymore, it was 3 lights in an equilateral triangle.  I kept looking back at the road, back at the object.  Keep in mind, there was no blinking lights on this object at all.  I have never seen anything like this, and to be honest have never believed in UFO’s at all.  At one point as I looked back at it, a flash of lightning hit, and I could very clearly see the object in the sky.  It was a big, dark equilatera! l triangle, with a solid light on each corner of the triangle.  Now, it was a dark rainy night, so it was hard to tell if the object was pretty small, and as close as it seemed, or if it was really way further away than I though, and a big structure.  All I know is that it was under the clouds, so this object was very low to the ground, lower than planes ever fly around that area.  I opened up my car window to see if I could hear it, because it was basically right on top of me.  The object was making no sound at all, and was moving very slowly and sneaky through the sky.  The road I was on was a highway type road, so I had to go way past it before I could get off an exit and make my way back towards it.  When I got back to the general area of the site, it was nowhere to be seen...  I’m curious to know if anyone else has reported that from last night, it happened around 11 pm, and there were many cars on the road that I was on.  There is absolutely no way that I could have b! een the only person who saw it.  What an unbelievable site.  C! hanges m y whole perspective on UFO’s and what is really going on in the sky.  Please, let me know if anyone reports anything similar from NY on the same night.  Also, please know that everything i have reported here is 100% accurate and true.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Each were brightly lit with a large bright red rectangluar display in the body of the teardrop/triangular shaped craft. Each of the three craft had 1 giant floodlight near the front center of the craft. (From a distance, all you could see were three bright glowing red rectangles with a floodlight in front. They hovered approx. 300 ft above the highway in a uniformly crosswise fashion. Very scary. As I approached within a thousand ft. of them they turned their floodlights off, and raced to the west at an unbelieveable speed and disappeared. I will be monitoring the Wichita Eagle newspaper for any possible missing persons report. This is all I want to say now.<n>
8/9/09 22:30|Charles Town|WV|Chevron|15 minutes|Hazy blue then bright white darting light|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71584.html|380|ndxe200908| Hazy blue then bright white darting light<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between 22:20 and 22:40 Sunday August 9th I and my partner witnessed a strange light in the western sky in the vicinity of the Big Dipper.  Initially it appeared as a blue hazy star, and simultaneously we both commented that it was oddly blue and had never seen it in that part of the sky.  In comparison to the other stars and the Big Dipper constellation it appeared to be very high and a star rather than an airplane.  We live in the vicinity of Dulles International Airport and regularly see the headlights and beacon lights of approaching and departing planes following regular paths and intervals.  This light however was distinctly higher.  For the first few minutes of our observation we thought it could be the headlight of an oncoming airplane as often airplane lights appear bright and stable when they are approaching head-on before turning; the steady blue haze created by the humidity.  However, no other airplanes approaching from the west or departing from! the east had this glow.  After approximately 5 minutes of observation, the light became brighter and white, with an aura of blue circling it then red.  The bright white light would disappear, as if an airplane turning course away from you, but then would suddenly reappear, with a broad swatch of bright white light from left to right as if an airplane with lights across the breadth of its wingspan.  While this light pattern was changing back and forth from bright white to blue/red haze, the position of the vision also dramatically changed.  It appeared to get closer rather quickly, and also much lower in altitude, while moving right and left.  Using the approaching and departing airplanes lined up as a reference, the light moved faster to the right and then to the left than any of the airplanes in their flight pattern.  Also the light descended and ascended quickly, faster than any helicopter I have ever seen.  Its movement from right to left, up and down came in abrupt sta! rts and stops, seemingly without building momentum or slowing ! of momen tum.  The right and left and up and down movements gradually lead it closer to the ground or horizon, still the size appearance of the light making it look quite off in the distance and not a small craft up close.  As it approached the horizon it seemed to descend very fast.  If it was travelling away from us it was at sudden great speed, if it was descending for a landing, it was straight down and at a descent much greater than any vertical landing craft I have ever witnessed.  After approximately 20 minutes of viewing it was not longer in sight.  We spend an additional 10 minutes viewing the area of the sky and horizon but it did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a red light that did not flash. for about 40 minutes it approached as if a plane would but took way to long to reach us which it never did. it rose upward very slowly glowing brighter and brighter, then very dim for a few minutes then bright again. Then this red light jumped over to our right at the same altitude it was at approx 2 miles from its starting point in the sky. It then began to flash very quickly and got brighter then dimmer flashing, then it decended the distance it traveled over the last 45 minutes or so in about 3 seconds flashing brighter and then slowing down and gettting dimmer, then getting brighter and faster again. at the end of its decent it got dimmer and turned a whitish color and as it was speeding off just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The skies were cloudy and it was mostly dark.  I then noticed one single light in the sky.  At first it seemed very distant and I thought it was a star, planet or satellite.  Then it became brighter and seemed to be either over the bay or over the mountains on the other side of the bay.  Then the light seemed to pivot and become several lights right next to each other.  It could have been 4 or 5 lights.  My impression was that they were connected to a single oval shaped object but I can’t be sure.  Each white light was equally bright.  I did not get the impression it was moving in terms of distance but spinning or pivoting.  I wondered if it could be an airplane but it was staying in one place and did not seem to have the same light pattern as an airplane.  The light then seemed to pivot again and become the single light I originally saw.  The light then started to dim and continued to do so unti! l it disappeared from my sight.  The entire event lasted 30-40 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was luminous and steady, not moving at all, perfectly round and orange in color. At first I thought it might be a radio tower but there was none -- it appeared over a wide field out in the country. It seemed suspended in the air, not wavering, the orange light steady and unflickering. Excepting the moon, it appeared larger than any planet I’d seen in the night sky and appeared to be northeast in the sky, judging from the position of the pavilion where we were located. Clouds moved in the sky BEHIND the object but the object was motionless. It was windy out -- light storms and rain had been moving in and out of the area that evening. We enjoy watching nature and had seen clouds drifting over the waning moon about a half hour before seeing the orb. I’d say the height off the ground seemed to be about 15 stories or more -- about the height of a radio tower. It faded away after a few minutes but never moved fr! om the spot where we’d first seen it (but it was in the sky when we first observed it… we did not observe it “appear.”)  We pointed the object out to a couple who were at the event with us. They looked at it but didn’t seem phased. I wish I’d had my camera! We tried the cell phone camera but it didn’t catch the light. It seemed beautiful and odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I are both nature enthusiasts and spend quite a lot of time outdoors observing and photographing nature. I&#39;m a graphic designer and natural clairsentient. Interestingly enough, I had &#34;vibes&#34; about attending the gathering in Blanchard, despite an iffy weather report, and joked to my boyfriend about maybe seeing a crop circle (we&#39;d just watched a documentary about them a few weeks before). Nope, but we saw plenty of haystacks on the drive home the next morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

We had just changed places when I looked up and saw a large, slow moving, circular object moving from North to South about 1000 feet away and about 500 feet in the air. I was looking at it as I was facing Southwest. It is not possible for me to guess how large it was. It did not move as fast as a plane and it was much larger than a helicopter. It had red lights all around the perimeter and they all blinked in unison. That is what caught my attention. Airplanes usually have red and white lights blinking at different times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house to get our camera, but by the time I came back out, it was much to far away to photograph. I have always wondered why no one gets a good photo of these things – now I know.  I also did not have my glasses on and as the object got further and further away, my view was blurring. I ran upstairs to get my glasses, but by the time I got back downstairs, I could not longer see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband didn’t see it--he had his back to the object and he thought I was kidding when I said there was something weird in the sky overhead. I said I thought I was looking at a UFO and he didn’t believe me. I kept telling him to &#34;turn around, turn around, turn around or you will miss it!&#34;  By the time I convinced him to turn around, it had already moved quite a ways away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He did not get a good look. He said he thought it could be an airplane, but that it didn’t look like any plane he knew of. Unfortunately, he didn’t turn around soon enough to get a good look. It was all over in two to three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Airplanes do not have dozens of lights in a circular pattern all blinking in unison. This object was flying about the speed of a small single engine plane or a bit slower, but it was a huge object. I am pretty sure that what I saw was not an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved very slowly for its size and was not high enough in the air to be an airliner. It was not shaped like an airliner. It was either oval or circular in shape. It made no noise as it passed over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live about 30 miles from an air force base. That could explain it.<n>

Sky was clear with many stars visible as well as the moon on the eastern horizon. Witnessed an object with 2 lights, one steady in the front, and one flashing in the rear about 25 feet apart. I could not make out any shape of the object. The lights were the same size and the same color, white. My guess is that the object was about 1/2 mile straight up but what was so odd was the rate of speed it was travelling and the fact that there was no noise. The object cleared the western horizon to a point on the eastern horizon where I could no longer see it in less than 30 seconds. I did not give this a whole lot of thought until the object reappeared from the western horizon at approximately 10:45pm. It was travelling about 10 degrees further north this time with the same trajectory and appearance, again crossing the space from horizon to horizon in less than 30 seconds. My daughter witnessed both passes with me and my wife witn! essed only the second pass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are very accustomed to seeing many types of aircraft flying at various altitudes as we are within 10 miles of the Rockford airport as well as being on a heavily travelled flight path used by Ohare airport. Again, the flashing lights were not that odd but rather the speed and the fact that there was no noise at all. No chance that it was a satellite as the object was way too low. If I had to guess at a known aircraft I would have to say it most likely acted like a jet helicopter but I&#39;m not sure if they can even fly that speed and then to do it silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a disk-like shape with many yellow-white lights moving in a circular motion around the craft.  The object also had one small red light near the top center of the craft.  I pointed the object out to my boyfriend and within about a minute, the object had moved all the way across the valley of Reno, NV, and could barely be seen anymore. We noticed that a helicopter came relatively close to the object several times, but the object seemed unaffected by its presence. We decided to attempt to follow the craft to investigate further.  As we drove across the city, the craft moved closer and farther away, sometimes hovering in one spot for several moments.  At one point, we got near enough to the craft that we could see with the unaided eye its true shape.  It was still disk shaped, but it had become apparent to us that there were two rows of lights instead of one, spin! ning around the craft in a circular motion.  At our closest, the object was a few hundred feet in the air away from us.  At this point, the object turned onto its side, much like a Frisbee rolling on the ground, then turned back to its flat side, and began again to move away from where we parked. We continued to drive throughout the city to get closer, but the object eventually disappeared from sight altogether.  In the dark it was very difficult to see the full shape of the object, but I and my boyfriend are certain that this was no helicopter, plane, or child&#39;s toy.  We attempted to both photograph and videotape the object, but neither method was successful in picking up the image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To clarify, neither of us have ever seen anything like this.  We are both young college students with no history of mental illness.  We have seen TV shows regarding these kinds of incidents, and have always found them to be exaggerated and quite unrealistic.  After today, we are unsure what to believe and are searching for some sort of logical explanation.<n>

8/8/09 21:20|Alfred|ME|Rectangle|10 minutes|4 rectangular glowing objects glide silently by and ascend until they disappear into a point in Alfred Maine.|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71569.html|397|ndxe200908| 4 rectangular glowing objects glide silently by and ascend until they disappear into a point in Alfred Maine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On august 8, 2009, my friend and I were driving south on Roux Rd. extension towards Back Rd in Alfred, Maine. At exactly 09:20pm, I looked out my driver’s side window towards the eastern sky and observed a rectangular-shaped glowing object moving towards us, at an altitude I would approximate as about 2 or thousand feet, that immediately caught my attention as something unusual. I said “what the heck is that, and stopped the car and got out. We observed this object coming towards us, then it began to veer to our left, towards the north and apparently back towards Bunganut Pond. It was then that we saw another identical object following the first at the same speed and altitude, and then a 3rd. I did not hear any noise at all, but I had left my car running, so I told my friend to shut it off to see if we could hear anything, but the night was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, my mind was trying to come up with some logical explanation for what they were, even as we were watching them silently glide past us. We observed them for at least 3 or 4 minutes. As they seemed to be about over the Pond we had just left, they started to ascend at a fairly constant speed and just kept going until they disappeared into a point. My 1st thought was that they were planes with some kind of odd lighting on them, but they were rectangular and seemingly composed only of light. Then I thought maybe they were those “paragliders”, the ones with a fan strapped to their backs, but again, I knew they would make a whirring sound as well, so we listened very intently for any noise, but there was not a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to report that it was a clear night, a ¾ moon, so the sky was pretty bright and some stars were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After regaining some of my composure, I realized that I had my camera phone on my belt, and I was able to excitedly take 2 pictures, the 1st normal and the 2nd zoomed as close as possible. It was hard to keep the objects in my viewfinder under zoom and apparently I did not get the 2nd picture in the frame, but the 1st definitely shows as a point of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there in awe discussing what we had seen for a few moments, and then we got back in the car and proceeded to pull onto Back Rd heading east. My friend called her father, who we assumed was either back at the camp on the Pond, or already in the car coming up behind us, to see if they had also seen it. He said they hadn’t seen anything and they were driving up behind us on Roux Rd Ext, when suddenly I saw yet another single object to my left following the exact same route as the others. I stopped the car and jumped out, and my friend began yelling to her father to look and he said he was also seeing it from Roux Rd! He was asking “what the hell is that thing” to her on the phone as I just watched it fly silently by right in front of me from right to left. It then made a wide turn to the right just as the others had and began to ascend. We watched it continue to ascend until it too disappeared into a point of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best I can describe the objects is that they were rectangular, and the bottom seemed to be on fire. They did not appear to have any form at all, but rather it looked like a “line of fire” with a glowing rectangle of light above the fire part. They were definitely not anything that appeared to be man-made, they moved at a constant rate, and they did not just fly away from us but rather ascended until they disappeared.<n>

At first, I thought it to be a meteor shower/falling fire.  I was turning left in my car and lost sight of the sighting.  I immediately turned my car around in order to track what was going on.  Once visible again, it seemed the objects fell rapidly but quickly aligned.  However, at some point the lights quickly disappeared with one moving quickly to the West.  Don’t believe in UFO’s.  Any rationale explanation out there?

It was inclining at a very slow speed. After about 30 seconds of it&#39;s presence, I ran into the house and got everyone outside to view what I was seeing. Moments later it started declining, and resembled a plane on fire going down. It split into 4 pieces which appeared the same size, and the fire disappeared. You could see dim red lights which led us to believe that an airplane had exploded. A few seconds later, the remaining pieces flared back up and started weaving in and out of each other in a horizontal fashion. They slowly dropped towards the skyline, but the whole sighting lasted about 3.5 - 4 minutes. We all came to the conclusion that it was not an airplane, and from my experience in astronomy, definitely not a meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I asked my friend to look, and he too saw the object in the distance. I looked like the object would have be directly above 5th street near Piedmont Ave, but from our view was still close enough that we were able to clearly make out the shape, individual lights underneath, and the color of the lights was white with a slight bluish hint. It moved in a fluttering pattern like a feather would if you drop it. We watched for a couple seconds until it eventually drifted out of view behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other people would have had to have seen this object as it was just a little after 9 PM on a Saturday in central Atlanta.

I was traveling easterly and the object appeared stationary and slightly to the north relative to my point of observation.  The size of the light was larger than normal planet observations and I believe in the wrong part of the sky for any common astrological phenomenon that I am familiar with (please note that I do not have a background in astronomy).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed the object out to my wife and son (daughter was asleep) and we tried to figure out what it was.  We all continued to watch the object while completing the remainder of our trip home (~1/4 mile). Shortly after turning on to the access road to our condo complex we all realized that there were multiple objects of the same size and basic characteristics described earlier.  My wife passed our point and shoot digital camera to me and I began to take video footage while finishing the drive home (hand out the window, very shaky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we parked we continued to observe the objects along with several neighbors who also noticed the activity in the sky.  As we watched there were at least 24 of the objects traveling in pairs along what appeared to be the same flight path (traveling at relatively low altitude in a southeasterly direction toward Easton’s Point, then ascending).  When the objects reached a similar altitude they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of the observers present could readily account for the origin or purpose of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> General Background: Weather Conditions--mostly clear skies, ~70 F, low humidity, near full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer Information- 34 year old Environmental Scientist; 34 year old Teacher; 4 year old boy; (2) ~50 year old neighbors (occupations unknown).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Available Documentation:  3 digital video clips; ~0:10 seconds; ~1:30 minutes; ~4:00 minutes<n>

It was about 9 o&#39;clock not quite dark, I looked up to see if any stars were out I didn&#39;t see any looked again 2 seconds later and saw what I thought was 2 stars one dim and one very bright, brighter than Jupiter.  The bright one started moving south and upward very slow until it vanished.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.  The whole thing lasted about 25 seconds.<n>

My nephew-in-law who lives in Mansfield heard some very loud booms near his house around 12:30 am and went out to investigate but found nothing.  His brother-in-law and two other people in the neighborhood also heard them.  In checking the web I found a forum for Kennedale on topix.  There were many people who heard the noises and several reports of sparks over the treetops, and several people who claimed they had seen a flatbed truck being loaded with a ufo on Highway 287.  There were two (supposed) pictures posted of this on Twitter.  There were also claims that several black suvs were at the scene and the men were directing the local tv channel 5 news crew not to film and to leave the scene.  There has been nothing reported on the local news.<n>

It took about fifteen minutes till it started disapating into a small light again and the small light was there for another minute and vanished.  A week later while visiting a friend he started saying that he seen something weird in July and described my incounter almost to a t without knowing anything about me seeing it.

Three friends and I decided to take a journey to the desert near Skull Valley and Dugway, Utah.  WE DID NOT BRING CAMERAS FOR THE SAFETY OF US AND THE BASE, IT IS ILLEGAL TO PHOTOGRAPH EVEN NEAR THE BASE.  When we got there we watched a cop come from miles away with lights on and search the roadside for our car.The cop even found the exact turn off we took but we were well hidden.After a while of watching the skies we saw nothing,not even military aircraft.The driver got tired and wanted to leave so we packed it up and got to the road and drove north towards the Dell exit in Skull Valley,Utah.  While driving back I was sitting in the back right seat with my arm across the back of the seat just watching the skies behind us.  Hoping to see something I kept my eye on the sky and we passed this group of small buildings on the side of the road and I caught an orange light in the sky th! at at first I thought was a street light.not wanting to sound like a liar I waited to say anything,looking back at the buildings I realized that every single light in the entire area was a halogen blue/white light on every building and street light post.Finally I look forward and then back and I caught the orange orb in action!  It seemed to just appear out of nowhere,it looked like a light switching on and after about five to ten minutes it would shut off.  Keeping in mind the possibility of flares, I didn&#39;t want to get ahead of myself but these didn&#39;t fall to the earth or even shoot upwards,but rather levitate in place. the light didn&#39;t flicker or flash it was a constant glow of light that gave you the feeling of fear just seeing it.  The sky was dead quiet and there was no possibility of this being any type of &#34;natural&#34; aircraft.   After about a half hour of watching these lights appear and disappear they started to release additional lights/orbs in a horizontal motion,each light fired off AND would stop almost immediately and hover in pla! ce for c lose to ten minutes each.finally they stopped appearing but then a fleet of fighter jets came out of the base in attack formation and flew directly into the area of action.  They seemed to patrol the area as they circled the area about three times before flying a little further out, circling around,and disappearing back into the bases RESTRICTED AIRSPACE.Dugway Proving Grounds is one of the only if not THE only base who&#39;s airspace is restricted all the way to outer space.  What we saw on this night was NOT conventional nor military aircraft.  Please, I would really love to sit and tell this story to an expert or someone who is interested.<n>

UFO was boxy and triangular in shape with three green bars of light on back.  Seemed to be hovering for 15 minutes slowly descending erratically towards southwest towards the Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon further inspection with binoculars confirmed triangular shape long black ship, seemed to be having engine problems or unstable, appeared to attempt to gain altitude no beacon lights and did not travel or maneuver like a plane or helicopter.  UFO moved quick at times and rotated slightly appearing to attempt to stabilize.  Ship wobbled erratically and slowly descended out of line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reported to Albuquerque police.

First thought it was a helicopter but it was FAR above the clouds.   Checked a weather station and the cloud ceiling was at 12,000.   Planes from the Detriot airport were visible on take-off and approach.  Object moved slowly across sky and grew dim and was gone.<n>

It was bright like the stars at first.  There were other aircraft in the air and you could keep track of them as for the light you could keep track only for a few seconds before it was gone.  But one of the witnesses pics up a flash light flashes it twice at the sky then a few minutes later the object reveals itself in a cigar shape thing with no wings or visible engines and flashes back 3 times in different colors first was bright then black in which we could tell the shape of it then bright like the color of the stars.  I my self and other witnesses have seen it sense the 4th of july around the same time and seen it up close later that night some of the witnesses are in the military and in there words that was very weird.  What ever the cigar thing was it was big and definitely not man made.  They seem to communicate because we have flash a flash light more than once and we get a response fr! om the cigar flying thing.  It might seem silly but we get a response.  The cool thing about this sighting is that the object camouflages it self with the night sky.  At times its really difficult to spot.<n>

When I looked to the left I saw an object in the sky above the neighborhood to my right it had 1 white light and 3 red all of which flashed in a way I have never seen our jets do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was one of the jets from the base then I realized it was too quiet. So I paid more attention; showed my fiancé by pointing at it I then realized it was so close but the light was so bright that I could not make out the objects form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People continued to drive by; like I at first sight thinking it was a jet. It seemed to have hovered for a moment then swiftly moved to the side as if it were heading east then quickly changed route as if it were coming toward us then stopped suddenly and hovered again over the same neighborhood that I originally saw it over in the beginning. I freaked out because I didn’t think that our base has anything that fast and quiet with no sound. I stared and then it moved quickly backwards then shot away and disappeared. I could not tell if it went up or to the side. It happened so fast.  It was just Gone.<n>

Three lights, white lights, blinking in a strange fashion, were moving in unison across the sky, towards the SW direction.  It took maybe 30 seconds to cross the entire sky.  There were no other lights, and I saw a flash of light coming from behind and above my apartment, which was the direction the triangle lights came from.  I saw a couple more flashes, spaced about by a couple of minutes, a little later, seemingly a bit more west each time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after, I went inside.

The kids came in and made the parents go outside and look.  We looked to the north just above the neighbor&#39;s house who live directly behind us.  We saw what looked like a wide blue line that flickered.  You could see it better with your peripheral vision.  The light seemed to move side to side and up and down but hover in the same general area.  I grabbed my video camera and it wouldn&#39;t pick up the lights.  I then grabbed my still camera with a telephoto lens and was shocked to see on the view screen 3 distinct blue lights.  I then took a few pictures and went back to finish our poker game, while my son continued to take more pictures.  The time was about 9:30 pm when the kids first noticed the lights and it was about 10:45 pm when they (the kids) said it slowly moved to the right and lowered out of sight.  If I had to guess the lights or globes were above an area called Larkfield, a small suburb north of Santa Rosa CA.<n>

Then, I saw a silverish-whitish &#34;thing&#34; floating high in the sky.  It was traveling up gracefully, kind of like a balloon.  I watched it for about 10 seconds because I had never seeing anything like it before and was trying to figure out what it was. Then, it slowly faded away.  I thought maybe it was a plane hitting the sun at an angle that made it disappear.  About 20 seconds later it appeared in the same area again.  It traveled upward again very gracefully and then disappeared.  I did see some birds in the sky, but they were much lower.  This could not have been a bird - it was way to high.  It disappeared and reappeared 4 times.  I was driving where there are many high hills and twisting roads so I eventually lost track of the area it was.  I concluded that it could not be a plane because a plane travels upwards and forwards, this was just t! raveling upwards.  I am a mother of two and a teacher.  I would not make this up.  Maybe it was some sort of reflection?  In appearance, it was not at all like the stories of UFOs I have heard of in the past.  Hmmm . . . . . ?<n>

8/6/09 02:15|West Jordan|UT|Disk|10 minutes|Possible early morning unusual flying object sighting in residental area of Utah.|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71545.html|424|ndxe200908| Possible early morning unusual flying object sighting in residental area of Utah.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eighteen year old son had been out with friends prior to the sighting.  He doesn&#39;t drink or take drugs, but he called me to come visit to show me some pictures, so this is a second hand report.  (I live in Salt Lake City, and he lives 12 miles south of me.)  He explained, the moon was up and he went into the house to get his camera and take picture of the moon with his Pentax Digital SLR 6 MP camera, with his 70-300 telephoto lens.  As he was taking pictures of the moon, he noted a dark object slowly moving and hovering about 30-50 feet in the air toward the northeast, adjacent to an elementary school about an eighth of a mile away.  It was dark, and he could barely see the object, but noted it was slowly moving. He directed his camera toward it an got some picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening, the 7th of August, I finally met with him and he showed me his pictures that he downloaded to his mother&#39;s laptop.  The picture quality was poor, but his pictures did appear to show a saucer shaped object, with some sort of a glow or reflection below it.  He said when he saw it, it gave him a &#39;chill,&#39; and felt like he was dreaming, he could not believe what he was seeing.  It was slightly above the trees, and the pictures did show that it had gained some altitude, but still was hovering, with no sound.  He managed to get several pictures.  Since this is a residental area, except for the large fields around the school, I would estimate that the disk or object, was only about 30 feet or so long.  He went back into the house, and didn&#39;t see where the object went, except that it was no longer there.  This may be something else, like a balloon, but even the pictures, as poor as they are, seem to show something unusual.  This may be nothing, but perhaps others saw it also, and perhaps worth reporting it to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I served in the military as a pilot. (I got off active duty and became a part time civilian flight instructor and worked for the Fire Department in SLC, which I still do.) One clear early morning about 02:30, in July of 1983, over the starry night skys of Utah, my student and I did witness an unusual craft within 50 feet. I remember the craft or object had a very unusual &#39;belly.&#39; It was a chilling experience, and never dared report it. My student never flew again!)<n>

I went into my 14 year old daughters room and asked if she was making that noise. She said no she was hearing it to. The weather report said possible thunderstorms that night but unlikely, so I said well it must be thunder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about to go out for a smoke anyways so I asked if she wanted to see if there was any lightening over the foothills. As we approached the door she said mom I see stars and clear sky not clouds. So I thought maybe its a motorcycle or something, but unlikely way out in the country like we are. We barely stepped out when we saw them. There first was 3 flashing white lights that were dancing in the sky moving all over the place. Then suddenly there were 6 of them as if they multiplied in front of our eyes. They were dancing like fire flies in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they just stopped dancing and formed a pyramid formation. These things seemed to move so fast  and compared to our tree line they appeared to be pretty high. Then a 7th flashing light shot across the formation like a shooting star arcing in the sky. It came to the end of the formation and it abruptly turned to fall in line at the end. They headed east toward the Sierra Mountains zig zagging every now and again. In a matter of less than 2 minutes they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We still don&#39;t know what caused the sounds we heard but were amazed at what we saw. From our house we can see all the way to the foothills and mountains without obstruction and are surrounded by fields. It was around 12:34 am or so in Clovis Ca.<n>

Our friends have seen it at least five times and told us about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have been there a handful of times this year and it wasn&#39;t until this last trip that we actually got to see it first hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was between 11pm and 12am that my friends wife pointed out a star or planet that was changing colors when all of a sudden we saw a huge bright yellow orange and very bright object come up over the treeline and traveled maybe a couple hundreds until it was almost over the top of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped for about 2 or three minutes then it started moving at a 90 degree anlge in a different direction. We watched it while I struggled to put batteries in my camera. I managed to take pictures but it was pretty far away at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it disapeared and we were all standing around talking about it I glanced up and noticed something behind the trees (at the skyline) I drew everyone&#39;s attention to the fact and here it came again! It could have been a second one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took more pictures. When we returned home I downloaded our pictures from the weekend and three of them turned out! They are not crystal clear because of the brightness of the object but You can clearly make out the shape and color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was listening to the recording of the astronaughts on Atlantis who saw something this year and described it as being made of a soft looking reflective material which could explain the color of the object we saw reflecting the glow of the campfires throughout the area.<n>

It was triangle shaped with three lights, one on each corner the lights were red and one white. it flew over our house and it looked as if it was headed towards downtown. i saw it take a quick turn left and it turned around headed back towards our house it did a weird circle and then took off. It was the most amazing thing i have ever seen. I tried to get it on video but the lighting on my camera was too dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was as if the light had been stationary and invisible and the moment I looked into the sky at the place it was, the blue light shot off faster than anything I have ever seen (to fast to be a shooting star) travelled briefly away and across the sky and then exploded in a very small bright flash of blue and possibly a bit of white (can&#39;t be sure of this was to quick) then was gone!!!  It happened so fast I couldn&#39;t even think, my eyes just followed it and then my brain registered it afterwards.  Weather it was alien or not I don&#39;t know, but it was definatly not a natural phenomenon, I know what these look like. I don&#39;t believe humans are that advanced, it was spectacular, my heart is still beating, the speed and brilliant blueness was incr! edible; going back to watch the sky, see if anything else happens!!!<n>

It had to be about 30 to 40 feet in the air and maybe about the size of a small car. I moved in silence and just glided through air effortlessly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It lasted 35 seconds then just disappeared!   It was well defined.  It looked as it was ONE object, and it was HUGE, we are not intelligent enough to make something that large fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Roswell, and always think the people talking about this stuff are idiots!!  Never again will I think that!!  This was the most amazing thing Ive seen in my 32 years of life!!WOW!!  I actually cant believe Im writing this!!  I&#39;m very familiar with aircraft, Scientific balloons and what not, this thing was so big!!  Nothing man made!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Minutes later a fighter jet (from Kirkland?) was seen flying at high altitude east over the area where we seen the lights!  Very weird!<n>

We are located about 10 miles west of Panama City Beach, Florida.  Then sun was about to go over the horizon when I saw a small light about two to three times larger than a star appears to be.  The light was located southwest of us over the water approx. 5 to 8 miles away.  The angle above the horizon was about 35 degrees.  The color of the light was an orange-yellow, similar to that of the color of the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds the light disappeared then reappeared slightly to the left.  That light then disappeared and seconds later two lights appeared a little to the left of where they had just been, then about four or five appeared, again to the left.  This sequence of disappearing and appearing went on for about 2 or 3 minutes.  These lights were not moving when they were visible, only disappearing and reappearing.  The lights disappeared for a final time traveling a total of a few miles.  The lights were in a line, appearing to be lined up in the direction that they were moving. Every time the lights disappeared they sort of faded out for a second or two.  Their path was a straight line.  There was no noise or anything else associated with this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I previously considered myself somewhat of a skeptic when it came to UFOs.  So at first I was trying to think of what else it could be.  There are a few Air Force and Navy bases near by, but this was definitely something I had never before seen.  There was no other solid object or anything visible that they could be connected to.  After seeing this I looked up pictures on the internet of UFOs, and found these lights’ appearance to be similar to the event that took place a few years back in Arizona, known as the &#34;Phoenix Lights.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be both serious-minded, and a bit &#34;shaken&#34; by his sighting.

It flew very fast and there was no noise to be heard at all.  I heard a neighbor yell out, &#34;Look UFOs,&#34;  and that was exactly my thought too..  I had never seen anything like it before in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were pretty large, compared to anything I had ever seen in the night sky before.

After driving 7 miles on a dirt road, I finally reached the lake bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I was about to climb out of my truck, something caught my eye.  About 200 feet high was an unmanned aircraft flying right over my truck in an eastward direction. It was all white with a high aspect ratio wing similar to the Global Hawk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reached for my camera but it was too late, the plane was too far on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I climbed out of my truck to get some pictures of the lake bed and surrounding mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived at home later that day, I downloaded the pictures onto my computer and sent some to my friends. Later on in the night, I reviewed the pictures again and made a startling discovery.  On one of the pictures, I scrolled up high in the sky and noticed something that at first looked like the moon.  Then I zoomed in and it was a white ring with another ring inside it.  I checked out another picture and saw the same object but it was farther away and farther to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pictures are good quality and there are plenty of mountains and objects for reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is very strange is that I have never seen a UFO and never an unmanned aircraft but yet I saw both within about 2 minutes.  Nearby is a military base.<n>

It did not spin around it just stayed in its original shape and came perpendicular to the earths surface very fast.  It took off straight up just as it had come down.  It was gone from eye sight within about a second.  I was able to see it for maybe 35 sec. from the start to finish of the sighting.  The sighting took place in Yelm, WA Thurston county.  Looking toward the northeast sky.  I have never seen anything like it, it was very interesting but at the same time scary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I know every one on the 57 freeway going that way must have seen it.  It was to big to have been a balloon and it was definitely not a plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a personal note, in 2004 I was working near La Vern Ca. and was looking up towards a person repairing a roof, and saw 2 silver disk way above La Vern moving very slowly, I pointed them out to the roofer, and we watched them for about 30 min and then they disappeared all very strange..<n>

A few moving back and fourth at times looking as if turning into a fireball, real bright, then back into a slow moving object almost to look like a straight line with a shadow black top. at times displaying a red and blue light. others in the sky in wierd line formations as many as four in a row, slow moving all togeather with distance beween them, moving in circular motion then up and down. what seemed to be a red ball of light moving from the west to the east at a fast rate. to the north there was a formation of lights the brightest one alil. ahead of the other 5 lights. 4 of the lights were flashing red while 1 was flashing blue, then like at the 2nd light, what seemed to all of us to be a spirt of red dots that would spirt above the 2nd light then disapear then spirt again, over and over, all the while this strange formation of lig! hts were at a stand still. the strangest thing is that there is one real bright circalur object to the east of the moon. that moves up and down, in a circular pattern. we noticed that as time is passing its moving more in line with the moon. The moon also seems extrodonaryly bright, like blinding bright, with an orange glow around it, which seems to come and go. Iam really freaken out !!!!<n>

When the object reached its desired altitude it froze as the blue light caught up to it and leveled off, then both lights turned bright white and began twinkling at each other in increments of 3 flashes per side. It was about 700ft above the ground and about 1 mile away from my car. Then the object flew off south bound down the highway and into the distance, quite quickly. I continued south down US 95 and pulled over for some gas, after a quick fill up continued back on the highway and saw the object again; still twinkling its white lights. it had flown about 4 miles from the sight i saw it rise so i concluded it could not be a toy plane or helicopter ,especially going as fast as it ! was and as far from its point of origin. The object zipped along the highway faster than i was driving (about 90mph) giving me ample time to observe it. With out notice the object turned around and began to head north up the highway. At this point i realized that the object was not 2 individual lights but a tube like object with lights on either side. I watched the lights turn from white to blue then back to red. Once the objects lights were all red it stopped and hovered in the air it remained still in the air as i drove past it, i could faintly make out the body at this point but not clear enough to see any defining features except for the shape and the three red lights on the side facing my car. I am a Grad Student at UNLV and am not prone to seeing &#34;funny objects&#34; in the sky - I&#39;m certain this was nothing i had ever seen before.<n>

It was about 5:45 and it was still dark, but the sky was a monarch blue color before the sunrise, so it was not completely dark. I was between Washington Rd and Bobby Jones exits when I saw a dark shape in the sky flying at about 2 o&#39;clock to the right of my car.  It zig-zagged and started coming toward the highway. I thought...wow! That is a huge bird!...and by the time that it got over the highway, I thought that it might be a helicopter, but it had no tail and no propellers.  It had no lights and was completely silent. It got close enough for me to tell that it was black and looked like a rectangular pod of some sort and definitely mechanical-looking. I could see side pipes and what might look like vents on it.  Although it was difficult to tell just how high it was, it was not too high...as I looked to the left over my shoulder as I saw it go across me over the highway, it looked like it just skirted the tree line before it disappeared.  I was not scared, but had a car behind me and I did have to be careful, because I did not want to run my car off the road.  If it was a plane or a helicopter, it would have had lights.  Due to the low altitude, if it had been either of those, I would have heard it.<n>

It flew from aylmer towards the ottawa area. When I saw it I could not talk or move for at least 10 seconds then my eyes started watering.. pretty weird considering just last week an unidentified flying object crashed on the Ottawa river at the deschenes rapids which is right beside here. Oh yes and it was also loud enough for me to here in here although the sound only lasted about 1 second.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However, after closer observation with the naked eye and with binoculars also, it was obvious that the object pulsated white, red and green.  It hovered for a long time, and then moved very slowly sideways across the sky.  It moved up and down at times and appeared to change into a &#34;V&#34; shape too.  I watched with my son and daughter and my son&#39;s girlfriend for over an hour.  The object finally disappeared behind the trees where it was no longer visible to us.  Two even stranger things:  the neighborhood dogs were going crazy, and this is the same type object that I observed at the same time of night,in the same location and for over an hour on July 31st.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a &#34;twinkling&#34; star.

To the East above my neighbors roofline I was a BRIGHT ORANGE/RED pulsating sphere.  At first glance, I thought it was fireworks.  However, it moved way too slow and just hovered.  Next, I thought airplane, although there was zero sound plus it was way too bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere slowly tracked a course to the Northwest, and slowly gained elevation.  I asked my wife to hurry outside.  When she arrived the sphere had continued to gain elevation, and dwindle in size and intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere started out very bright and roughly the size of a full moon.  The sphere tracked a deliberate course to the Northwest all the while gaining elevation.  I watched this sphere for roughly one minute.  It started out at roughly 15 degrees in the horizon very intense, and slowly dissipated at 60 plus degrees in the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wife: I was packing for vacation in the bedroom by the window when I heard my husband quietly say, “Babe, come here and take a look at this.”  When I went outside my husband was standing at the end of our yard looking in an Eastward direction.  I immediately saw what he was looking at…A BRIGHT ORANGE circular light that was smoothly moving thru the evening sky.  He said, “What do you think that is?”  I replied immediately with, “ A UFO.”  He said, “it isn’t making any sound at all.”  I then yelled for my eleven year old daughter to come out into the yard to take a look.  We all stood there in amazement and watched as the object faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting was 1 minute in length.  We were facing in the East direction.  The object traveled in a Northwest direction.  At my initial look the object was approximately 30-40 degrees from the horizon, close to the size of the full moon.  The color was BRIGHT ORANGE, and never changed in vividness.  At my last view of the object it was approximately 60 degrees still heading in the exact same Northwest direction.  The object seemed to become invisible due to distance.  It became smaller than a star upon no longer being able to view it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The experience made the hair all over me stand on end, and my body was covered in goose bumps that lasted for a good 20-30 minutes after coming into our home and locking the door.  I was unsure if we should call the police, our local National Guard, and then online found the National UFO Reporting website.  We don’t want people to think we are crazy, but the experience sure was unlike anything I have ever experienced in my 34 years of life!  Daughter: My experience of seeing an UFO was not like anything I have ever seen in my eleven years of life.  The time was about 9:15p.m.  When I walked outside the color of it was bright orange with a little bit of red.  By the time I had got outside, it was fairly small but very visible.  It looked like it was smaller than the moon, but bigger than a star.  While I stood in amazement the object was at about a 50 degree angle from the horizon.  The UFO moved smoothly thru the sky for the approximate 30 seconds that I was out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if I will sleep so good tonight, it was kind of scary.<n>

We muted the TV and continued to hear it. We ran out onto our porch.  The noise continued.  Approximatley 15 miles from us is an F-15 base (Barnes Air National Guard Base, Westfield, MA).  We saw 6 F-15&#39;s fly over with afterburners on.  This is not a normal occurance, they usually fly over during the day time, and unless at an airshow I have never seen them fly over with afterburners.  Particularly at night.  The other odd part about this incident was the fact that the aircraft were running only their red collision lights, not a typical red white green configuration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wondering if you have recieved any additional reports from the area or of similar nature?  The F-15&#39;s certainly appeared to be going somewhere in a hurry.  The low rumble heard prior to the F-15&#39;s being seen was a different noise entirely from that of the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout the evening and as I am writing this report our TV has been having frequent interference and service interruptions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We would welcome reports from any other witnesses to this event.  Six F-15&#39;s in the air at one time is a major event, and we would welcome reports from anyone who was witness to the exercise.  If there were news reports in the local media, we would be grateful if people would send us links, or the text of those reports.  Thank you!  PD))<n>
8/4/09 20:57|Albuquerque|NM|Other|2 minutes|Blue/Green Glowing Figure 8 shape sighted in North East Albuquerque - followed by possible Military Aircraft|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71486.html|451|ndxe200908| Blue/Green Glowing Figure 8 shape sighted in North East Albuquerque - followed by possible Military Aircraft<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out walking my dogs with my wife and noticed a low flying air plane (cross streets are Union St NE and Eddy in Northeast Albuquerque) at 8:57 pm.  Height was under 1000 ft.  Plane possibly looked like a C-130 (it was getting dark so it is hard to tell exact aircraft).  The plane was flying north along the east side of the Sandia Mountains.  The reason I looked up is because I could hear the engines as it was pretty loud and low flying (planes do not typically fly this close to the ground as the airport / Kirtland AFB is about 15 miles to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After looking at the plane, noticed a weird object in front of the plane.  The plane appeared to be following or chasing the strange object.  What the object appeared as was a figure 8 pattern with flashing blue/green lights moving on the outside of the figure 8.  The figure 8 object actually looked like an 8 on its side.  I could not tell if the space between the outline of the figure 8 was solid as it was getting dark.  I could just notice the blue/green lights circling around the figure 8 pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent 12 years in the USAF and have been around aircraft for years.  I also work on Kirtland AFB and am familiar with flight characteristics and aircraft types.  The only thing that I would even guess this could be is an Osprey aircraft (which they have at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque) due to the large propellers.  Unfortunately, I have never seen the propellers radiate a blue/green light in the strange pattern.  I would also not understand why it appeared to be followed by a C-130 size aircraft.<n>

I&#39;m sure this event took place over the Ocean.  I distinctly saw four lights, that changed Colors, these lights made acrobatic moves that no plane I&#39;m aware of could make.  that is what grabbed my attention, really.  I have seen Jets fly at night, these lights were Flickering and changing shades of orange and flitting about the sky gaining altitude and then they all came together in some sort of Diamond pattern, one then two lights disappeared, then the other two.  I couldnt sleep after that, and approx. 30 minutes late I saw what I thought were the Lights again, but I strained to hear two Jet Fighters Flying High from South to North out over the Ocean?  Rare to see them, even that high.  Strange stuff indeed. I gotta get a high power camera.<n>
8/3/09 23:34|Anacortes|WA|Triangle|5 Minutes|Very loud slow moving equilateral triangular aircraft with 3 white lights on bottom connected by red/peach colored lines|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71532.html|454|ndxe200908| Very loud slow moving equilateral triangular aircraft with 3 white lights on bottom connected by red/peach colored lines<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened on 8/3/09 around 23:34.  I was in bed when I heard an extremely loud grating engine sound.  It didn&#39;t sound like any aircraft I&#39;ve ever heard before and I actually thought it might be a plane about to crash into my building.  I live in an apartment in an industrial building and have no other neighbors, so as far as I know I am the only witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My building faces an open field on the edge of a bay and a marina to the left/north and also another industrial building across the street.  Beyond the bay is an oil refinery of which some of the lights are visible above the roof of the building, those lights are a steady orange.  I got out of bed and went to my window to look when it sounded like it had passed overhead.  All my lights were out so I was able to see fairly decently in the dark and what I saw was a black equilateral triangular aircraft flying overhead going east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The points of the triangle were pointy, not rounded.  If I had to guess at the dimensions, I&#39;d say this would be approximately 40-50 feet long on each side but I confess I am not spacially adept.  I saw a plane flying in the same area heading north the next night and in comparison to this aircraft the plane is  tiny.  I was only able to see the bottom of the aircraft so I have no description of thickness or what the top or sides of it looked like.  I can&#39;t estimate very well how high up it was but I might say a few hundred to 1000 feet above my building.  It seemed to be moving more slowly than a normal airplane would be flying.  The aircraft was solid and each point of the triangle had a large white light and the lights appeared to be connected by thick red/peach colored lines.  There were no lights in the center of it and no other lights that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the points of the triangle was pointed toward the direction the aircraft was headed.  So, looking at the back end of the aircraft, the light on the right side of it was flashing in a steady rhythm, maybe 1 flash every 2 seconds or so, it was the only light flashing and only in white.  While the other two lights were not lighting up, they were still visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of minutes, the light at the front of the triangle began to flash white just like the other light and the two lights alternated in a steady rhythm.  I watched this fly in a fairly straight path until it was almost to faint to see, I never saw the third light flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do live 30 miles from a military base and considered it might be something from them but I don&#39;t know what aircraft out there is triangular.  I also live in the flight path of helicopters from our hospital and know this was not a helicopter. I spent some time looking at images online the next day and know this wasn&#39;t an Aurora or a stealth plane, nor was it an Osprey based on the pictures I found.  The object was solid and didn&#39;t have any wings.  It was literally a flying triangle and extremely loud, unlike any other aircraft I have ever heard or seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m extremely curious to know what it was that I saw!<n>

It was night and the light bright, no suggestion of shape or configuration of the craft was possible.  The speed of the light was many times faster than a normal planes speed, it traveled in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The remarkable thing about this was that as i watched this high speed light for approx 7-8 sec, it faded away into nothing.  This was a clear night, no clouds, the object was just past its apex flying across my field of vision, and it just went out.  Not like the light was turned off, but dimmed, took approx 2 sec to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possible factors: 45 south of McCord AFB and Fort Lewis.  Directly between Seattle and Portland airports (lots of air traffic).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The two on the left went out 2 seconds later. The 2 on the right went out shortly afterward. They did not have an arc indicative of a flare or firework, or anything else not under its own power. We stood there watching for a while, bemused. A few minutes later one appeared and disappeared then another right beside it, which seemed to move horizontally in the sky. Then we saw two come on at once, then the left one would disappear followed by the right. This pattern repeated itself with the lights, never losing altitude, though one looked like it shifted at a 45 degree angle downward and to the east, stopped for a moment, and then disappeared. We watched this go on for 30 minutes and then nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did see the blinking lights of several aircraft, also in the southern sky around the lights, but could not discern the 3-dimensionality of it (ie: if they were right next to them or some distance away).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a large object that had looked like the shape of a stingray. It was completely solid black, moving slowly.  About 200 hundred feet in the air. It was approximately 18 feet wide and roughly 10 feet long.  We watched it for about 40 seconds before turning. And watched it for a moment while driving away.

As I looked towards the WSW, I saw an object...blue with a metallic quality, spherical, at approximately 60 degrees above the horizon.  No lights...no glow...but clearly there. It was about the size of a fairly large star.  As we walked along, I kept an eye on it, and it remained stationary...same height and same location in the sky. This lasted for almost 20 minutes.  As we were heading back to the house from the end of our walk, I noticed that the object began to glow with very clear blue color, a couple of shades darker than robin&#39;s egg blue, the metallic quality no longer visible.  As it got brighter, it also began to slowly pulsate.  The pulsation grew faster, and the glow grew brighter. Suddenly, as it was about as bright as it seemed it could get, and pulsing as fast as a strobe, it took off in a N direction...in motion and out of sight in about 2! seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called in this report to NUFORC as soon as I got in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would certainly like to know if anyone else saw this incredible object that morning, or at any time before or since.<n>

But then while I was thinking about that, another one came right behind it, following the same path. No sound. The size appeared like a planet, maybe, and the warm color seemed more glowing than flashing. There were also a couple of meteorites, which appeared white and fell downward and disappeared.

The object began to take the shape of a triangular craft, with flashing lights ( like airplanes), but they were ever-changing. 4 lights could be seen, blinking and flashing. 2 would blink, then the other two, then they&#39;d go dark and blink one after the other clockwise, with atleast 2 or 3 rotations per second. the object proceeded to zig zag across the sky, over me and kept going at an estimated altitude of between 8,000ft. to no more than 15,000ft. the color of te lights were neon green, blue, red, and white. it continued on until out of my sight, moving much to fast for an airplane.  No sonic boom or noise of jet engines was heard, no other planes in sight in the sky. It would travel a great distance in a straight line for a few seconds, then stop abruptly, move diagonaly from its previous course, and then spee! d up again.<n>

I was thinking it was quite bright outside and looked through the blinds to get a look at the moon.  As I was pulling away from the window, I noticed a very bright sparkly/pulsating color-changing light to the west.  This light was quite unusual in that it was very twinkly and very bright. The moonlight overpowered the other stars so I knew it was not a star, it was not a steady light so I knew it couldn’t be a planet (i.e. Mars, Jupiter, Venus, etc), and it was in the wrong place for a plane (I live beneath the flight path for Alliance Airport and if I stand in front of my house, I can see the planes traveling to DFW &amp; Love Field; these flight paths are very consistent)… there were no other aircraft in the sky at all (I looked) and it has been my experience that planes pretty much stop passing over my house or in front of it around 11:00pm at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light stayed in the same place in the sky for the duration of time that I watched it.  I did try to take pictures of it, but it only appears as an indistinct, yet bright, pinpoint.  I tried to find my binoculars but couldn’t, because at one point I thought the light was ‘spinning’ and I wanted a better look.  After about 45 minutes of looking at the light from various windows, I laid down and tried to sleep.  When I could not sleep I got up again about 30 minutes later, and the light was gone.  The light did change colors between red, orange/yellow, blue and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Although the crafts appeard to be oval in shape with Intense bright lights, one craft was definitly triangular with colorful lights at each peak of the angles.

The object was a circular pattern of about 5 bright yellow lights with one light in the center. It was not very high in the sky, about 2,000 feet. It was about the size of a dime from 20 feet away. It moved very fast. It may have changed direction but I am not certain. I first thought it was a shooting star but the uniform pattern of lights is not consistent with that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was south-west from the moon, it seemed to shift form slowly but it stood still. I went inside to tell my girlfriend to come outside to see if she saw the object as well, she did. The object was right above the Griffith Observatory so it seemed from my perspective, the object still non moving glowing somewhat light-red and orange and gradually shifting form to somewhat triangula shape. Pointed towards the direction of the moon. Slowly it began to move after 5 minutes. The moon was south-east from my perspective. The object slowly moved paralled towards the moon, gradually increasing speed still glowing but throughout it made no sound. It crossed through and left without a trace until it was unseen to the eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I first thought it to be a sign pulled by an airplane, but as I got closer it was obvious that there was no writing on it.  It was somewhat transparent but charcoal in color.  And I would say the dimensions would be similar to a tractor-trailer or train boxcar.  It was perfectly rectangular in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took some pictures with my I-phone but was traveling approximately 78mph and taking them with one hand while driving.

As I stepped out onto my porch and looked up my eyes locked onto a moving object.  It was just approaching daybreak. There was an area of cloudiness in the location and the object itself appeared to be a circular (though not perfectly round) batch of cloud in the background of the cloudiness but very visible (though not with sharp contrast) through the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved at extremely great speed, certainly faster than an aircraft, in a horizontal direction (left to right) for a distance of about two or so miles.  It traveled back and forth approximately on the same track covering one leg in about 3 to 5 seconds.  I estimate its size to be about a regular motor car.  It was about four or so thousand feet up and a distance of about 4 miles from my location.  As you will imagine size, speed and distance are very difficult to estimate in this situation but this is my best estimate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my eyes locked on the o! bject for 10 minutes.  I then walked a distance of about 100 meters and when I looked to the location where I first saw the object, it was still there.   I then went on my way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I return, about 5: 50 a.m. it was daylight and the object was not seen.<n>

I observed approximately 15 shooting stars during that time. when the rate of observations slowed to nearly none I when into the house for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night I wanted to see if there would be more shooting stars.  I went outside at 2:00 am and stood in the same driveway and was watching the sky for shooting stars.  Although there weren&#39;t nearly as many shooting stars on this night , there were a few to see. every shooting star would zip by in an instant, if I wasnt looking in the right direction at the right time I would not have seen them.  In the country you can see the entire sky is filled with stars when there are no clouds in the area and there weren&#39;t any those two nights.  I was looking in the eastern direction when almost directly above me I noticed three &#34;starlike&#34; objects (lights) in a triangular formation, two objects following behind o! ne lead object moving across the sky.  At the first instant it was hard to notice their movement but it was soon evident.  They were moving slowly, unlike any shooting star. after approx. 15 seconds I watched then change their vector. originally they were moving toward the north then they turned toward the northeast. I watched them until they went past the horizon. the total time I was able to see them was 45 seconds.  I took note of the time and date and will never forget it.  Satellites dont travel in 3&#39;s nor do they change direction.  I have no Idea what they could have been.<n>

8/1/09 23:15|St. Catharines (Canada)|ON|Unknown|a minute or less|Two large bright white lights appeared equidistant as travelling extremely fast maybe triangular craft|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71681.html|478|ndxe200908| Two large bright white lights appeared equidistant as travelling extremely fast maybe triangular craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of Saturday August 1 2009 at approximately 11:15 PM (give or take a few minutes, did not have a watch, but checked the time shortly before going out)my friend and I were leaving the apartment complex and as I was stepping away from the building towards the parking lot/driveway, I glanced up at the sky directly above and saw two large bright white lights which moved very quickly towards the west. I sensed whatever was behind it wanted us to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were large round and very luminous, but it&#39;s light seemed as if it was contained behind something opaque, almost like frosted glass but allowing more of the light to shine through without the dazzling radiance I suspect really exists there. The sky that night was very overcast and I could see these lights through a seemingly thinner lower layer of clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights most likely were two stationary lights on the tail end of some unconventional type of craft as they were equidistant the whole time they travelled. It could possibly be the tail corners of a triangular craft, as I could not see any projection of anything beyond the light&#39;s edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were similar to light fixtures you see against walls or ceilings that are circular, round and protruding out from a flat surface looking like a deep plate/saucer or a bowl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So the lights were not globes or orbs. This left me with the impression of a triangle as I could only see a undefined darkness of some seemingly solid matter inbetween the lights and infront of them and it too was enshrouded in cloud as the round lights were. It did seem to me that the lights were at the back end of something, but that this &#39;something&#39; was cleverly cloaked!  Another possibility is that they are two separate vehicles of some sort that travel in &#34;synch&#34; or equidistantly somehow but that&#39;s not the sense I get from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So my friend and I were exiting the backside of the complex which is facing East, and I was just saying how nice the weather was for the walk ahead, and as we turned the corner of the drive, we were now facing West. I was looking up to see what the sky was doing and out of my peripheral vision a brightness caught my eye. So I turned my head (North)to look directly at it, as it was coming from a point between North and East going toward South and West.The craft moved extremely fast from at least behind this complex to a fair amount of distance in the sky infront of this complex (but still within my view) within second/s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So just before the craft gets to the frontside of this complex, I said to my friend &#34;Did(or &#39;do&#39;) you see that?&#34; and they said &#34;No! See what?&#34;, and so I pointed to it and they stared totally dumbfounded as it was about to disappear from view. It was my friends first U.F.O./craft sighting,it was my third.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was one thing that intrigued me the most about this particular craft sighting and that is just before it disappeared out of view in the Western sky, it&#39;s previously very straight and smooth trajectory suddenly at that last split second in sight, turned kind of erratic looking, and almost wobbly! (This part is like a fraction of a second!) It seemed to my eye it veered a bit to the right a little sharply and suddenly, before zig-zagging the rest of the way out of sight! I asked my friend again if they had seen what I had seen and it was affirmative, we both had seen the same thing. I was somewhat surprised as it was not expected, but not shocked as I think my friend was, as it was a more common experience for me.<n>

As i was driving I pass a soybean field that I have passed every day for my entire life.  I was 18 at the time.  I noticed 3 red glowing spheres about the size of soccer balls floating 2 feet above the ground.  They were red/orange in color and were hoving, stationary, and making absolutely no noise.  The orbs seemed to know I was there.  There was one closer to the road and two more in the distance in the field.  I stopped my car and decided to get out and investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked over the ditch seperating the field from the car and walked into the crops and stopped about 10 feet away from the closest object.  After concluding that it was nothing like I had seen before I quickly turned and returned to my car. I drove away and picked up my friend to come back to my house.  On the way back she noticed them too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These orbs were nothing that I could explain or an! yone i knew.  The observers to this event were two girls both of around or 18 years of age about to go away for college.  Both went to a private, Catholic school and were not under the influence of drugs, medicinal drugs, or alcohol.  Neither of us are big &#34;gamers&#34;, either.  The area the orbs were seen is a road hardly traveled in a very undeveloped area (except for crops).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel this is more of an unexplained &#34;being&#34; sighting than an UFO. I cannot remember the entire night or what I did and my memory seems to be missing important details about when I walked into the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This could be possibly because I pushed the secret into the back of my mind because no one would believe me except that one friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a smart college student and I have not seen this orbs since this one incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Very bright, like on fire, but looks like going east, not falling down, one after another about 3 mins apart, then disappearing.  Did not look like a meteor, looked like huge ball of fire, very red in colour. Not an airplane, perhaps space junk burning upon re-entry, but then why wouldn&#39;t the fireballs continue descent to the ground, why keep going east?  Silent, no engine sounds.<n>

But it was an amber colored light with  the radiant light beams coming off of it due to the salt in the air, I thought it may have been a plane or helicopter but it was borderline motionless and the light color was very strange and far off, a cloud went infront of it once and the light beams were still protruding through the cloud structure. We watched planes flying overhead while this was occuring, I dont know if they saw this but planes were present in the area and clearly much dimmer, and smaller than what was out over the oce! an. After about five minutes I decided to go run and get my camera to see what I could videot tape of this, and in less than a 2 minute time frame , while my friend Chris stayed to watch it, I returned and the light had just &#34;shut off&#34; is what Chris said, and we stayed for another 30 minutes and saw nothing. It was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked to round to be a air plane in my opinion.  It flew as fast as would a normal plane (which makes me think it may have actually just been a plane) and it had two or three blinking lights on it, one red and two blue.  Though I was the only person who saw it at least twenty people, including myself, heard an odd noise before and after the object was within sight (note: the sound was not heard while the object was in sight).  The sound was very similar to soft thunder (even though the sky was clear).  Some people thought it may have been fireworks, but the soound was too continuous to be from fireworks.  I even speculated that it could have been sheets and cloth flapping in the wind, for it did sound like that just stronger and farther away.  Was this an extra-terrestrial phenomenon, I&#39;m still skeptical.  I&#39;m postimng because I want to hear if other p! eople who know more about UFO&#39;s think this could be something that is out-of-this-worldly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As I am kneeling over in the grass up against my house it is dark enough outside to notice a light above light up the white siding of my house.  Above my head very low maybe 50-100 ft above the tree tops there is a purple bluish light just sitting exactly over top of me for a few seconds before taking off very quickly, there was no sound whatsoever just the light tht was emitted from object.  The memory is burned into my head and I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was frozen as I looked above myself at the object as I was the only living creature other than sleeping birds and dogs across the street.  I ran back in the house and told my family but of course no one believed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened a while ago but like I mentioned the site here allowed me to open up a bit and share.

Sphere, white in color duration 10 seconds, moving at a medium speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my patio and was looking at the moon and the planet below it. At first I thought I saw a satellite, and it was not a bright light like you see on a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a sphere, fluorescent white in color travelling from the east at a southerly direction just below another star(approximately at 125degrees)just to the left of the moon.  It passed underneath it and disappeared.  What I find amazing is that the star it passed under was no longer there thirty minutes later.  That object, which I thought was a star was not moving at all.  How can that be? I know for sure there was a star there, because I kept looking at the moon and I believe it&#39;s Venus just below the moon.  I was using the moon as my observation point.<n>

He told me what is that over head I look up and saw what look like two 6 foot balloons floating together about 10ft apart. They were dark in color and shape like a peanut. They both were flashing on the top as if sun light was reflecting off them both objects seem to wobble and flash at the same time. When l saw the objects they were at least 100ft in the sky moving around 5 to 10 miles hr. I told my son that they were baloons tide together. Soon they were out of sight I drove my car to get a better look at them. As they were headed to the Santa Cruz mountains. The sky was very clear that day we got out of the car to take a look as they travel across the valley they both were still 20 to 30 ft apart soon they look like two bright stars. All at once they flew together making one object it lasted for about 3:min to 4:min one took off stright up around 15 thousand ft while the ! other object stood in one place, soon it shot upwards to meet the other oject and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was at my friend&#39;s house, looking out the window. Then It came back into view and went slowly to my left, about as fast as an conventional aircraft. Then the craft once again zoomed across the night sky, to my right. I decided to tell nobody, because they may of thought I was imagining nothings [though I don&#39;t].  There was also no sound.  I guess it probably was about a kilometer away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I moved so fast I did not see what made this happen, there was no sound just a spark at the end of the streak, it all happende in les then two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to convince myself it was a shooting star but it was way to close to me and way to bright and shot straight up intead of across the sky. I can&#39;t stop thinking about what I saw and thats why I&#39;m making this report to see if anyone else saw the same thing?<n>
8/1/09 03:00|Slidell|LA|Unknown|2.5 mins|Object with 2 red lights & 4 smaller strobing white lights heading west on I-12|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71442.html|495|ndxe200908| Object with 2 red lights &amp; 4 smaller strobing white lights heading west on I-12<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading west on I-12 and had just driven past the Slidell Airport Rd./Northshore Blvd. exit (about 3AM) when I noticed a red light in the sky off to my south which was also heading west (this object wasn&#39;t heading to or from the small municipal airport in Slidell).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued driving and watching this object it did seem to be relatively low in the sky (3,000 to 4,000 feet up) and I could begin to make out 2 mid sized red flashing lights (each light was flashing separate of one another fairly quickly).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the object slightly changed direction to begin heading Northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object was picking up speed it seemed to be about 1/2 mile in front of me as it crossed over I-12 at the Lacombe/St. Tammany exit which is about 3 to 4 miles from the original exit that I first saw it at.  At this time I could clearly see that inbetween the 2 midsized red lights were at least 4 white strobing lights smaller than those red lights but I still could! n&#39;t see a shape to the object.  Almost underneath where the object was there were 4 vehicles traveling west, I was roughly 3 to 4 blocks in back of these vehicles. I noticed as this object passed over those vehicles, 2 of them did press on their brakes for a few seconds so I do not know if those people were able to make out the object. This area has very tall pine trees on both sides of the Interstate.  As it crossed over I-12 and continued heading on a Northwest trajectory at the same altitude I lost sight of it behind the tall pine trees on my northern side.  This entire sighting lasted just about 2.5 to 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, this could have been a plane.  I simply could not make out a shape to it at all, nor did I hear any noise from it.  I live 20 miles west of this area and I live in the direct flight paths to both the International and Municipal New Orleans airports and I have never witnessed a plane with lights flashing the way these did.  I know that this wouldn&#39;t have been a commercial large plane flying that low in this area as it wasn&#39;t coming from or going towards the Armstrong International area.  I have seen smaller planes at night with just a red light on it but none that quite flashed the way these did.  I am interested in seeing if anyone else reports seeing these lights and could clear up if it was a plane or not.<n>

We were staying for the weekend at the local hot springs.  All four of us had been on the road for five hours and decided to take a late night/early morning soak.  We were all relaxing in the communal hot tub when we started looking for falling stars.  My friend and I witnessed a few falling stars over a ten minute time span. My envious wife starring deep into the sky finally thought she got her lucky shooting star. She said,&#34;look at that star!&#34;  We all looked to the sky and witnessed what looked like a star moving across the sky at a high rate of speed.  The next thing we knew we were seeing these &#34;moving stars&#34; going in a variety of directions at different rates of speed.  They would appear and move from one point in the sky to another.  They seemed to dissapear as easy as they would appear.  All four of us wittnessed something unexplainable with a clear mind.  There is no way these! were satellites or known government aircraft, just by the different rates and directions they were all moving.<n>

I opened the door to let them out.  One of them went out the other did not. I watched out the window of the bedroom to the north.  It was a dark night.  There was a light in the field.  I thought, oh, heat lightening, but it wasn’t.  The light moved across the field toward the house tipping back and forth.  It was a circular shape and very graceful and at the time I thought how beautiful and peaceful it looked.  It was definitely round in shape.  It came up the previous night’s campfire.  There was a column of light coming from the bottom that shone on the field and the campfire pit.  The embers lit up like a bellows had blown on it turning bright red for just a couple seconds.  There were lights around the edge of the circular shape.  I tried to wake up my husband but he wouldn’t wake up.  I wanted to tell him what I saw.  I had nothing to drink.  I was sober and awake.  I let the dog back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later my husband was crying out in his sleep as if struggling.  I woke him up with difficulty.  He didn’t tell me what was wrong.  In the morning I told my relatives who were visiting that I saw a UFO.  Later my husband came out and told us his dream about having to fix something underneath the craft and that a being was threatening him to fix it NOW!  He was frightened because he had messed up the threads on the item he was screwing back into the craft.  He hadn’t heard my story yet about seeing the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing it I wrote down a summary of what I saw and some of the thoughts that I had during the time after seeing it.  I was thinking that maybe our eyes couldn’t always see them.  There was no fear.  They seemed curious and graceful.  It was soundless.  Possibly heat seeking – the fire pit was warm.  Why did they come from the woods and field?  The reason I could see them was I just woke up and was in an open frame of mind.<n>

The time was approximately 1:30 am.  I climbed in bed and closed my eyes, when I noticed a bright light coming from the west.  My bed is beneath 3 large windows facing south.  The light was shining on the blinds and looked as if it were car headlights.  I moved the blinds slightly to see if I could get a better look, and was only able to see a bright orange circular light, behind the trees.  To be honest it looked like what we would call a harvest moon.  It seemed odd coming from that direction at that time of morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up and went to look out of other windows that I may have a better view of the light and possibly the source.  I finally went into a bedroom facing west and looked out the window and saw the bright “moon” in the sky.  A new cell phone tower had just been put up in town.  The light seemed to be behind it somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to bed telling myself it must be the actual moon, not really believing it.  The light lasted for about 30-45 minutes and then as quickly as it had appeared, it was gone.  I did not see it leave or how it moved.  I heard no noise.  I just noticed the light was gone from my window.  I have waited for it to return, but it has never been back.  If it returns, I will be getting pictures and video.<n>

It appeared to hover for approximately ten minutes which was enough time for me to smoke two cigarettes and to find our binoculars. Next it had made a very sharp right turn and took off faster than anything I’ve ever seen in my life. We looked at it through our binoculars and it had not resembled anything we’ve ever seen in our life. It definitely had not resembled a plane of any kind or a helicopter. There was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  The object seemed to be rectangular with two very bright lights. It was nighttime in a country like setting with not a lot of air traffic that passed through. It was a very clear starlit night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A glowing fuzzy red/orange light caught my eye very very high up in the sky. As i looked up, it seemed to go forward (west) for about 4 seconds, then it stopped, and went south at a 90 degree angle for 4 seconds, then it went north for four seconds, almost forming a &#34;T&#34;  then it went straight up or back in the &#34;Z&#34; plane (not x or y) and slowly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this i made sure i wasnt seeing a reflection off of a building, or window and all i could see was sky, i even blinked a few times to make sure my eyes were&#39;nt messed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
