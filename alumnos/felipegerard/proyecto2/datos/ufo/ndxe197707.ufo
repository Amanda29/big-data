Same intensity of light and speed as other satellites I&#39;ve seen, but after watching it for about three seconds, it zig-zagged back and forth about four times (very rapidly) before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

At first I thought it was the light of a commercial aircraft at 20,000 ft. until it jiggled slightly up and down.  When the peripheal of my vision opened around the light I realized the light was at the bottom of a rectangular white craft slilently hovering approx. 200 ft. above me. Just above the tree line and above an apartment building. I stopped dead in my tracks, Rubbed my eyes and realized it was not an illusion.  The bottom of the craft as well as the sides were flat. The back side and front of the craft were angled. Much like the Chevron shape. It hovered motionlessly (except for slight jiggling up and down) over me for at least one minute.  Before it started off I could hear a &#34;slight&#34; air disturbance, and then it zigged slowly in a left angle about 50 - 75 ft. and stopped, then it zipped to a right angle and stopped, then left and stopped, then right and stopped in this exact pattern moving northwest acrossed Aurora towards the mountains until I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

I recall leaving from celebrating my Aunt&#39;s 50th birthday party weekend at the time. She had a condo in Toronto and a cottege in Beaverton, so recalling my 7 year old memory is slightly dusty which is why I don&#39;t recall where we were coming from (nor does my family).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I were in the back seat of the family car and we had our heads up in the rearview window (right. no seat belt requirement then) as we often did. We noticed a black triangle blanking out the stars and very slight amount of high, wispy cloud that evening. We thought it was strange and thought it was even more bizarre when slightly pulsating red lights came on at all three points. It traveled with us 3-5 thousand feet (?) above us and matched our speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This only lasted for a few minutes and it took off picking up speed slowly until it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the Stealth years later, it prompted me to think again of the object I saw as a child 30 years ago. As my dad worked in aviation at this AFB, I asked him these years later if the Stealth had ever been there at that time. He laughed and said no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m curious if there is anyone else out there that had seen this in the area west to the 400, east to HW 12, South to HWY 7 or north in a line between Beaverton/ Sutton/ Barrie/ Base Bordon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks!<n>
7/26/77 14:00|So. Farmingdale|NY|Unknown|15 minutes|Six flying craft sighted over a clear blue sky, just one day after a major blackout in 1977.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36558.html|4|ndxe197707| Six flying craft sighted over a clear blue sky, just one day after a major blackout in 1977.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Peter Davenport, My name is ((name deleted)).  My Brother ((name deleted)) has written into your program on his UFO sighting encounter.  As apart of his story, I also was a witness to this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The day of the event was July 26th, 1977, the time 2PM.  I had noticed that beautiful, cleared skied Summer day, that my Brother ((name deleted)) was laying out on the lounge chair soaking in the sun.  Next thing I knew there was alot of commotion going on outside as I heard him saying &#34;Oh my God, look at that&#34; !  I ran to the back door, and asked him what was going on, he said, &#34; Get out here, look at this, it&#39;s incredible&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I rushed out to the backyard, and as he pointed up to the sky, my focus targeted on six flying objects.  One large object in the middle, and four to five smaller objects in a formation surrounding the larger craft. The objects seemed to be way up in the atmosphere, and appeared to be &#34; a strange attraction&#34; to me because the objects just hovered, and definitely did not act as the flight of a plane craft would.  Suddenly, the smaller objects started to perform  pulsating, multidirectional maneuvers that planes or other craft would never be able to maneuver.  Then all of the flying objects moved across the sky together in the same formation, surrounding the larger object, and continued to maneuver this strange multidirectional flying pattern.  This type of event continued on for what seemed a minimal of ten to fifteen minutes.  Then in a blink of an eye, they all took off in different directions and were gone !!  Just like that.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for taking the time to read my witnessing of this account.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))   Below, is more information on this sighting:  Time:  14:00 Duration:  15 Minutes Sighting:  So. Farmingdale, N.Y.  11735  County: Nassau Witnesses: 4  P.S.  My Brothers e-mail address is ((e-address deleted))<n>

I was bored and decided|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36271.html|5|ndxe197707| It was July 26th 1977 the day after the big black out in NY. It was 2:00 PM and the electric was still off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was bored and decided to lay out in the back yard. This is when I realized how beautiful the day was. I decided to face south with the sun at my back. This would allow me to look up and admire the beautiful sky that had no clouds or haze. As I was looking at the sky I saw to what I thought was a star. I said to myself &#34;Wow the sky is so clear I can see a star.&#34;  The star was in the 11:00 position in the sky. I continued to look at it for approximately 5 minutes when the phone rang. My brother said the phone call was for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told him to come out and keep your eyes on this while I answer the phone. He came out and said Wow it&#39;s so clear you can see a star. I said I know, that&#39;s what I said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I got on the phone he started screaming, &#34;It&#39;s Moving ... It&#39;s Moving&#34;  I ran out and was shocked to see it moving very slowly South heading to the 2:00 position in the sky. I told my brother to hurry up and get my telescope. I immediately put the small spotter scope on it then I was able to get it immediately in the large scope. To my shock and surprise I saw very clearly a round object that was silver at the top and glowing orange and yellow at the bottom. I screamed &#34;It&#39;s a UFO&#34;  The UFO was moving very slow as I was following it. Then suddenly my brother started screaming there&#39;s another one. I looked away from the telescope and saw 5 more UFO&#39;s directly behind the one I originally saw, only now you can see the difference in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other 5 UFO&#39;s now look like small dots in comparison to the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were all evenly spaced and started to move a bit faster south when Suddenly they all Bolted across the sky from the 12:00 position in the sky to the 2:00 position in the sky in a flash. They looked to be at least 34 thousand feet up. Then they all stopped at once still evenly spaced at the 2:00 position. Then they dropped down to the 3:00 position and all stopped then all went back up to the 2:00 position all stopped then all shot out at once South West at the 1:00 position faster than a flash of light. Gone Forever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all very excited to be a witness to this UFO sighting. My Brother, Sister, and two of my brothers friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After everything was over I sat down by myself and reflected on what I just saw. That&#39;s when I was hit with flashes of information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was suddenly taken off this planet looking at it disappear in the vastness of space. I was suddenly outside our universe. It looked like a black ball floating in a dimension of white energy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I went further back I realized the white energy is also a bubble, only extremely large and still growing. There were other Black bubbles within the white. The other black bubbles are other universes. Some were large and others were smaller then our own. The larger the bubble the older the universe and the more advanced life is within. The most advanced beings were able to travel between universes. They were beings of light able to exist in all dimensions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got taken even further back it came to an endless field of black. The extremely large whit bubble was in this endless field of black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However this endless field of black was not black at all, it was such a high frequency it would show up in our spectrum as black however it is the brightest white and most intelligent and was the first spark of existence. This Frequency always was and always will be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This frequency is so intelligent, it deliberately designed our existence by putting frequencies together that would create our universe and matter then us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From seeing this I understood the following.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. Our universe is in the 3rd dimension of matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. Our universe sits inside the 2nd dimension of Frequency and energy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. The endless field of black that the 2nd dimension sits inside the high intelligent frequency.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. How frequency and energy was created to push open the third dimension of matter. (Our Universe.)  5. As Frequency and energy radiated through the empty universe, it collected on to itself creating matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6. I understood what creates gravity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7. How to repel it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8. How to have instant communication from one universe to another universe at real time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9. How to collect free energy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything I just reported I have written down and mailed it to myself back in 1992.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/26/77 03:20|Toronto (Canada)|ON|Changing|2 minutes|I saw two objects following each other along the exact same flight path over the city. They came in from the SSE and were heading NNW.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45850.html|6|ndxe197707| I saw two objects following each other along the exact same flight path over the city. They came in from the SSE and were heading NNW. I couldn&#39;t be exact about the height but it is a very clear night and there were a few light altocumulus clouds so I&#39;m guessing that they were anywhere from 7500 feet upward but I can&#39;t say for sure because I have no clue as to their actual dimensions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the first one appeared I was confused as to wether it was a plane and as it grew closer I thought they might just be balloons but then I relaise that it wasn&#39;t light reflecting of the balloons but infact light moving in a circular motion probably around the edges of the craft. There was a light haze around the craft probably caused by the lights refracting in the air around the craft. At times the circular motion changed to an elliptical one as though the craft had changed its angle of attack but it was definitely moving at a unifrom crusing speed with no erratic motion and a continous heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Skeptical as I am, after it passed over my buliding and out of view I looked down and a second later saw the second one following just like a replay. I studied it to the best of my visual ability and I am confident that it was not in the shape of any aircraft that I am aware off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not under the influence of anything alcoholic or any kind of drug. I am a logical, sound person with a few hours of flying time under my belt and have always been skeptical of UFO&#39;s and am still skeptical of alien life forms investigating our world but I can say for sure that the craft I saw tonight is unidentifiable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing I know for certain is that the Toronto City Centre ATC and the Toronto Pearson ATC should definitely have seen it on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a light or brightness over my left sholder and glanced that way and saw some really bright lights in the sky. I scared by buddy as I locked up my brakes and pulled over to the side of the road and I remember yelling &#34;what the hell is that&#34;? We both got out of the car and looked up. The lights were in a v shaped formation and there were 4 total and the one on the north side was a little offset from the rest but traveling at the same speed. The lights were moving west to east and as we watched them they flew right thru a partial moon but I could not see any outline nor were they pulling any contail behind them best I could tell. I did not see any navigaton lights as on a plane or any strobe lights. The lights continued on an easterly heading and did not change appearance in any way, it was hard to tell what altitude they were, but I did not hear any noise nor see any contails or nav lights. The lights were traveling at a fairly fast speed but hard to estimate, I guess the best way to describe would be when you see an airliner pulling a contrail these lights were moving about 3 or 4 times faster than that. My friend and I watched them until they went out of sight on the east horizon and at that point went on home. We did not think a whole lot about it until we saw in the paper a day later other people had seen strange lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little background on me at that time. I grew up close to a large airport and was always interested in aircraft and was very familiar with most aircraft by a very young age. I could tell with a quick glance a Boeing 707 from a 727 from a DC-9..etc and even at night I could usually tell by light configuration what kind of aircraft I was looking at. I was a student pilot at the time and have go on to become a pilot and have been in the aviation industry in airline operations for 22+ years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report is not made up or a crank thing done for fun, this sighting has bugged me for many years and now that there are places to report them I have decided to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

7/25/77 20:00|Danbury|CT|Disk|5 minutes|Close up sighting of UFO saucer over house at about 100 feet altitude.|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86166.html|8|ndxe197707| Close up sighting of UFO saucer over house at about 100 feet altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 8:00 to 9:00 pm in late July or August (don’t remember other than it was a warm time of year and in the evening and in New England so it had to be mid summer) and was getting dark out but still light enough to see details in all objects (trees, house and vehicles). I was in my car with my son (about 10 years old at the time) and we were backing out of the driveway, which slopes up from the house to the street. As I approached the street I saw this large saucer/disk shaped object hovering directly above (less than 100 feet) my house. My house was about 45 feet long and this object was a little larger than the house, so I would estimate it was about 60-70 feet in diameter. When I reached the street and backed out into the center of the road (this was a circular dead end street) the object moved towards me and again just hovered over my car. I opened the window and stuck my head out to get a better view and also to see if I could hear any sounds, ! which there weren’t any. I am a very mechanically oriented person (I worked as a mechanical designer at a model shop) and kept looking at the ship to see what is was and if I could detect anything that might indicate it was a hoax or some type of simulated ‘space craft’. The ship was a disk shape with a dropped central area on the bottom with windows all around the vertical surface. There was a soft green lighting effect inside as though there were lights coming from below the windows or back away from the windows, like you would get from lighted instrument panels. I could see seams on the outside surfaces defining the ‘metal’ panels that made up the skin of the ship. It looked just like a typical aluminum aircraft construction. There were no exterior lights that I could see from below. (At this point I am convinced this is a UFO type craft and started to look at the details.) The ship started to move away from me, following the street above the trees, and I proceeded to fo! llow it, all the time with my head out the window. I was movin! g at abo ut 10-15 miles per hour and kept up with it as it moved down the street.  I never heard any sound coming from the ship and it remained just above the trees, so I would guess it was still about 100 feet above the street level. I followed it down to the end of the street and then all the way to the end of the next street where it dead ended and the ship ‘shot off over the woods’ and disappeared into the night sky. I had heard from some of my relatives that it was seen about 15-20 miles away the next day near Mahopac, NY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been an office manager, mechanical designer and Security Officer for my company in Oak Ridge, TN for almost 30 years and did not want to ‘go public’ with this as I was concerned that it could affect my job and/or credibility in my position. After seeing and reading about so many reported sighting of UFO’s (lights in the sky and small blurred images) but never anything as close as my experience, I decided to tell my story now that I am retired and would like ‘let it go’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

7/24/77 23:45|Cerrillos|NM|Triangle|25 minutes|We saw a craft flying making instantaeous 45 degree turns and landed less than 100 ft from us.|4/12/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97103.html|9|ndxe197707| We saw a craft flying making instantaeous 45 degree turns and landed less than 100 ft from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two witnesses to this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 24th, 1977 I was with another witness at location 37 25.818&#39; N &amp; 122 05.36&#39;W south of the town of Cerrillos NM.  In the clear night we saw a craft flying erraticly making instantaeous 45 degree turns caught our attention and landed approximately 75-100 ft on a small plateau infront of us.  The craft was dark black in color with red &amp; green lights along the edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the craft was 45-60 feet in length.  The craft was clearly visable to us and made no noise except for a slight humming mechanical sound.  The craft landed and had three thin legs, centerwise to the orientation of the 3 triangular legs it had a light that came out from underneath with a mechanical articulated 3 joint arm.  That seem to interested in the ground for some reason.  On the side of the craft had red and green lights emminating with a slight color alternating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 15 min my other whitness decided to approache the craft despite my best efforts to! stop him he moved toward the craft. The commotion of our struggel seemed to be recognized by the craft and the craft immediately shown the light directly at myself and the other witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point we both froze in our shoes.  Then the craft retracted the light and retrieved the landing legs folding inward and hovered rock solid in air with no support and completely stationary.  At that point we began to hear a very low frequency sound beginning to emminate from the craft.  This startled us so much and we ran to both of our cars.  The frequency of the sound emmating from the craft continued to increase both in freqency and amplitude until after a few minutes it was shaking the hood of both cars.  My car started immediately but my whitness truck would not turn over.  Both of our chests were vibrating as well from the noise of the craft.  The craft moved slightly forward (as though you had removed the parking brake on a car) then the craft slowly moved forward (east) then elevated in flight to a 45 degree angle and took off at a high rate of speed estimated to be 2-5K MPH continuing upward into the night sky and in less than a minute it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The remaining evidence of what we saw that night was the indentation of the ground of the legs of the craft and some burnt grass where the light had shined on the ground.  My proximity to the craft and seeing it first hand in full operation has haunted me for all these years.  I don&#39;t know what is that we saw but it had to be an advanced aircraft of some kind.  Over the years I have researched various kind of aircraft flight systems and know the USAF was working on an advanced design similar to this in Albuquerque but what I saw was literly 50-100 years ahead of what we would be seeing today.<n>

I said, &#34;where&#34;, and the Airman pointed toward the flightline. I saw this object the size of a football field, and it was shaped like a football. The object was slowly moving from left to right. the object turned right, and headed toward the ground, and it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called the airport to find out if there was Jets landing, and they said, &#34;no&#34;. There was nothing going on. The People We talked to said, &#34; it&#39;s probably a cloud of some type&#34;. &#34;I&#39;d say it was a UFO&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

My mother thaught it was the stop light (breaklight) of a car, but we lived on the 5th floor so that was not the case, anyway i was scared (5 years of age) and went under the blanket. My mother told me what happened then, This big sphere or ball if you like was about 5-6 meters wide and tall (ball) and had a constant red bright light scanning our bedroom and us (that was my mothers feeling)it was only outside our window?!. After about 5-7 minutes it took off all the time soundless! completely silent, and it flew away and my mother saw it all the way until it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im not sure what that was but ill tell you... After that, i do believe more that it is somethings out there. (or the goverments testing new equipement???????)

It was the eighth anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing.  As darkness descended I was chatting over the fence, as it were, with a neighbor who was approaching retirement age; we often spoke like this.  Housing in our south-side neighborhood was modest single-family residences on smaller urban lots, with narrow driveways leading from backyard garages to the public street.  Lighting was typical of what one may find in an urban area in the late 1970s, that being mercury vapor street lamps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know why we each paused in our conversation, what may have attracted our eyes, but we both halted at the same point and looked skyward toward the west, and perhaps 20° above the horizon.  The best I may describe what we saw was a small group of intensely colored lights, moving steadily and in formation, east by southeasterly.  As the group of lights approached what would be due southwest of our position, they halted suddenly.  And then the fun began.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights no longer remained in formation.  They darted.  Here.  There.  Then there.  Changing position.  Appearing in this part of the southwesterly sky.  Then there.  The rapidity of movement, the intensity with which each craft changed direction, was absolutely startling.  The lights would dart and flash in the sky almost as if wishing to convey a message that could not be readily understood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the sky again was absent of these lights.  For a moment.  They reappeared again in the formation that initially caught my eyes and that of my neighbor.  In formation they resumed the same path at the same rate of speed as when we first observed these and before their awesome light show.  There was no audible sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With a modest separation after the formation of lighted objects, we then observed two military jet aircraft on the same path as the formation and following at the same pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor and I looked at each other.  &#34;What the heck was that?&#34; we both said to the other.  &#34;I guess we&#39;ll never know.&#34;<n>

It went dead.  I looked for new batteries in the house but found none.  I turned the thing off and on several times.  It began to work again.  I thought it was weird but did not think much else about it. About 30 minutes later our neighbors showed up with a story.  They had just sent some friends on their way and were standing in their driveway when they saw a very slow moving object in the sky above the trees and houses and particularly noted that it hovered across our house.  It was flying low. It was shaped like a “cigar” as they told it and had lights around the circumference.  They walked around to the back of their house to track the craft as it moved but when they got there it was gone.  They did not see it speed off. It was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember my dad asking them (another dad and his son) if they were sure it was not a “blimp” that they saw and they reported that it was definitely not a blimp.  I remember they debated about whether a blimp could leave so quickly.  The other father was hesitant but finally reported the event to the local radio station (WMBG) in Williamsburg, Virginia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot say that the dead radio experience and the object seen were related but they did occur at the same time.  I guess it would be possible for something like that to interfere with the crystals in the radio.  But who knows?  It could have just been a coincidence, which would presume the radio went on the blink for a few minutes just as the neighbors spotted the UFO.  [I never had a similar experience with that radio before or after that night.  It was a pricey and quality item my father had purchase for me as a birthday present that year.]<n>

The craft itself looked to be about two storeys high with a saturn type ring splitting it through the equator.Above and below this ring there was clearly visible a row of about eight windows slightly octagonal in shape and very dark.We agreed that we did not see any moving parts at all, and that it appeared to be of metal and a very pale orange colour.I know that this happened a long time ago but its not something I would forget especially the size of it,I believed it then and still do now.<n>

Thinking it was a satellite, I pointed it out to my companion. We saw it stop and remain motionless for a short time, then start to move in a different direction, then stop again. This went on for a short time with at least five changes in direction at a low speed. Then suddenly the object left, disappearing over the horizon at enormous speed. There was no sense of acceleration-the motion was instantaeous and the light was gone in a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The storm had high winds and there was something about the air that night that was different.  The storm had ended and we were approaching a plateau where the high school is located.  There is two high objects there on this plateau, the water tower and two grain silos. As we were making the approach, I noticed a light hovering above the grain silo&#39;s.  This light was round in shape and looked like the same light as fire.  It hovered above the twin silo&#39;s.  My brother then noticed the light and asked me if I saw it too. We didn&#39;t know what it was.  As were got within 500 yards, it began to move and did not make any noise.  I began speeding toward the object as if we had scared it.  I approached 85 miles an hour and seemed to catch up to it. It was as if it had not wanted us to get closer.  It began to speed up more quickly. When the object seemed to have the ability to go over the horizon, I began to be disappointed.  I flashed my auto lights and honked the horn.  It seemed to wait at the horizon. My brother and I had to drive down into a valley and up another hill to where this horizon was located.  My brother was deathly afraid and I wanted to make some kind of contact.  We drove around on top of this hill and I had the feeling that something or someone was around.  That was the last time that I saw this object.  However, my brother drives a newspaper route in the morning and he states that he has saw it again.  I can&#39;t confirm it but I know what my brother and I had seen.  I had thought it was ball lightning but it acted as if it was hovering above the silo with intent.  And when we approached, why did it speed away?<n>

As we got closer I could see the silhouette of this object against the dimly lit clouds in the sky.  I turned around to be on the south side of Pacific Coast Highway so I would be closer.  On the north side of Pacific Coast Highway there was a highway patrol on the south side was a Huntington Beach police vehicle.  The officer was outside of his police vehicle with binoculars.  I pulled over and stopped.  I was going to get out when the lights that were pulsing alternately pulsed once simultaneously and were both red.  Then this object started to move slowly southeast down the beach.  I followed it slowly down to the Huntington Beach Cliffs.  Then it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness implies an evening sighting.  We have amended the time above.  The date is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/15/77 21:30|San Francisco|CA|Circle|1.5 minutes|The object hovered over my bedroom window with spinning circular lights|11/8/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32914.html|24|ndxe197707| The object hovered over my bedroom window with spinning circular lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am ((deleted--thirties)) years old now and presently working at the ((deleted--senior legal position)) in San Francisco. I have never forgotten about what I believe to be a UFO experience that happened a long time ago around the year 1977 when I was about 11 years old. I&#39;m not too sure about the date since I was a young kid. But I figure it had to be between the years 1976-1978 because I was in Elementary School and around 10-12 years old during the time. My family and I lived on the 3rd floor of an apartment-housing complex during the time. It was one night about 9:30p.m. My three sisters and I were all sitting in my mom&#39;s bedroom in a half circle while we intently listened as my mom read to us a storybook. I was the only one directly facing my mom&#39;s bedroom window, which faces an outside courtyard with planted trees and grass near the main street of Valencia and Albion Street. During the reading, I saw what appeared to be a shadow of a large object with spinning rotating lights (red, yellow, blue, green) going around it. (Not to sure about the colors, but it had many different colors) The lights only shown dimly through the window shade and curtains but just strong enough to attract my attention. This object with the rotating lights went pass the window QUICKLY back and forth about 3-4 times totaling about 15 seconds. I wondered what that object with lights could be? After the 4th time when it passed (end of 15 seconds), I remembered calling out to everyone in the room, &#34;Wow, did you guys see that, those colorful light? Apparent no one noticed it except me. And unfortunately, back then when I was a kid (only boy in the family), I was always pulling jokes and teasing my sisters, therefore no one took me serious and went to the window. I must have told them at least 3 times to look at the window, because I seen something strange. But, I guess I told them to LATE, because by the 4th time (end of 15 seconds) when my brain finally registered what was happening to call out &#34;look&#34;, the object had made it&#39;s final pass from behind the window shade and curtains (I thing it was just hovering/hiding along the back left side of the cement building wall or high above the building roof, I don&#39;t know). Anyway, I tried telling my family I seen something, but my mom told me to stop interrupting the reading of the story. No one believed me. At that point I got up and lift the shade and curtains aside and looked out my mom&#39;s windows. I saw nothing through the trees but I was sure there was something there. Then I decided to get a better angle view so I quickly ran to my empty and dark bedroom and look out my bedroom window, which is to the right side of my mom&#39;s bedroom window. On the left side of the building I saw this round circular object. It was about the size of a car or van but it was completely circular in form. Beneath the bottom of the circular object it had many colored bright lights built all around it. The lights were spinning. The object did not have any sound as it moved and hovered. The technology was unlike anything that we had back then or now. It was the quietest thing I ever seen. There was a large glass window on one side of the craft. This is where it gets unbelievable and really weird. But this is honestly true! I saw only the shadowy outline of three skinny figures inside the craft. It appears as if they were passing their hands over lighted panels or some how using their hands on the front of the craft that appeared to be some kind of lighted control panel to maneuver the craft. I could NOT see their faces or inside the craft clearly because it was too dark inside the craft and the spinning lights obstructed my view. I started to call out to my family once AGAIN but changed my mind, because it looked as if this craft was going to depart and it would probably be gone by the time they got to the window in the next room. Anyhow, I doubted that I could somehow convinced them to at lease get to the window in time before it flew away, they seem more interested at listening to the read! ing of my mom’s story. I was speechlessly staring at the object almost in deep wonderment for about five seconds. At that point, to my surprise, it did not fly away. In fact it flew closer to my bedroom window hovering there. At that point, although being an extremely curious and inquisitive kid, I remembered getting nervous (and it took a lot to make me nervous, I didn’t scare easily as most people- not then and not now). I remembered letting the curtains and shade go and running back toward the room door about eight steps. Then I could see the hovering object lights through the shade and the curtains silently back away from my window at a distance. I could not help but to be so curious, no one will ever believe me I thought. I decided to run back a second time to my window and lift the shade and curtains. The object was still hovering at a distance, but when I came back to the window it flew close to my window a second time. I got frighten and ran away from the window again. The object seems to sense my reaction because it withdrew from the window again at a distance. I was amazed at the QUICK precise speed and exactness it moved between our building (without hitting or smashing the walls) and without making a sound at that close level. Therefore, although feeling a little nervous, I was filled with curiosity, I decided to go back to my empty bedroom window a third time. I looked at the object hovering at a safer distance for about 8 second. At that point, I heard the voices of children in our neighborhood running and playing. Although, it was around 9:30 p.m., I remember children in my poor neighborhood always stayed out playing hide and seek real late at night (especially during the summer months-if I got the month/date correct). Anyway, I think the children in the neighborhood also seen it because I heard one of them yell, &#34;There it is, up there.&#34;  Then the object begins to slowly depart higher and higher without a sound (it was weird how it did not speed off fast to conceal itself). I think it begin! s to fly toward the east of San Francisco near the freeway near Mission and Fourteen Street. I have never seen anything like that again my entire life. I was thinking, I had a pretty good unique view of the object. Since these objects usually fly in the sky, most people only see them when they have both feet on the ground. I was able to see the object eye level at my window around nine feet away. I was thinking, that is probably the reason why I was able to have a unique view of the figures inside the craft. Anyway, ever since that experience, whenever the subject of UFO comes up I always tell my wife and friends what I experienced. Since they know my characteristics, they know I seen something but they all say they find it very difficult to believe it was a UFO. I don’t blame them, because if I did NOT see it myself I would find it very difficult to believe any one also. But I will tell you one thing, for some strange reason, I wish I could see it again! I have already searched your database to see if anyone else has experienced seeing a similar strange object in the sky around the time of 1976-1978. There is ONE other record in your database, which occurred on 7/15/78. I wonder if it is the same as my experience except either he or I was a little off with the date. Since the person who recorded the event on 7/15/78 was NOT detailed as to the street and area of San Francisco, can you please tell me if the experience in your database that occurred on 7/15/78 match my experience, meaning did it happen near the SAME area as me - the Mission Area, around Valencia and 15th and Albion Street?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was dark and we were on a highway when my mother asked my father if he saw the thing in the sky. It was definetly a saucer shape. We pulled over by the side of the road. It was hovering next to a big builiding many stories high. It had colored lights on the bottom of it going around the craft. The craft was larger than the circumference of the building. There was a small plane flying around it. The craft made no noise. We had a CB radio in the car and each time it got close to the car the CB radio would get full of static. We watched it for 15 minutes or so and continued to drive. Not sure if we lost sight of it because we drove out of range or because it flew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was 18 years old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the three of us approached the town roads, we stopped to talk.  My Dad was in deep conversation with his friend and I was looking across the horizon.  We were at an elevated position to the neighbouring town, giving an excellent view toward the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an overcast night with heavy grey cloud, warm and dull, but still bright and clear enough to see for many miles, as we were in summer and the days were long.  All at once I could not comprehend what I was looking at.  There was a giant orange object slowly rising from the distant horizon up toward the sky.  The distance from us was about four miles and I know this because the horizon was the border of the neighbouring town which is four miles from where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was like an orange ball at the centre with hundreds of long thin orange spikes protruding from the centre outwards to form a circular shape.  To the bottom right of the object was an identical object, except it was only a quarter the size of the big one.  Both objects floated slowly and shimmered while floating up into the heavy grey clouds until they were no longer visible.  The size of the larger object would easily have been a mile in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the sighting I asked my Dad and his friend to look at these strange objects.  Both men looked to where I was pointing and turned to me and said, &#34;Where are they, we can’t see anything.&#34;  This was rather frustrating for me so I asked them to look again. There was no way they could have missed the objects, especially the giant one.  Once again they looked right in the direction and said they could see nothing.  My Dad was rather angry at me for interrupting his conversation.  I found the whole experience really strange.  I never touched drugs or alcohol and I was not hallucinating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two strange events lasted about a minute and a half.  The very clear large orange objects and the really strange fact that my Dad and his friend could not see them have always baffled me.  I had never seen those objects before and have never seen them since.  This sighting got me interested in the UFO phenomena.  I have seen several UFO’s since, because I observe the sky and practice a little amateur astronomy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two excellent written reports from the same source.

My friend, his 5 yr old son and myself were sitting on the hood of his car talking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point the 5 yr old said quote &#34;Look up&#34; &#34;Look up&#34; very persistantly. His father told the boy to shut up.This responce by his father bothered me so I told the boy &#34; ya those are stars&#34; The boy again insisted that we look up. At this point I looked not straight up but looked to the south of our location and spotted what looked like a chevron shaped object moving silently through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was larger then an airliner had sharp edges to it and the entire surface emitted a white glow. The object reminded me of a giant peice of glass. I was completely shocked at the sight of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object left I asked my friend to draw for me what he had just seen, I didnt want to influence his mind in anyway. His discription of the object was just as I had viewed it. The object I might add was on the same flight path to kirtland AFB that many planes use .<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I grew up under this flight path and spent many a summer night trying to reflect spotlights off the wings of planes as they would come in for a landing. We both became very adept at I.D.ing types of planes day or night. What we saw was not a plane or a balloon or anything else that we had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole experience was like seeing a ghost and left me very un-settled. Every time I tell this story I am met with great skeptisisum, but i know in my heart that I was fortunate enough to see something that most people will never get to see in their lifetime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The tractor stalled on the way, so we left it there in the driveway, and walked dwon to the mailbox, and upon as we were walking back to the house, noticed how bright the evening star seemed that evening.  The four of us were in our mid 20s, tow males, two females.  Upon reaching the house, one of us noticed that the evening star seemed to be getting bigger and brighter, and we all went over and leaned on the fence, and watched as it became clear that it was an object approaching from the west, in the clear twilight sky.  after about an hour it was getting quite large, and was approaching our location directly, and shortly after that it was right overhead.  All the animals were quiet, and we all felt that it was going to land.  One of our group (female) ran out towards the object, which was as large as 1/2 acre accross, and had red lights on the edges.  We tried to discourage her, but she returned without incident to our position at the fence.  It seemed to hang there for a while, and we felt as if our thoughts were being monitored, very odd.  Just as it approached right over the farmhouse, it took a turn to the south and within a couple minutes it gained speed and vanished over the southern horizon.  We were all elated and a bit frightened to go back in the house (aliens in there?), but worked up the nerve, and had no problems, and the following day, the tractor started right up.  One of our group contacted Wright Patterson AFB about it and was not called back about it, and we seldom talked about it after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was a student of Engineering  studying in Jabalpur (State MP) then and was visiting my parents during the summer break .<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this hot evening between 4 and 5 PM (it was still bright enough), I was engaged in some conversation with my mother on the roof-top of our apartment when she pointed in a direction asking in an amazed manner, &#34; What IS that?&#34;  I gazed in the indicated direction to see what I can best describe as an Orange colored cloud flying (or floating at enormous speed) at an altitude much lower than that of normal clouds. It was quite far when I first noticed it, but in a matter of less than 10 seconds, it had crossed over and disappeared on the other end. (A normal air-craft would have taken more than 3 minutes to cover that distance). There was no sound or noise of any sort associated with this flying thing and neither had it any regular shape.  Just a random cloud shape. It could have easily passed for a cloud but for it unusual dark orange color and its super-high speed.  In my opinion, there was a solid object really flying but with the cover of a randomly shaped orange cloud around it that not only masked it’s appearance but also perhaps suppressed any associated mechanical sound.  My father later informed me that many others in the neighborhood had mentioned having seen the ‘fast-moving-low-altitude, silent-orange-cloud-like-thing’.  And a report appeared in a local daily the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was riding on my bicycle, heading home in the afternoon around 5 p.m. It was sunny and hot and in that area lots of farmers field, the houses were on the other side of the street, i don&#39;t think anybody saw it but me.At the level of the power lines and beside a big tree,it seemed to rotate on itself, i lost track after the tree blocked my view.I was very close to home and i advised my mom right away, she of course didn&#39;t believe me. What scared me the most was much later, last year i believe in 1998, the shuttle was experimenting new equipment in space, and there it was, the sphere, but for the shuttle crew it was their new observation &#39;floating&#39; camera,the same thing i saw again except 22 some years later.<n>

Me and my mother saw a strange thing when i was about 5 years of age. My mother was around that time 31 years of age. We woke up in the night because of a really bright red light lighting up our bedroom. We lived three stories up (10 meters). My mother thought it was a brake light from a car. but when she and i looked out of the windows there it was. Throwing its light only into our room (so it seemed). i got really scared (5 years!) but my mother looked at it for this 5-10 minutes. she wont talk about it now so much because she cant explain it. The lights were BRIGHT red and it hoovered in total quietness. After these 5-10 minutes it flew away (still totally quiet). My mother thought she saw some smoke after it. As a tail of smoke. Well thats that. Nice to get it of my chest. This is true! i have no intension to write this much for nothing. I swear that it is true. But if it were alien or some experimental flying objekt of some militarty i dont know. I believe in alien 50 percent and military thing 50 percent.

As we were coming into the town of Greenville we all noticed what appeared to be an airplane flying across the sky from our left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft suddenly made a 90 turn in our direction.  We realized that it was following a car coming in our direction.  I immediately thought it was a police helicopter chasing a stolen car.   We all watched intently as we kept approaching the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were travelling at about 60 mph as was the car coming in the other direction.  As the car passed us we all looked out the rear window to watch what was happening.  We couldn&#39;t see anything so as I turned back around (seated in the front passenger side)  there was a bright light coming thru my window.  I immediately realized this aircraft had fully reversed and was now hovering over our vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew not even a helicopter could make such an abrupt maneuver and thought immediately it could only be a ufo.  Being a risk taking 19 year old I decided to roll down my window and check it out.  I tried to see what it was but the light was so bright I couldn&#39;t actually see the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The wind coming in my ears at 60 mph was loud but I couldn&#39;t hear an engine or helicopter propeller.  I kept yelling at my friend driving to pullover!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all jumped out of the car and looked directly above us but nothing was there.  Then, as we looked over a farmers&#39; field we saw the light of the craft just zoom off and disappear into the horizon.  I have no way to calculate the speed it was going but it almost looked like a shooting star but not quite that fast.<n>

I was about 14 years old and it was a warm summer day and I was sitting on the front porch about 1:00pm. I noticed that it seemed to get very quiet that not even the birds could be heard. I stood up and looked out and noticed a dark triangular something flying over the house. It had white flashing lights on each point and a bright, smaller red on dead center of the craft. But there did not seem to be any other openings or any other lights on the craft. It was made of a black plastic looking material. Nothing like had seen before or have seen scene, and I was a Security Police Specialist in the US Air Force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was back before cable and we still had an antenna and the thing was about 2 or 2 feet above it but there was not even the slightest sound. It seemed to be going so slow I thought that it was going to fall on top of our house. It was about 40 yards long and took forever to pass overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was gone I ran inside and ask my Mother if she seen what just went over but she said she did not. Then later that day the boy from across the street came over and he asked if we had seen it. He was behind his house watching it pass over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed that no one but us two had seen anything. We ask everyone in town and then in school the next couple of days and now one had seen it or no one had claimed to have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I was picking up rocks to hit with an old baseball bat, when I suddenly notice a shadow move right between my legs, heading north. It was the shadow of 6 perfect, unattached circles, moving at about walking pace. From my perspective, each circle on the ground was about the size of an over-sized dinner plate. This was a perfectly sunny and cloudless day, but when I looked up toward the sky to see the cause of the shadow, there was nothing. It was quite amazing to me, I remember, that I couldn&#39;t see what was causing the shadow, despite it&#39;s large dimensions. Any other craft casting a shadow that large would have been easily spotted in the sky. I followed the shadow for about 20 yards until the yard ran out and thich hedges obstructed me. My first immediate reaction was to run inside to tell my parents (since my father had a sighting in 1962, of a green cigar in the night sky over Treasure Island, FL), so I knew that he would ubderstand. My first impression was that I thought that these craft had to be cloaked in some way, maybe by turning the bottoms of the craft to match the clear blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

A very nice sunny day with only patchy cumulus clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving home on US Rt.40 near Brier Hill Pennsylvania I witnessed a fairly large saucer shaped craft just hanging about three fourths out of a cloud that was just a little bigger than the craft. The ceiling I would have estimated to be about 3 to 5 thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t exactly estimate the size but, there was a farmhouse below and the craft looked about the same size as the house about 50ft across. Given the altitude - the craft must have been a couple times the size of the house. I saw the craft for 15 seconds or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I viewed it as I traveled towards it going east to west on Rt. 40. Almost wreaked my car, ran off the road before I could stop. When I stoped and looked back up the craft was just disappearing into the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was flat black in color and was a classic flying saucer shape. Like two pie pans welded together as in the drawing enclosed. The ouside edge was sharp looking and the sun reflected off it like the paint was worn off and the metal was showing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The upper surface and the lower surface were flat with a concentric ring which was only slightly raised. If this thing was in the night sky you would not see it, beautiful design, very simple and clean. The surface was smooth and there were no visible antennas or windows showing. Although I saw the upper surface and the lower surface as it went into the cloud, I did not see any lines for hatches or doors for gear etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise comming out of the cloud and it just seemed to drift with the other clouds in the area. I watched the cloud for a few minutes and then went home in amazement. Though about going back to the area with a camera but, I couldn&#39;t be sure of which cloud contained the craft, pictures of clouds wouldn&#39;t carry much weight. I travel quite a bit and always think about this big flying saucer when we are flying through clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

As we were approching a little curve in the road there right above a small stand of trees at the edge of the field was this huge object.  I have always said that it reminded me of a large type of metal thing (long enough be hovering over and entire stand of woods)that just seemed to be pasted on the sky.  There was not a sound.  I just hung there right above the tree tops.  As, we moves toward it I could clearly see a row of light. This is how I was able to know that the craft was stationary-as the car moved around the curve I was turning and could see the lights beening out of sight as we came &#34;behind&#34; it on the back side of the curve. (there was lights there also. As I was looking behind me I noticed that the dog was staring at it too!  We drove on not saying anything at all for a few minutes and my boyfriend asked,&#34;Did you just see something back there?&#34;  I said yes. He said,&#34;what did you think you saw&#34;?   I said, &#34;you tell me what you saw first&#34;.  We had this back and forth exchange for awhile before we talked about it because neither wanted the other to think them nuts!  He did see it too.  The rest of the evening we both felt as if we were in a dream like state.  I tried to call the Mattoon air port I didn&#39;t get an answer.  The next day my boyfriend brought me the paper and there had been several sightings that night.  One in Terra Houte, Indiana, and another in Decatur I think.  Any how I do not know what it was but I am positive of what I saw.  I haven&#39;t seen anything like it since.

After watching we started to make out and in the corner of my eye I saw, 3 ufo&#39;s!  they were a white color with a bunch of colored lights outlining the bottom.  Then when my girlfriend was about to scream I told her not to they might find us.  So as we were slowly getting up we saw that the ufo&#39;s where distributing a whitish blue light like laser  beams.  So we started to crawl very swiftly. then we gto into my uncles car and stared to drive off.  Then all of the sudden our car stopped with a jerk! then i looked to my right only to see that the 3 ufo&#39;s where there only above them was a bigger ship.  It was 10 times the size!!  It looked exactly the same except the ligths on the bottom where blinking as if talking to the otehr ships.  then my girlfriend grabbed me by th e arms and took me into the a feild and we ran for our lives!!  Then she fell as if she was dead.  Then so did i.  I don&#39;t rember what happened exactly but then i rember waking up in a silver room on a table naked!!  It seemed like i was chained to the tabel then i felt i had straps on my neck writs and ankles.  Then I looked to my rigth and I saw tools that looked like a scafel a knife and twizers!  then I looked o my left to find my girlfriend surrounded by a binch of silvery whit people!!  She to was naked too! then the aliens entered my room and one of them looked at me and turned to the other one the other ine which seemed like an older one gave a hand signal to the younger one.  Then they picked up the twizers ((deleted))  I tryed to scream but i coulndn&#39;t speak!!  Then they picked up the scafel and cut of that pice of skin!! It didn&#39;t hurt!  Then they picked up the knife and ((deleted)) I found this very srange then I remeber going back to sleep.I woke up in another room only this time we weren&#39;t chained and My girlfriend stacy was next to me.  I looked at her and noticed! that ((deleted)) was a line with a very snall triangle!!  Then I ((deleted)) flab of skin that was missing my  penis had a triangl on it!! All I rember after that was waking up in a feild nakd and our clothes where nowhere to be found we both had our scars still so it couldn&#39;t have been a dream.<n>

A forested area surrounded the end of the street. I was sitting in a lawn chair watching fireworks down on the street (the neighbors yard was up on a small hill), when I noticed something coming across the sky from the east. I knew it was far too high to be a firework, and the object was getting brighter as it got closer. It was coming what I perceived as slowly, so at first I thought it was some kind of air plane.  I was just surprised at how bright it was getting and close to be a small plane, since it was too close to be a commercial jet.  I don&#39;t really remember much sound either, no engine sounds for sure.  When it finally reached us, I saw it was a circular craft.  It hovered right above the poplar trees at the end of the street where we were all gathered!   Amazing, I was really amazed since my father watched Star Trek and being so young I was thinking it was something from the show....I could see the bottom of it, it hovered there with a very quiet sound, a quiet humming but not like any engine I had ever heard(boat,plane,car,tractor, ect).  It had different color lights on the edges on the bottom.  The lights circled around the perimeter of the bottom at equal distances. It hovered there for at least 15 minutes that I can remember.  It was close.  I&#39;m not good at estimating size, but I have a Ford F250 now, and you could fit three of them in the diameter of this craft easily.  The most amazing thing was its departure.  This is when reality hit me that this was not something from TV, even though I was only 6 or 7 years old.  It started to ascend upward, somewhat slowly, but then suddenly it just shot extremely fast straight up above the earth, and became just visible like a small star within just a few seconds, and then I totally lost view of it.  I have never seen or heard of any mechanical thing moving this fast in my life ever since I saw that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Occupants of van stepped out next to roadway and marveled at the speed of the  object.  It traversed the  horizon at incredible speeds.  It also descended in the sky and then shot back up again.  It appeared as a point of light very high and made no noise nor did it smoke or emit anything.  The event lasted a while (we watched for about 12 minutes) and then we left with the object still racing across the sky.  It was daylight and the object light was bright enough to be seen at high altitude.  The structure of the object could not be ascertained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Amazingly the other van riders seemed to drop the subject of the sighting within hours and it was not talked about again.

I have been looking around off and on to see if anyone else did too. I am glad to have found this site. Be that as i may… Here it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family vacationed at Hampton Beach N.H. pretty much every year during 4th of July week to watch/partake in the city funded fireworks display. This year was kind of special to me because &amp;quot;The Commodores&amp;quot; were playing at the boardwalk that year. As luck would have it, I had the opportunity to watch them perform some of their tunes despite the fact that the venue was a 21 plus, ticket in hand establishment. I sneaked in and watched until they kicked me out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night that I saw this object…. I remember it was a few days before the fourth at around 8 pm to 9 pm. A typical thing we would do after dinner and boardwalk arcade fun is walked the long stretch of beach. With shoes in hand walking a southerly direction on the cold wet sand,  the object in question seemed to kind of appear just a few hundred feet out and a few hundred feet over the ocean. As it moved in the same direction as us its velocity was maybe three or four times the pace we kept. It seemed to effortlessly float along past us. It was disc shaped and very dark on the bottom like it was devoid or less than there if that makes any sense. It had lights that were rotating around it in a clockwise direction at a pace that seemed to match its forward velocity. Well not like a bunch of lights. More like one wide light that can only be described like a windshield wiper that leaves a dissipating light trail behind it as it moves forward. I was confused by this point. I! clearly remember questioning what I was seeing and my older siblings dismissing it as a balloon or a helicopter or a blimp or a blah blah blah. I also clearly remember saying that it can&#39;t be any of that because there was no noise coming from it; Why cant we hear it? Where are the engines? even blimps have engines!! If there is one thing that makes me believe that I saw what I think I saw is the lack of noise it made. Even to this day I get freaked out thinking about how it made absolutely no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anonymous<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Well 1 of the nights about 8:30-9:00PM &#34;because it just about dark&#34; when my sister and I seen a group of people looking and pointing up in the air taking excitedly so went over there we look up&#34;it was just over the tree line, like 20 of the trees at about the 10 oclock posision beybe 1000 feet in front of us it was a round shape gray in color what I could see looked gray in color just sitting up there then there was some flashes I guess something like a camera flash I can only guess at the sizeof because I think anything in the sky is hard to jugde the size,but itwasmaybe like size of a olimpic size pool,Then slowly moved on forward and out of our sights.

I could never determine what caused me to do this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed a saucer shaped object hovering stationary over what would be our neighbors back yard.  It was aprox.  40&#39; off the ground and 30 yards from my position and did not move or emit any sound.  I would estimate it&#39;s size as 35&#39; diameter and 8&#39; in height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;top&#34; had a smaller diameter of perhaps 10&#39; and there was a bank of multicolor lights slightly above where the diameter decreased.

After everyone in my family was asleep, I woke up and got out of bed, left our first floor apartment, through the front door, and entered my neighbors apartment, across the hall.  Their door was unlocked, as was normal in the seventies.  I walked over to their balcony door, opened it and stood there for a moment, just staring outside.  There was an empty lot between the apartment I was in and the next row of homes, which spanned approximately 100 meters.  It wasn&#39;t long before the UFO appeared over the lot, traveling  perpendicularly to my position, just above the rooftops, at about 10 kilometers per hour.  It stopped directly across from me for about 1 minute and then resumed its movement, until I was unable to see it an longer.  It had soft,  multicolored lights rotating around it&#39;s center, blinking in unison. I believe it was metallic and about the size of a car.  I do not remember hearing anything stra! nge or out of the ordinary while watching the UFO.  After it left, I closed the balcony door, and returned to my apartment, without waking my parents.  I can still remember the experience vividly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
