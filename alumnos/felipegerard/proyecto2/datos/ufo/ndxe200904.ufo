It passed by really quickly and made a noise sort of like a litesaber from starwars would. I saw it a couple of times afterward from my window the same week.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We went to the higher deck in our apartment complex and looked up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right then we saw a really fast and quiet object flying through the  sky.  It had four beams coming off each light, two sets of three lights in a triangle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went to find where the sound was coming from to see if they were related and discovered it was blowoff from Simpson Craft Mill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all three are just flabbergasted about the incident and had to report it somewhere.<n>

At 9:35 PM I spotted a bright light in sky near the  western horizon (to my left).  I watched as the light got brighter and bigger. It was travelling due East.  I slowed my car to try to intercept the crossing of I-5.  As it got closer I notice there were three bright lights within a triangular craft.  I parked my car off the edge of the freeway as I felt I was directly in the path.  It slowly passed directly over my vehicle and myself. I estimate it was about 1000 ft. (I served 8 years in the 82nd Airborne with over 200 parachute jumps.  We jumped from 1000 feet so I know estimate the craft at the same height).  It was large, black, tringular with rounded corners.  It had extremely bright headlights.  It was flat, with several small white lights where jet engines might be located.  It crossed the freeway and headed due west. No noise what so ever.  I had a very clear unubstructed view.  There is no lights, houses, buildings or trees on that section of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be 6 to 15 feet in length and was brown in color. It passed in a North to South direction and was gone in a a second.Because of the house blocking my view I could not follow it . It was traveling at a great speed.  After it was gone my mind tried to process what it was,  My first impulse was to identify it as a known object and failing this I decided to make a report.<n>

I guess my first question is, has anyone reported something odd in the sky over the NW Indiana today (4/30/09).   I ask this because myself and another person witnessed a strange object moving very slowly beneath the heavy cloud cover.   The object was dark color and very large.  I first thought the object was a low flying jet.  Then I realized it was moving way to slow.    As we watched this thing we kept asking each other what we thought it was.  We vocally passed ideas to each other that it was a helicopter, Balloon, Blimp but the shape was all wrong for any of these aircraft. We couldn’t figure out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movement was SLOW, very slow.  Had it been a big jetliner it would have fallen out of the sky, it was moving that slow.   The shape was sort of round but more elongated or cigar shaped and the color was dark greyish black.  There was no sound and we saw no lights of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was well below the very heavy cloud cover and it was extremely easy to see as it passed behind the tall leafless trees in the distance.  As for the distance from it to where we were was about 400-800 yards.  I know this sounds like it was pretty far away but the size of this thing was quite large.  Someone else had to see it.    I kept comparing it to the Semi Trucks traveling below it and how much bigger it was and wonder what the hell it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving in an easterly to south easterly direction.    After about 3 to 4 mins of watching it, it stopped and looked as if it was turning (North) and we thought is was going to come toward us.  But it immediately zipped way at a much faster speed due south and out of our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea of what this object was and it has left me wondering about we saw.      One thing we both kept saying to each other was that the outer shape was obscured or had a fuzzy appearance.   What I mean by this, is for some reason we couldn’t make out a clear outline of the object.    It was like when you look at the road on a hot day and you see the heat waves coming of the road creating a watery appearance.    You could see it but it was very hard to focus on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me know if anyone has seen anything like this or if anyone has reported seeing this strange object over northwest Indiana today on April 30th 2009 at approximately 3:00 Pm or a little afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time<n>

Super quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Was in my backyard playing with a laser pointer with my dog from my hottub and he was chasing it around.  Once in a while I would shine my laser up to the heavens and the moon wondering if anyone out there might be able to see it. I had turned it off and laid back in the water when I sensed something I was already looking up at the stars and a couple of planes that were in the area. They were kind of crisscrossing across the sky, anyway what I sensed or heard was a kind of  a whispering sound like the sound of a small fan or something like that kind of quiet but fright above me then I saw it, it was a craft and it went right over me from south to north it was v shaped kind of like the stealth with three dim lights under each side of the chevron it disappeared from my view right away and I know those planes couldn&#39;t see it. I think they were looking for the sourse of my laser pointer it was weird and I believe they are out there but I never saw anything like this. It was black or real dark grey and very stealth. I was by myself but I swear on my Parents grave I saw it. I&#39;m kind of wondering if I shouldn&#39;t point my laser up the the sky at night anymore.<n>

I looked up and saw it out over Lake Champlain.   It was very bright, orange/reddish (the color of a flame), a little bigger than a star, and was moving slowly.  First it went north, and then it turned south.  It was at about a 40 degree angle from my viewpoint.   It appeared to &#34;flicker&#34; and also fluctuated in intensity (sometimes dimmer and sometimes brighter).  I called my friend who lives about a mile or so away, and she went outside and could see it as well.   It did not have blinking lights or white &#34;headlight&#34; type lights and thus did not resemble a plane (in fact, there was a plane near it in the sky for comparison, but it was impossible to tell how far away the plane or the object were from myself and/or from each other).  Eventually the object moved south and I could no longer see it because the trees in the yard were blocking my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It is possible that it was a meteor, but it’s angle and trajectory were wrong.  Also it had no tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This took place around 8:45 to 9:00 pm.<n>

It appeared similar to a tracer bullet from WW2 war footage.  It moved across the sky directly overhead and terminated to the north.  It sort of &#34;hung in the air&#34; for approximately 3-4 seconds.  As it approached the Catalina Mountains to the north the object burst into an orange flame for the last ½ second of flight before disappearing behind the mountains.  This occurred in Tucson, AZ while I was driving due east and looking approx. or within a few degrees of due north.  Object appeared to be falling from the sky, but may have been traveling across the sky.<n>

It didnt sound like a plane or anything I have heard before.  We saw for flashes of light moving side by side.  They moved faster then anything I have ever seen but we could see them flying off in to the distance.<n>

At first the lights were stationary and I believed them to be towers of some sort because of the lights perfectly spaced apart from each other and because of there close proximity to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued down the highway at the posted speed limit until I noticed the lights beginning to move south crossing over the highway in front of me at about half of a miles distance from my location.  I also noticed a darkness between the two lights as it continued to cross the highway as if there was a mass between the two.  I immediately followed it south onto Guinns Mill Rd then Scotland County Line Rd and continued pursuing it at high speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Going through curves and valleys I kept track of the object at sporadic moments until I lost complete sight of it.  As I came to highway 381 I continued south and once again saw the two lights spaced in the sky heading south.  Once I reached the intersection of highway 381 and 79 I proceeded east on X-Way Rd until I could no longer see the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had seen them before I went into the store, but didn&#39;t pay that much attention, thinking they were two planes together, because it was at a distance to where I was I only glanced that way and noticed it but went into the store as I was in a hurry and on the phone at the same time. When I came out of the store around 5 minutes later, the 3 amber lights were still there, hovering, not moving since I had gone in the store, in the same exact spot and they looked like they were twinkling. there were 3 distinctive lights. What I noticed was it seem way too large to be a plane on approach to SKY HARBOR {my son and I watch planes on approach all the time} when I was watching it intensely a plane was coming from the west and dwarfed in size to these three lights. If I had to estimate the size I would say 3-4 Jet plane size wise at least. Way to big to be a regular craft. Plus they were AMBER in color, not like any normal craft lights. It was not a helicopter as it was too far to be that big. And they run with white, green and red lights. As I was watching these 3 lights I called my son on the phone to try and see it, but he was in an area that the tree lines near our house blocked the view but because I was at the field at 51st and Olive I could see clearly the area it was hovering at. I stood there for 3-4 minutes watching then I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes as the lights started to twinkle brighter then dim then the center light went out first, then the one on the right, then the one on the left. It was not a plane or helicopter, nor was it a craft I have seen at any airshow I have been to in the last 30 years. The lights were in a line next to each other but what was weird is that it was parallel, or slightly above the nearby south mountain lights but not too far above the horizon. about .5 - 10 degrees abov! e the gr ound but more over the estrella mountains side of the southland.  It was not like flares I have seen in the past, it was not like blimps or balloons we see here often in Arizona, it was 3 Amber lights close together but separate.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No sound/wind<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking the puppy outside for his evening walk before-bedtime at 10:35 PM and I was looking into the starry night sky while he sniffed around.  The clouds had not as yet moved in for the evening ahead of the storm front and the sky was clear and very still.  In the area of the sky above my head and slightly West by South-West I saw what I first thought was a falling star, but it was moving slower than a falling star and not in an arc,and had no tail like a comet, but rather moved  at a 50 degree angle across the sky--more like a satellite or swift moving plane, but with one bright light source.  It then flashed brightly once, continued move on its 50 degree angle, flashed brightly a second time and continued to move on the same angle.  Then it burst into the brightest white light that I have ever seen and bathed me and the surrounding landscape in a bright white apot-light (I cannot convey to you how bright this was!  Like a Halogen spot or an MR16 or a Mercury vapor spotlight)  I was looking upwards and I felt like my face and arms were stark against my shadow on the ground-brighter in contrast than anything I have ever experienced, and the surrounding landscape was lime-greener with the illumination than can be immagined.  Time seemed suspended for a moment and then the light was extinguished and the afterimage of the light faded like a halogen spot fades after it is turned off and the glow of it remains for a moment.  Then all was dark again. The puppy was coward down and the horses on the hillside began to stampede around the pasture in confusion.  I stood there waiting and trying to listen and evaluate the experience:  I had heard absolutely no sound---no airplane or helecopter, no missle whine, no explosion, no sound of any implosion with the ground.  The night had remained calm and still throughout the event.  I have only a vague sense of the scope of the illuminated area since I was staring up at it.  I can only say that the surrounding hills of the hollow were black and my ! immediat e area was illuminated:  perhaps 1 to 3 acres.  I am curious to find out if anyone else saw this event and has an explanation.  Was it a meteor, but I have never heard of them flashing several times and then bathing-light so this seems unlikely to me?!   After about 8-10 more minutes, 2 airplanes flew from the north-eastern horizon across toward the area where the event had taken place and I could distinctly hear those planes which confirmed to me that indeed the even had been totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was near 9:30pm on Monday, April 27th of &#39;09. I was alone and traveling along US 25 heading toward I-26 and had crossed the state line not long before this sighting. I noticed the craft ahead of me; it caught my attention because of the unusual lights, how low it was and how close it was to the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer to it, I became sure that this wasn&#39;t any type of standard aircraft I&#39;d ever seen before. It was round/ball-shaped with two red lights on either side, center, and a row of at least 3 rectangular light panels on the bottom half which were strobing slowly in vertical sequence, from the top one down. It was about the size of the cab section of an 18-wheel truck. I estimate it was approximately 50 feet in the air, on the right side and just slightly over the road. It did not move at all, and as far as I could tell, it remained stationary the entire time I had visual contact with it. I had the radio playing and did not have the presence of mind to turn it off or down, so I am unaware if the craft made any type of noise. I did briefly consider stopping to try and take a picture, but the only thing I had with me was an older cell phone which previous experience taught me did not take decent pictures at night at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed my vehicle quite a bit as I approached in order to get a better look at it, being both fascinated but understandably a little shaken, too. In my rearview mirror, I previously had noted that another car was coming up behind me. I was driving quite slowly, so with that in mind, I sped up slightly to prevent annoying the other driver and finally drove past the craft, which still never moved from its position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once past it, I looked in my mirror again and was dismayed to see that the car I&#39;d seen behind me was no longer there--I&#39;m not sure if the other driver had seen what I was seeing and pulled off or had exited the road somewhere--but I became immediately aware that I was now totally alone on the road, with no cars whatsoever in sight in either direction. This finished unnerving me and while I no longer saw the craft, I suddenly felt the need to at least be within sight of other cars/people, so I accelerated to appx 70-75 mph and stayed at that speed until I finally caught up to more cars about five minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was my first encounter of this nature. I came to this website to see if there were any other sightings in that area on that night and chose to report what I&#39;d seen since I found nothing else. I sincerely hope it will be of use.<n>

Skeptical at best, and a little annoyed because it was cold, I went down to our driveway where she was standing beside our truck, which was still running. She pointed out a tiny light quite a distance off, and after watching it for a minute or two and seeing it was moving too slowly for a plane, I began taping it on my cell. The phone didn’t have a very good camera, and couldn’t zoom in enough to record the light, but it caught what was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then another light appeared, and my mom cut the truck off and called my dad. Both lights were moving directly toward each other, and when they crossed paths, they seemed to twitch and spin around one another and then fade out. That was about when I couldn’t record anymore because my annoying little phone ran out of storage space. Before long, another light appeared, and then another, from different directions than the first two, (by now my dad was outside with us in his underwear muttering about how they were just planes) and they did the exact same thing as the first: meeting up, spinning around each other, and fading out not long after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By definition, they were UFOs. Past that I don’t know what they were. But planes fly over our house pretty frequently, and they don’t spin around each other or fade out. These lights were white at first, but would change briefly to red or orange, like a star. They were far away and high up, I can’t say how far though. Both my parents were skeptical- my dad’s not a big believer in UFO’s and such, and my mom basically doesn’t care. But both of them admitted these lights were pretty weird.<n>

They did not leave any afterglo as they silently slid across the sky. All of the objects seen traveled in the same direction heading north.  They traveled in the same straight path and elevation.  During the time we observed them, the sky was clear of cloud cover and we did see other planes flying at higher elevations in relation to the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, we saw two such objects.  Within minutes after them, we observed a formation of seven.

It was an un-seasonably hot sunny day and the sky was a deep blue with a few sparse, wispy white clouds. I looked to my left, out the driver side window and saw a very distinct symmetrical, shiny, silvery metallic object hovering motionlessly in the western sky. My first thought was that maybe it was a helicopter because it was just hovering there and not moving, although its perfect symmetry and chrome-like appearance did not make that seem likely. The only way I could describe it would be that it was shaped like an acorn or upside down bell with the wider end up. I looked later on the internet for photos of “acorn shaped UFO’s” and was surprised to find that they were not that uncommon. The only difference was that the pictures that I found showed the object inverted, with the wider end facing down. I continued to watch the object for about 15 or 20 seconds and then to my amazement, it just faded away into the blue sky over the course of 4 or 5 seconds. That’s when I was convinced that I had seen a UFO. Weather balloons or helicopters don’t just disappear right before your eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

4/26/09 22:15|Bellevue|WA|Cigar|1 min|While filming the crescent moon, I noticed a cigar shaped shadow about 1/4 of the way down creep up and out of sight.|5/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69833.html|32|ndxe200904| While filming the crescent moon, I noticed a cigar shaped shadow about 1/4 of the way down creep up and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday as I was filming non-passenger planes that seemed to be swarming about. I noticed the crescent moon, and filmed it for about 20 seconds, commenting on its beauty. Then a plane went by and I followed it with my camcorder. About three minutes later I wanted to get a better look at the moon, so I focused on it a second time, from the exact location. This time the crescent had a shadow about a 1/4 the way down from the right of the top, and it was moving! This shadow covered the entire area of the crescent, as if someone had taken a magic marker and drew a line through that section. For a second I thought maybe I didn&#39;t have a clear view, and that there was a nearby tree or something that was causing the shadow, so I pulled the camcorder away and verified that I had a clear view with no impediments. In those few seconds, the shadow had drifted upwards, and was moving quickly. I filmed it advancing until it was out of sight-- it was the exact color as the space around it, so I&#39;m not sure if the shadow was coming from below Earth and causing it, or the object was moving in front of the moon. Either way, it had to have been pretty large to cover that much of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within seconds of the shadow disappearing, I immediately noticed an unusually large number of aircraft around the moon, moving west to east, as if they were observing something. In ten minutes, I saw seven planes all on the right side of the moon where I had seen the cigar shaped shadow, and filmed two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the sky had been relatively clear, when I went outside 40 minutes later, there was total cloud cover. I recall that at 21:00 I had filmed a couple planes that were emitting chemtrails, that I could barely make out due to the waning light. These trails were expanding into clouds. I filmed until 22:30, when I ran out of tape. Then at 23:00 I went outside with a new tape, and there was total cloud cover. For the next few hours I proceeded to listen to jets overhead until I fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to ad that the phenomena of planes making chem-trails which expand into total cloud cover had become so commonplace I don&#39;t bother filming it any longer. These planes are very well camoflauged, but they&#39;re noisy. They are two types but they follow the general description of having two engines, but the trail is emitted from the tail of the plane. It looks almost curly cue as it billows out of the end. In my opinion, some of these planes are spraying for moths and other perceived nuisance insects, and the other ones that are more camoflauged are producing convenient cloud cover for the passage of military planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I type this I am listening to the constant hum of jet engines, and there is total cloud cover in Bellevue this morning. Last week Monday it was clear and sunny at this time of the day, and apart from a passenger jet ever 7-10 minutes or so, there was not this activity.<n>

After about two minutes or so it appeared to turn faster than a normal aircraft in a northwest direction.  The lights had no flashing, last I knew there should be flashing lights on known aircraft’s.  It lasted about four or five minutes then disappeared.  A passenger in the vehicle saw it as well, less baffled than I, she was the one who noticed the change in direction and confirmed to me that no lights were flashing and it turned faster than normal.  Both are amazed at what was seen and feel a little confused.  Definitely not any stars or a normal plane.<n>

Apart from the observed airplane activity, a genuine UFO sighting occurred and was videotaped, and that is the purpose of this report and video submission.  The NUFORC has made it very clear to me that it views the notion of &#34;chemtrails&#34; as a complete hoax.  I fully accept that view, but am determined to report the UFO sighting anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the wake of the airplane activity (whatever its nature), I shot a 26 second clip of the sky, about 14 seconds of which depict what appears to be an orb-like shiny object.  It becomes visible at about 8 seconds into the video and shines or reflects light to varying degrees until the video ends at 26 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MY BACKGROUND:  WITH UFO&#39;S:  My prior UFO sighting reported on this site occurred on 2/6/97 in Mesa, Arizona.  On that occasion I had a spectacular, close-up, detailed sighting of a triangular craft.  A follow up report gave added detail (map) of the location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OTHER:  I am a former advertising executive turned high school teacher and coach.  I hold degrees in education, marketing and political science.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and found him to be sincere and serious-minded.  We disagreed with him regarding the issue of &#34;chemtrails.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have looked at the video he provided, and we cannot determine what the object is, photographed through thin cloud layer.  However, we have no reason, at this time, to conclude that the object was a genuine UFO.  PD))<n>

I was heading eastbound towards Kingman, Az.  . I was approximately one mile West of Landon Drive.

The coloration of the falling star was a bright greenish color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The falling star appeared to pass behind the mountain range from my point of view. Approximately one or two seconds later, I observed a large flash that illuminated the eastern horizon behind the mountains for less than a second. The flash was similar to heat lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lead me to believe that the object actually struck the ground.  Or, can falling meteorites cause lightning bursts?

It was such a bright green and I&#39;m talking bright bright green  with a ring of red around it.  Then it passed behind the mtns and we saw a huge flash (explosion) and it was gone.  I couldnt believe my eyes and neither could my boyfriend.  We heard no noise however when it crashed...all we saw was a huge flash of red and orange which led us to believe that whatever it was crashed into the earth.  It was incredibly amazing and I would love to find out more information as to where the crash site would be because if it was in the gorge it would be difficult to locate, but I am willing to investigate it.<n>

The object had very faint, dimmed circles of gray light on both sides of the triangle towards the sharp angle. There were 5 circle on each side. The object was stealth like.

We reported it to 911. My neighbor who used to work for the military thought suggested some sort of reconnaisance mission. She is in her 40&#39;s and I am in my mid-50&#39;s.

Anyway, i saw this thing fly by. it moved in a straight line and was going very swiftly though the air. it was about the size of a city bus, long and narrow. i could not make out to much other detail, but the street lights did refect off the underside. it was traveling from north to south. it made no sound and there were no flashing lights on the craft. This is the second time in past few months that i have seen something strange in the skies above palm springs. the last time, i saw 4 round flying discs. they flew over head, no lights, no sounds, heading north to south, and it was obvious each craft was being independly  piloted by the way they were moving through the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was tilted to my right as it flew above me and looked like an antenna for a cellular tower leading down to a spherical &#34;traditional&#34; saucer shape, only from the tip of the antenna(lights equipped), there were what appeared to be cables attatched at various points of the saucer, and then from(as though pierced by the antenna) the saucer to the tail end.

4/24/09 20:00|Wading River|NY|Formation|About 2 mins|Not a UFO, but very strange...|5/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69813.html|52|ndxe200904| Not a UFO, but very strange...<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 8 pm last night, while grilling on my back deck, I noticed four airplanes flying due north in a straight line, directly over my house, at an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 feet. These were large commercial jets, likely 737s or larger, and from my vantage point were separated by no more than one mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we live smack-dab in the middle of a very busy air-traffic corridor, we never see commercial planes traveling this due-north trajectory (instead, most commercial jets pass over us at a lower altitude, heading west on final approach to MacArthur or Kennedy airports). And these planes were VERY close together -- as I said, no more than a mile between the first and fourth in the line, and probably less than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In fact, the third and fourth planes almost seemed to be jockeying for position, racing extremely close to each other before falling into line. Worthy of note: All four appeared to have their anti-collision lights on full and were very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose my eyes could have deceived me; this could have been a military formation heading north toward Connecticut, or perhaps the planes were not as close together as they appeared. But I&#39;ve lived near major airports my entire life, and I believe I can identify commercial airliners; I also believe they were traveling at the same approximate altitude, and most certainly the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 6-year-old son also witnessed the jet formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a triangular UFO was reported last month in Riverhead, which is our town here on Long Island (Wading River is our hamlet). I doubt that report was related to this event, and these planes did not appear otherworldly in any sense. But it was very, very strange to see commercial jets flying like this, and I thought it was worthy of mention.<n>

As we turned off the highway, I noticed something shiny in he sky.  It wasn&#39;t moving, just hovering in the air, and this is what perked my interest.  It was definitely not a plane as it was not moving.  I&#39;m unable in my knowledge to come up with a rational explanation.  My sister, who was driving, noticed it when I pointed it out, but as she was driving, she had only caught a few brief glimpses of it.  My other sister was as oblivious to it.  As background, we make fun of her for never being able to spot or find anything.  As we were turning off the highway, the object went out of view due to a hill obstructing our quickly changing view.  The object was shiny, glistening high in the sky.  I&#39;m not familiar with the stratosphere or troposphere and find it difficult to describe it&#39;s height above ground.  It was high, but within what I would guess is the troposphere.  It was farther in distance from us, across terrain, compared to it&#39;s distance above the ground.  Much farther.  The shape wasn&#39;t very definitive in form--the closest thing I can compare it to being a polished stone.  I hope that I&#39;ve included enough information and hope that I&#39;m not wasting your time by sending this.

It is slightly overcast and thought at first it was the clouds making the stars look like they were moving. I noticed the craft was moving with a cloud , or what looked like a faint cloud.  So I placed the binoculars on top of my childs swing set and sat on the slide, as not to touch them and cause a false sighting. To my surprise the craft was moving and I had to keep turning to follow the it. It flew directly under the big dipper and blocked out many stars as it passed in front of  them. I eventually lost sight of it in the Northeast sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> each tip of the ship had a faint white light on it. The lights were not of a normal plane of any kind that I have seen, they looked like a very faint stars. Could not be seen with naked eye...<n>

I got to the top of the hill to see 3 large lights hovering very low above a farm in a large triangular pattern.  The object was moving at a fast speed but I still was able to follow it for about 3 minutes.  It was flying broad end first, rather than the point.  And it appeared to be flying at an angle.  After following it I turned and it had passed just over some trees and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought maybe somone had broken into the house, it was a wierd feeling. then there was a slow rumbling sound, not uncommon living in kent which is somewhat near the airport. having seen and reported a previous sighting I jumped out of bed and looked out my window. I jokingly thought to myself &#34;I wonder what my response to seeing this thing again would be...&#34; and then yelled a profanity as a orange blob of light- obscured by the overcast sky- shot over my neighborhood with a rumble like that of a commercial plane. I sat dumfounded for about 20 minutes staring in the direction it had gone. then Iwent downstairs and got my digital camera and set it to record video, and waited perched in my window sill intill the sun started to come up.  I was so sure the first sighting I reported had to be ball lightning as i dont believe in aliens. but the probability of somone seeing somthing as impossibly rare as ball lightning twice in a 6 month period seems unlikely. so my only guess is it has to be boeing. theyre right up the street, and next gen things are always shockingly strange before they are made public. but ive got my camera ready now. one other thing, it was distinctly orange, as was the first one I saw, but the first one was way faster, and completely silent, this one rumbled the house like a jet would, but it was only a few hundred feet up, and I think getting buzzed by say a military jet would have been louder.<n>

We were on Interstate 89 heading south just past Exit 14 when I first noticed two bright lights in the sky.  I&#39;ve sat on the tarmack at O&#39;Hare airport enough to know what planes look like when they&#39;re &#34;stacked up&#34; waiting to land at night and have their &#34;landing lights&#34; on.  That&#39;s what I thought I was seeing.  After driving a few miles I could see a plane that was flying very low, coming in for a landing.  This was on the left side of the Interstate near the Williston exit, #12.  Looking to the right I then saw the lights, which I again thought were planes in line to land...but now there were three of the bright lights.  The two on the left were closer together than the one that was farthest to the right.  As we drove a bit further down the road either trees or hills blocked the view of that part of the sky.  I commented to my friend that it seemed very odd that Burlington airport would have 3 planes waiting to land...ever, let alone at that time of night.  He said he thought the lights were too close together to have been planes.  A mile or two down the road, the Interstate curves to the right as it goes down a hill...about 2 miles before the Richmond exit.  I figured that we would have a good view of the &#34;same&#34; sky when we got there and then we&#39;d have another chance to look at the lights.  However, we never saw the lights again.  The night sky was very dark, no moon...and no clouds.  I believe that, if the lights had been planes, we would have seen them again as they came in to land.  But we never saw or heard a plane landing (after the one we saw landing as we drove past the Williston exit.)  The lights appeared to be a almost an orange color, but a very yellow-white orange.  Size-wise, the lights appeared bigger than any star or planet I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky.  I can&#39;t say that I saw the lights moving at all, except for seeing 3 lights after earlier having seen 2.  I am reminded of looking a! t Jupite r with the naked eye...but about 4 times larger in apparent size and a corresponding increase in brightness.  The more I replay it in my mind the more I am reminded of how the planes looked at O&#39;Hare airport at night while they are in line waiting to land.  (They also don&#39;t appear to move when still far away in the sky because they are, in essence, heading directly at you.)  It was the strangest thing I&#39;ve seen in the sky in a long, long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

For awhile there were two large cigar shaped objects in the sky with all this dogfight action from tiny white globe objects or ships.  Sometimes the white globes seem to emanate out and spiral from the cigar shaped objects.  This sighting may last for hours.

I did not make an official report through MUFON at the time of this sighting I was being called daily by the producers of a UFO related T.V. series I was out and out asked to lie of film and say that I had witnessed a UFO land in a field and create the circle I&#39;d found I at that point lost faith in objective investigations into UFO related sightings at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve since witnessed at least 40 other events on and off since this sighting but nothing as close as this event,it was only after I had walk around my circle here that I noticed air traffic again it was almost as if it was planned to be this way as I saw no jets when this object was making its way over my head and off to the west my only question is with it being a moon lit night how did this thing go un-noticed because this was not a small object?<n>

It was dark out and the sky was clear. I could see the constellation of Orion clearly. In fact the event occurred in close proximity to my view of Orion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were just closing the front door of our house from the inside when my brother called me outside. He said look up there – he pointed to the sky above the area of the Woodbine shopping centre. My brother exclaimed that there were two objects in the sky. I said they must be planes ‘cause we live only minutes from the airport. I saw the two lights, one that I am certain was an airplane cause of the flashing light pattern and the relative size of the lights. The object of concern was a very large yellow light and was shaped like a star in the sky (basically round). This yellow object did not flash or blink like an airplane nor did it grow or shrink in size. It just stayed in the same spot for approximately 60 seconds, then moves to one side very quickly and disappeared. When I first saw it (and my brother too) an airplane had been in the same airspace as the yellow orb light thing. The airplane seemed to have come from behind the light (UFO?) and broke away hard from the shared airspace and the plane continued towards the airport and then out of sight. I have lived by the airport all my life (33 years) and I see airplanes every three minutes (I live 2 minutes from the airport). Oh, as I am writing this I can remember the absence of noise. I could only hear the faint hum of the highway off in the distance. Overall, I must say that the yellow orb (UFO?) is not like any aircraft I’ve ever seen. My brother (older than me) was slightly shaken by the unusual sight too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your attention to my observation report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> C.M.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had a charcoal black color to it sorte like the color of a stealth fighter jet.  It may have been 30 to 40 feet wide in all directions.  It was diamond shape but it was more a Square shape.  It flew almost parallel with the road I was on .<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came right over top my car! I got out of my car and watched it make a banking turn while it almost came to a stop. this was rt 9 (edwin miller blvd) rd in Martinsburg WV.  It flew right over top of arbys . Then it flew southeast for a while till it went out of view.<n>

The lights was very bright and not moving at all. After a minute, or so standing there looking at the lights, a third light appeared and formed a triangle with the three lights.  At this time the lights still was not moving and no sounds was heard from these lights to indicate an aircraft. About 30 seconds later, one light disappeared, then the second one, then the third one.  We stood there for a moment then one light reappeared and was not moving.  Suddenly another light emerged out of the right side of the light and moved to the right away from it then started slowly dropping down to the earth behind some trees down the road and set there for about two minutes.  As we was watching the light behind the trees, we looked up and seen the light in the sky disappear.  After another minute, or so the light behind the trees also disappeared.<n>

Thursday, April 23, 2009 at 9:05 p.m. central time, a UFO flew over my home in Lake Charles, Louisiana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving down Ryan Street heading home, and we turned left by Blockbuster Video Store when I noticed the white lamb shaped cloud that had what appeared to be a genie lamp on its rear end with smoke coming from the lamp.  My husband said that the cloud looked like an elephant to him, and he tried to point out the trunk.  We giggled, and then arrived at our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was busy getting things out of the van when my husband shouted out, &#34;Hey, - come see what - found!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking to myself that I was about to look at another Gecko or some creepy crawly thing I walked over to them.  They were both staring at the sky, and I looked up and saw flashing colored lights floating way up in the sky in slow motion heading south while moving upward toward the doom of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Baffled I asked, &#34;Is that a plane?&#34;   My husband said that there was no way it could be a plane, because planes do not move like that.  He said that - noticed it first, and he said,  &#34;Look Daddy at the stars moving across the sky!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to make out the image as triangular with a glowing sphere shield around the base.  It had colored flashing lights that were blue, yellow, and red making the perfect points for a triangle.  I confirmed what I was seeing with my husband, and he said that he saw the same shape I did.  The object was way higher than a plane would normally fly, and it was moving so as if they wanted us to see them.  I waved and said, &#34;Hello, my friends.&#34;  My husband pointed at -, and told me to be quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all just watched in awe, and then it speeded up at an impossible speed, and from no where the sky filled with clouds again hiding the object.  My four year old said, &#34;See momma, it was the aliens, because I told you they are always up above the clouds.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally well-spoken.  She sounded quite sober-minded and sincere, and we suspect that her report of their sighting is quite accurate.  PD))<n>

A few seconds later my wife and I were looking to see the jets and saw 2 bright orange circular lights flash on then off, then one on then off slowly, then the other on, then off slowly. We watched to see if we could see what it was and quite a ways to the left saw another orange light, same type, turn on then slowly off, then next to it another on, then slowly off, then again, and one more time, then they were gone. The second time there were 4 in a row. We then saw what appeared to be the jets circling as if the were searching for  the lights. Two or three jets appeared to be circling in the distance above the northern mountains of the las vegas valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My seven year old was riding with me when he pointed to a tall water tower that he thought was interesting to our left (Looking East).  The sun was just setting off in West.  My son looked in another direction and I happened to glance at the tower which was inside the states prison campus.  I noticed just above it in the sky near the tower and there were two shiny silver objects like what you see on TV (saucer shaped) shiny silver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was planes because TF Green is nearby, but then I looked back at the road (because I was driving) for a second.  I turned back to my left (looking South Eastward) and the the two objects which were diagonal from each other jolted upward just a bit and shrunk out of sight vanishing into the blue sky.  It was a clear section of the sky too.  So there was really no clouds to hide behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They jolted upwards and vanished.  I watched this with my own two eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t buy into much of this UFO nonsense, but after witnessing this bizarre account, I have changed my position on the matter.<n>

While outside I noticed 3 super stallion military helicopters fly over heading east.  After the helicopters left my field of sight I noticed a small light slowly moving north.  It appeared to be a shiny metallic and was reflecting the sunlight off of it.  As I watched the object it suddenly stopped.  After sitting still in the sky for approximately 1 minute, the object headed west at the same slow pace.  I noticed that the object was not only reflecting the sunlight but it was also appearing to be slowly pulsing a white light.  The object abruptly stopped again for about 3o seconds to 1 minute and continued on the same path.  I did have my video recorder with me and tried to get video of the object.  I could not get any solid video of the object moving because the sun prohibited me from observing the object through my LCD screen. Later that evening I did review the video and I did manage to capture several small bits of video showing the object.  I did obtain some still pictures of the object and one picture clearly shows a small metallic orb in the sky.  It seemed to have some sort of haze (energy?)surrounding it.<n>

I was in Langley in the Murrayville region and not very far from the police station it was on my right side - I was on foot and decided to sit at a bus stop for a moment as I felt something was kind of  watching me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday was a beautiful day with good visability and just a flew fluffy clouds.  I was looking out North and appearing high in the sky was a [dot] very very high up in the sky -  This dot  wasn&#39;t moving at all.  I then watched this stationary dot for about a minute and it just assended upwards towards space until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then continued on foot to the local coffe house and had a latte.  I then headed back in the general direction where I had just come from and noticed a vacant field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to place my jacket on the gound and sit there peacefully for a few mins and bask in the spring sun.  I was aware of my surroundings including several men working to the right of this field (city, municiple workers)<n> <n><n> <n><n> suddendly from my left side of the peripheral vision I saw something very strange.  I thought it was a metallic butterfly (taking off from the ground) or field where I was sat.   This highly reflective object was probably no bigger than compact disc in size.   It wobbled and had the motion of a jumping butterfly.  I would guestimate this object&#39;s distance to be 20 metres from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved across the field left to right and also lifting up higher and accended upwards towards the clouds and beyond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then took out my cell phone and tried to video cam this (checked video afterward but couldn&#39;t see anything on replay due to very poor video quality)   Also to verify what I was seeing I then ran over to the City Municiple workers and asked them to look in the sky way up to see this shimmering object - One guy said yes + the other guy couldn&#39;t see this until I gave him my sunglasses.  They both saw it thought it was very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While speaking with these workers the object  disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several minutes after I saw something odd start to zoom across the sky at high speed and I asked this guy walking towards me if he could see this object moving quickly?   He said yes (what is that?) I said, &#34;I&#39;m not sure&#34;, but something else I saw prior to this object moving high speed was very very strange in that field over there.<n>

I was standing on my back deck looking up at &gt; the stars (which I usually do whenever I go out to smoke after dark) &gt; and noticed what I first thought was a satellite. I see them on &gt; occasion as I&#39;m looking up at the sky. As I&#39;m watching it, it went &gt; from the dim glow of what satellites look like to a very bright point &gt; of light that kept moving, at which point I started thinking maybe &gt; it&#39;s space junk re-entering the atmosphere... even though it was &gt; moving slower than any shooting star I&#39;ve ever seen. It then dimmed &gt; again to what a satellite looks like, but I noticed at this point that &gt; it wasn&#39;t moving in exactly a straight line like a satellite would...<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt; I don&#39;t know how to explain the movement, generally forward, other &gt; than to say it almost looked like it was vibrating very tightly within &gt; a somewhat forward motion. It then turned into a very bright point of &gt; light again (still moving), dimmed, became bright again and did a 90 &gt; degree turn before dimming and moving behind some clouds. At this &gt; point I started backing toward the sliding door to the living room to &gt; call my 5 almost 6yr old son to come see it... I figured it was a once &gt; in a lifetime opportunity, and I wanted to have someone to back up my &gt; sighting... even if he is only about 6 years old. By the time I got &gt; him out, which was maybe 5-6 seconds after I lost sight of it&#39;s last &gt; position, a huge cloud had formed right over the area. I kept looking &gt; at the edges of the cloud at the parts of the sky I could see, but it &gt; never came out of the cloud bank, that I know of. It was originally &gt; moving from S to N and drifting slightly Eastward, when it made the &gt; right angle turn it was moving E.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt; I know it wasn&#39;t a plane as it didn&#39;t have any of the other lights a &gt; plane would have, and the brightening/dimming wasn&#39;t regular time &gt; wise. The brightness is something hard to describe... when it got &gt; bright it kind of looked like a star but without some of the colors &gt; you might get from the light interacting with the atmosphere. The best &gt; way I can describe it was that it looked like a fluid like point of &gt; light. It definitely looked like it was outside the atmosphere around &gt; the level of where satellites travel, which is why I at first thought &gt; that&#39;s what it was. I also noticed that it seemed to increase in size &gt; very slightly whenever the brightness increased.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt; &gt; I have NEVER seenanything like this before, and since I spend a fair &gt; amount of time looking at the sky whenever I&#39;m outside at night I know &gt; what planes, shooting stars, satellites, helicopters, blimps, para &gt; sailors, planets,etc. look like, because I&#39;ve seen them all in the &gt; night sky before. I also know it wasn&#39;t a high flying jet, or the &gt; international space station because those things don&#39;t make right &gt; angle turns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt; &gt; I&#39;m really still kind of in shock from what I saw...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had red and green lights and I thought it was just and aircraft or something but I noticed it was just floating!  It was like rectangular shape kind of and when I pulled over in the middle of the road to look at it; it looked like it flipped over like a saucer and smoothly and rapidly disappeared.  I then called my mother because this is like once and a lifetime thing and I saw something soaring through the air higher this time and then it just sat in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw a regular aircraft and it looked like it was going to crash into it.  I called the Mosinee airport to see if there were any of reports but they said that aircraft could be a private plane for all I know.

The lights were much larger than any star and I would compare the total width of the 3 lights in a row to that of a full moon that is just rising up. (When the moon is brighter orange and appears to sit just above tree top levels.)  I watched the bright amber lights rotate towards the north, (my left facing east) and witnessed another complete set of 3 amber lights, with the rotation the lights appeared to stay within the same proximity of one another and also appeared to be what I would say part of the same “craft”, being the one set of lights rotated around out of my sight and another set appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed the bright amber lights for approximately 15 seconds, and just as the lights had rotated I witnessed 3 or 4 smaller white lights, what would appear the size of a star in the sky, these white lights were moving around very erratically in the same general area of the amber lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After contacting the National UFO Reporting Center, I contacted the local law enforcement and was informed by the deputy sheriff that he had also witnessed the same lights as well as another witness that was in his squad car at the time.  The sheriff’s location at the time of the sighting was approximately 12-17 miles east north east of my location, and he witnessed the lights to the west of his location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be both sincere, and sober-minded.

4/21/09 21:40|Albuquerque|NM|Teardrop|about 30 -45 seconds|bright teardrop flys over the freeway in ALbuquerque|5/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69759.html|87|ndxe200904| Bright teardrop flys over the freeway in ALbuquerque<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from a local television station after dropping off a friend at the university (UNM) campus on Central Avenue. On the freeway to go home,  I had just gotten on I-25 from the frontage road and was somewhere around the exit for Montgomery road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving I happened to look up through the windshield at what I though was a reflection in the glass from behind. However, when I looked up the light was coming from an intensely bright object in the sky, maybe (I&#39;m estimating here) about 45 degrees up from the horizon of my car hood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was shaped like a tear-drop on it&#39;s side. I almost thought it was a comet at first, but then I realized it was completely solid looking. It looked like it had a tail except the &#34;tail&#34; was as solid as the rest of the object and very distinct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was none of the hazy quality you usually see with a comet&#39;s tail, plus it was clearly all one piece, with no detached parts. Also, it was really low in the sky so I could see it very clearly. I&#39;m thinking a comet that close to the city would be pretty much impossible. The object was about the same altitude as planes are when they are coming in to land at the airport nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a red &#34;aura&#34; for lack of a better word springing to mind, out in front of it...but only around the curve where the &#34;front&#34; of the object was based on the direction it was travelling (west to east across the sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving really fast. It crossed an area of the sky about as wide as my windshield in probably less than a second. I got a good look at it but only briefly before it flashed a kind of bright blue and was completely gone. It did not go over a horizon or behind any buildings or cars and the Sandia mountains were still a good distance away from where it disappeared. It just flashed bright blue and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound, and no trace of anything left in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was largely clear (at least I didn&#39;t notice any clouds), with very good visibility. You could see all the constellations really well and there were not an inordinate amount of vehicles on the road, about average for a Tuesday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say with certainty that this was not a reflection, a balloon or lamp, a shooting star, or anything else. It was way too solid, distinct and fast (and pretty big at that) for any of those things. It moved in a fairly straight line before disappearing. I looked around to see if anyone else noticed it, but honestly couldn&#39;t tell if anyone had. I hope someone else did because I&#39;d like to compare notes and see what they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very intense,solid, bright and quick, but it was one of those moments where there is no doubt about the details of what I saw. I don&#39;t drink or party or anything and I got a really clear look at it. It was definitely odd looking and not something I could explain. I wish I could say I had snapped a pic, but it was gone too quick.<n>

There were three lights on which looked like a Black Triangle. The lights were on the corners of the Triangle. It was going Fast, looked like it was going faster than an airplane. It was a very clear image you could clearly see the Black triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It Flew By and seem to have left, a couple seconds later it came back into clear veiw. Not sure if it was the same one or a second Craft. I was so amazed and very excited that is saw a UFO. This time it stayed there for about a minute. I got a very good look at it and it seemed to have a Silver circle in the middle of a black triangle. It flew away and i was amazed. I told everyone i knew. But no one believed me. So i came here and had to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date above apparently is approximate.  PD))<n>

We live in Columbia, MO, and not knowing what would be the proper method of describing where, what, and when I’ll do my best.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw what looked like a star that was moving back and forth almost directly above our location. While watching that &#34;star&#34; another light appeared just north and west of the first star moving south to north.  It covered a distance of 45 degrees and then blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not long after that another star appeared south east of the first star and moved from east to west for about 45 degrees and then blink out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Meanwhile the first star was still moving back and forth and my wife said that she could see a glow around it every now and then that resembled the northern lights.  We kept watching the star till sunup where it faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen satellites and these star / lights moved in a manner that a satellite could not possibly do as well as the speed that they where moving.  The second and third lights covered the distance mentioned above in less than 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went out the next night and did not spot the &#34;stars.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I forgot to mention that our youngest son came out and watched the stars with us for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We’ll keep an eye out for any more UFO’s and will keep in touch.<n>

We had stopped in the street. The way my friend describes it was he got a &#34;feeling&#34; or an urge if you will, to look up. Thats when he saw the ufo directly above us. He describes it as circular in shape with three lights on the underside. When he looked up the ufo shone a light on us through some trees that hung over the road. The light was bright but not painfull even though my eyes were adjusted to the darkness of the night. The light was light blue in color and reminded me of the color of lightning. The craft hovered there for a second and without discontinuing the light flew in an easterly direction, it moved faster than anything i&#39;ve seen before, it flew horizontally and then shot straight up. The flight pattern i saw resembled a graphing of a number that is rising exponentially.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS. sorry for the spelling errors i am on a phone with no spell check, also there was complete silence during this encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live on Peterson AFB.  I saw triangle shaped craft flying almost overhead.  I saw a total of five really dim steady lights. Two where in the rear..two more in the middle..and one at the point of the craft.  For a few seconds it was reflecting the lights from the city.  It would have flown directly over the AFB/Airport for Colorado Springs.  It was traveling on a south to north path.  It was traveling at a high rate of speed and I heard no sound from it at all.  I didn&#39;t really see a color to this craft.  There is no moon and a I saw it reflecting the lights from town and the small emitting lights from it has well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My first thought was that is was a airplane light in such an angle that it looked like one of what i call there head lights because it was in the direction of the airport were i am use to seeing touchdowns by JAL and i think now the Fairchild AFB who might have been here at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i was driving down stratford rd it was still there just  bee bopping around my next thought was maybe it was some sort of remote air craft but as i keep driving down stratford rd it seem to always be just ahead of me and if a remote it had pretty good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS i turned off stratford to Loring dr toward the base where i live (ex Larson AFB from the 60&#39;s).  This orb seem closer had just crossed the street for the second time was apx. above Basin Meats but seeem to  be hovering ! between there and the field as i drove down loring dr i stopped on the little hill before the road stated to wind and rolled down my window to look at it.   I couldn&#39;t see anything but light similar to a white head light not led but white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then i started to continue and after i got out of the curves in the road i looked back for the light again and could find it, then i noticed it in the direction of the airport.  From my distance the light was just below the lights of the airport flying fast under the lights and was gone again.  I dove down Patton Blvd got home and asked a friend at my house and her b-friend to come look for the light with me, they thought i was crazy and laughted plus it was too late we had to wake at 7am for work anyway. So that was it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Conditions were unusually clear, with no cloud coverage.  The stars were beautifully prominent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the witnesses observed a very bright light in the eastern sky, which initially he thought was a satellite.  The light was at an azimuth of approximately 80-100 degrees (true); angle of elevation was approximately 45-60 degrees (above the horizontal plane).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first witness called the unusual looking light to the attention of the other witness present, and they both stood, watching the object, as it coursed generally to the north, i.e., from their right to left.  It followed a flight path that was generally parallel to a horizontal line.  It was moving at approximately the same (angular) velocity that is seen for a typical satellite, i.e. approximately ½-1 degree of arc per second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the light, which already was quite bright, e.g. brighter than the ISS when it passes directly overhead, flared up dramatically.  Following this dramatic increase in luminosity, and over the course of approximately 10-15 seconds, the brilliance of the object subsided to the size and illumination of a typical prominent low-orbit satellite, and the object continued its flight to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still visible at approximately an azimuth of 20 degrees (true), and at approximately 20-30 degrees angle of elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have checked www.Heavens-Above.com, and no Iridium satellite was visible from the witnesses’ location for the evening of April 20, 2009.  Also, the ISS was not visible from the location on this date, and no Space Shuttle was in orbit on this date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My impression is that the object was not a tumbling booster (ullage) in orbit, many of which I have witnessed.  It was dramatically brighter than the many boosters I have witnessed, and there apparently was no regular periodicity to the flare-up of the object; it flared only once, during the observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  Both witnesses, who have normal color perception, had the impression that the object had &#34;color&#34; to it, when it flared dramatically.  The second witness reported that he thought he witnessed a &#34;purple&#34; tint to the light, during the flare-up, although the color change was subtle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both witnesses are quite familiar with satellites in the night sky, and both have been witness to over-flights of the ISS, most recently on March 25, 2009, at 20:05 hrs. (Pacific) when both the ISS and Space Shuttle were visible, flying in formation, in the northern sky.  They had performed their undocking maneuver at 13:35 hrs., on that date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remain mystified by this event.  If anyone can identify a satellite or ullage that would have been visible from our location, at the time and date indicated, I would be most grateful if you would please submit that information to NUFORC, so that they can post that information, to supplement this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you!<n>

My husband went to get our camera, which had a telephoto lens. I looked through the lens, and saw red, green, and white lights twinkling. We decided it was not a star. It was not on top of a tower or a hill. It was not traveling (moving) like a plane. It was too bright to be a helicopter. We did determine after sitting in the same spot for about 12 minutes that the twinkling light was moving NW as it had drifted from our reference point between two trees  We grabbed our tri-pod, got in our vehicle, and headed in the general direction of this twinkling light. We decided it was above West Richland, Washington or Benton City, Washington. We went to the Union St. Library in Kennewick, which is about 3 miles or so west of our home. We got out of our car, walked to the darkest part of the field, set up the tri-pod, and began to snap photographs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light changed shape. The light made perfect cylindrical clouds that were red, white and green in color. We snapped two photographs where it appears there is a HUGE unidentified (by us) flying object. Like to know what THAT is! In many of the photographs, there is what seems to be a multi-colored tail coming from the light. The light began to drift very quickly at the end heading in the direction of Yakima Washington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We focused the camera on light from a house at one point to show the object was moving, and changing shape. This can all be seen VERY CLEARLY from the still photos. There are also the stars to use as a reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I would like to know what we were looking at. Yeah, we would really like to know. Will someone please IDENTIFY this UNIDENTIFIED flying object so we can sink back into our safety zone? We are not stupid so please make it something we can grasp with certainty. If you tell us they are here….we will understand.<n>

The same flash of light was seen south of the Leo constellation between the star Regulus and the planet Saturn, observing with binoculars the light is closer to Regulas (about 2/3 of the way) but about 4 degrees to the south perpendicular to a line drawn between Saturn and Regulus, it is hard to determine whether the light moves during the observation period but appears to be farther north than two days earlier but less than 1-2 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the last three nights it has been observed at a 15 minute earlier time in the evening.  The light flashes with a period of 60 seconds and only lasts for 10-15 minutes. It is possibly a satellite but is unusual in that it has very little motion across the sky and is at a very high azimuth from the horizon (approx 80 degrees), I would expect to see geosynchronous satellites at about 30 degrees azimuth from the horizon at this latitude.  I will try observing again tonight but it will probably be too light out at 7:15-7:30 local if the pattern continues of earlier nightly observations.<n>

She was jogging and I was on the bicycle.  We were on a road (Settlers Pass) heading eastbound when I saw an orange fireball in the southern sky.  At first I didn&#39;t know if what I saw was a street light or a helicopter with a spotlight in our direction or maybe a meteor.  As I slowed down the bicycle I briefly lost view of the fireball behind a house.  I wanted to make sure what I saw so as I kept rolling east I saw the object again and it was flying northbound towards our direction.  I was surprised that it did not have any blinking lights like all the other aircraft that I see fly over.  I told my wife about it, she had already finished her jog before me spotting the fireball and was walking to cool down.  She thought it was strange too.  It flew almost directly over us, just a little to our east as it kept going north.  It moved the same speed as any other aircraft that I have seen.  By the time that it was some 2 or so miles north of us, it must have sped up because the light got small really fast and eventually we could not see it anymore.  I wondered if anyone saw it.  I did not report it to the police because they probably can&#39;t do anything about it.  I don&#39;t know if this was an extraterrestial craft but if it was all I have is two eye witnesses.  With no visual proof I was not too excited to share this with too many people, but I thought I should tell someone or at least log it down for myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On Sunday the 19th I left Oklahoma late in the afternoon and drove to somewhere within the borders of New Mexico that evening. Found a small motel checked in went to sleep. The next morning I woke up, gassed up, cleaned my windows and continued on toward my destination at approx. 7am. I was still on the far eastern side of NM and was had a long day of travel ahead of me so I found what I thought was the best coffee in town and hit the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been on the road for probably three to four hours and was getting close to the western borders of New Mexico; in fact, I was at mile marker 62 or 63, just enjoying the ride and the scenery when I happened to look toward the northwest. I noticed a bright object in the direction I was looking and focused my vision on it. At first I thought it might be a hot air balloon, having just watched a documentary on them on PBS just a few days before, but the object wasn’t shaped like a balloon. The object was shaped like a dome that was slightly short of a half circle. It had a flat bottom to it that was shaped like a tear drop on its side, with the pointy end facing toward my right. I approximate that I was looking up at a 20 to 30 degree angle, through my windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a plane in the far distance coming toward me from the area of NW Arizona that was within my field of vision as well, evidenced by the con trail it left in its wake and a large mesa off to the right that was parallel to the highway. The craft was slightly above the mesa in clear blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was bright metallic silver, as pure a color silver as I’ve ever seen. There were no other distinguishing marks other than the bottom which appeared white and which for the briefest of moment seemed to phase out of distinct characteristic form and then back in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been looking at the object for a matter of probably six seconds and had to turn my attention back to the road to make sure I was still traveling in my lane. Convinced I was ok I looked back to where the object had been and it was gone… completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a couple miles of the sighting was an exit off the highway. I took it and got out of my car to investigate further. I couldn’t see anything but several airplanes with the con trails left in their wake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later exited at another off ramp to ask if there was any historical significance to the area and I found out that right there was the entrance to Chaco Canyon, the residence of the now extinct Anastasi Indians. I thought that was interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was much too shiny for a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cylinder like, approx 4.5 feet long and 1-1.5 feet in dia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound, just shiny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Object came down slowly. I was about 25 feet away.   I continued to walk, as I was going to get my dog out of the fence row.  As I approached, the object   darted straight up in the air, almost to the clouds.  (the clouds were a little lower than usual on that day).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then took off extremely fast in the northern direction and was out of my sight in 3-4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Amazing, I don’t think it was a balloon and no wind could have carried an object like that as quickly as it vanished and as straight up as it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s almost like it didn’t know I was there, spotted me and took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your site.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object appeared to be about 1000 - 1500&#39; in the sky just northwest of the Houston Intercontinental Airport when first sited.  It was traveling from the east downwards to the west.  We were traveling north on JFK Blvd towards Terminal A.  It did not appear to be a meteorite due to its cigar shape.  One of the observers is retired Air Force and said it looks like a missile attack. No crashing boom was heard after it dissappeared towards the ground.  It should have been obvious to the air traffic controllers at the Intercontinental Airport.  No plane crashes have been reported in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It wasn’t something from this planet and somebody or something was in control of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like it came out of now where, but I wasn’t afraid and I don’t know why I wasn’t afraid I just wasn’t.  The light was very calming not blinding at all When it got close to me before hitting the ground it veered up what seem like just above the trees and I watched it as it disappeared into the distance.  It was never close enough to hit the ground but it was what  seemed to me clearly just above the tree in my front yard and went straight above the houses in where the my street turns and disappeared into the distance This thing was like someone was guiding it… there was no heat or anything coming from it and the light was not blinding and I do feel it was close enough to me for me to have felt some type of heat but here was none , nothing just light and speed.<n>

Since there had been poachers in the woods, upon spotting a large bright light, nothing was thought that unusual at first second but then the light was just above the tree line.  It moved silently and very fast from west to east and disappeared behind a foggy area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fog was not very dense and a large, almost ¾ to an acre, pill box hat shape could be made out.  Three large slate blue or grey blue lights that looked more like reflective windows were evenly spaced across the shape.  The shape of these windows was ret angularly oval and almost a square but not quite.  The person was too shaken up to go back and take a picture with a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After going a short distance to work, at 05:02, a similar large bright light hovered on the northwest part of town by an antenna and then moved silently north and disappeared behind building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was total silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier in the morning about 01:00, the dogs barked and barked.  This person did not investigate as there are deer who wonder up by the dog kennel.  The dog kennel faces south were the unidentified objects were sighted.<n>

The neighbors were not keen on the dog as he was a pitbull therefore I put the food out in the wee a.m. hours.  As I was coming back in the house/front door, a light caught my eye to the NW horizon over the cul de sac.  I stopped with my jaw dropped and just stood there to take it in.  I said to myself I am witnessing a close up view of a UFO so I better take this in as I knews it was most likely a once in a life time exp.  It was VERY close, very large and actually just sitting, as parked in the sky. It was actaully quite beautiful, one large craft-appeared to be 3 stories and I know this will sound weird, but it was like somoene had taken the top tier of an office building and parked it in the sky..it had windows...much like you see when you look up at a highrise office building.  It was all lite up with bright white lights-penetrating...as I said quite beauti! ful to take in.  It just sat there and did not move, the back drop was nothing but the black sky...it looked so close that I was tempted to walk towards it to the culdesac to get closer, that is when as I was standing at my front door got a bit spooked and thought I should go in.  I wanted to wake a neighbor to witness but it was the middle of the night thru the week, school-work, and I thought to go upstairs and get my camera, but the batteries are always weak and thought it will be gone when I return...so I went inside, looked out the window and it was still sitting there...then I went back to bed....stupid!!! So wish I had stayed to see it move, but as I mentioned I had taken it in , in great detail, no one to share it with and didn&#39;t want to stay outside any longer by myself.  I didn&#39;t tell any neighbors lest they think I was crazy, and really my prioirty at the time was attempting to rescue the dog (which was a succuss a few days later).  I did share the sighting with ! my immediate family and my best friend and then just filed it ! away as I have never known who to report it to that was reputable and where I could remain annonymus...so it is almost exactly a year later and on my mind I googled and found your site.  I hope this is a reputable site.  I can tell you I have watched, googled many sighting shows etc. since my siting and I have yet to run across anything that was as large and close with such a clear view of what I witnessed.  I would love to be able to share more details of my sighting to the appropriate personnel.  It was quite amazing, astonishing and etched in my momeory.  Oh, one other note...a couple of days later I drove behind our neighborhood to where I thought approx. it was sitting in the sky, 1/4 of a mile no more and it was over desolate wetlands...nothing around where it would have been in the sky....thought that was interesting.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

There were no clouds in any line of vision. I was on a dark spot on the University of Vermont Campus when suddenly a formation of lights streaked across the sky.  Each individual object looked identical to a faded star and but there were four all together that moved in a somewhat V-Formation.  3 moved in a straight line while one moved to the back left of the leading object, creating the V-shape perception.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights remained constant, created no sound nor trail, held a constant shape and the lights were spaced out similar to the stars in O&#39;Ryan&#39;s belt.  The cluster of objects came into my vision about 40 degrees west(relative to the horizon) of the big dipper. It then moved liked a shooting star but but was visible for about 4-5 seconds before it vanished in the southwest sky.  I had never seen anything like this before and had been a total skeptic before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to know if there were any other witnesses or someone who could explain to me what this might have been.<n>
4/20/09 00:00|Durham|NC|Triangle|about 5 mins|Large triangular craft seen hovering over power lines|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74236.html|113|ndxe200904| Large triangular craft seen hovering over power lines<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around midnight on April, 20th, 2009.  I was driving down the highway to bring a friend home when we both noticed a bright light about a mile or so up ahead, low to the ground.  As we continued to towards it, the light became brighter and still remained low to the ground.  My initial reaction was that it was a spotlight or a low helicopter or something.  As we drove up on the object, which was about 50 yards off to the side of the highway in a field with high power lines, we both stared in awe as we noticed a giant triangular shaped craft hovering above these power lines.  I was driving and my friend was in the passenger&#39;s seat, so he had a better view than I did.  I kept looking over at it every second or so and what I saw was a triangular shaped craft about 60-80 feet long on the longest parts and three bright yellowish/orange lights shining from each corner.  We took a right turn at the next light about 100 yards up the road and pulled right into a parkin! g lot next to this field.  We got out of the vehicle and stared in awe at this giant craft, not making a single sound, just hovering above the power lines.  As we stared at this craft, my friend gets in the car and pulls his camera out.  About this time the craft starts to slowly ascend into the air.  As he takes out his camera to take a picture, the camera reads, &#34;Memory Card Full&#34;.  He had just taken a pictures a few hours earlier of the night and had not filled up his card yet.  I found this to be very unusual.  As the crafted started to ascend, it rose in somewhat of a rocking motion, then in an instant, it pretty much disappeared from sight.<n>

I then noticed a bright light in the sky, and we went outside on our 3rd floor balcony to see what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we believed it was a plane flying straight towards us, but we then noticed other planes in the air. This light was much brighter than anything we had ever seen in the sky at night before and much lower than any plane I’ve seen fly in our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made absolutely no noise and appeared to be two lights connected together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We grabbed my digital camera and took three pictures and one video.  The light kept its brightness and didn’t move from its original position in the sky for approx 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:49 p.m., it began to dim, move left, and increase in altitude. Once it gained a bit of altitude, the object leveled off and started to pick up speed. It then began illuminating brighter again. We recorded this part on my Cannon digital camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued to travel leftwards in the sky and then decreased in altitude. It moved behind a tall building in the distance. At this point the object was the brightest that we had seen it.  It moved out of our vision while leaving us frightened and confused.<n>

The light appeared to be shifting colors slightly from white light to very slow flashes of very faint red. It was located somewhat low on the horizon at about a 30-35 degree angle.  It was not a hovering helicopter, as I heard no noise and it was completely stationary, with no bobbing or shifting of its position whatsoever. I have never seen a light like this at that specific location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed this object for a period of 15 minutes or so. It did not move its position in the sky the entire viewing, I thought it was one of the observable planets, but did not know which one. It certainly looked like a planet. Then suddenly it simply vanished. There was a tree off to the right of my immediate visual area that I was marking its location by, so it was not a matter of losing sight amongst the stars in the sky. It was suddenly not where it was upon my earlier observations. A very strange sighting and I cannot explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, we suspect??

The object began flashing about 1945 MST and only flashed 10 times. This was 15 minutes earlier than the night before.<n>

4/19/09 12:00|Stavanger (Norway)||Other|approx 30 sec|Daylight observation in Stavanger, Norway|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71391.html|127|ndxe200904| Daylight observation in Stavanger, Norway<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following took place in the city of Stavanger, located on the southwestern tip of Norway. Time: April 19th 2009, at 12 o’clock, noon. The weather was warm with no cloud and no wind at all. I was at a friends house in the outskirts of the town, drinking coffee. From my spot on the sofa in her living room, looking out of the windows at the clear blue sky I noted that the contrails left by high flying aircraft didn’t move and were left hanging there, crisscrossing the sky and slowly spreading. I figured that the contrails would eventually turn this sunny day to an overcast one as they seemed to bloat over time in the perfectly still air and did not go away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the reason that I had my attention at the sky in the first place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I noticed a bright light moving fast towards us from the left. It looked just like the landing lights on an aircraft but without the aircraft. This soon separated into two light sources spaced close together and I could just make out that they were connected to a solid object. At this point I called out to my friend: What is that? What the heck is that?! And I got to my feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both ran over to the windows to have a better look. At this point the object was rather close and it soon scooted in front of the windows and disappeared over the roof, out of sight and obviously moving so fast as there was no point in running through the house to have a final glimpse of it disappearing on the other side of the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both very shaky after this and we started right away to try to find a rational explanation.  As of yet we are at a loss.  The object looked like nothing I have seen before. It didn’t have wings or a tail (no control surfaces whatsoever).  The closest thing I can compare it with is it had the general shape of a hat with a very tiny brim on it.  The two lights were on the upper half of it (or at the very top) and they shone with a bright white light (just as normal landing lights would).  The colour of the object itself was dirty gray or black.  I could not detect any further details as it was moving so fast. I noticed that the sun reflected off the top of it.  I estimate the size to be about 8-10 feet at its base and about 6-8 feet tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved very steadily in a perfectly straight line with no wobble at all, in fact, it was almost as if it were moving on a pair of (invisible) rails.  I estimate the speed at around that of the sound or slightly below (much like when fighter aircraft fly past the crowds in air shows, just under the speed of sound).  There was no sound whatsoever (not even a swoosh), and the windows were open because it was a hot day.  Also I noticed that the leafs on a big tree in the garden did not move as the object streaked just a few feet above it.  The windows should have rattled when an object of that size moved so close at such a speed and this fact puzzles me more than anything about this experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend saw it pass overhead, which I didn’t because of the angle in which it moved in relation to the windows and she said that it had a purple ‘hazy’ colour on its ‘back side’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I read the local newspaper thoroughly the next day but there was no mention of it.  The course of the object was NE which would lead away from any built up areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the only experience of this kind any of us have had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They were heading to the northeast at an altitude of about 10,000 feet at a speed faster than fighter aircraft – but slower than a shooting star.  However, there was no jet noise.  I could not see the actual craft or crafts; just the lights.  It looked like the lights of three fighter jets in tight formation.  The craft or crafts turned north-northeast and headed out over the Long Island sound towards Westchester and quickly faded from sight.  The turn was impossibly swift with no arc; more like an angle drawn on paper.  The shimmering part was like a Star Trek movie when the ship comes out of cloaking – it was like the light formation was there but you could see through it somehow -  half visible / half invisible.  My daughter saw the movement but not much else.  It was gone before I could process what it was.  I am hoping others will see this and report it.  I was just looking if anyone has reported anything similar and the Orland 4/10 sighting comes close.<n>

I never saw a trail, this was in the morning hours 9:30 am Sunday morning, I was sitting on the town square in my pickup truck, staring out the driver window the distance was about twenty blocks near I-30 and college street this happened in Sulphur springs, Texas.  I never witness any lights, and I was to far away to hear a noise, however there was a wreck near or about the same area about ten minutes earlier.  I waited and watched the sky and thought that maybe it was a plane, but I questioned that because large planes never fly wing to wing, and the crafts looked to wide to the tips for a commercial plane.  The total time span was three minutes!  There was what seemed to be  blur around the crafts, they were large! this town does not have a major airport.<n>

The circular light then re-apeared, a smaller circular light emerged from the original cicular light and hovered above the bigger circle.  Another circular light formed above the second one for a total of 3.  The 3rd faded out, a few seconds later, the second faded out, then the orginal one faded out.  The object reapeared a few seconds later in the shape of a long rectangle or cigar.  This object was high and had no noticable definition, however was extremely bright white.

I am the most skeptical sort of person about this type of thing so it&#39;s still really hard for me to believe what we saw.  There were four circular, oval light shapes in the sky.  They were flying in a repeated pattern in a circular motion, with absolutely perfect precision.  They would then converge towards a centerpoint between them and then repeat their circular pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked to be an exercise of some sort.  The precision was that of a machine or computer.  The incident lasted 30 minutes.  I was too dumbfounded to record it on my cellphone and am now really kicking myself for not doing so.

We saw them as we drove East along 102nd Ave in Seminole near to 125th St.     Two objects, could only see lights at 3 points.  They were moving quite slowly and seemed to be closer to the ground than a jet would be and also wider wing span that a jet would have. There was no loud sound, but I was in car with windows closed.      In the  middle of back two lights, on one craft, can&#39;t remember if it was front or back - a blinking light was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were very close together and moving not very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realise it could have been planes heading for MacDill AFB nearby, but they were very close together to be large transport planes and moving very slowly for jets and also too wide for jets.

However, after only being out for a couple of minutes, I had spotted a light over in the distance.  I presumed it was first of all a plane with it&#39;s lights on at night, but as it seemed to come closer, I started to think it was a plane on fire, as the sheer brightness, matched with the orange/yellow colour of a fire glowed from it. Although after watching it for a few seconds more, I do not believe this was so.  It closely resembled a diamond shape, but I could only describe as the colour that shone from it, maybe the diamond shape was an aura of light around this object.  I did pull my mobile phone out to take a picture, however I am afraid due to the age of my phone, the picture did not come out at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I had thought the object was possibly a UFO, I quickly returned to my kitchen and rang up one of my friends to ask them to look out in the same direction, but by the time I had returned to the garden, the object seemed to be fading.  I assumed it was going the opposite direction, but the speed at which it seemd to shrink into the distance was immense.  I was too late in asking my friend to look for this object, but I shall be checking my local papers in the next day or two, seeing whether anyone else has seen this.  I certainly hope someone has managed to take a picture, as I have to admit I was very excited at what I had witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (The length of time the object had been in the sky leads me to believe that it was not a flare from the coast, as it hung in the same location for such a long period of time, without falling).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have only now started scouring the Internet, and have come across http://www.nuforc.org/ I have also recorded these following details, the time is as accurate as I can guess, give or take five minutes either way.  I look foward to any reply, although I understand you must receive many letters from people with similiar stories, but I would ask if there is a chance you could let me know if anyone else may contact you regarding the following:  22:40 - 22:45 Saturday 18th April  UFO? -  Orange/yellow colour, like fire, in the direction the Belfast Lough points toward the mainland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rough Diamond shape, though may be an aura rather than the object&#39;s actual shape.  3-5 minutes sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you in advance for any reply,  ((name deleted)), N.Ireland<n>
4/18/09 21:43|Leicester (UK/England)||Fireball|10-15 seconds|Red-Orange ball shaped light descending towards a building rooftop|5/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69720.html|138|ndxe200904| Red-Orange ball shaped light descending towards a building rooftop<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was picking a friend up from a pub on Law Street in Belgrave, Leicester, England. When i reached Law St i parked up and was waiting for him to exit the pub and then it happened.  This reddy-orangey coloured glowing ball came gliding past my line of sight in the night sky heading towards a high rise building.  At this point i was so engrossed in this phenomenon that i did not have time to take a picture or record a video.  It actually looked like it was landing on the building as it was lower than the height helicopters fly at.  As it disappeared from view several other random people witnessed it too. To my amazement we all said the same thing to each other &#39;did you just see that?&#39;  I ran round the other side of the building to see if i could see anything on the roof but it was gone and couldn&#39;t be seen in the sky either.  Strange. Very strange because if it didn&#39;t land then it would have been still heading in that direction.  Thats the third time I&#39;ve seen that kind of ball in Leicester, the 2nd one i actually got a video of from a distance, trust me these ain&#39;t no hoaxes, someone or something is out there...<n>
4/18/09 21:40|Stoke-on-Trent (UK/England)|||1 minute|Craft with orange landing lights avoid collision with plane|5/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69699.html|139|ndxe200904| Craft with orange landing lights avoid collision with plane<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions:  Dark, fine, 10% cloud cover, strong chilly breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking roughly to the North West I often watch planes coming out of Manchester and the headlights can be seen after nightfall rising above the horizon until the planes reach a trajectory of about 30 degrees when the headlights are extinguished.  I see those planes flying in a vector between south and southeast and I would estimate that the altitude is about 5000 feet when they pass the Dilhorne area.  I also see planes flying from east to west over Dilhorne at a similar height and assume that these are heading for Liverpool. These flights are controlled by the Manchester ATC people and are obviously coordinated to avoid any chance of a collision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9.40 pm on Saturday 18th April 2009 I happened to notice headlights to the North similar to those of planes taking off from Manchester but coming from a point probably about 15 degrees east of the usual location.  Furthermore the headlights were orange, not the usual white. I will now refer to this plane as the object.  I then became aware that a Liverpool bound plane was passing almost overhead.  I must admit that I was somewhat concerned.  My vision of the orange light became obscured when the object passed behind my house and I had to move to the front of the house for a clear view.  The Liverpool bound plane cleared the collision point by about 10 seconds before the object reached it but it seemed as though the object had slowed down. Because of its unusual flight path and the orange light I was wondering if it might have been a helicopter.  However by the time that I reached the front of the house, the bright orange light had dimmed and I became aware that the orange light was in fact in the centre of an array of seven or eight lights forming a slender arc. The object made a slow sharp turn to the west and just a few seconds later disappeared.  I would estimate the trajectory at this point was about 40 to 50 degrees.  I have no doubt that the lights indicated that the object was saucer shaped.<n>

The sky was dark enough to be officially night time.  As I was headed West and came around a bend in the road I noticed 2 objects that I first thought were planes before I realized how low they were, 500&#39; max, how large they were, and how slow they appeared to be going.  The 2 objects appeared as 3 points of light whose positions remained static relative to one another.  One had 2 lights that appeared to pulsate at different rates, on quicker than the other.  The other objects lights were all solid.  I stopped and rolled down the windows, but could hear no sound from the objects.  Both flew South-East, more south than east, and remained in formation for the whole time observed.  This path took them over my home and across our Lake towards my parents home, whom I spoke with this morning and discovered that they both were also witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coordinates at point of sighting 27°52&#39;19.58&#34;N  82°46&#39;1.90&#34;W<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As such, I am quite familiar with the sky surrounding my area. There are aircraft in their designated lanes, the occasional military plane from a nearby Air Reserve base, and countless satellites.  In fact, I see a dozen satellites visually each night out and capture a handful of their trails on each of my photos, to my dismay.  There are also bats and owls that fly by, hunting with their squeaks and screeches.  I am used to it all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last month, I noticed a “satellite” moving east across the sky. I thought nothing of it and diverted my attention.  I then heard the sound of a military jet in a hurry to get somewhere, which sounds completely different from the usual passenger planes that fly by.  It sounded like an F-16 tanker escort from the military base. I looked back up to spot the jet and saw the “satellite” make a nearly 90 degree left turn as the military jet rapidly approached it from the south-west.  The “satellite” proceeded north-east, closely followed by the military jet with its wingtip lights flashing away. I watched the chase until they disappeared over and the horizon, during the time span of maybe 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened last month, near April 18th, sometime around 9:00pm.  I did not take notes at the time because nothing can really be done about a sighting like this. I know I was in communication with another astro-photographer via email at the time, and I remember typing “I’m watching a UFO chase…  So what are you taking pictures of tonight?”  To me, it was just another curiosity so I quickly returned my attention to the photographic task at hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what you can do with this late report; maybe this can be useful as corroboration for someone else’s report of anything similar to this around that date and time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

To high of an elevation approx 80 degrees to be a geosynchronous satellite and not an aircraft or orbiting satellite.  Possibly a pulsar but after 10 minutes it no longer flashed.

I decided to go out on the balcony of my bedroom and smoke a cigarette.  I was watching a large star over the horizon and was wondering what planet was out at this time of year.  I knew it had to be a planet because it was to large for a star and not twinkling like a star.  I was looking at the moon and Venus and just hanging out by myself.  I kept watching that big planet looking thing when all of a sudden a beam of light came out of the side of it.  Then I thought “oh it must have been a plane coming towards me and now it has turned and I can see the after burner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a beam of light came out of the left side.  Well there is no way a beam of light can come out of both sides of an airplane.  Then there were four beams of light coming from it, top bottom and both sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was banging on the sliding glass door and work up my cousin and she came outside.  We watched the ball of light for an hour.  It keep change from a bright ball, to a ball with anywhere from two to six beams coming out of it.  They it changed shapes to where it looked like a chevron.  Then back to ball.  We watched it until the sun started to rise.  Just about sun rise the bright ball of light climbed higher into the sky until we could not longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I got up about 4:45 and I opened the curtain to wall outside and a flash of light like someone was taken a picture flashed.  I walked out on the balcony and no one was outside that I could see anywhere.  When I looked up in sky I saw that ball of light again.  I woke up my cousin and she went outside.  The I ran across the hall and woke up a friend and she went out side with my cousin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went upstairs and woke up my sister and another friend and we went out on the third floor balcony.  The ball of light started to eject the beams of light again.  We all ran down to the second floor.  And my cousin and friend said that they saw two flashes of light go down the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all decided to go watch it from the forth floor balcony.  We got upstairs we saw a second one, it was smaller and over close to where the moon was.  It also started out as a ball of light, then had anywhere from two to six beams of light.  It also started changing shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of the sudden to the left of the first one something appeared really fast it became a big ball of light, all of these beams of light came out of it and there was a big flash.  All of the beams went back into the ball, and then the beams came out again.  There was another big flash of light and what ever it was took off very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four of us watched this event for over an hour.<n>

We decided to go to the local Sonic fast food restaurant and get something to eat. We got there at 00:00, and the employees told us that they were closed for the night. Well, one of my friends knew one of the employees.  So we decided to wait for her to clock out. She came out shortly after, at 00:03.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all standing in the parking lot by the highway and talking.  I heard a noise of something that sounded like a distant airplane. Not too distant, but one that sounded like it might be close. I looked directly up, waited a second for my eyes to adjust to the darkness of the sky.  When they finally focused I saw what was dimmer than the brightest star (not including our sun) moving around at a great speed. It was quite small, this could have been because it was quite high in the sky, higher than most airplanes it seemed.  It seemed to be somewhat triangular in shape.  I watched it for a second, and it quickly started making sharp turns left and right, while still going at that same constant speed. It didn’t look like it was getting any closer. The first thing I thought was it was a bug flying around, but there was no way it would be that visible at this time of night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told everyone and two of my other friends saw it, even one with glasses on.  The other friend, and the person we were waiting for to get off work didn’t see it.  The employee thought that we were smoking something that night, but that was defenetaly not the case.  I watched it for a good while, almost a minute, as it make incredible turns at such a high speed.  This thing could not have been man made. If it were, not many people know about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally looked away for one second to ask how my friend and the employee could not see the UFO. And when I looked back it zoomed off.  I didn’t see if it went off somewhere else or if it just went straight up and left the Earth’s atmosphere.  And just as fast as it was gone, so was the quiet noise it was making while it was flying directly above us.  I kept looking around hoping to find it, and I couldn’t. My other two friends that witnessed it also could not find it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  We are uncertain as to whether this is intended as a serious report.  PD))<n>

Va|5/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69694.html|151|ndxe200904| At 11:15pm on April 17, 2009, four bright objects were sighted flying at a very high speed, in a strange pattern, over N. Va<n> <n><n> <n><n> After leaving dinner with several friends in Falls Church, Virginia, my husband and I walked out to our car.  It was about 11:15pm on April 17, 2009.  The sky was very clear with no moon, so I looked up to see some stars.  I looked directly overhead, which at that time and season was toward the area of the sky around the fixed star Arcturus in the constellation Bootes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked at the sky, I saw four luminous, round objects moving in a northeastern direction.  The objects were uniform in size their brightness was similar to an average star.  They were clearly flying at a very high altitude.  Thinking at first glance that they were a group of meteorites, I pointed them out to my husband.   It became apparent that they were not meteorites since their shape, speed and luminosity was constant.  They flew almost directly overhead at a high speed and altitude, and did not appear to be birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the objects continued to fly toward the northeast, their formation changed.  Rather than flying at a constant direction and speed, they began a movement pattern that was similar to a small swarm of insects.  They maneuvered around each other, almost playfully, staying in one group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects seemed to move in a more northerly direction as they assumed this new flight pattern and then flew to the north toward Washington, DC and out of sight.<n>

These objects flew side by side at a high rate of speed emitting no sound and leaving no vapor trail. They flew at a steady speed and at a constant distance apart from each other. There were no lights on these craft and seemed to be reflecting ambient light from the material they were made with. It resembled a semi polished aluminum or titanium. The craft flew in a North, Northeasterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed at which the craft traveled was comparable to that of a low flying military fighter. The craft seemed to be approximately 20-25,000 feet in the air. I am no flight expert but it seemed to be at an altitude slightly higher than what a helicopter would fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft appeared to be flying in a formation with one slightly ahead of the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As stated before, these craft traveled without making a sound. I only noticed the objects because I had went outside to smoke and happened to be looking at the stars noticing what a clear night it was. The objects seemed to be round or a slight elliptical shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time I have witnessed unidentified objects. The other sighting was approximately 17 years ago near Warrenton, VA. That sighting was confirmed by documentation with a government agency of other reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a very awkward experience, as the light looked very much like a fire on the water and there was no determinable source of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After breifly observing the light floating on the water it slowly rised into the sky like a helium balloon. It was a warm night, but quite windy, yet the light seemed not at all effected by this wind, rising perfectly vertically instead of diagonally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no aircraft in the area, or any boats.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

While sitting outside by the fire and watching the sky I notice two lights moving from west to east. Initially I believed these were aircraft. As a few minutes passed and the objects came closer, my first thought was why no flashing marking lights? Dismissing the thought due to possible observation angles and possibly seeing only the front I waited until they came directly in front of us and then began to seriously consider something wasn’t right. The objects were far too close to each other and secondly didn’t make a sound. The ridge above us was around an elevation of 6500 ft, the objects were no more than 200 to 300 feet about the ridge line. (Less than 1000 feet above our location) Never at any angle was there a sound or any flash of strobes. The proximity of the two objects defies any commercial control and the speed was t! oo slow for any military AC to my knowledge. Everything about the sighting felt wrong and the senses continued to confirm it. The lights moved behind a tree line out of sight to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

While looking toward the north my wife noticed a bright &#34;star&#34; like object travelling at a constant rate from west to east. I found the object very quickly after she pointed it out and was able to witness the following.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had been observing the clarity of all of the stars and planets because we have just recently moved from the city to the country and were amazed by the difference in the visible sky. There hasn&#39;t been a cloud in the sky all day and there were not any in the sky at the time of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance we thought it was an airplane, however it was a solid white color with no blinking and about the same light magnitude of a typical star in the sky. The object continued on its course for less than 10 seconds, dimmed, then brightened for just a split second before disappearing. There was still a visible star to the right of the object when it disappeared. Whatever it was it seemed to follow a &#34;controlled&#34;, straight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I have never experienced a &#34;UFO&#34; sighting before, ever. I do believe in such objects but the scientist in me wanted to try and disprove what we witnessed. I looked up the orbital paths of the ISS as well as satellites and was unable to find anything with the trajectory that the object followed at the time of the event. We are left to believe that this was indeed our first UFO sighting. We waited for another 20 minutes with both of us watching separate portions of the sky to see if it would return but had no luck.<n>

First pulses of light brought object to our attention.  Three pulses of dim yellow light that grew rapidly in intensity, dimmed rapidly then reappeared very close to the preceeding pulse within a half second before the first light had dimmed fully like 3 lights from the same object just happening at different intervals. Same three pulses happened further down the coast within 15 seconds and further out to sea, estimate distance travelled in the 15 seconds was 5 miles.  That was the last sighting.  All who viewed the lights were around 45 to 50.  The reason for the report is the pulses of light were unusual and everyone noticed how unusual they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were out back looking at the sky enjoying all the stars..  There are no city lights where we live so the sky just explodes with stars..  We started observing several satellites moving across the sky some were moving faster than others and we had a good time wondering which country owned them.  Then my neighbors wife and I observed one which was just screaming across the sky (same size as the others)  This was no plane which we see a lot of up here in the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for 30 seconds and in that length of time it had traveled half way across the sky  Then it just blinked out?  Satellites just dont blink out!

The sky is always filled with stars and I observe them as I drive.  My manufacturing business is very close to an airport so when I saw the object which appeared as a very bright single dot, I assumed it was an airplane.  However, the bright white dot never moved.  The dot seemed to hover in place and then suddenly the dot appeared to fall downward then, as fast as it fell, it shot straight up and disappeared leaving a copper streak in the sky. I immediately called my husband whom was also on his way to work. He was in Knoxville, TN which is 30 minutes from Maryville. I proceeded to tell him about what I had seen. Shockingly, he was just as surprised as I was and told me he saw it too! He described the exact details as I have provided above.<n>

On our way home, around 2:45, we were driving on College Ave. My friend and I both made comments about how illuminated it was. As we were driving by a large field, we saw a heard of about 40 deer, the field was completely light it up, it was very strange. We did not think too much of it and continued to drive to Hilltop parking lot. The parking lot was full because of the time of night and it was hard to find a spot. We were driving up and down the lanes, suddenly facing the hilltop dorms. Hovering very closely over the buildings was a strange craft. We stared at it, and it began to move VERY slowly, without any sound. As it got closer we were able to get a better look, the aircraft was in the shape of a triangle, with orange lights at each point of the triangle and a white light in the middle, and from what we observed it was about twice the size of a car. We kept driving, staring at it. We couldn’t see it anymore as we were weaving up and down the lanes. Then as we turned again, we realized it was above our car, following us throughout the lot. We stopped the car, and the craft moved over the trees. Thinking it was gone we decided to move the car to a different area of the parking lot. As we began to move again, the craft started to come back towards the area we were in. Terrified, we jumped out of the car and ran to our building. We cannot explain what we saw. All we know is it was a triangle with orange lights, hovered closely over buildings, moved slowly, but precisely and was silent…Quite possibly the most terrifying experience of our lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were about 25 people in the backyard with me, but they were over near the house while I was away to the side a bit just star gazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly I noticed movement in the sky and saw a triangular shaped ship moving across the sky at a smooth, quick cruising speed, dead silent. I couldn&#39;t tell how large or far away it was, but if you were looking in the sky, it was about the size of a large tostito chip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ship could have been black, or possible a grey (it was dark outside so it was difficult to tell, but I could see the whole outline of the ship.) Along the sides there were lights in a V pattern pointing in the direction that the ship was moving. You could barely see the ship in the sky, as the lights were incredibly dim. They may have just been white circles on the bottom of the ship, but I could see the V pattern made with 7 dim small circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I watched it fly over, the significance of what I was seeing set in when it was already directly over my head and moving away fast. I turned around and started yelling and pointing so someone else would see, but everyone kind of lazily looked up, and noone else saw it. I immediately went and called 411 to hook me up to a UFO hotline, and the guy just cracked up and sent me to the FBI which was an answering machine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly, this coincidentally happened right after. I wanted to head out to find where to report it online, but I thought I would stop at the beach first and star gaze for a bit (hoping another one would show up). I actually couldn&#39;t stop looking up for the rest of the night. Anyways, these 2 guys were walking up from the beach as I walked over. We started talking and I told them what happened earlier. I was talking about how crazy it was that I just saw this article, and heard an interview of Dr Edgar Mitchel (6th man on the moon) basically confirming that aliens were real, the gov knows it and has for 60 years, and area 51 was actually a crash where they have bodies. (check out the interview http://www.kerrangradio.co.uk/Article.asp?id=804160&amp;spid= )  Now check this out: The guy I&#39;m talking to acts surprised I mention area 51 and says &#34;my dad worked for area 51. He&#39;s actually in therapy right now because of it.&#34; I freak out and start asking him questions and he continues &#34;he didn&#39;t even tell me. My mom had told me even though she wasn&#39;t supposed to.&#34; How crazy is that? As he was leaving I yelled to him &#34;Hey, tell me that sh*t&#39;s real. They have bodies don&#39;t they?&#34; he replied &#34;yeah it&#39;s real.&#34; Then he kinda realized what he was saying and he says &#34;shit, I just told you some shit i&#39;m not even sposed to know and Im def not supposed to say&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a believer.<n>

Around 12:47 and 12:48am, I was outside paroling an area in Santa Barbara just South of Highway 101 facing West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I flinched, thinking that I caught a glimpse of an owl soaring silently through the night.  My eyes caught a visual of a dark triangular object its&#39; three corners were a grayish white, there was no flashing and no other signs of markings, no sounds, no exhaust.  The triangle was acute, I would say it had a 90 degree angle in it.  The unidentified object was at a low altitude, I would estimate 600&#39; - 1200&#39;.  Holding my pointer finger out the object measured 2&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be soaring at a steady speed compared to an owl.  The object was visible for 5 seconds, heading westward. 20 minutes later I got a hold of a police officer who directed me here. I called the National UFO reporting center in Washington state at about 1:15am on the 17th of April 2009.<n>

While pointing out constellations we recognized, she motioned toward an object that momentarily obscured some of the stars from her view. I stood and watched the object after it passed overhead and noticed that it was rectangular, dark colored, emitted no illumination, very fast, and completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to determine its altitude, but seemed very low compared to surrounding commercial air traffic. No other aircraft seemed to be following it. The event lasted thirty seconds at the most, and the object moved in a linear path due North/Northwest. This event occurred in Hernando, Mississippi above a running track used by local schools.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I are young (in our twenties) and pretty well educated. I work as a chef in a nearby restaurant, and she is a reservist in the U.S. Air Force. She claims that the object displayed no characteristics of any aircraft she is familiar with.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When i did i saw a bright star like object that appeared to stay in one plac and changed colors seemingly. I watched for about an hour and it was pretty much in the same spot and would get brighter every so often.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Arc shaped and semi-tranparent.|5/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69671.html|171|ndxe200904| UFO spotted over Toledo, OH, USA. Arc shaped and semi-tranparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside with my mom and fiance.  My mom was in the car already and by the time she got out it was gone.  But my fiance saw it first, she looked up and said &#34;What’s that?&#34;. I thought she was talking about the big dipper because that&#39;s where she was pointing, so I said &#34;That’s the Big Dipper.&#34; and she said &#34;no that&#34;.  Then I saw it looked huge, it was semi-transparent it was arc shape, like  this ( but huge. I couldn&#39;t judge well its height very well id say 3000ft up.  It looked like if sat on the ground it would have been several football fields in length at least.  Despite its size it made no sound I could hear, I have good hearing, and so does my fiance.  I&#39;m 20yrs old, and she’s 18. It was quiet outside as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving slowly compared to normal aircraft. My mom started the car and the car lights came on, I yelled at her to turn the car off and she did but by the time I turned back around it was gone. My fiance says she thought it kind of flapped slightly like a large slow moving bird mind you she agreed on its size, she said &#34;If it was a creature it was still the size of several football fields.&#34; The best way I can explain it is if you took a paper plate, cut out the middle leaving only the curved edges, then cut out a quarter section of the edge giving you a rainbow arc shape, now make it see through, like glass. I could even see the stars through it. I kept looking for it hoping to see it again, but I doubt I will it looked pretty set on its course. I didn’t see it flap and she said it wasn’t very noticeable movement, I think since it was transparent the way it moved in front of the stars did give an appearance of it rippling, I think that might have been what she saw. I hope someone else besides us saw it, it was an amazing sight. Even if it didn’t last long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for us, I am a 20 year old Male. I have lived in this city most of my life. I have very good vision, and hearing.  My Fiance is 18 years old, and has also lived here most of her life.  She also has excellent vi! sion and hearing. I&#39;m a normal adult, I spend my time taking care of my dad and hanging out with my friends. My fiance is a senior in High school, and will be graduating this year. We live in a normal city, and I have never seen anything like this as long as I’ve lived here. This is no joke or hoax, if I wanted to make something up id write a book, this was the first site I found to report this so that’s what im doing. Thank you for you time whoever reads this.<n>

When we approached town we noticed 3 round orange lights in a horizontal row hovering above a radio tower (height not known).  Maybe 30 seconds of us seeing them they disappeared one by one from left to right.  We are positive it was not an aircraft.  They were not moving forward, just hovering slightly up and down.  I do not believe in UFO&#39;s completely so take this information as true and correct.  I witnessed a couple of other cars further on my drive parked by the road, out of the auto viewing the phenomenom.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving very fast, and at a low elevation. It&#39;s direction was heading north. I checked and made sure the ISS wasn&#39;t visible, and confirmed it was not the ISS per NASA&#39;s website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this night the winds were calm and skies clear. I confirmed on the Boston Logan airport radar archive no aircraft were in the area or heading in the direction which I viewed this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I viewed the object for only about 20 seconds at most due to its speed. It had no features I could see. I believe it was too far away to hear an audible noises if it was creating any. I hope others report this object as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Glowing orb sightings occurred April 16-22 of 2009 the other 2 bigger ships showed the 16th and 17th only the one big ship returned April 19-22 but here is the best part on 4/21 between 12 o clock and 1 o clock at night I was actually getting very scared had no car or phone to get the hell out of dodge and I herd a jet so ran on the porch to see what was about to happen and thought I was gonna see something really cool  ha!! Nope the jet flying between 10 maybe 15 thousand ft. flew directly over the house with his burners on and a maybe a mile or 2 away was the UFO  the jet just flew by or just didn&#39;t see it either way I felt a little less worried because I thought somebody finally made the call it did take of about 30 seconds later or I thought that just a cloud covering it without the cloud.Me being irrational with the reality of the situation ran to the middle of the driveway with my binoculars I noticed this pain in the back of my head that me and my mother had felt on 16th but she was to freaked out by the whole idea and actually said she was scared she was gonna get picked up and dropped of ha!! so most every night I got my binoculars and watched the orbs circling each other but they came a little earlier each night the 2 orbs were never out with the other 2 UFOs that i could see they always came before the UFOs with red/white light&#39;s.Also I&#39;m 10! 0% sure they were not airplanes because most of the time I would be watching the UFOs and planes would go by. Also that area is flooded with air traffic day and night but those first 2 nights there was so many airplane there was at least 1 or more in my sight at all times and no noise at all from the orbs and flight characteristics matched none of today&#39;s jets/plains/helicopter hovered like a balloon but picked up to much speed to fast.It was not shooting stars very simple very clear. I also know a few people who live in that area a good chunk of their life who have witnessed UFO activity in the area years ago.These were not my first sightings in the area 2 times before to be exact witch leads me to my next words. 2 people told me they saw a UFO years earlier in the area.I look at the stars since the dish got cut off about a month ago I would not have saw any of it if i had not talked to my grandmother that day .At first it when the orbs arrived I could not be drag in the house all I wanted to do was get that awesome footage and watch it over every night.But each night was a little different but on the 4th day I was doing a lot of thinking and was also filled with excitement fear I just wasn&#39;t thinking strait.I would sometimes turn on the porch light before I would go outside or to let dogs in and out so eventually  what ever was flying those aircraft had to see me turning on the porch light the UFO,s returned every night for something they would hover for hours some nights so when they stopped in the sky right in front of the house and they got a little closer as they were circling and dropping altitude slowly closer towards the ground.They knew I was there I just didn&#39;t really think about it until the orbs chilled in the air for a couple hours and it was still 4/20 about 10 o clock to top it all of I was by my myself no running vehicle and I finally realized if they/it whatever could build aircraft such as the ones they/it/him/her what ever posses they probably have technology or something that lets them know ! I&#39;m ther e. I ignored my worst fears and the hurt in my head to see if the other 1or 2 UFO,s were doing their thing about a mile or so away the fear is the 2 orbs froze in the sky circling away.I tried to take more pictures worthless attempts the camera sucks so it was another fail.So I sat on the porch looking at the sky above a airplane was passing and a really bright light caught my eye from strait above it was the second UFO from the mountain it&#39;s lights shined bright white ember and red  for about 5 seconds then quickly cut of its lights. After that my brain couldn&#39;t let me watch any more i had seen to much it could have been right above me the entire time it had demonstrated it&#39;s superior capabilities. I couldn&#39;t take it I came close to calling the 5-0 to do what.But at 12:32 4/21 I heard the jet and I couldn&#39;t help to think what if those where aliens that would mean that this planet could be taken if so pleased seeing demonstrations 1 after another. now for but I know the Crafts could have returned again last night i could not tell you yes or no because i was typing this. I can take a chance and look like a fool or do NOTHING.  4/25/09   pss i wrote this on the 4/24 and 25th and i returned to my house at about 8 or 9 on the night of the 25th and the UFOs did return again about it seen much more UFO activity last night more than what is normally out actually.Not sure all how many or if any other people in the area know about the UFO  activity in the area . But I checked online to see if any UFO had been reported in the area  but nothing has ever been reported in that area till now.But i heard some people on a plane over North Carolina seen UFO in Feb i really wouldn&#39;t doubt it  or just t don&#39;t care.4/27/09 Saw 3 UFO&#39;s within 1 hour. I only watched for a hour or so then retired for the night.  4/28/09 OK this time i saw 3 UFO&#39;s circling near an airplane was pretty close to the 3 orbs glowing a ember or copper color . I honestly would not be surprised if people or pilots do not report seeing them.Also 3 extra! UFO&#39;s i n where in the sky last night. and I also seen the shape of UFO that was a  triangle it had 6 lights that shined a bright white and I now think it was one like the triangle UFO that landed or just hovered over neighbors yard but to be honest I don&#39;t really know the shape of the craft that hovered over the neighbors yard but because I took 6 pictures on the 16th and looked at them on my computer the 17th no good except for I could see something in 1 picture that was above the ground that looked like a silver line but thought nothing of it and deleted it because I thought it was just camera error and another pic with bubble light if that makes since looked like bubbles that were lite up from the inside out all over the picture and i didn&#39;t even mean to take a picture I turned around to go on the porch after many failed pictures and it just took a pic but now it would make since because I thought that was 1 of the 2 with the red and white lights I just couldn&#39;t say because I only seen the lights on them but now I&#39;m 50% sure that the 2 with the red and white lights were triangle while the other 2 were orb shaped but only from a distance I am still not sure of their  true shape yet but i will try to find out.I&#39;ve also seen more UFO&#39;s but these that i have written about have always came back and hang around in the area for hours or a few minutes at a  time. sometimes they leave and return the same night but there are also many others but are just passing through the area  i do know is that there is a air base or something around  4/29/09 also sorry for not sending this sooner but this is one of the biggest decision of my life and  i fear you guys will come to check it out and the UFO&#39;s will have left the area and I will look like A dumb ass.Just contact me by email if you have any questions.1 Last thing i have not really left any specific time records for sightings well I also didn&#39;t keep count but if i did it be about 30 just since April 16/09 and i would be happy to take a lie detector test if needed you can! imagine that i am very confused with what I am seeing and for a while after i seen my first real UFO right by house about 200ft in the air and the craft was at least 60ft to 70ft I was beyond petrified and terrorfied my mom was in the next room so I holler to show her and it was moving at about 30mph we got out on the porch and it was going right over the tree line at a near by mountain with only 1 dim white light on and i started turning the flash light on and off and it brighten it&#39;s light and froze in mid air over the mountain for a couple of seconds then faded from sight as it hovered the mountain I thought i was hallucinating basically I thought i was going insane my mom saw it to or she says she did.The 2nd time I was at the end of the driveway using the cell phone and this time I was alone but I was talking to somebody who I couldn&#39;t exactly tell there is a UFO and the front is visible and the rest is like not there.The guy would have laughed hung up and had me in a padded room within the hour plus I didn&#39;t tell anyone mainly because nobody could believe this anyway. So I thought to my self ? there was a front and it was black I thought it was some birds flying in like a formation but first of all it was to even if birds are flying that close together there is gonna be some birds getting ahead even 1ft  movement in fly formation it would look squiggly and no wings flapping and no space between the wings of the birds that&#39;s when I started thinking great another UFO maybe I&#39;m not crazy.It was also like 6oclock day time sunny not dark at all.It was only about 100yards in the air and it was moving to slow to some birds flying and I couldn&#39;t think of anything else that even looks like that did and still cant.I can only say the front was shaped like an ark it was black and if this was a UFO it was about 120ft wide at least and the rest wasn&#39;t even visible I&#39;M not sure why all of this shit is all within 3mile radios of the house.At first i thought they had their own private base somewhere in the mountains that ! was my o wn little crap theory so I remembered the direction the 1st UFO was headed then the 2nd then i figured out if there was a base I got the general direction it might be in but here is the interesting part there is a water fall in the direction I figured the base would be not a base but a person i know and his friend saw a UFO up at the water fall years ago.Another person i know said he saw one out the house window. saw diamond shaped UFO same kind I had seen at my old  house but in a different place 2 times and to top it all of A jet was chasing a UFO right above my head at about 20 to 35 thousand ft. I was gonna send a email to Ktox to show UFO hunters in April but to much pressure and I was moving so instead I just let it eat at my soul if i ever had one. I will fill out a crap report that people will laugh at anyway but if my best friend told me this shit I would have called the nut hut. I also found out that during the days of my April 16th/25th UFO sighting people all over the planet were witnessing the strange crafts I even watched a video of  2 orbs in a different place i didn&#39;t really expect that A month later but its crazy. also many left out details and UFO sightings.also temperarly disabled the DVD player with fuzzy black and white picture kinda twisted blackness on 4/20 weak also had 2 pretty weird dreams during those nights maybe caused by stress and fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also i forgot to mention April/16/09 I called my friend then called my grandma that lives in Delaware for the first time in 2 years i call her and talk till cell phone goes dead then charge up and go back to the end of the drive way to get cell phone reception.Anyway I didn&#39;t tell here about my second UFO sighting just my first and she told me her and her daughter saw 2 orb shaped UFO&#39;s that were as she describes circling each other kinda like they were just playing with each other so I was starting to feel not as insane after she told me that but she didn&#39;t know how twisted my mind was from the my 2nd sighting and we started discussing how we think the world is failing I said [to be completely honest i don&#39;t think the world is gonna make it to long at the rate its going and humanity will eventually kill itself with the pride in the nations starting pride wars  they wont just unit as people and just get it over with and start the road to mega science and eventually humans leave earth to go explore the universe] And she was saying now days it&#39;s scary to even consider having  a kid in the world today and I was standing by the mail box and it was starting to get dark but I was just looking up in the sky and i saw i just waited about 5 seconds to think see holy shit mum mum there are 2 orbs just circling each other just like mum mum said like 10 minutes earlier my mind was bent way to far then so i ran in the house got my mom and they were gone I knew then I had lost my fuckin mind i told mum mum they were gone and nobody seen them once again then I told her about my second siting and how crazy I am because i COULD HAVE SWORN i JUST SAW THEM 2 UFOs i said then she says your not crazy and if they just poped up from the sky they will be back I started telling her no they won&#39;t because I&#39;m just crazy but i waited a couple minutes and told her that&#39;s the biggest coincidence of my life but still not sure of reality untill the orbs show up again I got my moms and her boyfriend to check it out and sure enough they ! were rea l I wasn&#39;t crazy my mind untied for the moment just untill the 2 bigger UFOs were chillin over a mountain till later then me and my mom was trying to take the pictures of them in the sky then 1 of the UFOs flew over a mountain it was amazing to even be able to watch it just move at all to even see the damn thing then lights were flashing near the ground I knew if i didn&#39;t say anything just give it 10 seconds max and my mom said do yo see that light on the ground she say what the hell is that I was still focused on the other UFO in the sky mainly the lights because they were flashing the same colors and it wasn&#39;t the neighbors TV on in the camper.Looking at it threw the binoculars was making my heart speed and hands shake and could see the light on very clear as they flashed different colors purple red blue green i don&#39;t remember all the colors but at some point a truck went by maybe 100 to 125ft from the object from the road it lasted about 30 minutes and only got weirder as the lights in the sky were synchronized flashing of colors with those just of the craft that just hovered over the ground a quarter mile away then gone like nothing but it was back over a mountain after that mom wouldn&#39;t even go to check out the UFOs with me any other night except 1 more time to see a triangle UFO crawl across the sky and when it went over the mountain she was back in the house she missed the best part after a couple minutes passed the bright white light on the craft looked awesome as it went to fast for my guesses i just know it picked up and haled ass out of that valley and her boyfriend just wants nothing to do with any of that but now he is all about some gay brown mountain lights or something i told him this is maybe once in a lifetime thing you might never see anything this amazing ever again he didn&#39;t even respond.these events took place on April/16-17/2009 believe it or not this shit happened and still is happening all over the world is my guess it doesn&#39;t just happen near my house and my neighbors front yard! ...1 mor e thing I had a dream and all I really remember is seeing the alien face as i lay on a table or something and it was over me then i woke up and my right eye was twitching really bad I don&#39;t think it was an abduction more like fear and stress and some other issues coming out but the other dream well may have been a abduction because I&#39;ve never felt like i&#39;m awake with my eyes closed but couldn&#39;t move I felt paralyzed I knew I wanted my eyes open but I just lay there and I don&#39;t know how long but when i finally came to i knew that has never happened and i felt like I was floating and then i felt the couch i was sleeping on touching me and time could not even be measured in the stat i was in I felt violated with life and still do i haven&#39;t called any of my friends or spoke to my granny since 4/17/09 and every minute of every day most all day till i go to sleep than wake up with it on my mind it never goes away and not showing my friends was a mistake but what if they got abducted then how would i feel because when i would see UFOs I would give em the finger I used to say if i ever see A UFO I&#39;m gonna shoot at it.THESE ARE THE MOST OUTRAGES CLAIMS YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD well i don&#39;t care because every word of it is true.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/16/09 17:25|Greenwich|CT|Cylinder|1minute|Cylindrical object in South Wester Connecticut|5/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69663.html|176|ndxe200904| Cylindrical object in South Wester Connecticut<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 5:25 PM in Greenwich, CT when I just got on the highway heading North bound.  Clear skies and very light out.  I’m skeptical of other peoples reports as well as when I saw today.  At first I thought it was a blimp, because it appeared white and very slow moving, but I’ve seen many blimps and this was much to thin and much longer than a blimp.  If I had to make a guess, I’d say it was nearly 10,000 feet high from the ground.  It was long and cylindrical in shape.  My next guess is that it was a low flying plane at an angle where I couldn’t make out the wings, and I’m still open to that possibility.  However, if it were an airliner flying that low, then it would have been moving much faster, compared to this object to be moving at the rate of a blimp.  I was driving on the highway during rush hour so I couldn’t stop and get a better look.  But it was clear as day.  Another reason it didn’t seem like an airliner was that I couldn’t make out any wings or a tail wing.    Even as the road twisted giving me a different angle of view, still no wings.  I had sight of it for over a minute at least.  Then the thing seemed to change direction pointing away from me.  I still had clear sight of it, while trying to avoid and accident, it seemed to move a little further in the distance then just vanished.  There were no clouds in the sky and visibility was great, so I don’t know how this thing vanished like it did.  I’m 31, and I’ve seen plenty of blimps, airliners, jets, etc...  Whatever this was, well I just couldn’t explain it or make sense of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was on my back porch with my dad and stepmother when I noticed a bright light in the sky.  It looked like the sun was reflecting off of a very large metal object.  My backyard faces north and the object was northwest of us.  It was much too high to be any sort of blimp and much too large to be a balloon.  It sat very still.  There were planes flying out of Jax International all around it.  They all had tail lines.  This didn’t move, nor did it leave any type of trail.  It had no lights.  It just looked like a silver/white, huge object sitting in the sky.  We never took our eyes off of it.  Within about a minute or so, it just disappeared.  This was my second sighting for all of us.  My first was in St. Maarten at Simpson Bay and theirs was in Arkansas.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Until a group of nine of us, was watching one specific sphere moving across the night sky, around 8:30pm, august 13th, 2008. as the sphere was moving across the sky, we watched a second sphere moving at a even higher rate of speed in a intercept pattern to the larger sphere. Upon which the larger sphere dimmed itself in light, and the second smaller sphere proceeded to explode with unearthly force. Then the first,larger sphere looked to grow with its light again and moved off at a even higher rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even during the winter months, we noticed ourselves looking up at the night sky much more often, due to the summer events.  But to our veil, there were no sightings in the colder months. Now, on April 16, 2009, they returned., but in a different form.  They are much closer in our atmosphere. rendering them much larger to the naked eye.  But when photographs are taken of the spheres,  They appear to be moving at a extremely high speed, and at a randomized, sparatic form, leaving light trails in  a photo graph. which result with multi colored lights and almost arms extended away from what seems to be a center point.  Blue, orange, red, green, purple, the whole spectrum of colors on these beams. every single photograph represents a different formation, never the same one.  almost stretching across the whole sky in the picture, but with the naked eye, only a glowing orb.  They are in the South East of our location in Hampden Ma. About 20-30degree horizon<n>

As I look up something caught my eye and at first glance it appeared to be geese flying in a V formation but as I watched I noticed no movement of individual wings or sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 7 white oval objects/lights that were slightly illuminated and in a V formation. It also moved faster than a flock of birds would travel never altering the V formation.  As it began to move from my sight it turned slightly up and out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure what it was and was wondering if anyone else may have seen this? It flew from the south/west to the north/east.<n>

I watched for at least 15 mins but they did not reappear.  It was definately not a plane as there were no coloured lights visiable.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Usually when she leaves my home she we’re outside talking for a few minutes before she leaves. Normally, I always like to look into the sky check out stars I can see, planets, or constellations. On this night I noticed the craft moving at a very common speed in comparison to Earth aircraft. This craft was triangle in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object had absolutely no sound and was moving in one direction from North-west direction to a South-East direction. This object was at a height of a private passenger plane. It was so apparent in the sky in contrast to the background of the night that my girlfriend had no problem recognizing the craft immediately when I pointed out to her. The glow on the bottom side of the craft had what I would only describe as a “dusk” orange on the bottom side of the craft. The shape can best described as a stealth bomber.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only recording device I had on me at the time was my iphone 3g and I snapped some pictures when it was already out of view. I am attaching the ones I believe are the photos from that night. I am more than experienced to realize that this is not Mars and was no known aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen in the area. As regular commercial jets fly around our area often and can normally be heard. Whereas this particular object had absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

On this particular day as I was sitting on my steps on my front porch, I noticed that everything got very quiet, maybe muffled is a better description, it was like all the sounds of the town, like traffic, wind, dogs barking etc. sounded    distant and softer, like things sound when there is a heavy fog or heavy snow, but it was quite clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was contemplating this very eery feeling, from the corner of my eye I saw a glint of light, I turned my gaze in the direction of this flash and saw what at first I thought was a constellation of large silver party balloons that had gotten free and were floating away, but as I watched them more closely,  I realized that they were not drifting in any direction and were a uniform shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 4 hockey puck shaped silver lobes connected to each other by some kind of cross member and very large, I would estimate that each lobe was roughly 15&#39; in diameter and the distance of one lobe across to another was an additional 15&#39; making it about 45&#39; across.  The lobes were oriented to each other like four people sitting at a square table with an x connecting one person to the person sitting directly across from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hovering perfectly still and noiseless about 200 yards to the northeast of my position and about 150 feet off the ground, right in the middle of town in the middle of a week day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took 20 or 30 seconds for my mind to catch up with my eyes, after all I was not expecting to ever see anything like this so I think my comprehension of it was a bit delayed.  But as soon as I collected my wits, I realized I needed to get a picture of it, so I hurried  into my house to get my camera, a Kodak easy share 3.2 megapixel,  I don&#39;t recall what setting it was on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I retrieved the camera I ran back outside, turned it on and snapped a picture, I tried to take more pictures but to my dismay the SD memory was full after the picture I took, I had to go through and delete some other pictures so I could have more space to take a few more pictures and maybe a movie of it, but as I scrambled to do this, I glanced up just in time to witness it zip away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing moved away to the north so fast it was completely out of sight in 2 or 3 seconds,  I won&#39;t even speculate about the speed, but it was very, very fast, also, it did this from a dead stop and absolutely noiselessly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after I lost sight of it, the muffled dull feeling lifted away and everything became very crisp and clear again and I noticed my heart was pounding so hard and so fast that I could literally feel and hear it through my heavy winter coat, I was very excited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I wanted to show everyone the great picture I took, so I uploaded it to my Facebook page, but that is all I did because, oddly, I received no comments about it, so I figured no-one thought it was real,   I shared the photo and the story only with my immediate family, until now, since then I have moved to a different, larger city where the chance of ridicule is lessened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sadly, I put the SD card with the original photo in a safe place so I would not lose it, but there was a fire and it was destroyed, that is actually why I moved.  I think I’m more annoyed  that I lost that than the fact my house burned down.  At least I have the copy on Facebook witch I will save to my computer and send it along with this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything that I have written down here is true and ac accurate as my memory allows,  I remember it like it happened today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

At least, I won&#39;t. We were down in an urban ravine, just hanging out and talking like friends do. I was the first one to look up and, in awe, see the unidentified flying object. I couldn&#39;t tell you how large or high up it was. All I know is that it was humongous, completely silent, and cruising slowly yet stealthily. Its luminous, phosphorescent lights made its shape out to be triangular or boomerang-like in nature, although the craft itself seemed to be cloaked. The whole spectacle lasted approximately ten to fifteen seconds until it just vanished. One of my friends later told me that he felt like he was being watched when it flew by. My other friend simply dismissed it as either a skein of geese, a weather balloon or swamp gas. But I know what I saw, and I&#39;m sure that it wasn&#39;t either of those things, especially since another witness told me that three helicopters, &#34;two &#39;regular,&#39; and one black,&#34; were scouting the area soon after the UFO had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was smoking a cigarette, just cruising down the highway when I looked up through my windshield and saw a ball of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I focused in on the light and saw that it was not a plain, it shot of into the westward sky.  It had a tail almost like a comet.  I have never seen anything move so fast in my life.

I looked up in the night sky and saw three bright white lights in a triangle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped away from my gate, approx. 30ft, to get a better look at the object.  I could not see any clear edges of the object. The lights did not change shape or appear to shine a beam. I could not guess the height of the object from the ground but it was not at tree level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not appear to emitt any sound and was traveling from a southerly to northerly direction.  The night was clear with high visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only observed the object for approx. 1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am accustomed to seeing aircraft from the George Bush International airport and do see high flying aircraft.  I am just trying to get clarification of what I saw in the sky.  If I knew for certain this was an aircraft I would not be reporting this information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time this event happened was between 22:50 and 23:00hrs.<n>

Object is super bright and low in the sky (lower than a normal star) it gets real bright and then dim, when its bright it flashes green white and red. I cant say what shape it is because its pretty far from where Im viewing it. It seems oval but that could be a trick of the light. It doesnt move - I watched it for 10 minutes and then called out a witness to look at it and discuss what it could be.  Its not a helicopter or plane. Can it be a star? Do stars become dim (almost invisible) and then bright (brighter than anything in the sky) in a matter of minutes. It seems to be in the same spot no matter what time of night it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of star??  PD))<n>

4/13/09 14:00|San Antonio|TX|Other|10 minutes|Black, gumdrop/bell shaped object sighted over downtown San Antonio, TX|5/12/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75268.html|201|ndxe200904| Black, gumdrop/bell shaped object sighted over downtown San Antonio, TX<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 21, working as a valet driver at a downtown hotel in San Antonio, TX.  It was a slower day and I was parking a vehicle behind the hotel in the parking lot.  As I was walking I was looking up across the top of the hotel for a hawk that usually picks off pigeons and stuff.  I then noticed an object, not directly above the hotel, but from my line of sight I can surmount that it was just a little bit further out over the city.  The first thing that popped in my mind was that it looked as if someone had placed a black gumdrop in the sky.  I am a college student and I know what things are, this was no helicopter or anything that could have been produced with our current technology.  It was clear as day right before my eyes, almost as if I could reach out and grab it.  I attempted to take a picture with my phone but could not get a distinguishable shot.  From what I could see there were no openings, lights, windows, or protrusions of any kind; just a solid be! ll/gumdrop shaped object.  There were cirrus clouds that day so I was able to gauge if it was moving, it wasn&#39;t.  I watched it for about 3-5 minutes then I ran inside, down to the maintenance room to see if the engineering guys had any binoculars.  There weren&#39;t any so I ran back up to the front to see if any guests had arrived, everything was clear so I immediately ran to the back again because the sun and trees obscured my vision in the front.  When I got back, I searched for it and was able to find it again, still there not moving.  Total time elapsed so far would of been about 8 minutes.  I watched it for another 2 or so minutes until I was interrupted by my radio that a guest needed assistance in the front.  When I was done with that I ran back again only to find nothing there that time.  I waited for a few minutes watching the sky around me but could not find it.  When this was over I went back to the front and about ten minutes later I noticed a very high altitude je! t going over, heading roughly north to south.  Then after that! one had passed, about 5 minutes later, another high altitude jet flew south to north.  I hadn&#39;t seen anything like that fly over all day, so if it was a coincidence then it was perfect timing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

It just hovered silently for 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came home after visiting with my parents and doing some grocery shopping.  When I turned into the street where I lived, I saw something bright in the sky that was just hovering.  At first, I thought it was a helicopter. Then, I realized that it wasn’t making any noise, and it was much brighter than a helicopter. I have lived on an army base that had a helicopter unit so I knew what helicopters looked like in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had noticed that there was a row of windows about the center of the sphere.  I did go into my home to put away my groceries, but something compelled me to go back outside.  I stared at the object for at least 30 minutes. There was no movement.  It just hovered. After awhile, I started to feel frightened and I had a strange feeling of being watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to get my digital camera, and despite my fear decided to go back outside. I went back outside to take pictures, but the craft was gone.  It was a white bright light, but it is was obvious that it was a sphere.  You could see the outline of the sphere.  I will never forget it for as long as I live.  I was never so scared in my life!<n>

It was just like every other night, a cool breeze caressing my face and only the silence to accompany me.  But then I looked up and my world fell down around me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been an avid believer in UFO&#39;s, and last night I saw three.  Tear drop shaped crafts that seemed opalescent in the bright night sky.  They hovered for many minute.  After about fifteen, they began to move, slowly at first, and at twenty or so, they shot away as one of them appeared to plummet to the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am afraid to tell people what I saw, I need help.<n>

My parents, who I live with, were at Mass and I stayed home doing my laundry and watching T.V in the garage.  I stepped outside for a minute to get some fresh air and to just cloud gaze and I noticed a white orb in the sky.  I could not tell how high it was or how big it was but I could tell it was white and appeared to be changing shape.  At first I thought it was a balloon or a plastic bag that had somehow got carried up by the wind to an unbelievable altitude but the object did not move.  It was unseasonably windy in L.A that day, which made the clouds coast by at a faster than normal speed but the object stayed stationary with out a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 2 minutes of just staring at the object, I ran into the garage and took 2 pictures of the object and about 8 seconds of video. After the 8 seconds of video, my camera lost power for some reason.  The Photos were taken consecutively and the object appears to be in two different shapes.  The video is too grainy too see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the camera lost power I went to the garage to put it back in the case. I went back outside and the object was gone.  I climbed on the roof of the garage to see if it had drifted or moved into the distance but there was no trace.  The timeframe of walking back into the garage had been about 9 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am baffled as to what the objects are but am very curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

An unusual, large, circular cloud was directly over the city and lights were positioned in the center, and densest part of the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they were air traffic beacons, but there movements were irregular and seemed to be coming from within the cloud.  There were 4 large lights which rotated in formation and then came together.  Another smaller blue sphere joined them when they came together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly, like someone had switched off a light, they disappeared.  It all happened so fast I hardly had time to realize what was going on before they were gone.  I’m not positive about the number but think there was five lights in total.  My view was also partially obstructed by the above balcony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within an hour following the sighting the cloud cover had broken up completely.  I also spotted a helicopter circling the area within an hour following the sighting<n>

Oslo)<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting at my friends balcony in Oslo, looking out over Oslo harbor when my friend saw something in the sky.  She thought it was some kind of satellite, and when I looked at the sky I didn&#39;t see anything at once, but after some pointing, I (we) saw the following: (note: she saw it approximately four seconds before me. I saw the object(s) for about ten seconds, so the duration seen by the other witness is about 14 seconds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> A v-formation with about 7 lights.  The lights had the same glow as a faded star, like the stars distant at the star sky.  The seventh light was completely still, but the six others where moving still following the &#34;main&#34; lights.  The other six lights (three under each &#34;wing&#34; was spinning sort of around, then shrinking to one light and then expanding again.)  I would say that the object was at the same size as a 747, or maybe bigger, and the lights were NOT blinking, they were constant all  the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not a trained observer, but from experience, I know that this was something out of the ordinary.  Given the six lights and their abnormal behavior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved south east, not in straight ahead, but like a weak half circle.  The object disappeared behind a hill (about 300 meters tall).  I would say the object was at the same standard height as an airliner about to land, and flying over the ocean.  According to my reference point, I would say it was flying approximately 2-3 kilometers from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note!  This was NOT an airliner.  Passenger planes fly over Oslo regularly, and they make a lot of sound!  This was completely silent, and way too slow to be a f. ex 747 which not fly in that direction anyway. (not to land, Gardermoen is in the north direction.)  if this was to remind me of something, it certainly reminded me of the descriptions of those coming from the Hudson Valley sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very interested in the phenomenon, and when my friend (which knows this) pointed and said &#34;look at that,&#34; I thought she was fooling me.  She was not. I also know of similar stories about something similar over &#34;Holmlia,&#34; which is a place east of Oslo.  (I actually heard this today after calling a friend who is very well read about the phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: No sound what so ever!  Will mail drawing of sighting!<n>

Our table was located right next to a large picture window, facing North at the end of Main Street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked out, I noticed a small Cessna airplane flying slowly on its final approach to the Bismarck airport.  Just as I was losing sight of the Cessna, I looked back to my right and spotted a silver metallic object flying extremely fast in a straight line from East to West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be disk shaped, similar to a double-convex lens if looked at from a side view.  The object was approximately 1/4 mile to the North and appeared to be flying at a lower altitude than the Cessna had been, I estimate about 300 to 400 feet above ground level.  I believe the airplane would have been moving at about 80 knots, therefore, I would estimate the disk shaped object was moving at between 500 and 700 mph, as I lost sight of it within 2-3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be a little smaller than the airplane, approximately 18 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur radio operator and trained weather spotter.  I have taken fixed wing flying lessons and have built and flown R.C. model aircraft for many years.  I am familiar with most types of aircraft and I have seen anything in the sky like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone whith this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally lucid and eloquent.

We were amazed to has seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few weeks later there was a sighting or a burnt spot in the ground at South Hill a near by town.

4/10/09 23:50|Bernallilo (entering to Alburquerque)|NM|Cone|2 minutes|Hello! I happened to find this site, and decided to report my observation which took place quite a few months ago while in New Mexico.|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73752.html|214|ndxe200904| Hello! I happened to find this site, and decided to report my observation which took place quite a few months ago while in New Mexico.  I just want to start by adding mt comment that I didn&#39;t want to bother to edit this observation report on MS format cause it&#39;s too time-consuming and rather cumbersome, though your guideline tell me to do so.  I apologize for that first^^<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here I&#39;m in S.Korea, my native country.  While searching for UFO reports which i&#39;ve also have some interest in on CNN website and I encountered this reporting site of UFOs.  And it made me to determine reporting what had taken place very long time ago and I forgot to bother to clarify the incidence by way of telling other people, researching documents-i has begun to do this only recently a little bit but not much- or contacting experts on this subject or issue.  I had many other things to take care of, or be concerned about, and Iwasn&#39;t even sure what the magnitude of my observation would be to other people, or society that&#39;s currently still skeptical about accepting this issue of UFO thing!   To be honest I&#39;m unable to recall the exact date of this incidence, so your discretion for this part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Actually not even certain whether it was April or some earlier months since Sandia Mountain on its peak had quite some snow accumulation around.  I was on my way back to Motel 6 Exit paseo del norte two exits donw from Tramway RD toward City of Alburquerque.  It was almost to midnight.  I was coming from Santa Ana Star Casino at City of Bernalillo, after I spent the day at Santa Fe up I-25 North.  Now below I&#39;d say only specifics of the UFO sighting provided with as much description as I can recall now- I&#39;m sure I can do better on this part than the date of the incidence thatI can&#39;t remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving I-25 southbound to that lodge just passed Bernalillo city limit, through the front windshield I saw what appeared to be presumably a bright yellow light (front) of an airplane like a bright headlights of upcoming cars.  It was approaching closer to my direction headed up north.  First, I&#39;d rather want to emphasize the speed of this flying object (or an airplane at the time of observation) wasn&#39;t that fast at all, rather similar to that of normal commercial aircrafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was getting closer &#39;n closer to where I was and at a certain point it was flying, passing right above of my car and if I didn&#39;t look up to see it, I&#39;d certainly have thought it as a usual airplane.  Before I describe how I could bend and lean my head to the right of steering wheel move my neck &#39;n head to look up, at that time freeway traffic was few and I just felt like to look at it, even if it were to be just an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This remarkable &#39;n breathtaking sighting (and a short obersation) happened, therefore, starting its closer approach toward above my car just till its blocked by the roof of my car! What extraordinary about the sighting here it is.. The rear or behind of the object A BLUISH GREEN BRIGHT LIGHT AROUND LIKE CONICAL SHAPE AND ORANGE-CLORED SPARKLING LIKE WIELDER&#39;S SPARKS, OR SOME KIDN ELECTRIC CIRCUIT FAILURE?  Judging upon its speed I doubt it was a satellite crashing down to earth, or meteorites.  And I&#39;m quite certain it wasn&#39;t an airplane.  This odd &#39;n mysterious sighting happened within a period of less than a few seconds-but perhaps longer than 5 seconds! (I was crazy!  Dangerous!) I had an impression that this flying object was a crashing one due to perhaps certain causes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I could&#39;ve pulled over to side road to keep my eyes on this object but somehow I chose not to.  Why not?  First of all, I got scared something bad might happen to me, if not from this odd object maybe from cops or gangs!  Second of all, some whisper told me i saw enough and don&#39;t try to ask the identity of this things any further.  How?  I can&#39;t explain but it&#39;s not a physical whisper I&#39;m taking about, but some powerful feeling or instinct that &#34;Let&#39;s just keep it that way&#34;.  So I told myself &#39;I saw enough&#39; and headed back to my M6 LODGE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s all!  Let me know your expertise about this observaation.   Waht was it??  You can contact me to my E-mail^^<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a black triangle, it was approximately 4-7000ft, it made no sound and was moving faster than any commercial aircraft I had ever seen.  The whole sighting lasted about 7-10 seconds.  I shrugged it off thinking that it was a commercial aircraft because I live close to MCO airport and it caught me by suprise and I didnt get time to focus and think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight at approximately 11:35, I was in the back yard, and I looked up and saw three lights in the shape of a triangle. Tonight, it looked as if it was three lights in the shape of a triangle, but I couldnt make out the shape like I could before.  There was a very very slight overcast, but it was definately there, I followed it from almost righ above me to about 22.5 degrees and it disappeared into thin air.  The sky was hazy, but I could still see the stars through it.  The lights made no sound, they moved very quickly, and just disappeared.  I thoufht that I was crazy the first time I saw it, or maybe because I saw it by suprise and didnt get enough time to actually focus on it and thought it was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight I was able to fully watch it, and I know it wasn&#39;t a commercial aircraft. It disappeared right in front of my eyes.  It almost looked like three symetrical spotlights pointed at the sky then moved across and turned off.  I have never seen anything like this before.<n>

We looked around for a while until we saw the object at a distance closer to the &#34;MOON&#34; pyramid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We only saw one object the shape of a sphere.  It appeared white in the distance, but may have been reflective.  There were no other visible objects around us in the air.  We were at the peak of the &#34;SUN&#34; pyramid and looking towards the &#34;MOON&#34; pyramid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear day with plenty of sun.

It was about the size of a medium star, and the glow of blue seemed to pulsate, but I can’t be sure due to the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watch it go across the sky, a white “light”(again, more of a glow) suddenly appeared right behind it. It also was about the size of a medium star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both were, to my ears, completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The blue one blinked out and re-appeared slightly further east in the sky, and was at a complete stop...no motion that I could detect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The white one seemed to slow down and did a little zigzag in the sky, at what seemed to be the same altitude as the blue one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the white one did its maneuvers, the blue one blinked out of view a couple more times, and after each would re-appear in a slightly different part of the sky, at a complete stop, but still within the area of the white one and its zigzag movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute (60 seconds) of this, they both took off, the blue one slightly ahead of the white one, at what seemed to be the same altitude, in a due south direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, I was quite mesmerized by the performance I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have provided contact information on the Report Form.<n>

Sometimes when it&#39;s not cloudy a heavy cloud which looks like a light hover&#39;s over the city of manhatten&#39; and whenever I see this cloud of light at night I wonder why is it so bright, so I took a picture of it with my cell phone. After takeing the picture I zoomed in. I was shocked to see a shape of a sphinx within the cloud and what appeared to be two images of fighter jets. I showed the picture to some friends and they were puzzled but said yeah there&#39;s something there. After a few weeks the image was gone but the picture of the cloud was still there. I knew something happened (not on my part)so I retrieved it from a friend I once transfered the picture to his cell phone,he became spooked out and deleted it after the transfer,once again the image disappered after three weeks.I always knew there was something in those clouds. And why are those fighter jets always in the sky at night.I still have the pictur! e but no image.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The vibrations rumbled the house, somewhat like when a loud clap of thunder shakes your house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object proceeded to take off corner ways to the house, it started out fast (faster then a jet plane), and gained speed, I ran down the hall to get a family memeber and by the time I looked out another window the object was gone, but the noise could still be heard.  We all ran to the back patio, but there was nothing to be seen, but the noise lingered, like after a jet plane takes of at an airport but much much louder.<n>

As I kept diving further I noticed the light was gone.  A short distance later 2 large saucer shaped &#34;crafts&#34; with stangely bright lights had flown over my vehicle very close to me and for about 45 seconds they were flying along with me as I was driving along the lake.  They had both coasted over the lake very slowly then very quickly went up to the sky.  Later that night when I had gotten closer to my destination to town I noticed the same shaped and same lights were flying in a circular motion above me, then had quickly disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never expeirenced such a sudden rush of wonderness when the &#34;crafts&#34; were so close to me, this was an expeirence that I thought never imaginable since I could tell they were of mysterious figures and were very strange seeming to me.<n>

It was just North of where i was and it was at least 30,000 ft up and that guess is based off commercial air traffic that was passing through.  It could have been higher up, but I couldn&#39;t determine the size of it to gauge height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was slowly moving from North to South and either Spinning or Wobbling.  Definitely was a Cylinder shape, and standing straight on end. After 30 Seconds of watching it it move about 14inches across sky in about 3 seconds. (Both Arms Extended Pointing, the Distance Between)  That put it @ my 1200 slightly West of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside and got a Co-worker to come and look.  When we returned it was still moving South and at about my 1100.  A Commercial Liner was passing by it when we returned.  Within 4 inches @ arms length, the Liner appeared roughly 30,000-40,000.  The Cylinder was about 1/3 the size of the Plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to move South Wobbling or Spinning, it just looked slightly distorted.  It finally stopped @ our 1000 and just kind of stayed there, stopped for 20 Seconds or so, as 2 other Commercial Liners passed close by.  Then it just started slowly Wobbling/Spinning Due East.  It seemed to Fade in and Out when it was moving, but it was perfectly visible when still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It eventually just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total Sighting time-6 minutes-0812 to 0818-it was a Clear Blue Sky with a little haze way off to our south.<n>

Judging the altitude to be about 30-40,000 feet based on several passenger planes that were flying over at the time.  (I am not a big UFO watcher and somewhat skeptical, but todays sighting for me was the FIRST time I clearly saw an object that I knew wasn&#39;t a typical aircraft and for all intent and purposes shouldn&#39;t have been able to do what it did.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching the cylinder, it continued South in a counter clockwise rotation or woble until turning East and then disappearing after about another minute.<n>

This pulsing had been going on for about 7 minutes, so I decided to have a look out of my bedroom window to see what was causing this sound. I looked out, and as we live in a small village with no street lights it was hard to see. The bungalow opposite us has a 40 feet high water tower behind its garden, and I noticed a small &#39;trash can&#39; sized cylinder slowly moving up and down over it.  It was hard to see what color it was, but it was light, maybe white or a pale gray. It had a domed roof.  I was able to look at it for a minute or so before it quickly headed west and gained height.  The pulsing stopped when it left. My parents laughed when I told them and said it was probably a helicopter (my dad used to fly Sea Kings for the RCAF), but I know it was too small and quiet to be a heli. Another thing I noticed was that it left a smell of burnt rubber. 100% sure it wasn&#39;t a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We said that we hadn&#39;t.  The 6 or 7 lights appeared to be moving slowly, but staying in the same general area.  We all took out our cell phones to videotape the lights, but they disappeared before we could get zoomed in.  The lights simply &#34;turned off&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were too high in the sky to be from a building or tower and they moved too much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next few days, I searched the internet for similar sightings and found this website where there was a video of the exact same formation of lights.<n>
4/8/09 22:50|St. Davids|PA|Triangle|13|4 Triangular objects hovering over Eastern University|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69597.html|234|ndxe200904| 4 Triangular objects hovering over Eastern University<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, at 10:50pm, April 9th, 2009, on Eastern University’s campus, in St. Davids, Pa, while walking into the Doane entrance I saw a triangular object moving above the trees a couple blocks behind Doane Hall, and as it descended many police sirens went off.  Then, walking past the gym from the pathway from Doane Hall, noticed a very bright orange light shining through the trees.  As I walked past the gym toward the soccer field I saw the object flying toward me.  While walking through the middle of the soccer field it flew above me.  While that object was directly above me, I saw the different but same type of object flying in the distance toward me from another direction,  It was much farther away from me, but still close enough to see its size in relation to the previous one.  From my eyes, it was in the direction of the lower corner of the University parallel to the main entrance at eagle road. It flew in direction parallel to King of Prussia road.  After I crossed the soccer field towards my residence at Kea Guffin Hall, I walked toward the back parking lot of Kea, and as I was walking up the hill, another object flew over the trees, and over Kea Hall about 80 degrees above me.  I tried to take a picture of it with my cell, but the resolution was to low for the lights to be seen.  The duration of this sighting lasted 13 minutes. I witnessed 4 objects in total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These four objects were triangular in shape. There was a full moon out tonight (or what seemed to be), and in relation to how close to the ground these objects flew compared to the size of the moon, the size of the object was of equal or a little larger than the moon tonight.  These objects had 7 lights. In the middle, there was a red light, and at each point of the triangle there was one, as well as two between the front light and the two side lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have seen unidentified objects that close to me, they couldn’t have been over 300 feet above me.  It was spectacular. Oddly enough, I wasn’t scared, but felt calm and at peace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be a quite sincere person.  We would welcome reports from other witnesses.  PD))<n>

It too was traveling north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was quite low, maybe 200 yards high, and moved at an incredible rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting only lasted approximately 2-3 seconds.<n>
4/8/09 22:00|Holden Beach|NC|Light|40 minutes|Holden Beach NC - Big Orange Light  Over The Ocean In The Night Sky|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74524.html|236|ndxe200904| Holden Beach NC - Big Orange Light  Over The Ocean In The Night Sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 50 years old at the time we saw this light, and my two sons were 19 and 23.  We were enjoying an evening of surf fishing, but not catching much of anything.  The weather was warm, and the sky was mostly clear with only a few thin, sparse, low lying clouds, and a full moon.  Standing on Holden Beach, NC looking at the ocean you are facing south.  We saw the light to our left a bit, in a south easterly direction.  I estimate it to have been approximately 25 or 30 degrees above the horizon, and most definitely over the ocean.  I did not notice the time when we saw it, but I estimate it to be sometime between 9:30 and 10:30 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw that night was a huge, sort of light-orange, maybe even amber light.  It was not a perfect circle, but rather it was a kind of very soft, square shape with long, sweeping, rounded corners.  The first time I saw it, it appeared for only a few seconds, then faded out.  I asked my sons if they saw it, but they did not.  I told them what I saw and where I saw it, and, of course, they got a kick out of picking on the old man for “seeing things”.  After what seemed to be about 4 or 5 minutes it appeared again, for only a few seconds before fading out again.  We all three saw it this time, and the next two times that followed.  After about 8 or 10 minutes it appeared again, and again for only a few seconds before fading out for about 15 or 20 minutes.  It reappeared once more for a few seconds, faded out one last time, and that was the last time we saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light maintained the same altitude and exact location in the sky during the entire observation.  I used the end of channel marker light from the Lockwood Folly Inlet, and the Oak Island Light House Beacon as my landmarks for pinpointing the light.  At first I questioned whether it was possibly a ships flare, but there is no way it could have been.  It was too high, too big, and did not fluctuate at all in its position or attitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did some research before deciding to file this report.  I know we saw it, and I know it was not an airplane, helicopter, blimp, or anything else I have ever seen in my life time.  I am not 100% convinced, however, that it was anything out of the natural realm.  But still, I do not know for sure what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Just as I was about to turn around I saw a bright white light zoom into the sky from behind the garage. It chucked up lots of dust as it went up but was silent.  It was about the size of a football.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was as high as a plane and looked like an orange teardrop. Several times it was amazingly stationary, then this orange glow kept changing speeds and veering off to the right until a few miles later, completely vanished! approximately 15 minutes later, i stepped outside again and was stunned to see the mysterious object re-appeared and continued the same path.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At 11:20 pm that night I walked out onto our 6th floor balcony, overlooking the ocean, to join my wife.  It was an absolutely clear night and only a night away from a completely full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had only been out there a few moments when I noticed some unusual running lights off to my left.  They were clumped together instead of the normal wingtips and tail and were flashing different colors continuously.  I’m an Air Force veteran and I’ve seen more than my share of a wide variety of aircraft.   I asked my wife if she saw the same thing I did and she said yes and asked me if I knew what it was.  I couldn’t determine how far away the object was but since I wasn’t looking up to see it from the sixth floor I’d say it was less than 1000 feet up and was tracking along in a straight &amp; level flight path.  I grabbed up the binoculars I’d brought with me for the trip and after a few moments locating it in the binoculars (it’s harder than you’d think) I was just getting focused in and they lights just “blinked out”.   I pulled down the binoculars thinking I’d somehow just lost it in the binoculars but it was completely gone.  There was no trace of it anywhere.  I can’t say I saw a flying saucer.  I can say, without a doubt, my wife and I saw an Unidentified Flying Object that was there one moment and gone the next.<n>
4/7/09 22:30|Abilene|TX|Triangle|30 minutes|Pictures were taken on cell phone.|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69573.html|245|ndxe200904| Pictures were taken on cell phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son, ((namd deleted)), came to my home in Buffalo Gap, Texas at apprx.  23:00 tonight 4-7-2009 and asked “if there have been any TV reports of a meteor or anything else crashing in our area.” I had not heard of anything because I was not watching live TV.  We were watching a recording of an earlier program we like to watch.  We had been out on a local lake with my son (the one who saw this object) earlier in the evening .  Our favorite program came on and I recorded it while we were still out on the lake.  My husband and I came on home and left our son at the lake so he could catfish after dark. When we got home we turned on the recording and were watching it from 22:00 to around 22:58.  The signal was interrupted several times as we watched the recording.  This is not a common occurrence at all on recordings from our HD TV. We just kind of wondered why the signal was messed up and let it go at that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my son came in around 23:00, he mentioned that he had seen something really “strange” streak across the sky as he sat out on the lake in our boat. He said “It was HUGE”…. And that jets from the Air Base (Dyess) had gone up shortly after the object appeared, streaking across the sky towards  Buffalo Gap, where we live. He said the object looked a lot like a meteor streak but was “huge” . He went on to say that the jets from Dyess were circling the area around and between Buffalo Gap and Tuscola (to our southwest approx. 5 miles).  We have no idea what he might have seen , but thought we should say something to someone.  Surely, many others must have seen this event as well.  We thought you might want to check into it and see what it might have been.  Incidentally, my son is 31 years old and not a goofball. He called me after he left my house to go to his apartment (he doesn’t live with us and had come to bring our boat we had left with him) and said that there was several aircraft in the sky still circling our area.  It was approx 23:45 at that point.  It is not unusual to see aerial ac! tivity w ith the Dyess Air Force Base right in between Buffalo Gap and Abilene…however, it is odd to see a cluster of activity around an unknown event as my son saw.  He does not have Internet and I sent this .  I am sure he has lots more details he could relate first hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you   ((name deleted))<n>

They must have passed directly over the airport and were changing formations in ways no kind of fighter jets or anything could. Green lights, roughly 8 of them, circular, tightly packed and switching places but keeping in a tight formation, this was so distinct and clear, i wouldn&#39;t be surprised if aircraft or other people spotted this that night as the sky was clear and alot of planes and helicopters were around. Also as they were so low, probably on 2000ft, someone else must have seen what we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly said to the two people beside me to look and they too seen the lights, they moved so fast across the sky that they were gone over the hills to the west of vegas within 30 seconds, no noise came from this, which for the speed they were moving you would expect to hear something from it. Also seen a helicopter head of in that direction five mintues later, which seemed odd as no helicopters the whole week i was there seemed to head off in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watching the sky for strange things is not something i would often do, this was so real and i would have loved to have captured this on camera, it was truly unbelievable and i don&#39;t expect anyone to believe me but i know what i seen and it was to my eyes not of this world so to speak.<n>

Sudden disappearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a large picture window behind the television set in the living room.  It was dark outside and about 22:10, my attention was diverted from the TV because of a white light in the sky which was streaking downward from right to left as I was looking north east.  It looked like a falling white flare and had a short white trail.  The light was quite intense and suddenly disappeared just above the tree line. There was no smoke. I believe the light went out before it was out of view from my seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was vaguely aware of the light for a second or two before remarking about it to my wife.  She was sitting in the room to the side of me and didn&#39;t have the same view of outside that I did.  She did not hear or see anything unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately went out side and could hear no unusual noise and could see no unusual lights or other scenery.  There were no subsequent police or rescue sirens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an alert active 73 year old retired Neurologist.  I have never had a previous sighting of any unusual sky events. I&#39;m not subject to hallucinations and have not had any retinal problems. I did serve in Vietnam and the light I saw tonight resembled the illumination flares used in night combat, although they lasted much longer.<n>
4/7/09 21:45|Tampa|FL|Sphere|1-1.5 seconds|A bright green sphere about the size of the moon shot across the sky in Tampa FL.|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69571.html|248|ndxe200904| A bright green sphere about the size of the moon shot across the sky in Tampa FL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two friends and I were standing in a parking lot talking at around 21:30 in Tampa Florida. We were standing in roughly the shape of a triangle.  One of my friends, whose shoulders were almost parallel to the object’s path, got a really puzzled look on his face and pointed toward the sky.  I turned, my shoulders about perpendicular to the path, to see a very bright, light green object about the size of the moon traveling quickly from roughly south to north.  My second friend turned all the way around and saw the bright light travelling quickly behind the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was definitely circular, possibly spherical.  It had a tail about twice the length of the object that gradually came to a point.  It was only visible for a second or two due to clouds and trees but I was able to see it cover about 40 to 50 degrees of sky (the angle created by pointing where I first saw it to where it went behind the clouds).  It looked very much like the green ball a Roman candle shoots but without any smoke.  There was no noise except that of the cars on the street and the wind blowing through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not sure what it was.  I grew up by an airport and have seen all different types of planes come in all types of whether at all types of angles and it was definitely not a plane.  I read that green meteorites sometimes occur but if it was, it was either big enough that I’ll be hearing about it on the news tomorrow or close enough that we would have an impact noise at least.  We were standing on church property, which is quite large, so short range fireworks are out of the question.  There is little to no likelihood that it was a big fire work due to the lack of noise and it was the only time we saw anything significant in the sky.<n>

All of a sudden a large bright blue oval object no more than 300 feet away appears overhead of us, right into the clearing. It was a solid blue with an extremely bright glow. It moved in a swift figure eight pattern, paused for a half-second, then blasted off into the atmosphere at impossibly fast speed leaving no trail or glow behind it.  The best way to describe it is like in the movies when a ship blasts off into light speed, except this was an extremely bright blue object, which made no sound and left no trace of its existence behind. It was like nothing I&#39;ve seen before and it what I saw doesn&#39;t even seem humanly possible.  This thing just took off and disappeared completely in less then a second. The whole event feels like a movie to me it was so surreal that I seriously could not believe my eyes, but it happened right in front of us and there was no possible way we could miss it, it was that close to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These formations were approximately two miles south of Peyia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each formation comprised of four bright circular red lights, one in each corner of the square. As I have said, there were two of these formations.  The lights appeared to be identical in colour and size.  Even the formations were at the same altitude, but were maybe a mile away from each other. Commercial airlines were above the area heading both toward and away from the Island and I would say that the air traffic was medium-busy.  It appeared that the lights were below these aircraft, so I would say that these lights were at between 5,000 to 10,000 feet in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These eight lights (one for each corner of the two formations) remained constant in strength and did not pulse or flicker and neither of the formations moved (they appeared to &#39;hover&#39; in the sky as aircraft were passing them).  The weather conditions were fine and for the entire 4 minutes of which we viewed these lights nothing obscurred our sight.  Although a few photographs were taken, none actually managed to successfully capture the lights.  We were unable to notice any sound from the lights.  After a breif period, the lights just &#39;went&#39;, as though somebody had flicked a switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although not linked to the above, I witnessed something similar in 2002 in Norfolk, UK.  Then it was a single red light moving slowly across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

There is a small craft airport in Fishers, less than 2 miles from the area and this craft came from the uppermost part of the clouds, without wings DOWN and no noise, and no flapping as a bird. Neither was it the same as fighter jets with wide wings. It clearly looked liked a craft with the wings UP like on a navy shipped when they docked on the aircraft carrier. It was more than odd, it was not from this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular craft came out of the clouds, approached toward my area directly downward and then veered oddly somewhat southbound on a dime, with absolutely NO movement from the UPWARD CLOSED wings. The wings were like a bird but stayed locked upward still. It then did a 360 motion (turn)  in FULL VIEW with a second, while still moving back into the clouds, upward like a helicopter’s movements, without hesitation and clearly like no craft this world has or any I know of, 3-4 miles from it previous location in SECONDS. This was spotted by two individuals who did not know each other.  The other person saw it like me and slowed their driving from the hospital in awe, but moved on. I told my wife,  but I had no other witness before she came out of the hospital clinic area for allergies. It was awesome and yet fearful as this didn&#39;t look friendly but more of a probing observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My heart was beating so fast, my mouth went dry and I couldn’t talk.<n>

I had just cycled past the Redstone Industrial Estate, gone down a little bicycle path which goes beneath Spalding Road and was just lifting my bike over the Somerfield supermarket fence to cross the carpark(to shave a minute or two off my time)and I saw a black triangle over the docks, about 1/4 mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first thought that it was a helicopeter, this was because it looked to be too small to be a plane and was moving too slowly. I soon began to doubt this because I was not aware of any noise coming from it. It moved slowly, not much faster than jogging pace. It was also not too far from the ground either. The triangle was near a 6 storey office block on the dock, and was only 30 feet higher than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put my bike down, and started to walk towards some moorings, on the opposite side of the river from the triangle. I had only taken a few steps and then it just shot into the sky and over my head it went. It was quite a sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was leaving a restaurant and walking to my car.  It was a clear night and there were a decent amount of stars out.  I paused to look at the stars for a moment when I saw three lights in the sky.  They were moving from a SE to NW direction.  Because they stayed the exact same distance from each other, I quickly assessed that they were part of the same object.  The lights themselves were a sort of neon greenish color and if you connected them, they would form a triangle.  I couldn’t tell you for sure what the color of the object was but it “felt” like it was black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew within seconds that what I was seeing was unlike anything I’d ever witnessed before.  I knew within seconds that I was seeing a UFO.  There is no doubt in my mind.  It moved across the sky at an incredibly fast speed, way faster than anything man-made.  It made no sound what-so-ever.  It simply…..glided, is the way I would describe it.  Because it was moving across the sky so fast, I probably only saw it for less than 10 seconds.  Since then I have researched this a bit, and have found many other reports from people of the same thing.  Big, black, fast moving triangles, and no, it was not a U.S. Stealth Bomber.  This was faster and made no sound.<n>

They would move left or right and sometimes drop altitude then ascend again, then hover in one position and fade out, then flair up again, and it started the sequence all over again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They looked like they would sometimes form a pattern. For example, two of the lights got into a straight line, but with some distance between them. Then they both moved away from each other, and then eventually faded away. Many of them did this randomly all around us, but mostly just in pairs. We saw a few of them seem like it dropped another light (aircraft) from under it. Also, we saw many planes fly over us so we were able to compare the lights and you could clearly tell that the lights weren’t any type of plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This kept happening around us for about an hour then it seemed like all of a sudden they all disappeared. None of us can explain what we saw that night.

I observed a single bright orange orb, very fast moving, it was faster than a modern jet but not as fast as a satellite. The object made no sound. The object was moving North to East just below cloud level,  The proximity of this object in relation to myself would have meant that if it was an aircraft I would have been able to hear it but there was definitely no sound.  The object illuminated the clouds when it travelled through them.  The brightness of the object would be approximately magnitude 2. No flashing lights or strobes.  This object was not an aircraft, satellite, balloon or lantern. I observed this object through my binoculars until it disappeared into the clouds.  I am a keen aviation enthusiast with thirty years experience of observing aircraft. I have a responsible job  and I consider myself to be a perfectly rational person.  This is the first! report that I have made and I have made this report because I am absolutely convinced that what I have seen cannot be identified, although I am aware that this object or others like it have been seen in other parts of the UK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was eating a snack and my 8 month old son was facing me.   As I was talking to him, I slighlty glanced in the cloudless sky and noticed a disk like object that is so shiny. It was moving very slowly towards the west and looked like it was 1 mile away.  From my vantage point, the object was the size of a penny.  I called my wife and tried to show it to her but then as I kept on pointing to it so that my wife could see it, the object slowly vanished in thin air. It just dissapeared in the sky eventhough there were no clouds that time.  I was very sure it was not a bird nor a plane.  It was something that I have not seen in my entire life.  I trembled a bit when I realized that I had seen an unidentified flying object.<n>

The night sky is unlike anywhere else I have ever seen up there because we were so far away from lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a point of light, which at first just looked like another star (a relatively bright one) moving across the sky from right to left. When I looked closer I could see that the object wasn’t exactly round like a star but rather kind of elongated, like an oval or very short cylinder. Think of it this way: I will compare a normal star that is circular in shape to a BB (like a BB Gun BB), but smaller, and this object was similar to a grain of rice. The overall size difference wasn’t great but I could definitely tell that this thing had a long side and a short side, although it was very minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing this thing moving I got my friend to look at it too. He saw it moving and said how unusual it looked. After about 10 or 15 seconds the object got much brighter instantly and within a few seconds disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a shooting star because it was going much slower than that. I think it could be a satellite because I have read that they have been seen to brighten when they hit a certain sun angle and can also disappear when sunlight is no longer reflecting from them. However, it seemed like once we started talking to each other about how odd this thing was an what it could be, that’s when it got very bright and then disappeared like it knew that we were aware of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder if anyone else has had this kind of sighting. I would like to know more about what we witnessed.<n>

We both saw it from inside of our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving back home to Montgomery County in Maryland from Howard County in Maryland on Route 108. We were driving from the east to the west, specifically from the northeast to the southwest, more or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SEE MAP: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Route_108    I believe we were still in Howard county around the town of Clarksville - or Highland - when we saw the UFO on the right side of our car - the passenger side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not very far away from us, as there were some tall power lines - or a cell tower of some kind - off the road in the field to the distance from us on the right of our car and a bit ahead of us as we travelled toward / by it on the left. It&#39;s hard to tell if it was one tower or a series of power line towers - but I will look more closely the next time we drive by and see what it actually is - and exactly where it is in relation to the road (Route 108).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was moving toward the tower - and then STOPPED! It stopped by the tower right after we both noticed it up in the sky. It was NOT very far away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend asked, &#34;What is THAT?!&#34; ... I saw it, too, at the same time and also said, &#34;Yeah, what IS that?!&#34; ... &#34;It&#39;s not a plane, I can tell you that.&#34; she added, as she rolled down the window to try to hear any sounds coming from it. I slowed down the car. Neither of us heard anything at all. Then I said, &#34;It&#39;s not a helicopter, either, because I can&#39;t hear anything - and that&#39;s too big to be a helicopter - and planes don&#39;t just STOP like that.&#34;  It had red and green lights that were slowly going on and off. The lights were the first things we both noticed before seeing the object itself. It appeared horizontally long, like a mettalic cigar in the sky by the tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my girlfriend said, &#34;I have a creepy feeling. We should speed up. Whatever that is, I have never seen anything do that before.&#34;  So, I sped up, and as I did so, the object began to move again and was heading in OUR direction. My girlfriend said, &#34;It&#39;s coming this way, toward the road. ... GO!&#34;  So I went even faster, and she took her seatbelt off to look at it pass over the car and off behind us in the direction of the area behind my side of the car - back from the area of Howard county where we were coming from, back in the northeast direction sort of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She looked at it as it sped off quickly, and the lights disapperared - and then the object itself disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound of a helicopter or an airplane going over us from up above as you would normally hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it was gone - and we continued to drive back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What WAS that?!

Extremely large flash of white light midnight April 5th, 2009<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unknown arial phenomena. Large white flash lit up the sky, bright enough to block out the stars, and reflected off neighbors houses. Bright white flash of light to big to be a meteor, and no sound, too large to be a commercial fire work, literally thought an explosion was going to occur from something as big as a chemical plant. Occurred from west over or past Chesterfield, Missouri.  Flash appeared for only 2-3 seconds. Flash originated from west to east completely  blanketing sky lighting up 1/4 of Northwestern sky.  Observed from Olive Blvd and Fee Fee Rd. area in Creve Coeur county part of St.Louis county at 00:05 A.M. April 5Th, 2009.  Absolutly clear cool night, no clouds anywhere, and visibilty very good. 4-5 minutes later a Police helicoptor, not the medical Arch Air helicoptor from hospital, came from the Southeast heading west to where the phenomena happened. Helicoptor in area for 20 minutes circling large area and half the time could hear it and not see it for it was going around large area.<n>

My husband was in the bathroom getting ready for bed (brushing his teeth).  Our house was silent, no tv on, no computer sound on. Both our kids were staying at friends homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then heard this loud humming noise.  WOOoooWoooWOOoooWOOooo.  I looked towards the noise that was coming from behind the house.  I was frozen at what I saw.  There were double twin light beams coming from the sky, directly down to the ground.  The light was not dissipated as a flash light would be.  The beams were moving up and down within the beam itself.  There was both the noise and the double twin beams happening at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband came out of the bathroom asking what the weird noise was.  He thought that it was something on the computer or I had the tv on.  He looked towards the tv and the computer and seen there was no noise coming form either.  He looked at me standing by the large windows and said what was that noise?  The noise and the lights were gone, but he had heard the noise and it brought him out of the bathroom to question it.  He heard the noise over brushing his teeth and running water.   I told him about the lights and he believed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have no noise out here.  We live on 25 acres with a few hundred acres of farmland, woods and crp land behind us.  Our house sits up on a hill with an unobstructed view of the sky.  Our sunroom has very large windows that go up to a peak.  I tell you this so that you can see that I had a very clear view of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as the weather, it was snowing and the humidity was high.  Sound doesn’t travel well in that kind of weather.  On days when it’s calm and dry or cold, you can hear semis 4 miles south of hear humming down a highway.  This was not that.  The light beams had two separated strands on the left side going straight up and down from the ground to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light beams on the right were also two separated light beams going straight up and down to the sky.  I looked up to see where they were coming from, but because of the snow, the beams went into what ever they call the low snow ceiling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then talked to my husband about what just happened.  We both went outside to listen for any more noise.  There was nothing.  Then he took his 10 million candlepower flashlight out and pointed it out in the backyard.  With a flashlight we did the same thing.  Both times, the light would spread out and you could see all the snow coming down.  With the double twin light beams that I witnessed, they were solid stands.  No breaking up of the beams, just straight lines down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then called my 19 year old daughter that was in the town 5 miles away and asked her if she heard/seen anything.  They were watching movies in her friends basement.  Nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided that it did need to be reported, so after about 15 minutes, I decided to call the Rice County Mn non emergency sheriffs’ telephone number.  The dispatcher did take the call seriously.  She was nice about it and said that I did need to repeat the story to a deputy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She transferred the phone to him.  I told him about what happed.  He was also great about what I told him.  I told him that I work as a librarian at a local high school, I don’t drink and I don’t smoke.  I am a middle age women that has 2 kids, a farm and would not make up what happened last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He had me describe in detail for their report, about what happened .  He said that there are too many reports world wide of this stuff happening for some of it not to be real, and the universe is too large for us to believe we are the only one here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt the need to report this to them, and I also feel the need to report this on your sight also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did go outside this morning to see if there was any visible sign on the ground to where the beams were touching, but I could not see any.  It did snow about 2 to 3 inches overnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this info helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness, who submitted this report, appeared on the Jeff Rense Radio Program at 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday, April 14, 2009.

It was 10:45 PM. I felt so elated that I called a friend and the cell phone call recorded the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, due to all the light in the intersection, we did not think much of it. As we drove closer and came into a darker area we noticed five and six bright lights formed into a triangle shape in the sky (we were surrounded by trees and, therefore, the visibility was slightly impaired; nevertheless, we could clearly see the triangle formation) .<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were slightly swerving into each other but essentially maintained the triangle shape. I asked my girlfriend to stop the car and I got out to get a clearer look at this unusual phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stood there, all of the bright points of light disappeared, except one. They zoomed out at an unimaginable speed leaving no trace whatsoever. The bright point of light which remained did so for another 20-30 seconds, and then slightly dimmed and suddenly it was gone. The color of these lights was a blend of red and orange and they were very bright relative to the surrounding stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These bright lights might have been hovering at 500 feet or more; it was hard to tell the exact altitude and distance, but they were near enough for us to see what was taking place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two of us were pretty baffled and amazed but we were convinced that we had witnessed a UFO, and I employ this term in the strict sense of the word as in Unidentified Flying Object.<n>

(By &#39;large&#39; I mean &#39;too large to be a star&#39;.) The light was round and approximately 4-5mm in dia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Keep in mind that my dorm is roughly rectangular, three stories tall, and has a courtyard in the middle. All dorm rooms open towards the courtyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So as I exited my room, the light was just above the line of the roof. My best guess as to cardinal direction would be West-Northwest, but do NOT treat that as anything but a guess. I can tell you that I could see the moon clearly from where I was standing, and that the light was below and to the right of the moon considerably.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was moving slowly, but visibly, upwards. I would say it moved about 1mm up (to my eyes) every second or so; again, a guess -- I have a poor sense of distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It kept changing color as well, and very rapidly at that -- at most, it stayed one color for 1/4 second, probably more like half that. Distinct colors were blue, white, and red, in that order. Very hazy, too -- its boundaries were blurry. About 1-1.5mm of its diameter was blurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got.<n>

We were both shocked by the intensity of the light, but assumed it must have been some landing lights on the runway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both looking at the base as we drove past. My partner then pointed out that there was a &#39;thing&#39; at the end of the runway. I looked and there was what looked like a helicopter sized triangle. It was hard to see because it was black/dark, but had a strip od blue light running around the rim of it. It was a couple of hundred feet off the ground at first, but then rocketed into the sky really quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I thought that it might be a planet, as it was too big to be a star, and it wasn&#39;t white or yellow- closer to red or orange. The sky was completely clear, and as we were looking at the light, we noticed that it was moving slightly, back and forth. Then, it went out completely for a few seconds, and flickered back to light. We drove back home, assigning the person in the backseat to &#34;keep an eye&#34; on the light, and watched it until it disappeared behind Mt. Eldon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Last night as I was heading back, I saw an intense orange light in the sky which looked similar to a firework which is about to explode into multiple little specks of light. That is what I actually thought it was, but when it did not become a bunch of smaller lights like a firework,I decided that it must be the light of a helicopter because it moved slowly like one. It began to head towards the beach as I expected to see/hear a helicopter but didn&#39;t.  The light then dimmed as it moved paralell to the beach and looked a little bit like it could be an airplane and yet thinned out and resembled a comet, then small enough to be a star. It changed directions after about 3-5 minutes, then it suddenly disappeared.  About 5 seconds later, it came back, reversed direction and immediately disappeared again.<n>

I live in a condo on Butler Beach very near Saint Augustine Beach and the ancient city of Saint Augustine.  Very often I take a 4 mile walk on the beach in the evenings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, Friday April 3, 2009, I left my house at approximately 9:00 PM (I did not wear a watch) and I walked south down the beach from Dondanville Road to Mary Street (2 miles) where I turned around and was approximately one half mile north of the Matanzas Street beach ramp (I estimate it was between 9:35 and 9:45 PM).  I was noticing the bright moon nearly directly overhead casting a short shadow as I walked and I turned around and looked up to admire it.  A bright banana yellow object caught my eye…it was far off in the distance (low on the horizon)but increased by double in size in just about 15 seconds…it still was very far off and at first looked like it might be an airplane (except for the unusual color).  After 15 seconds it looked more like a Coast Guard Helicopter with a search light on and it was much closer (I am estimating 3-4 miles away).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took my headphones off to listen but heard nothing.  The yellow light continued parallel to the beach and I looked very carefully to see the green and white flashing lights of an airplane to appear – which they did not.  When I first saw the light it was low on the horizon and seemed to have a contrail.  I thought maybe it was a space shuttle launch or a missile.  But then it kept getting closer and larger and was not climbing higher.  It did not seem to leave any further contrails after I saw it—it was like it might have been after a vertical climb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sorry but I am completely unable to surmise its size.  I had nothing to compare it to out over the water…but at its largest it would have been about 10% of a full moon (low on the horizon rising) at its closest to me -- I am estimating that to be a quarter mile to as far as a half a mile away.  I know that is no help.  I held my arm out and my thumb completely covered it and would have even if it had been four times larger.  The light continued towards me and parallel to the beach but and one point it turned directly to me and glowed very brightly, again in that banana yellow.  It grew larger and seemed to be moving very fast – about the size of a softball, held at my arms length – now dwarfing my thumb.  The light became so bright that it illuminated the water like a ray of sunshine…but again in that bright yellow—very similar to a ray of sunshine – not diffused at all.  At that point I felt that it must be a helicopter but none the less I felt a little scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light shifted slowly away from heading towards the beach (and me) to directly out to the ocean.  As it turned it looked half yellow and half orange with a fire-like flickering.  Finally it turned all orange and sped off impossibly fast due east and then grew very orange and doubled in size and then completely disappeared after a thunder-like orange flash…and the atmosphere looking all wavy like a heat distortion around where the light was.

We were right in front of the Super Walmart when I saw an orange glowing object in the sky. My husband had seen the exact same thing a week ago when he was by himself. I asked him if that was what he saw and he said &#34;YES!!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it as we drove and it appeared to be either traveling away from us or was getting dimmer. It got smaller and smaller then eventually faded out, popped back on for a brief second then was gone. There was a slight haze around it just before it went out. It was a crystal clear night so it didn&#39;t go behind any clouds. When we first saw it it looked about the size of a street light off in the distance, but was up too high to be a street light. It also did not have any other colors or flashing lights but a bright orange glow. We did see an airplane flying the opposite direction shortly after, but you could clearly tell that was an airplane as it had flashing lights.<n>

I glanced up to see if there were clouds or stars out and noticed a moving object in the center of the sky with a rainbow of colors.  I ran inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars and saw a rapidly rotating orb or sphere that flashed a rainbow of colors as it moved.  It was stationary, but it wasn&#39;t.  It stayed in the same general area, but rotated.  I called my daughter and her fiance along with my husband and we watched it for approximately 20 minutes.  Then, we noticed smaller objects that were moving around this larger orb.  It was as if the first one spotted was the docking station.  The others moved more like planes, but were round with strobe like lights on the bottom that rotated.  The crafts appeared red.  They moved about all around us and this went on for over an hour as we watched in amazement.  One by one they began to become difficult to see and then the larger docking station was moving.  It did not fly away quickly, but started fading and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stopped to take a break from painting my front step railings and just looked up at the sky. A very bright reflection immediately caught my attention to the south west.  I watched it to see what was so bright. The silver object appeared to be &#34;floating&#34; in one area with no movement from side to side or up or down. It stayed this still for about 25 seconds and made no sound. It was approximately a mile from my house but I could not begin to judge the altitude.  I realized that this was not an airplane or a helicopter because it had no shape other than round.  I changed my position to see if I could see another angle of the object but it still continued to look like a ball.  It was definitely NOT a balloon.  I was about to go into my house to get my husband so he could see the object, I turned from the direction of the object to go into my house then looked around one last time to see it, and in that short a time, it disappeared completely. I have never seen anything like this in the sky before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 43 yr. old wife and mother of three sons.

Earlier this month I am not sure of the exact date I was cleaning my kitchen island and happened to look down my hall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this light. I wouldn’t call it a ball of light.  I would say it was like large sausage shaped lights entwined into each other it was a sunny day and my hallway is dark it came from my bathroom, I would not say it floated it seemed to have a motion like the sausage lights were moving within the shape of a rounded off cube.  There were no hard edges and the lights within the shape moved as it was going from one room to the next.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first thought I thought it was bluish lights on some of these sausage shapes and some were perfectly white.  Luminescent.  It seemed to hover for a second and I had a strange feeling it was intelligent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that people are starting to think I am crazy.  That is okay by me.  I just know that someone out there has seen something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also had some crazy stuff happening at home.  Something said something in my ear while I was lying down.   My dog who was beside me heard it and started to bark like there was someone in the room.  It was loud and I could feel it down my ear canal.  I have been researching to see if someone had died in this house but I have come up with no explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think all this started to happen in the last few years when I saw a round object in the day sky go over my backyard. It had a military plane a few hundred feet above it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was in the living room with me when I watched the handle on my sun porch move and the door opened.

It appeared to be stationary.  Citizen advised that he had been watching it for approximately 15 minutes, with no change.

Some airplanes were flying very high, others, mid altitude, others landing.  Suddenly I noticed a silver ball moving from what I thought was east to west and a steady speed and not higher than any of the airplanes flying.  My first reaction was, wow, a balloon, but then I noticed how the ball was extremely shiny, almost as it had it&#39;s own shine or the sun was shinning on a metallic object not a silver balloon.  Suddenly the ball came to a complete stop for about 3 secs and then started to go back to where it came from at a higher rate of speed than before.  That&#39;s when I realized this was quite unusual.  It was not an airplane, helicopter, or any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen.   As the UFO changed direction I jumped on the Manhattan bound train that had arrived at the station and continued to watch the ball until it was out of site from the train.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I see something as unusual as this.  Could a balloon change direction completely like that? the speed always seemed quite steady, almost as if something were pushing it, moving it a along.<n>

Then out of nowhere there are these 3 trianguolar shaped things just above the tree lines, kind of like gliding in the air.  Too big to be a bird and too small to be a plane.  I do not know what it was I saw, they were just floating across the sky and then disappeared  without making any kind of sound what so ever.  I have the actual notes from that night.

I don&#39;t remember the exact date or time unfortunately at this point, but I do remember the sighting occured at the tail end of dusk, when stars were beginning to pop into the sky. As I was climbing a hill on the trail, I looked up to see some of the stars and planets coming out. This was almost directly east, as the trail in that section runs that way. As I glanced at some directly in front of me and straight down the trail, I noticed what appeared to be an explosion in the sky, in my peripheral vision, about 10-20 degrees to my right. The moon was in the sky, I think about 3/4 full, and it was a further ten or so degrees to the right. The object I saw was about a quarter of the moons diameter, I would reckon. The object, or the explosion, seemed to grow, or shift, at first, but then held a circular shape for about 5-10! seconds. After this time, &#34;wings&#34; seemed to grow or appear out of the top and bottom, again seemingly on fire, with many colors and stange flashes continuing within the &#34;fire.&#34; The wings formed with the original ball a crescent shape. If I had to guess its size, based on the distance I think it was from me, I would say 300-500 feet in length, from wing tip to wing tip. I don&#39;t quite remember exactly how the explosion/object/craft disappeared, just that it seemed to quite quickly. This particular object I saw in the sky for about twenty seconds in totality.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the above object disappeared, I saw a second event about one or two seconds after, and about three degrees to the left in the sky. Two lights, which seemed to be obvious jets of human design, were flying quite fast in what I would consider to be combat manuevers. Working seemingly in concert they both were performing roll after roll, never stopping turning, and seemingly at full speed. The distance from me to them was great enough that I could not hear them, but despite the many turns, they were moving left across my vision, that is north, at a good clip. As I watched them in wonder, for as I said I noticed them first directly after and adjacent to the strange object above, I noticed a much smaller light, so small I didn&#39;t see it at first. This light appeared to be a tiny craft, and it was flying in between the two jets, seemingly dodging or fighting with them. For all intents and purposes, it appeared what I was watching was a battle. This battle continued and ran, as! I said above, left and north across my vision. I was only halfway up a hill while watching all this, and the craft, all three of them, slipped behind some trees. I ran the rest of the way up the hill to try to see the encounter, but I never saw anything strange again that night, or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Howevre I feel like it is important to report what occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way back to my girlfriends house after her, myself and our two friends went to a local store in Orland Park. She rode with our two friends and I drove by myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should mention a little about our background.  I’m a student at a local college as is my girlfriend.  My friend is the General Manager of a restaurant and his fiancée is a student also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived at her house in Frankfort Square before they did so I waited in my car for them to arrive.  As I was waiting, I received a call from my friend who was driving the car my girlfriend and his fiancée were in.  He told me to drive to  St Francis Road and turn east towards Harlem Ave.  He said that there was a huge triangular object in the sky and I should be able to see it.  I immediately did just as he  said and the was a large triangular object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three lights on the object on each point and they appeared to be changing colors from red and blue constantly.  The lights were far enough in the distance that the shape was not clearly visible but when the lights moved, they stayed the same brightness and appeared to be equidistant from each other.  The object appeared at times to be pointing downward and then it would appear to turn and be pointing up or to the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my friend that I saw it and we decided to see how close we could get to it.  We decided to drive south on Harlem to Rt. 30 and head east.  Two other cars appeared to have noticed it as they pulled over and were taking pictures on their phones.  I got out my small video camera and attempted to record the object but it would not appear on my camera.  I kept the camera rolling however to at least capture the audio of our conversation.  My friend called both 911 and NBC5 news to report what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My car got  separated from theirs and they got close enough to the object where my girlfriend and my friends fiancée were both almost in tears because they were scared.  They followed Rt. 3o to Indiana and when they got to the city of Dyer, IN,  they reported that they had gotten really close to the object and then it disappeared.  By this time I was about 5 miles behind them and I could see the object clearly as a solid triangular object.  However when I got close to it, the object also appeared to just flicker out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I caught up with them in a parking lot in Scherriville, IN where my girlfriend got in the car with me and showed me some pictures she had taken on her phone. Only a single light was visible on all of her photos. As we talked in the parking lot about what had just occurred, my friends fiancée said that she “got a weird feeling that if we keep going east we will see it again.” I looked at her and my friend and said that we should probably head back home because I got a bad feeling about her last statement. However, my friend decide that maybe they should keep going east towards Merriville, IN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well they decided to keep going east on Rt. 30 and my girlfriend and I decided to head north on Indianapolis Boulevard. We stopped at a bookstore so I could try to relax after what just happened.  About 3 minutes after we had stopped at the bookstore, my friends fiancée called my girlfriend crying saying that the object did in face ‘reappear’ and it looked “a lot more menacing.” I told my girlfriend that I wanted to talk to my friend so she handed me the phone and I had his fiancée put me on the phone with him. He sounded kind of scared and he told me that he yelled at the object and the lights appeared to “flare up”.  I kept talking to him as I went outside with my girlfriend and we saw the object to the south east.  It appeared that there were one or two aircraft flying in the area of the object. I cannot say if they were commercial or military. I do know they were apparently circling and were flying pretty fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I got in my car and we drove south down Indianapolis Boulevard  back to RT. 30 and headed east. I called another one of my friends from Valparaiso, IN to tell him what was going on and to keep a lookout because it appeared to be heading his way as my girlfriend talked to my other friends fiancée. They decided to turn around about half way to Merriville, IN. We followed the object to I65 in Merriville where the object vanished.  We went home after that and my girlfriend was talking to my friends fiancée on the way home and all she kept saying was that she kept “wanting to look up”. We did notice that the aircraft that were circling the area were still there as we drove home on I80.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event lasted about an hour and a half.  It was first noticed at about 8 :00 PM.<n>

I kept watching it waiting to see the telltale blinking lights we see on all the planes.

He picked me up around 19:35 so that we could drive around town and enjoy each others&#39; presence. While we were driving North on Clovis Ave, between Dakota and Ashlan Ave, we spotted these strange flying objects (at 19:37) moving east.  It took about 2 minutes for them to be right in front of our view from when we first spotted them. Eight to ten bright, and silent objects flying surprisingly fast, and rapidly flashing white lights (that changed colors to red, purple, blue, yellow, and green). They were in a 4-2-4 formation; 4 on top, 2 in the middle and 4 on the bottom.  We immediately pulled over in the parking lot of the Clovis Recreation Center.  We sat there for 7 minutes, staring in awe.  We failed to have any type of media equipment suitable for capturing the moments that were happening.  The objects then, 2 at a time, began to separate and flew faster than the rest (going towards the ea! st hills/mountains).  At that same time, we noticed an airplane flying in the sky.  We could quickly tell, due to the red and green slow flashing lights and the noise it made.  After, we drove towards the hills/mountains to try to catch up to them.  We were not fast enough, but we did see them disappear.<n>

It was a cloudless night except for a round shape black cloud covering the moon. It did not look like a cloud it looked like smoke. It held its shape and when it dissipated it stayed in one place. The second time was a whole different sighting. I was on my patio in back of the house and it was dusk, sun was below the horizon but still plenty of light. To the west I saw one again. It got darker and was not solid, like a round cloud but not like a cloud within the circle. It was not perfectly round. Sorta like a mortar firework puff. Anyway, it dissipated slowly in the same place. Then another one formed, got darker and looked the same as the first one. But then I saw a little black dot like like a pencil point travel from the cloud that was going away and where it stopped another one formed. It formed there then the dot moved and another one formed. When they dissipated it ! was over.There was a branch on the neighbors yard and a limb with leaves stuck out closely to the right of this happening and it all happened in exactly the same place. I searched the internet. I was about to give up seeing anything about this, then I saw a pic of one up close and it is amazing. Shows black strands, not straight, that were real black. Looks like they are like when u drain a bathtub and the little tornado like swirls around the main draining. I can find the website again and get the pic or u can find it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MIG: http://ufomig.bravehost.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As we were watching it it would turn directions while the triangle maintained its shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:55 pm I called Frankfort, IL 911 they said that there was multiple calls regarding the sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I did the only thing I could, as I had no camera besides my camera phone which was not a very good at taking clear picture. So I started driving towards the UFO to get a better shot from a closer distance. after 30 miles we were into Indiana and the UFO was just a little too far out of Camera Range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were driving towards Indiana There was a lot of people sitting on the side of the road taking pictures. I never stopped to get any numbers and I would love to be able to contact those people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were driving into Indiana. The lights dimmed down as we saw 6 lights coming out of the south the strobe colors on the new lights were RED WHITE AND BLUE and they were fast movers. I think they were the air force because they circled the area for over an hour. I called all of my friends and family that were in the area and they went outside to look but they were too far away at the time. I also called channel 2, 5, &amp; 7 news and they said that they would look into it through the police blotters. I left my number and so far I haven&#39;t gotten a call back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I&#39;m hoping that someone comes forward with pictures or videos that we can submit to the UFO hunters or the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never got a good picture of the Craft but we saw the objects for over 2.5 hours. The lights on the craft would switch from red to a bright orange about an half inch wide in the sky which is pretty big. there is no way this could be an airplane or a weather balloon or flares, because the lights would go out for a while then go back to a higher intensity and change color but it always kept the same formation. I lived outside of a air force base and have seen a lot of different aircraft flying and I have never seen anything like it. It reminded me of the &#39;05 Tinley Park, IL sightings (which i saw too after my friend called me to look outside) If anyone has any pictures or videos please submit them. I am sorry I don&#39;t have any pictures but I will review the video some more and see if there is anything good on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n>

Since I live near the Boulder Municipal Airport when I saw two orbiting red spherical objects (they were orbiting each other) over in the west of where I live (which is slightly to the west of the airport) I called the police non-emergency line. As the phone was ringing I saw a slight flash of green come from the east. A solitary green sphere was floating right over where the airport is emitting occasional bursts of light. As I watched the three orb/spheres I told the police what was going on. Then I saw something I knew I should not tell them. The green orb detached two smaller green orbs that chased the two red orbs off to the north. When I went inside to email this off, the large green orb was still there. All the time there were aircraft passing by at normal flight altitudes but what I found disconcerting was the fact that I could not hear the trains I normally hear this time of night going by on the tracks just under half a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So you know, I am a firm believer in UFOs and have twice before seen them but never this many in a single sitting, it has always been silver doughnut shaped UFOs before now and in pairs. Anyway I am a student and a retail sales person who is between jobs and schools. If you are wondering why I list a California address that is my permanent address and the address I live at now I am here for only a few more weeks. The address in Boulder at which this happened is 4832 Baldwin Place, Boulder, CO<n>
