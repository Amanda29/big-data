As I look at it through the L of my thumb and index finger now as an adult, the rectangle void was 5&#34; High, the length of my Index finger and was 9&#34; Long or Wide the projection from my thumb angled out including the length of my thumb from the bottom of my index finger.  It was almost like the size of a business envelope resting on the L angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This triangle was empty looking as though it was a void. The odd thing was that the stars that were surrounding the object were shining as usual in the sky, there were no lights flashing or edging the object but and blackness of the void was blacker as though it was a black mirror which was different than the sky with the stars. It looked like a door into another dimension.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents told me it was just a lack of stars because there was no moonlight and insisted I close the car window. Several years ago when I started to hear the people on your show talk about the triangles I was hoping someone would talk about rectangles but so far haven&#39;t heard anyone talk about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, if you put several triangles together you can have a rectangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget seeing this void, this emptiness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even at that age I felt as though it was Big Brother watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Size of a half dollar coin at arms length, had a neon orange glow. No sound, Shape well defined, Sky dark and clear, 30-40 degree temp. Observed for approx. 2 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was sighted from a &#34;Ground Observer Corp&#34;. post on the roof of a hotel in Aberdeen SD.It was in November, around the 15th. The weather was clear and cold. At about 18:30 hrs we stepped out of our shelter building on the roof to get a bit of fresh air. As we walked toward the roof edge we noticed an orange eliptical shape traveling towards us at a fairly slow rate of speed. When it was first noticed it, it was about 25 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to travel straight south to north and directally above the main street below. As it approached, the shape changed to a more circular shape. when it was directally over head it appeared circular. As it continued North, it again took on a more eliptical shape. We returned to the shelter where we called in the sighting to the G.O.C. reporting station in Huron SD, 90 miles due South of our location. The officer taking our report indicated that an object of the same description had been sighted at their location about 3 minutes earlier, it was traveling North. It&#39;s shape was well defined against a fairly black winter night sky. Some air glow was present but planets and stars were visible. Both of the observers were highschool students who had signed up to be Ground Observers and were on their normal shift. Although we felt there was little chance of us seeing a foriegn military plane at our location, we did keep good track of all civilian aircraft in and out of the airport some 8 miles to the East of our location. During the week and during the previous week there had been several reports by ranchers of cattle mutilations so we were especially watchfull for non aircraft in the skys. It was reported on the local radio station that theres on the North edge of town had also seen the object about the same time as we had seen it a few miles South of their location. Thgis sighting was near the end of a week long series of sightings around the state.<n>
