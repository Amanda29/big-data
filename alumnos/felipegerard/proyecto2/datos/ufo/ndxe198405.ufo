It was a clear night and I had went outside comming out of the garage into the driveway facing east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and saw a large Triangle shaped object fly directly overhead at a low altitude (500 -1000 Feet?}. It&#39;s flight path was aprox south-west. There where no lights but I could clearly see the outline of the craft against the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no engine noise at all but I could hear the craft push the through the air, almost like a glider. This was no glider..It was flying under power. I had only told two people this. Then tonight (2-24-05} when the ABC special was comming on I told my 9 year old daughter what happened. Then I saw on the special about the triangle crafts that made no sound..WOW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was driving my family back to Detroit. Their was 8 of us in the car that night. My aunt and uncle were 20 minutes ahead of us in a different car and seen the same thing. We saw a bright light streaking back and forth across the entire sky range. It did this 3 or 4 times. To travel this distance, this event got everyones attention in the car and other cars on M-53 that night. Their was 8 of us that night in the car. It came North real fast and stopped right above the road. we stopped the car almost right under it. It was so close we could of hit it with a rock. It was a shape of unknown and was completely silent. Their was a haze around one side of the object that made the sky look distorted. The radio signal in the car went dead but the car did not stall. We all got out of the car and the same with the other cars on the road that night. This was around 11 pm or so. It hovered there for a few minutes and then  speed off east in an instant . Alot of cars followed us immediatly to the Romeo State Plolice and filed a report that  night of the incident. They said they had similar reports in the area about an half hour after that in that area. A few minutes after we left the initial area we saw a few of the army aircraft planes  going over the same area we saw the object area but their top speed was now where as fast as this object was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

5/15/84 23:00|Winchester|VA|Circle|6 seconds|I spent many hours looking at stars as preparation for navigation with a sailboat using a sextant|7/5/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08171.html|4|ndxe198405| I spent many hours looking at stars as preparation for navigation with a sailboat using a sextant<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was laying on my on my back at about 11:00 in the evening studying stars for navigational purposes. I observed a round disk coming from the Washington DC area with what looked like small wires on the perifery as it rotated. It took a 90 degree left turn and proceeded down the Shenandoah Valley, The total time was about 6 seconds. I inhaled and waited for an explosion due to the speed involved. There never was a sound. I have 1600 hours flying and never have seen anything like it.In August or Sept.of that year, Popular Mechanics or Science featured a craft like it on its cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

5/15/84 18:45|Flower Mound|TX|Disk|10 seconds|The glowing disc came from the South in the evening sky and silently moved North at a high rate of speed.|2/25/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26898.html|5|ndxe198405| The glowing disc came from the South in the evening sky and silently moved North at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was living with my older brother and his family in Flower Mound, Texas, looking for work in the Dallas/Ft Worth metroplex.  It was early evening after we had finished the our evening meal.  I stepped outside in the backyard to smoke a cigarette and sat on a garden chair just off the patio.  It was a clear sky; I could easily count the stars.  The residential neighborhood was just West of the flight patterns of the DFW airport.  The sky was frequently dotted with planes of all types approaching to land, or nose-up to gain altitude away from the busy airport.  The sun had not completely set; objects high in the sky were catching the sun&#39;s last rays and were very bright with the illumination.  I was looking NNW.  Suddenly from the South a bright round disc silently moved across the sky.  Having seen many jets fly in a similar direction, I was quickly aware of how much faster this object was moving...my conclusion was this was not a jet.  Because of the sunlight it appeared to be slightly yellow, but mostly white.  I did not write the exact date down anywhere because I knew no one would believe me, later.  1984 is the year, for sure.  I remember it was not yet a typical hot Texas summer...late Spring.  I am very surprised to see no record or report from anyone about this sighting.  With so many people in that region of Texas someone else had to have seen it.  Because of the similarity to the flight paths to/from DFW and the many passenger jets I had watched while in Flower Mound, this was a very large craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

5/5/84 22:00|Cloquet|MN|Other|1hr55min|Myself, a friend, two 9-yr old children watched a pulsating craft hover over the St.Louis River in Cloquet, just at the edge of town.|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15944.html|8|ndxe198405| Myself, a friend, two 9-yr old children watched a pulsating craft hover over the St.Louis River in Cloquet, just at the edge of town.  I lived on a hill, giving an excellent view of the river and the craft from about 1/4 mile away.  My friend and I had just returned from a coffee and pie outing at the local Perkins.  We walked around to the back of the house and entered through the sliding glass door.  The two children were in an almost hysterical state, shouting about the &#34;tornado&#34; which had passed over our house at a very low level.  I tried to calm them down, and told them to draw me a picture of what they had seen (in separate rooms).  They drew virtually identical pictures of an upside-down &#34;ice cream cone&#34;  with spinning marks and colored lights.  They estimated that it barely cleard the top of my 1-story rambler.  It continued to the river and either landed or hovered just above the opposite bank. (north of our house.  Evidently it had come from the south &amp; traveled north.  As we spoke, the kids pointed to where the object still was, on or near the river bank.  I saw only a red (sometimes light green) pulsating light on or near the river bank.  We watched it for 1 hour and 55 minutes exactly.  During this time, it kept getting brighter; then dimmer.  As it brightened, it seemed to become larger.  I watched it thru binoculars, but could not make out a shape behind the light.  My friend, the kids, and the 15 year old babysitter, watched and talked.  Toward the end of the sighting, it did some spectacular things; the babysitter had gone home, but my friend stayed and watched with us.  During the time we watched, we all tried to come up with some type of explanation for what it could be; we all concluded that it could not be human made; it was just too bizarre looking.  There was no road or path it could have taken to get where it was.  It was basically a swamp.  We went there the following day to see if it had left any evidence of itself; it had not.  We had to go on foot, climbing over fallen tree! s, etc. Anyway, just after 11:30, it suddenly turned an intense white, shot to the center of the river, and dispensed a laser-like dirty-white light onto the river. This lasted about 5 minutes or so.  Then it suddenly turned that intense white again and took off up to the top of the opposite river bank; a distance of approx. 1/4 mile.  So now it was a full 1/2 mile away.  It stopped above the only other house in the area; a new, large multi-level home.  The object shined a spotlight-type light that lit up the whole house and the yard; it looked like a helicopter search light, but much larger and brighter.  The house lights had previously been off, but when this light show happened, all the house lights came on.  I don&#39;t know if they actually saw this thing; and I haven&#39;t called them or discussed it with them.  The owner is the county court administrator, and currently the mayor of Cloquet.  I was just too embarrassed to ask a county official if he had seen the ufo.  I was also too embarrassed to make a report right away.  The next day I did call the local police to see if anyone else had made a report; none had.  After about 2-4 minutes of scoping out this new house, the ufo suddenly brightened and shot off over the top of the hill and out of sight.  I told the kids to go to bed; that they&#39;d never see anything like that during their lives.  I barely got out that statement when Zoom!! Back it came, shined its blinding whit light DIRECTLY AT US for several seconds before shooting off to the north and out of sight.  The movements of this &#34;thing&#34; were completely unbelievable.  It moved so fast that it reminded me of a child playing a flashlight on a wall in the dark.  Nothing moves that fast.  It&#39;s impossible!!  During the sighting, the kids flicked on the floodlights to see if it would respond. It did.  The kids turned the lights (6 of them) on and off three times.  The object responded by brightening three times.  I had the feeling it could hear what we were saying and thinking, because of the ways it seemed to r! espond t o us.  The weather was completely clear, no moon visible.  No wind at all.  About 5 minutes after it left, however, a heavy fog came rolling down the river west to east, and completely obscured the view.<n>

5/1/84 20:00|Burnsville|MN|Rectangle|5 mins.|Enormous Rectangle object with rows of red and white lights|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70389.html|10|ndxe198405| Enormous Rectangle object with rows of red and white lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> In either the spring or fall of 1983 or 1984 while driving down Highway 13 in Burnsville, MN I saw something unbelievable.  It was approx between 8:30-9pm and I was driving eastbound on highway 13.  I noticed through the upper right corner of my windshield HUGE lights.  At first I thought it was a blimp because it was moving so slowly SW to NE.  It was so odd that I pulled off the road so I could get a better look at it.  There was a football game going on at the Burnsville high school and so I initially thought it was a blimp that was going to hover over the field with a display like the American Flag?  But, it had rows of lights (one row of red the next row white with several rows) but after pulling onto the side of the road and I got a better look at it I saw there were only rows of red and white and it was a rectangle shape and wasn&#39;t a blimp.  It was enormous, I&#39;d have to guess it was close to the size of a football field at minimum.  I remember wondering how it stayed afloat because it was moving so slow.  So I rolled my window down so I could hear if there was any engine noise.  There was possibly a faint hum at best, but it was hard for me to tell because cars were passing by and it wasn&#39;t quiet enough.  I sat and watched it slowly move out of sight and there was one other car in front of me that had also pulled off the road.  I never spoke to the person/s in the car in front of me, now I wish I would have so we could have shared observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been on my way to meet a group of friends at Burnsville Bowl, when I arrived they asked why I was so late.  I remember looking at my watch, but since it&#39;s been so many years ago I cannot remember how late I was or how much time I was missing.  I know I was confused because I had told them I saw some weird cool lights but had only sat on the side of the road for maybe 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never reported the sighting because I was convinced that HUNDREDS of people would have seen the same thing I had because of it&#39;s size and slow speed and surely many people would call it in!  I did faithfully watch the news for the next few days hoping I&#39;d hear about it but never did.  I&#39;m regretful that I did not report the sighting then because now I cannot provide an accurate date or time.  Now I think I understand why so few photographs exist, because while it was happening I was unable to take my eyes off of it and was completely mesmerized!  I may not have an exact time/date, but I will not forget what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I do not know how long I was outside looking at the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the house, where my two teenage daughter&#39;s and a boy friend was, and told them to come look at what I had been watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I don&#39;t know how long we were outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden the LIGHT started toward us, (going east) it took some time,  and then I thought it was a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound, it was triangular in shape, and 2 or 3 different colored lights besides the white light in the center and dark in color.

5/1/84 18:00|Joliet|IL|Circle|3 minutes|Driving with Mom and saw a grey disk hovering over trees on the corner of our street|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57583.html|12|ndxe198405| Driving with Mom and saw a grey disk hovering over trees on the corner of our street<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hadn&#39;t thought about this in quite some time, but after the recent media attention about &#34;Out of the Blue,&#34; I Googled &#34;ufo&#34; and found this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1984, when I was 15, I was driving home with my Mom from the store. It was dusk, so there was still some light left. We were heading down Caton Farm Road, which, at the time, was just a two lane &#34;countryish&#34; road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were roughly a half mile from our street, we noticed a very bright white light up ahead just over the trees. It was completely out of place and we wondered out loud what it was. As we got closer and were able to see what was responsible for the light, and I think we about crapped our pants. There was a huge grey, metal disk just hovering above the trees over our neighbors house at the corner of our street. It was completely still. I wish I could say how big it was, but I honestly couldn&#39;t say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Mom pulled over on the side of Caton Farm, a couple hundred yards away from it, at which point I flew out of the car and ran towards it. My Mom, of course, got out of the car and started screaming bloody murder for me to come back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood on the corner of my street and Caton Farm and just stared at the thing. It was above the trees (maybe a hundred feet) and shining a white light down that lit up my neighbors back yard. I can&#39;t remember how long it sat there in the sky, but it wasn&#39;t more than a minute or so. When it left, it was really surreal, because it looked like it wasn&#39;t moving that fast, but it disappeared from my sight so quickly. It just went up and then followed Caton Farm until it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never been so excited as when I saw that thing. The first thing I did when I got home was to call both the police station and the local airport to see if anyone else had reported it. No one had, unfortunately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Mom wouldn&#39;t talk about it with me and would get mad if I tried to bring it up. I think it really scared her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, I couldn&#39;t wait to tell everyone in my Earth Science class. I picked that class because the teacher was really cool, and we always had great discussions about weird stuff. Needless to say, I was just about laughed out of the classroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told a few other people over the next couple of years, but after hearing &#34;are you sure it wasn&#39;t a helicopter&#34; one too many times, I never talk about it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until I found this site, I thought I was one in a million to see such a thing. I&#39;m glad to know I&#39;m not. I just wish the government would come clean with what they know. I hate the fact that I saw this amazing thing and have no idea what it means. At any rate, I&#39;m so glad I got to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
