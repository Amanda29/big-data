6/30/80 23:00|Grand Rivers|KY|Flash|instant|Bright blue flash which lit up the night sky like a blue neon daylight.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85903.html|1|ndxe198006| Bright blue flash which lit up the night sky like a blue neon daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had three different experiences.  This is the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.  I was working an evening or overnight shift (I can&#39;t remember which or exactly what time it was but it was well into the night) in a local rock quarry and was high on a rock pile in my quarry dump truck so that I could see above the tree line and obstacles and out across our large lake, Kentucky Lake.  I was looking roughly south and southwest.  From somewhere behind me came a massive blue flash which lit up the sky almost to the level of daylight.  I could see the horizon in front of me for miles just as if it were daylight except it was a brilliant blue color.  I thought it must be some sort of nuclear attack or explosion and I waited for the shock wave for probably a minute.  During this time I contemplated taking my truck the 2 miles to my house because if I were going to die, I wanted to be home with my family.  These trucks are very large and not street legal so the thing I was contemplating seriously would have gotten me in a lot of trouble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I composed myself and drove down off my rock pile and returned to the quarry where I was now facing in a north / north-easterly direction.  The sky off in the distance (if I had to estimate, I&#39;d say 8 to 12 miles away, had (from memory) about 5 planes circling in the general direction where the blast came from.  I never heard a sound with the blast.  This area is an hour&#39;s drive by Interstate 24 from Fort Campbell Army base where the 101st Airborne Division is based.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shaken up pretty badly for a while.  I&#39;m sure I must have discussed this event with some of the other workers at the time but can&#39;t remember those conversations.  Nothing of this event ever showed up in any local media.  I suppose it could have been a meteor but that wouldn&#39;t explain the circling planes in the area where the blast must have originated.  I was absolutely perplexed at the time.  Now, after several other experiences, I feel the event must have been a UFO encounter with a military jet.  I have only spoken with a few people about my belief in UFO&#39;s and have found two other people who have had dramatic daylight experiences.  I&#39;ll encourage them to make posts here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Driving through Athens, Texas; Tyler toward Waco, left turn.   At turn to left was church and just above saw green and red light, round but undefined, moving randomly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the unique nature of the light, I pulled to the side of the road to observe, thought the light may be from helicopter but realized the movement was to fast and to mobile.  The light moved as a spot light would on the bottom of clouds with random movement but there were no clouds and the lights appeared autonomous.  There were no beams associated either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then instantly the light moved at a high speed, just off vertical (greater than f-16 climb rate by factor of 8-10) and apparent size diminished to the vanishing point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I however did not write to tell you that I had a dream on the Ranch that a UFO was hoovering over our house on the ranch.  There was telepathic communication going on from the Craft to me in my dream-state.  They told me that they have known me since I was about 8 years old and was aware of my age at the time of the dream.  It was so vivid that I woke up and looked out the window as the sun was piercing through the window as I had the curtain pulled/drawn back.  What was stranger was back in high school alone in my bedroom I was in a sleep coming out of a sleep (meaning my eyes where alert and I could feel the bed) Something was literally PULLING me like a force as I was on the bed.  I recall Digging into the Sheets with my fingernails.  It was my way to stop whatever it was trying to suck me out of my bed.  At that moment I was laying in bed in Shock.  I could not yell, nor talk.  All I could feel was muscle spasms in my leg doing down my knee and I could actually hear my body making the noise.  Then about several minutes or more I was finally able to get up and move around.  Also by the time I was age 6 years old I have been gifted with seeing the Future and Predicting Events or things before they happen.  I find it odd that, I have now seen in my life time 2 Orange Round Disks, 1 Triangle Disk, 1 Pinkish Translucent Craft shaped like a Fly, 1 Round/White Disk.   I don&#39; understand why I have been able to see these objects so much and that includes seen most of them with WITNESSES to boot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We usually do not concern ourselves with alleged dreams, but we include this report, principally because the source has included other, seemingly credible, reports.

6/30/80 00:00|Clinton|MO|Rectangle|30 40 minutes|Repeated Encounter in about 1980|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62216.html|7|ndxe198006| Repeated Encounter in about 1980<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have an incident that seems unique in the fact that the object repeatedly engaged me and two other friends over 30 to 40 minutes. I know that many years have passed, so this event may not be of interest. I just haven&#39;t heard of a story quite like this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time we lived in a small town, so we all agreed not to tell anyone about it, feeling we would be ridiculed.  Now, after all these years, we&#39;ve only just began to contact each other and recall exactly what happened that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all about 20 years old or so.  I&#39;m not sure what year it was, but me and 2 friends were riding around in my car in Clinton, MO.  It was a boring night riding in circles around the Clinton Square, which is where all the kids hung out.  We decided to go see a friend in Windsor, MO, which was about 25 miles away.  As we were on the way, heading east on highway 52, I happened to see a flashing, blinking object on the horizon to my left, and mentioned it to my friends. It seemd to be blinking different colored lights that were unusual. They took notice, but resumed talking about whatever. I kept watching it as they talked and noticed it was coming closer to us from my left. (I was driving so I could see it better than them.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object now came within a half mile or so, I interrupted my friends and said that they should take a look at this thing since it seemed like it was going to fly over us.  I shut off the stereo and as it approached it was obviously very large.  It had various stationary and blinking lights in a configuration that I can&#39;t quite describe, but as it flew over us, we only knew it was very large.  It slowly flew over us - I mean only 10 or 20 miles an hour at maybe 150 or 200 feet.  Right over us, but we couldn&#39;t figure out a shape.  Just BIG... and NO SOUND.  We hung our heads out the windows and looked up as it slowly flew over us.  It didn&#39;t make sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We coasted along the highway and began talking about what it could have been as it headed toward our right-hand horizon.  As we talked and watched the object fade off in the distance, we eventually speeded back up and continued down the highway.  We soon realized the object was coming back toward us. (but from several miles away)  It seemed to be on an intercept course with our progress down the highway.  As it approached within about a quarter mile or so, I noticed that there was a circular light below the object.  As if there was a beam of light shining toward the ground, but you couldn&#39;t see the beam, but only a patch of light on the ground below the object.  There were strip pits in the surrounding area, so it was very strange seeing the patch of light floating up and down the hills below the object as it approached us.  I yelled at my friends when I saw it and we all became very uneasy about it.  Now it was upon us and just to the side, about the height of 3 or 4 telephone poles up.  It turned to parallel us and matched our speed, which was now only 10 or 20 miles an hour.  Weird blinking lights, maybe strobing or rotating, but very hard to describe, even just after the incident.  NO SOUND.  Not a whisper.  We still couldn&#39;t make out a specific shape, even though it was right over us. Only the lights that seemed to defy any aircraft-type shape.  Kind of like a big box, but nothing we could actually describe within reason.  We all had our heads hanging out the windows, looking up at it: RIGHT OVER US and it banked and flew toward the horizon to our forward, left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked at each other in disbelief again until one of my friends yelled: &#34;Chase it!&#34; I speeded up, but didn&#39;t realize that we were now within the city limits (and speed zone) of Windsor.  Now there were familiar flashing lights in my rear view mirror and we were pulled over.  I told my friends NOT to say we were chasing a friggin UFO and they agreed.  The Windsor cop walked up to my door and put his hands on the ledge of my door... I kid you not, he had &#34;L.O.V.E&#34; tatooed on his left hand fingers and &#34;H.A.T.E&#34; tattooed on his right. This night was getting wierder as it went on.  After he asked for my driver&#39;s license, I realized that I had left it on my dresser at home.  He asked my name and I told him it was ((name deleted)).  He went back to his car for a while as we chattered about what had happened with the object. The cop was the furthest thing from our mind.  He soon returned and told me he didn&#39;t have any record of a &#34;((name deleted))&#34; from Clinton, MO.  I corrected him on the name and he went to his car again.  We were now laughing about Barney Fife, but still trying to figure out what that thing could have been.  The cop returned again, now with a dumbfounded look since he had messed my name up again.  He said we should follow him &#34;downtown&#34; to the police station.  I gladly agreed and followed him there.  We went inside and he introduced me to the &#34;Chief&#34; who quickly pulled me up on his computer, showing me as Barry Wilder.  No Problem and thank you for your time.  We were quickly released.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we walked toward the door, one of us said: &#34;Wouldn&#39;t it be weird if that thing was still out there?&#34; We stepped out the door and looked to our right... There it was, about a mile or two down the road and seemingly hovering. We jumped into the car and gave chase again.  As we headed toward it, it began about a mile-wide cirlcle. We saw an dirt path that lead up to a small hilltop.  There were no trees or anything around it, only this &#34;bald hill&#34; as we called it later.  We stopped the car and got out as we watched the object circling toward us.  It was as if we knew it would fly to us.  It did.  It came directly over us at a speed of maybe 20 miles an hour.  We stood there in disbelievment as it flew directly over us.  Again, NO SOUND.  Nothing.  The sound of the mild wind blowing past our ears was louder.  It slowly flew over us and headed away for the last time.  We looked at each other in disbelief, but when we turned to look at it again, it seemed as if it was much farther away that it should have been at the speed it flew over us.  Soon it was over the horizon and gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I seem vague about dates and times it is only because after the event my friends and I decided it would be best not to tell anyone about it since it sounded so rediculous.  We lived in a small town and people would not understand what had happened.  Because of this, it kind of faded into my past.  I moved away soon after the incident so we didn&#39;t have much of a chance to talk about it until years later.  I just spoke with one of my friends and asked him about his recollection of the events.  As we spoke, he said that we actually turned around to follow it after the first pass.  I don&#39;t remember doing that, but we probably did.  I think if we all got together, we could work out the exact sequence of events.  It wasn&#39;t like a &#34;sighting&#34;... It was more like an ongoing encounter that we couldn&#39;t quite grasp, so I think we all just tried to forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date and time could be verified by the Windsor Police Department, unless Barney Fife is in charge of records. They could also verify that we weren&#39;t drunk, on drugs or just crazy.  We were straight as a board and completely sane.  In the years since, two of us have become upstanding citizens and business owners.  The other one has been gone and not much in contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this sounds a little unbelievable, but I&#39;d like to get together with my other two friends and refresh each other&#39;s memories as to the exact, cronological sequence of events. I would then like to take lie detector tests to prove that this really happened.<n>

Seven o&#39;clock in the evening during June the sun is still quite high in the sky, but due to the thunder storms it was light, but not bright sunlight. Above us was clear blue sky for miles, so I discount the chance of any lightning strike any where near us. We were all sitting on a picnic table when all of a sudden we experienced a bright flash of light. All except my wife saw different colors, myself saw red, the brightest red I&#39;ve ever seen. The others saw blue and red. My wife remembers seeing bright white light. Thats all any of us can recall, except my wife, which was sitting right next to me, was getting up off the ground about 30 feet away to my right (west) of our position. We were all extremely bewildered at what had just happend. It all happened in a split second. We looked around for possible scorching on the ground in case of lightning, there was nothing. We left the area immediately. Later that evening we all experienced a painful neck. My wife had severe pain in her pelvic area, hips and lower back. My wife went on to carry our first born for 10 months with no problems during delivery. The baby was dehyderated but was healthy. She is currently a sophmore in college. We have two other kids, The second, a boy is extremely bright straight A&#39;s all his life (a sophmore in high school). His TAP test scores are in the 99% of the nation. The third, a girl, is a bright girl and a gifted athlete. She is currently a sixth grader. All of these kids were born less than a month of being exactly 4 yrs. apart.<n>
6/25/80 10:00|Cave Junction (outside of)|OR|Unknown|5 minutes|Men In Black Encounter in Oregon|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60351.html|10|ndxe198006| Men In Black Encounter in Oregon<n> <n><n> <n><n> In aprox. 1980, on a late spring day, I was driving up to Oregon when I somehow got off on a logging road which was winding along a steep mountain. After a while, I noticed that the road was narrowing, and I was afraid to follow it any further. I decided to try and turn my car around, and drive back to Cave Junction, Oregon which was about 30 minutes away. As I was backing up the car, it went off of the road, and the rear end of the car was off the road and the car was tottering. I slowly got out, and was trying to figure out how to get my dogs out, which were in their kennel in the back of the car. If I tried to reach them, the car could tumble down the cliff. While I was trying to decide what to do, a big car pulled up, and 4 tall oriental men, with a strange skin tone, ( too orange ) got out of the car. In spite of the 100+ degree heat of the day, they were all wearing black trench coats.  I said Hello, and they did not reply. Without a word, they went to the front of my car, and picked it up, and sat it back in the road, facing the direction back to home.  I do not think that even twice that number of humans could have lifted my car from the front end only and place it on the road. I do not remember how I got past their car, or they passed mine, as they were headed up the fire break road as I was originally as well. The after thought of the encounter left me really scared, and as soon as I was back in town, I rented a hotel room and slept for a couple of days. This experience is also written about in Dongo’s The Alien Tide (pg 16) I apologize for reporting this some 40 years later. Those weird men on the mountain saved our lives, but they still scared me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/24/80 14:00|Mount Weather (near Leesburg)|VA|Unknown|possibly 5 hours|Missing Time: Two People|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49998.html|11|ndxe198006| Missing Time: Two People<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I have a long history of UFO sightings/involvement.  It&#39;s highly possible that there was an abduction experience when I was not quite three, and my mother was 23, involving not only us but a busload of soldiers en route to Augusta, GA, in 1957.  But when the incident I&#39;m reporting now happened, I was around 25, and my mother was 45.  I had driven from my suburban Alexandria home to visit my mother in Front Royal, VA, and we decided it was a lovely summer afternoon for a drive.  We went on one of our old favorite rides: to a nearby mountain where an airliner had crashed a number of years before, just up the road from a semisecret military installation.  The road led through some beautiful countryside, and we&#39;d always enjoyed taking leisurely drives and talking about life in general.  My mother and I had seen many UFOs, both together and separately, and had, as mentioned earlier, a bizarre bus trip when I was very young, but on this summer day the conversation was light, and the subject matter was strictly terrestrial... except, of course, for our traditional speculation on what went on at that semisecret military complex out in the boondocks yet so close to DC.  We were travelling north in bright sunlight early in the afternoon... then the next thing we remember, we were travelling south, about 20 miles from where we last remembered being, and the sun was almost setting.  We both seemed to be coming out of a brain fog -- speech was very difficult.  My mother spoke first, saying in effect &#34;How did we get here, and how can it be this late?&#34; It took great effort for me to respond that I had no idea.  We literally did not say another word for the remaining forty minutes of the trip -- very unusual for two chatty sorts, especially given the circumstances.  I could not comprehend how I could have been driving in such an apparent fugue state, and that both of us were in the same condition was quite disturbing.  Neither of us could remember a single thing that had happened to us during the five or so hours just past... and neither of us were capable of talking about it -- or talking about anything else, at that time.  Even years later, it was exceedingly difficult for us to discuss the incident beyond the bare known facts, and both of us vividly recalled the incredible introversion of our thoughts on the way back to her house.  But we both, as we managed to admit to each other years later, were positive that we had seen &#34;something,&#34; that a craft (UFO) was involved.  Our difficulty talking about this event even years later seemed perhaps the result of a mental block of some sort placed by an outside source.  Especially given our individual and shared histories with UFO sightings (also witnessed by others numerous times), there was little doubt in either of us that we&#39;d had an intense and lengthy encounter with something, and some entities, decidedly not of this world.  The roads we were travelling  My mother was an accountant for a furniture/appliance store, and I was a chef/restaurant owner (physically a bit disabled now, thanks to years of heavy lifting, etc.) and am now a professional artist and writer.  This report is probably only the first in a somewhat long line -- it&#39;s time I deal openly with the strangeness in my life that seems to have revolved around UFOs, and this is step one.  I&#39;m very open to discussing the full range of experiences and incidents with an investigator, if you or an associate are interested.  I will also consider hypnosis in order to penetrate the mental veil concealing the two incidents of missing time, providing that the hypnotherapist is reputable and well-versed in probable abduction incidents.

It was 8 pm but still quite light out as this was in summer.  It was heading north and I decided to follow it.  As I made a left onto Waldermire Drive I followed the craft as far as I could.  The object was round and metallic (I could see sun light reflection).  As I made this turn I caught a quick glimpse of the rear view of the object.  It had two half circles with a rod connecting these two half circles.  So in other words this object had two half round sides with something connecting them in between.  The side view showed a round metallic shere.  The rear showed two half spheres.  As I made the left turn onto Wlademire Drive there were a man and woman at their parked car and she was pointing at this object.  I kept driving to follow it.  I did eventually lose sight of it as there was no way to follow because of the direction it was traveling and the road did not go that way.  It was flying low.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My whole family was at my Aunt&#39;s house in a housing project we saw a light coming towards us, we were joking around look, look a UFO, everybody&#39;s laughing also. All of a sudden as it got close we noticed tht this was not an airplane or helicopter, we saw a yellow to orange oval shape on the bottem of the craft, so everybody starts sreaming, it went over our condo, so we all ran out to the hallway, they are open hallways in Puerto Rico. we saw it again on top of us, all of a sudden it turns on to its side, and you can see its like a ball of fire but oval, then around the sides there were lights of all colors, it stays like this for about 20 seconds then it turns right and heads into El Yunque (Puerto Rico&#39;s tropical Forest) and it zooms out of sight. This also happened the next night. My father, mother sisters, aunt&#39;s, grandmother, cousina all saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Here is my verbatim letter dated June 19, 1980.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sunday, June 15, 1980, at approximately 9:45 p.m. I witnessed two unidentified flying objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I noticed lightning from my bedroom window.  I did not hear any noise and as I approached the window I realized it was not raining.  The lightning was blinking behind my neighbor’s house.  As I scanned the city from my view I saw a UFO.  It was a weird design as I have illustrated here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These are red lights.  (Drawing)  It flashed one second and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I focused my attention on the lightning behind my neighbor’s house and all of a sudden it stopped and a flying saucer ascended high above the neighbor’s roof.  The saucer appeared dark then lights went on.  It’s green and transparent so I could readily see it was occupied by one person.  The lights are brilliant and illuminated around the saucer and below the scene created a beautiful pattern.  It was immobile a few seconds then the lights went out and it disappeared.  For the next two minutes the lightning reappeared while far away in the distance the other UFO flashed once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the last I saw of the two UFO’s.<n>

We were near the intersection of Bell Rd. and Mufreesboro Rd. travelling south, when we noticed a very large object that looked like a giant dumbbell in the sky.  I saw on the dash radio when we got out it was 9:42pm as immediately prior to the beginning of the incident I was changing the radio station.  The object came in very slow from the NE, and then turned paralell to the road we were on.  It came to a stop.  As it came to a stop another vehicle, a station wagon, stopped with us.  Out of it got a man, a woman, a boy, and a oyung girl. We estimated it to be about a half of a mile to a mile away.  It appeared to hover.  There was no sound of any type eminating from it.  About five minutes or so after it stopped in the air, three triangular ships approached it from the NE also at a high rate of speed, and took up positions rotating about it.  This relationship was maintained by all the ships with the three triangular ships were rotating horizontally, with their apparent noses pointing towards the dumbbell shaped craft in a counter clockwise manner.   We maintained this observation for some ten minutes, until the dumbell craft moved SSE about three ship lengths of itself, abruptly turned to a 60 degree upward pitch, and literally went up instantly.  The starfield around the ship seemed to bend towards it.  Almost as quickly, the three triangular ships turned upward, as if in pursuit of it.  They seemed to be reacting to the dumbbell ships actions, and were visibly slower in their acceleration towards it. When we got in the car it was 10:24pm, and we seemed disturbed by the incident because the amount of time we spent outside the vehicle seemed to be no more than 15 to 20 minutes.  Not the slightly over forty.<n>

There was no electricity for many hours, so my husband and I decided to cook our dinner on our outdoor barbeque and invite our neighbor over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat on the back porch and it was around 9 p.m., when the three of us went into the backyard. From the corner of my eye, I saw something coming fast and looked up, as did my neighbor.  My husband was looking in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A disk/saucer shape that glowed light orange-white was racing across the sky, slightly skipping/shifting from side to side.  Since there was no electricity, there was no light pollution and we got a good look.  It was about the size of a tablet of aspirin held at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it long enough that I began to crouch down afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went across the sky in about 8 seconds and then tilted up into the night and disappeared -- I&#39;ve never forgotten it and wonder if anyone else saw it. There was no sound -- it was completely quiet.<n>

I was 15 at the time, and was with my boyfriend who was 22 at the time. We were walking along the beach, and had stopped to watch what we thought were buoys bouncing in the tide. There were lights on top, which we did not find unusual, as this is (was) the case with many buoys. They are frequently placed at a distance close enough for swimmers, and far out enough for boaters. I was soothed by the motion of the lights. After a few minutes, I couldn&#39;t say exactly how many, the lights lifted and hovered. They stayed in that hovering position for about 30 or 40 seconds, then flew off. It was not a lazy, slow type of flight, but very fast. They took off to the left of us and were out of sight before I could even blink an eye. I had never, and have not to this day, seen anything that fast in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought I must have been imagining the whole thing, but when I asked my boyfriend, he confirmed to me that he had seen the same thing. We went back to that spot the next day, just to see if the buoys were really there, which they were. But, they had no lights atop of them. I had my doubts about UFO&#39;s at the time, but they were quickly removed with that sighting. I have never had another sighting, though I would like to. I do not know the shape of the crafts, only that the lights were the predominent factor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My dad’s cousin and his wife and kids were camping with us, as was our yearly tradition.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our tents were on flat ground between the main dirt road and a hill.  On the other side of the road was the beach and then Lake Michigan.  I don&#39;t recall what was on the other side of the hill.  It was night, perhaps 8pm, and I was in the tent.  I think everyone else was out around the campfire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a commotion and came out.  Many people from other campsites, and my family, saw this 4-5 foot diameter green ball coming across the surface of the lake.  Its origin unknown and it appeared to be mere feet above the water the whole time, which was 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then floated across the beach, bounced off the road, and went over the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no reports of any incident in the papers the next day, despite the 20-30 witnesses.<n>

When the object was exactly due south of us,l it stopped as if aware it was being watched, paused for 2 seconds and then &#34;closed in on itself.&#34;  What I mean by that is that the outer diameter of the object reduced within a second from the size of a Ford Pinto to zero, ie nothing, ie it no longer existed. ZERO sound.  Local FAA called &amp; reported no radar objects.  Local weather station and University Meteroligical program called, &amp; they both confirmed that NO experiments had been scheduled.<n>

I did not speak freely about this to people for many years.but what I saw I will rewmember it like yesterday there were 5 rotating lights under it and a few windows on the side. I was scared because I thought they had saw me and didnt understand why they were here.but what strikes me very weird is that I used to draw very good but when I drew the apartments they looked good but I could not draw the craft.till 20 years later also now after 20 years I coppied the picture through my computer and drew what I saw.I also feel I have dreams that come true alot now and I have become a creator or inventor these days I am not sure if there is a link about that but maybe. my husband and I also developed thyroid disorders, I never gave it thought to conecting it until I read another story of a woman and her mother. all I know is we saw a craft from another world I have seen simular ones on ufo programs,I never go outside without looking in the sky first,I am so interested in ufo stories I am waiting for the world to have proof.3 weeks ago I dremt there were 11 ufos in the sky ,but last tues. there were 11 ufo sitings by mexican pilots. I hope this will be the proof we all need but I did dream this.I am not trying to convince anyone of anything I just want people to know the truth.I also beleive they wont harm us unless we dont take care of our earth they need water themselves and they will do what they have to to keep their supply.so take care of the earth to take care of ourselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were confused because we had no yard light. We stopped the truck on the levie. I immediatly got out.  I was standing with my back against the truck, door. I looked up into a perfectly circular light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximatly 20 feet in diameter. About 10 ft. high over the pond. Approximatly 25ft. from me. It was a craft hovering motionless. With no sound. I immediatly started talking to the craft.  I said, Don&#39;t be scart of me, come down and give me a ride.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was talking my wife was running to the house with our son. I heard the engine fire up. Wind started blowing from the craft stronger and stronger. I was pinned to the side of my truck. Could not move, the craft shot straight up 20 times faster then a  high powered rifle bullet. It was a roar that I have never heard before.  In 5 seconds the light completely disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, I was looking around the house and found a 12ft. diameter circle of flattened weeds. I never reported this to anyone. I didn&#39;t think anyone would believe me.<n>

My 3 1/2 year old were sitting in our front room facing the picture window.  She was standing on the couch beside ne and I had my arm sort of around her.  A disk/saucer shaped object dropped straight down into our line of vision. It was in our neighbors yard, in front of their house about 4 feet above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That image is pretty much burned into my brain and I can still clearly recall what I saw that day.The object was not more than about 5 feet across  and about 2 1/2 to 3 feet deep.  It was a sort of mottled green camoflauge color and had what looked like writing on the side. Except the stick figure lettering looked like Egyptian/Arabic/Russian type of script.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object hung in place for a couple of minutes and then it moved straight up past the window frame where I could see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so stunned that the time seemed to creep by, but I&#39;m sure the incident was not more than two minutes. I could not believe what I had seen. It seemed impossible. I immediately turned to my daughter and asked her if she had seen anything and she said  she saw an upside down turtle shell.  She got the shape right.  The lower side was slightly more curved than the top side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was only 11 when in 1980 (?) something really wonderful was about to be experienced...a UFO sighting.  It&#39;s as clear to me now as it was 22 years ago.  Was I dreaming? Seeing an illusion? Was it a meteor or a meteorological event?  I&#39;m certain it was not!  How can I be so certain?  I was with a friend who also saw everything.  We ran home to our parents to tell the story.  The next day, Edmonton radio and newspapers claiming the phone lines were choked with similar testimony gave us credibility.  Representatives from the University, (who never witnessed the event), explained it as a possible meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So here is what really happened... Armed with a pair of binoculars, it was a clear summer starry night when my friend ((name deleted)) and I set out to star gaze.  While &#34;break and enters&#34; where the hobbies of kids our age, we enjoyed astronomy. We actually wrote papers on the planets and studied the constellations. Call us geeks, but we found it exciting.  Facing the northern sky, we settled into the side of a hill not far from my house where lights could be dodged. My parents were stationed in Edmonton for a 5 year term. Life on the Greisbach army base was, to say the least, boring, so the patience we had learned was about to be rewarded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 40 minutes of just laying there, I happened to take interest at a red star in the east. I pointed it out to ((2nd witness)) to get his opinion. Although we both agreed it was just a star, I still kept a wary eye on it. It wasn&#39;t long before I was asking ((2nd witness)) to confirm if the star was moving.  It seemed to be growing!  Awww...just a plane we decided.  He went back to gazing at other objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few moments passed and I nudged him asserting that it was no plane.  Now we were both watching intently.  Then the most peculiar thing happened.  A beam of light grew from it.  Our mouths were fixed open in awe.  I fumbled with my click camera, but was more interested in taking in the event.  The beam of light grew long across the sky as it moved at a constant rate from east to west, well above the horizon, but not overhead. The distance was difficult to judge, but it seemed far yet near.  Kind of like a Las Vegas building. They look near because they are so big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it stretched across the north in front of us, stranger things appeared.  Two stars appeared on each side of the beam, and then another two, and then another two. Then all stars did the same thing the original beam did.  They stretched out thinner beams in front of them.  The beams had bright lights at each end.  They were positioned perfectly symmetrical.  The middle beam was bigger than the surrounding beams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the event was directly in front of us, again each of the smaller beams were surrounded by stars which then shot out their own beams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now as the event passed into the west, (which still had a bit of twilight), it did the exact reverse!  Small beams collapsed into stars and into single beams and then the last big beam collapsed back down to a star which eventually winked out.  The main event had lasted for only a minute, but it seemed longer. Chris and I looked at each other in excitement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed there for another half hour hoping for more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our excitement got the better of us and we ran home to tell all!  If anyone else has seen and remembers this, please contact me (email address below).  I would like to compare notes.  Also, I can&#39;t remember the exact date but I would love to search the newspaper archives for this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its possible the army was experimenting with some sort of transportation device; But as I let my imagination take over, I think we witnessed an alien space probe passing by our planet on a planned mapping of our solar system.  Think of it like a car coming down the road. At first you see a small dot, then it grows into a front and then as it passes you see the long side of it and then the backside and finally a receding dot.  In this case the front was like looking at the end of a fiber optic cable and as it passed it looked like the whole fiber.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its so hard to put into words, but it was an incredibly FANTASTIC event to witness. Whatever it was, it was VERY BIG!  If you ask ((2nd witness)) today, he thinks it was just a meteor.  I saw some very cool big meteors with a long sparkly death, and nothing in that shower could even come remotely close to what we saw. It was NOT a meteor. Meteors do NOT have symmetry! Nor do they fill up the sky.  But there was no doubt that it was NOT a meteor.  I had seen them before, this in contrast looked alien, moved slowly across the entire sky, and behaved mechanical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also forgot to add that there was supposedly a very low engine rumble.  I can&#39;t remember if I experienced this or if I got this from the reports the next day.  Like I said, we were too transfixed, all other non-visual senses seemed to be halted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should also state that we were NOT under the influence of anything... we were eleven!  I have better things to do then tell wild stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and he seemed exceptionally lucid and objective to us.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness, in part, because he is an amateur astronomer.  Please see his other report for February 28, 2004, also from Edmonton, AB.  PD))<n>

Sims, FF 1059, was urgently dispatched to Puerto Rico. We were initially told that a Russian submarine was detected which was making suspicious manuevers in the vicinity of Puerto Rico. We spent several weeks with divers, scientists and other experts on board, attempting to determine what was going on. I was informed that the divers had remarked that this incident was another &#34;Shag Harbor&#34;. I only learned many years later after leaving the U.S. Navy, through watching programs on cable like &#34;Sightings&#34; and other programs on The Learning Channel and Discovery Channel about Shag Harbor in Nova Scotia and also that UFOs were reported to be operating in the waters off Puerto Rico. We never were told anymore about the result of this mission other than that it had been determined that a natural phenomenon of undetermined origin had been studied, that was capable of mysteriously eluding detection at will only to reappear again. This went on for about 6 weeks if I remember correctly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have encouraged the witness to have other members of the cress of the USS W.S.

The window faced east so it was traveling roughly south to north and coming down at about a thirty degree angle until it dissappeared behind a really big tree and house. As far as I remember it was about the size of a nickel or smaller held at arms length and took just a few seconds to cross the view I had before being obscured by the trees and houses. I kept watching for several moments but did not see anything else.  I questioned what I actually saw for a really long time, believing it was a meteor or some kind of debris, but this was a solid white light, almost bright as the full moon but with no glare and very defined edges.  There was no trail left behind or any change in brightness or color and was definitely football shaped or eliptical with pointed ends.  I think my sister saw it also but I&#39;m not sure if she did or remembers, she is 18 months younger than me and we shared the room with at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I felt kind of funny, a feeling of something watching me, as I looked up above my head we witnessed a small bright orb above us at about 30 or forty feet up. The feeling was of shock and disbelief, the orb continued to follow us, we began to run but not in horror, more like the feeling of surprise, excitement. As we began to run, the orb, bright white light surrounding it, no more than the size of a beachball, shot away in a south direction at a high rate of speed until it was seen no more. We were in our teens then, high school students, today successful businessmen and fathers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed 4 objects going from the northwest to the southeast.  They were orange, blue, white, and red.  They were flying fast then stopped dead in their tracks, made a circle and speeded off into the sky, and disappeared.  The entire experience took about 15 seconds. I just wanted to share my experience with what I believe to be a UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

My mother, son and I were traveling Southbound on I-5 on our way to pick up my brother to go fishing. I was driving and felt a very strong vibration traveling up my arms from holding the steering wheel. This vibration was so strong that I could feel it in my chest as well. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were passing Boeings, which is a small, private airport for private and smaller commercial planes. I leaned forward to look up through the windsheild (I was driving an Oldsmomile that had a deep, slanted windshield and it was necessary to lean forward to view the sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed a large (about 1/2 the size of a football field) saucer shaped UFO. I remember it being a pewter color,a dull silver, rather than the shiny description I have since read about. There were &#34;running lights&#34; flashing on the underside of the craft - much like the &#34;chasing lights&#34; now available for Christmas Tree lights. I remember them being blue in color. The UFO was a little higher than the freeway street lights (VERY close) and almost directly above our vehichle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember yelling out in shock and excitement, &#34;Mom, it&#39;s a UFO...Oh My God, it&#39;s a UFO!&#34;. I remember making the decision to pull over to the shoulder of the road. As I navigated over, I remember seeing 6 - 7 other cars parked on the shoulder of the opposite side of the freeway - they would be heading Northbound. I do not recall seeing anyone in or near-by their vehichles. I do not remember seeing any cars on either the freeway or on the shoulder of our side of the freeway - Southbound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This memory was lost for 3 years!  One day, I was doing a mindless task - dusting furniture - and recalled the sighting. It was in Technocolor and VERY clear...only 3 years later! I called my mother, who was living in Alaska and asked &#34;When we were going to pick up my brother to go fishing 3 years previous...what did we see?&#34; Her answer was instantanious, &#34;A UFO.&#34; I asked if she&#39;d recalled this or had told anyone about it previous to my call. Her answer was &#34;No.&#34;  Neither my mother nor I are the type of people to keep this memory a secret. we would have told close friends and family members. We didn&#39;t. We couldn&#39;t! We had had our memories blocked somehow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I recalled the sighting, my memorie goes from seeing the UFO to being in a rented rowboat at in Point Defiance Sound (located in Tacoma, Washington), our fishing destination. We were caught in a rip-tide and I recall all 4 of us having to lay flat in the boat to avoid being tossed into the sound by the extreme bobbing of the boat encountered in this rip-tide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After my mother and I discussed this incident, I called my brother and asked him if he could remember if my mother, son and myself were late in arriving for our fishing date. He couldn&#39;t recall, as it had been 3 full years after this trip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither my mother nor I recall seeing anything other than the UFO. I am filing this report in the hope that one of passengers of the other 6-7 cars may have a clearer memory of the encounter and wish to report this for the record.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

On a different story... a current airforce MP friend of mine was stationed at the air force in / near las vegas a couple of years ago (for two years) who told me/confirmed what an older ex-air force crew chief friend/ex-partner of mine told me. That there are a bunch of hollow mountains in Nevada near las vegas. The ex-crew chief told me that years ago he and the pilot/co-pilot were told/ordered to take off with some cargo but didnt know where they were going and would find out once they were enroute. He told me that they flew for hours and then received directions to fly to a certain coordinence (spelling) and they couldnt believe their eyes, they were instructed to fly into the side of a mountain, but when they got closer the side of the mountain opened up and they flew into the mountain and were told to not get out of the plane. the cargo was unloaded and they were told to leave. Ofcourse he told me to not tell anyone but i figured after all this time a bunch of people probably know about these &#34;hidden&#34; airstrips/bases in the mountains. Back to my friend the MP...he said he had clearance to go into the restricted areas of that secret base as he was a security/police and he has heard many people say that yes those hills/mountains are all hollow. One day a friend of his was taking a break in his humvee near a top secret building and a guy came out the door of this secret building and later the guy taking the break was taken to headqtrs and asked what he saw when the other man came out the door. he said nothing as it was to quick and he wasnt even paying attention but within 24 hours the airforce transfered him out of state and made him sign the 50 year &#34;i saw nothing paper&#34; this kinda stuff is exciting but i wonder what the heck our government is doing in those secret bases..i wouldnt be surprised probably.... so, has anyone/group ever tried to sneak-in to this area and take pictures etc.? dont we have a right to know whats going on? ofcourse we do!!! i will try to squeeze more neat stuff out of my buddy the MP.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The person who submitted this report indicated that it had occurred in &#34;Tucson, AR,&#34; suggesting the state of Arkansas.  However, in the body of the report, the person refers to &#34;Las Vegas,&#34;  and he/she indicates that the county was &#34;Pima.&#34;  Hence, we are uncertain where the alleged events actually took place.

I headed down King Muir Rd towards to the corner of Deer Path Road, and I heard an extremely loud, two very low frequencies coming from a triangle shape, it was moving very slowly, I watched it for five or so minutes when it changed direction and just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Lake Forest is not the only one however, When I was five years old, I was headed home from Springfeild, Il with my grandfather and it was totally dark out.  All of a sudden my grandfather spotted an object hovering above a field and he pulled over to the side of the road.  There was a brightly lit with multiple colored lights, it looked like an enormous barrel (10X size) with both ends bulging out.  His car died and he could not start it, until the object suddenly shot upwards and vanished.  There was no noise from what I remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I saw this alone the first time but instantly mentioned it to some of the friends that were with me,and pointed to where it had happened (luckily for me) exactly the same thing happened again, another one took off in exactly the same manner.They saw the second one but it didn&#39;t happen again. this is the only non explicable ufo sighting I&#39;ve seen and to this day wonder what it was.I know that jets go up in pairs and they can switch their afterburners on and off but this was dead vertical and the final accelaration was far beyond any jet, of that I&#39;m sure....Any ideas clues, any other sightings like this???<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As I observed it I was frightened and got a feeling that it was focusing only on me.  I was on front steps and was afraid to get up.  I finally go up, went inside house woke up wife and we stared at it outside of our window fro about 15 minutes.  It eventually moved up and back and high into the sky  but it just appeared at the new location.  Didnt see it moving there but it just reappreaed.

It had lights and was spinning<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident occurred around 1980, I was living in Algonquin. I was lying in bed falling asleep, when I realized what I was staring at should not be.  I was looking south over an area that is now built up with houses and Spring Hill mall in West Dundee.  I did not see the craft, however I saw the lights and shape of the craft. It was a flying saucer with red green and blue lights.  The lights were spinning like in an Ed Wood film.  Classic flying saucer. I seemed to be dopey with sleep or?  When I realized what I was seeing after several minutes, I walked to my window to stare at it.  I did not get my mother , she would have whipped my butt for waking her.  After a few minutes, either the craft moved or a second then third appeared.  It was in the sky, then disappeared and reappeared directly below where it had been but much lower.  The distance was impossible to tell. I think it was the same craft, but there was no time delay. It was not like &amp;quot;blink-blink&amp;quot! ; it was here, then lower.  Then it moved again to the right[west] of where it had originally been, level with the first location but all 3 were equidistant from the other forming an even sided triangle. It sat in the original spot a long time, then down, then over for a few moments each. Then disappeared. I lost a few hours that night beforehand.  The timing was so precise, the distance as well. I then went to bed, and had a strange animal experience like in a book from 1985 that I read a bit of. I lied in my bed and saw 2 lights at the top and bottom of my dresser perfectly lined up and centered. The lights blinked in perfect unison. I was so scared I nearly shit my pants. When I worked up the courage to turn the light on, I found 2 lightning bugs. They flew off immediately and I thought nothing of it until I read many abductees have strange animal sightings. [insect in my case] I have never seen anything like what I witnessed outside of science fiction, I truly believe it ! was a UFO. I have thought of being hypnotized to investigate, ! but neve r have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was watching airliners flying over at about 30,000 feet, headed to the airport at Charlotte, sixty miles away. The planes were just lights with no sound. They followed the same path, one every five minutes or so. Then another light came along, an orange light the looked just like the others, but this one split into three pieces.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I had just seen a plane blow up and pointed this out to my three friends. We saw one of the three lights continue towards Charlotte while another turned north and the third light turned in our direction and seemed to hang in the sky. We assumed the light was at airliner altitude, but when I went out to the car to get some binoculars, I saw that the light moved against the backdrop of stars when I moved. This indicated that the light was much lower than we thought, perhaps only two hundred feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light drifted slowly over town and we followed it in a car, easily able to keep up. At one time, we saw a series of fire balls shooting out of the bottom like a Roman candle. This scared us, but nothing happened. The light drifted out of town. We pulled into a church parking lot and got out to watch. The orange light suddenly accelerated very quickly and was out of sight in a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/1/80 22:00|Marlow Heights|MD|Light|1 hour|Appeared to be a star moving at great speed, breaking up, disappearing then reappearing in another location.  Very erratic behavior.|12/16/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11230.html|44|ndxe198006| Appeared to be a star moving at great speed, breaking up, disappearing then reappearing in another location.  Very erratic behavior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While parked at a dead end street with a couple of friends I observed what appeared to be a star moving slowly accross the west northwestern night sky.  I thought it to be only an airplane and didn&#39;t think anything else about it. The following is my recollection of the objects relative position, distance, movement, speed, shape and size elevation: 45 degrees distance:  unknown movement:  approximately 45 degrees left and right of center. shape:     round light size:      alternated from a pinhead to a dime at arms length. As mentioned above I really thought this was only an aircraft as we have heavy air traffic in the Wash. D.C. area.  This point of light however would move from it&#39;s central position approximately 20 degrees north or south then return to the exact same spot.  I watched this and said nothing to my friends as I still thought this was an aircraft of some sort.  Suddenly this point of light moved at incredible speed and stopped instantly in a new position and just as quickly returned to it&#39;s exact original location.  I grew up the son of an Air Force pilot and have a very good grasp of what various aircraft can and cannot do. (I since have become a private pilot)  This thing is moving like nothing I have ever seen.  I finally ask my friends if they see this funny light.  They both responded yes and that they too have been watching it.  So now there are three people seeing it do the same thing at the same time.  We got out of the car to get a clearer view and for the next forty five minutes watced in amazement at what happened next. This &#34;star&#34; would shoot accross he sky in all directions and return to the same point as stated earlier however now it would take up a new position and begin to pulsate and grow/shrink in size.  Then, in one of it&#39;s hyper speed moves it seemed to blow apart and leave glowing fragments in it&#39;s wake.  These fragments would then move in various directions then rejoin the main &#34;star&#34; Then it would completely disappear.  After about five seconds it reappeared in yes, exactly the same begining position!  It did this several times in all directions and as always, would reappear in it&#39;s starting position.  At one point it remained motionless while it pulsated and began to grow in size.  Within ten seconds it exploded with fragments going in all directions.  This time it and the fragments disappeared right after this explosion only to reappear in another part of the sky. This behavior went on for approximately forty five minutes before the &#34;star&#34; began to move off and finally could no longer be seen. To better envision what we saw and it&#39;s relation to the sky, try this, take a piece of letter size paper.  This represents that portion of the sky the object moved in.  Now draw a dot about the size of a pinhead in the center of the paper.  This represents the object. If you place your pencil on the dot and draw a straight line about four or five inches in any direction as fast as you can you can get an idea of it&#39;s relative speed. Even though many years have passed since this incident, it remains clear in my mind.  I believe this is due to the spectacular way in which this object moved and the fact that two other people saw it perform the same maneuvers, at the same time, as myself. I know this information may be dated.  The only reason I am reporting this is because of an episode of Sightings I watched this week in which they reported on what they referred to as &#34;Cluster UFO&#39;s&#34; and how rare  they are supposed to be. If I can be of any assistance feel free to contact me. Thanks,  ((name deleted))<n>

It was around 9 or 10pm. If you&#39;d like to verify my memory,Texas was in the middle of a severe drought that summer of 1980. I saw miles and miles of dead cornfields. Suddenly, something caught my attention at my 3 o&#39;clock vision field.I saw what appeared to be &#34;2&#34; satellites on a dual trajectory. My 1st thought was &#34;It&#39;s a high flying jet&#34; .. but after a moment or two, I decided it was travelling way too fast.I did not see any other flashing strobe lights. I was amazed to see 2 satellites in tandem for the fist time. After watching this for a good minute, any doubts I had about it being an airplane evaporated. Suddenly,the 2 lights &#34;stopped&#34; in their trajectory &#34;tracks&#34;. After 4 or 5 seconds, the lights &#39;went out&#39;...they disappeared simultaneously. The next morning, I asked the cadre instructors &#34;If a! nyone had heard about a UFO sighted over I 10 last night?&#34; They said &#34;No.&#34; All I can say folks is this: &#34;I KNOW what I saw...but I still do not know what it was.&#34;  Thanks for listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

All of a sudden there was an extremely loud roaring vibration and I looked up through the windshield and then stuck my head out of the window. What I saw was a very large flat surface right above the tree tops. It appeared to be metal and was visible at night though I did not see particular lights. They may have been above the craft and I could only see the bottom. It hovered above our car but was extended over the trees on both sides of the highway.(Highway 22 East). It was very large and very loud, then in an instant it was gone. It either disappeared or took off at such a high rate of speed that we could not even see the direction that it was travelling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What makes this so real is that my father was in his truck 2 miles behind us. When he came in we were standing in the kitchen staring at each other and he said you are not going to believe what I saw. He described exactly what we had seen. He called the Air force Base at Warner Robins GA but they said they did not know of anything in the area. The neighbors a quarter of a mile away also said the saw something at this same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked outside but did not see any light coming from the outside.  I asked dad what was it.  He said he had no idea.  That happened when I was 11 years old.

6/1/80 21:00|Birmingham|AL|Triangle|3 minutes|three lights that formed a triangle in the night sky|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39710.html|49|ndxe198006| three lights that formed a triangle in the night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the eary summer of 1980, I was taking my private pilot ground school on the weekend.  On a Friday night a buddy and I were sitting on the front steps of another friends house, waiting on him to get home from eating out with his parents.  As we sat there talking I noticed a humming sound that sounded different from any airplane that I have ever herd before.  I looked up toward the sky (southeast) towards Birmingham and notice three lights in the sky above that formed a perfect triangle.  The two on the right were smaller in size and would have formed the base of the triangle.  The one on the left was larger and would have been the apex of the triangle.  The apex light was white and the two smaller lights were white with a red tint.  Since I was taking my private pilot ground school, we had learned that red was on the left, green on the right, and white on the tail.  I was trying to make sence of the lights but it just wasn&#39;t right.  The lights were moving towards us from the southeast heading northwest.  If the lights were on a plane, the plane would have been flying sideways.  I then got my buddies attention and pointed the lights out to him.  As we watched the lights slowly move across the sky, I was telling him if,that is a plane, it is very low and we would hear it, and that the direction of flight would be different than the lights.  The house that we were at is up on a hill and from our position you can see the lights of Birmingham in the distance some 12-15 miles away.  To the southwest of us about 1 mile a baseball game was underway at parkwest and you could hear the pa being annouced at the game.  I notice a plane had just departed from BHM and was climbing out towards the north in a slow arc.  The plane was very identifible as an F-4 phantom recon aircraft that was based at BHM.  This was identified by the two bottom stobes that we saw all the time in our area.  As the F4 got closer to the objects above us, the objects slowed and came to a complete stop.  To get an idea of the spacing of the objects overhead, they were about the width of an adults outstrected hands in the sky (2&#39;from the apex to the base.)  The two objects that formed the base were about 1&#39; apart from each other.  As the F4 got closer, the two objects that formed the base began to separate from each other, widening the base to what appeared two be 3-4&#39; in the sky.  They slowly started to move to the southwest which is a 90 degree turn from the original direction.  As the moved the gatherd speed and instantly streaked across the sky leaving a white line that dissapeard as fast as it appeared.  As soon as they were gone, the largest (apex) light slowly started in the same direction (toward the ball park) as did the other two.  It too started to build speed and in a blink of an eye streaked across the sky and left an identicle steak of light behind it and was gone.  It would remind one of a shooting star.  From out position on top of this hill, you could see 15 miles.  So we were able to follow these light all the way across the horizon.  The F4 continued its approach and made a large circle back towards Birmingham.  My friend and I just looked at each other in disbelief and asked each other &#34;did you see that&#34;.  We told out friend what we saw and his parents.  They just looked at us as if we were crazy.  The next morning I went to my private pilot ground school at the birmingham airport and asked my instructor, who was a F4 pilot at the time if they scrambled any F4&#39;s last night to check out what we had seen and he said he didn&#39;t know.  This has been on my mind ever since and I felt the need to write it down.  If anyone else has had a similar experience I would like to read about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There was no sound at all comming from it. The object was silver and the size of the disk was aprox. 300 ft in diameter. The craft was vertical with its&#39; top facing the blacktop when I first spotted it. I slowed down my car and pulled over to the side of the blacktop and stoped the car. I couldn&#39;t beleive my eyes. This was really happening! As I watched the disk it began to rotate around and around slowly. Then it tilted to the left then to the right then ended up horizontal, still rotating around. About the time i was wishing someone else could see this thing . a car came along west bound. He also was seeing this disk and slowed down his car and said to me..&#34;What is it&#34;? I said,&#34;I don&#39;t know!&#34; He sat there looking at it for a few secounds then just looked at me and drove off. I stayed longer and then I had this wired feeling come over me and I decided to get outa there. I kept looking at the disk over my sholder until it was out of my sight.

I kept driving and the highway was busy, i looked again and the light was bigger and closer, I thought that must be an airplane, the road was with trees on the left side , trees of about 40 feets, i look again for the light and what i saw was the light was coming behind the trees, i looked to the left and i saw this bright object, and i said to myself, oh that it is an ufo. My wife did not see anything, and my kids, 3 and 5 years old were in the back of the jeep.

I was playing with my neighbor on my front porch.  I noticed the fireball in the sky in the western horizon.  The sun was just out of view under the crest of the mountain range.  What is strange about the fireball is that it seemed to hypnotize me.  All I remember is just staring at it.  It did not appear to move vertically or horizontally.  It did not get closer or farther away. After a period of time it just was gone.  I did not know what a UFO was at the time.  I never told anyone other than my family, nor did I ever talk to my neighbor about it. I don&#39;t even know if my neighbor saw it, although he was with me.  I don&#39;t recall talking to him about it at the time it occured, either. Although I have been fortunate enough to see &#34;unidentified flying objects&#34; since, I have not seen anything resembling the fireball on that summer evening, nor have I seen anything as significant. I would like to know if any one else has seen anything like this.  The experience was sublime.  Even as a child, I sensed something sacred; perhaps that is the irony of my curiosity after all this time.  If anyone is interested in sharing info, feel free to email me.  I have other information to share. Thank you.<n>

TO my great surprise, and genuine startled sensation, a person in Rochester, (which is not too far from where my stepfather and I originally saw this UFO, in Ethel, WA) described a very similar shaped craft and an unusual time disorientation feeling both my stepfather and I had experienced after the craft departed.  For whoever wrote about the V shaped craft, I want you to know, you are not alone in seeing this. Both my Stepfather and I saw it, and we saw it within very close proximity and in broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is my account of the incident:  My stepfather was picking me up from a friend&#39;s house at the top of the Hill on an old country road called Larmon road about 1 mile east from where the road meets into Hwy 12.  I remember I had rode the school bus up to my friend&#39;s house that day to go play on his go-cart, as it meant I wouldn&#39;t have to try and ride my bike up that incredibly steep hill.  We had left my friend&#39;s house and we were driving East back towards the hill, That is when my stepfather turned to me in the passenger seat and said quite casually, &#34;Look, a UFO.&#34;  My reply was &#34;yeah, right&#34;, until I looked past him and out the driver&#39;s car door window, then I actually saw it.  My stepfather slowed down the car as we saw looked in disbelief and eventually came to a stop there on the road.  There it was this huge upside down &#34;V&#34; shaped silver metallic craft.  It was hovering no more than 15 feet above the grass in an empty cow pasture right off to the left of the road.  I remember just sitting there in the front seat, looking at it, in total disbelief as to what we were both seeing.  It was there, in a field belonging to my friend&#39;s grandparents facing North of the road.  It cast a giant shadow on the ground, but I remember it looking as if it were just hanging there in the air, it was impossible for our eyes to comprehend, as it defied gravity, just hanging there.  The top of the &#34;V&#34; was facing towards the sky.  And in the center, I remember a circular domed area, and what looked like domed windows.  It was not a plane, as there was no noise, and this craft was a lot larger than a regular plane, or even a jumbojet, it was very big.  The house of my friend&#39;s grandparent&#39;s was just to the right of where it hovered, and it made the house look like a shed in comparison. We were probably no more than 150 ft from where it hovered above the pasture. I remember seeing the grass below it reflecting on the tips of both sides of the V.  It had lights, green, red, and blue.  I remember seeing the green light the most coming from the centermos! t point of the craft, where I had believed to have seen windows on the craft.  The light got intensely bright, and after that, I remember being suddenly startled and then suddenly looking out the window of my passenger window, as if something was there, I for a moment thought there was something there.  It was at this time that time seems to have skipped on us.  We both felt as if some serious time had passed since first encountering the craft, that we had something like a time hiccup is the best I can describe the sensation.  Like we hiccuped and we moved ahead in time, like we had been gone for hours, but somehow equated out to no time loss at all.  I have no idea if we were abducted, as I have no memory past looking out my passenger door window, I just remember being very startled and was compelled to look away from the light.  After I saw there wasn&#39;t anyone there, I looked back at the craft, and it was gone.  Suddenlt there was a noise, a very loud thundercraking sonic boom type of noise, but when we got out of the car to see if it had made the noise, there was nothing visible in the sky.  For a good five minutes, we sat on that road looking at a craft that was in no way shape or form anything I have seen before or since.  It was huge, and it made no noise.  We proceeded down the hill towards home and went back into the house.  When we got into the house, my mother asked quite sternly where we both had been, and we both said we just came straight down the hill.   She said that it had been well over an hour when my stepfather had gone up the hill to pick me up.  We lived no more than 2 miles from my friend&#39;s house.  We never reported it, but not long after that incident, My stepfather somehow developed a very serious and debilitating brain tumor and died three years later.  The effects of the tumor started to a few days after we saw that craft.  I do not know if this was somehow connected, but it did appear very strange when the right side of his body went dead and he started having seizures not long after our encounter.  So, to whoever saw this same shaped craft, you are not alone, My stepfather and I saw it as well. And I believe something else might have happened to us.  Although I have always been very healthy, I have the feeling that something else occured that day.  For whoever wrote their encounter regarding the craft in Rochester back in 1979 - 1980, I hope that these people will share my contact info with you.  It is because of what you wrote that compelled me to share my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

When I came back out it was traveling upwards at a high rate of speed and I took pictures but it was out of sight in a matter of seconds.  I still have those pictures but all I see on there is a little white spot since the sun was very bright that day.  My husband called the airforce and the airport and they knew of nothing that would do that.  That husband is deceased now so can&#39;t put him down as a witness.<n>

I had a morning paper route and usually set out around 04:45 to start delivering my papers. When the event happened it was still dark and I was walking down a deadend road. The road stopped near a large wooded area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t hear anythingbut all of a sudden these lights appeared overhead, directly over me. There were 4-5 separate lights…white, light gold and green were the colors. The lights were large not small and they, looking back, were about 200 feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see the complete shape of the ship/aircraft but the leading edge that I did see was rounded so I am assuming the entire craft was round or oval. Being so young out by myself, I was shakien a bit, so I immediately looked away and began walking fast away from it. When I got a football field in length away I turned around. And it was gone. No noise nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never told anyone about what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I looked through the window, I saw that thing hovering very close to a couple of radio antennas attached to a wall on a nearby building. It looked metallic, like two dish shaped pieces together (upper and lower)with lights of different colors (green, white and purple)in the middle. It didn&#39;t look big. I got scared and went back to my bedroom, but once there, I got curious and went back to the kitchen and the thing was gone. I went back to sleep and then I dreamt of redhaired men with thick whiskers, barechested, flying in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I have just recently been able to talk about it. It was a huge Boomerang craft. Totally silent. It was going so slow I thought it would fall out of the sky. I have time loss and had an implant so I assume I was abducted but have no memory of this. I have proof of the implant. But something made me throw it away. My dentist has Xrays of it. It came out when I had teeth next to the sinus. I do not remember the craft going away. I have since lost contact with the 2 others. But last I knew one remembered it the other did not. This is very odd since she was the one to tell me to run outside to look at it. Maybe she just didnt want to remember I dont know. This craft was moving from the south going north. What Id like to know is....Was there ever anyother reports of seeing this humungous craft besides me? Thank you…((name deleted))<n>
