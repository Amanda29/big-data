12/24/65 23:59|Bellmar|NJ|Triangle|1 hour|delta shaped object, missing time|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74756.html|1|ndxe196512| delta shaped object, missing time<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was perhaps 3 or 4 years old, which would make it 1965 or 1966.  It was Christmas Eve.  The location was Bellmawr NJ.  It was very late, possibly midnight or later.  It was snowing lightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family was just leaving my aunt’s house at a Christmas Eve get-together, exchanging gifts, etc.  It was very late.  It had been snowing lightly but steady enough that there just a dusting of snow on the car.  My father cleared the windshield off quickly with his hands.  I remember this because he didn’t have enough to make a snowball to throw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started toward the end of the street (St Charles Street, facing southeast).  At the moment we came to the street’s end (St Egbert st) a very, very large black/gray delta shaped object appeared over the tree tops (there used to be a field there, now occupied by homes).  The delta shaped object was very low, perhaps just two hundred feet, and moving slowly enough that it was almost hovering – heading or facing northwest.  It was large enough that it obscured most of the sky.  It was silent.  The leading edges of the delta shaped object were brightly lit in what at the time seemed the strangest possible way.  A single light on each of the two leading edges ran the entire length of the leading edge.  It emitted collimated ‘sheets’ of light, which slowly swept across the ground, homes, and trees from each leading edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the rear left seat, with a clear view out the car window.  My brother, three years older, had jumped across the back seat and his body weight was on top of me while he gawked out the car window on my side.  I remember my mother saying something, sounding emotional, frightened.  It was at the moment my mother said something that everything seemed to spiral down to some dream like state, like being drugged into unconsciousness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became aware of four beings, three males and one female.  The female was speaking, or more like singing to me.  It seemed the three males were ‘singing’ to everyone else...I mean everyone else in the area around the ship and car.  I became aware of the presence of our car from another perspective, perhaps looking down at it from some altitude, at the tops of the homes and trees.  The female voice kept singing to me.  It was the sound of a lullaby but had intense imagery and concepts attached to it.  I understood that I was to take it all in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I gradually became aware of being in the back seat of the car again.  My brother was no longer on top of me.  My parents were sitting perfectly quiet in the front seat.  There was no sign of the object.  My mother looked at my father and nudged him.  He looked at her, then grabbed the wheel, and just started to move, (the engine was still running) then suddenly stopped.  There was about three inches of snow on the car.  My father had to get out and clear the windshield and front of the car before we could go on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 1985 I asked my brother if he had any recollection of the event.  He stammered and said he had, but thought it was just a really weird dream or dreamlike memory.  My father had no idea, in fact, didn’t remember Christmas Eve at my aunt’s house.  My mother couldn’t remember the event.  Oddly, my cousin, who was in the house that we left that Christmas Eve night, remembered that something weird happened, but couldn’t remember what it was.  When I asked what kind of weird, i.e., walls melting weird or can’t remember where she put the keys weird, she stated that she had dreams for many years of that night but wouldn’t go on about what kind of dreams.  I felt that she didn’t want to talk about her weird dreams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve been looking over the years for a record of a sighting in that area and time, would have been Christmas Eve, 1964 or 65, but have found none.  Seems inconceivable that no one else saw this event.  The area is very close to Philadelphia Int’l airport.  However, at that time of night, the airport and tower would have been closed.  I’ve wandered if the three male singing voices were a type of sedating effect over the general area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is one sighting noted 12/24/65 in Davidsville, PA of a ‘light,’ nothing more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I note that this doesn’t seem to correspond to any of the typical sightings noted over the years.  But that is my memory of it.<n>
12/24/65 01:00|Davidsville|PA|Light|5 Minutes|I personally witnessed this sighting while hitchhiking back home while in the Navy.  It was a clear night while walking within 4 miles|10/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46924.html|2|ndxe196512| I personally witnessed this sighting while hitchhiking back home while in the Navy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night while walking within 4 miles from my parents home outside Davisdville, PA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what appeared to be a bright light between me and a hill side some 1/4 mile away.   I thought the light was a glare at first, allowing it to move past my vision, but quickly followed it some 3/4 mile North and parallel with the hill and road I was on (Route 403 between Davisville and Tire Hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light appeared to follow the elevation of the ground uniformly, some 30 feet of so off the ground.  What proved to me that it wasn&#39;t a glare or something explainable, is that it made a &#34;U&#34; turn slightly disappearing into a valley area, so it was very distinct in it&#39;s travel pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light &#34;flew&#34; back past me now heading back South (again about 2/3 the distance to the hill), and traveled up over another hill into Davidsville, but at that point seemed to fly a higher trajectory, because I could see it partially in sight and then out of sight as it undulated South and from its original trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then appeared to turn West towards Thomas Mills, where I then lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then kept walking South on Route 403, and about 200 feet from where I first say the sighting, staring off towards Thomas Mills way, I noticed over Thomas Mills area, what appeared to be a plume of circular smoke or vapor that went &#34;upward&#34;.  This &#34;upward&#34; plume of smoke or vapor appeared strange to me.  I would have expected it to go &#34;downward&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the extent of my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And the amazing timing of this sighting from first sight to last sight, over some 4 miles was an amazing 7 or 8 &#34;seconds&#34;.  Why this timing sticks in my mind is that it was traveling so fast and so precise, that I actually counted the seconds.  I don&#39;t know of anything that can go that fast.  And it made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a body that was somewhat visable, but I was fixed on the light.  The body of this UFO was not clear in my mind.  As much as I wanted to form a shape, I couldn&#39;t.  But the light was real, and lead me on its venture.<n>

THIS ALL HAPPENED IN THE WINTER OF 1965, I WAS 12 YEARS OLD AND HAD BEEN TO MY OLDER BROTHERS HOUSE WHILE MY PARENTS WERE OUT. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HOME AROUND 11 PM. WHEN WE ARRIVED NO ONE WAS HOME AND WE WERE GETTING OUT OF MY BROTHERS CAR TO GO IN AND WAIT, WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE SAW A FLASH TO OUR LEFT AND LOOKED UP TO THE LEFT AND SAW NOTHING UNUSUAL. THEN I LOOKED OVER TO THE RIGHT AND HOVERING ABOVE THE THE LINE ABOUT 100 FEET UP WE SAW, WHAT LOOKED LIKE A ROW OF WINDOWS I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECT, BUT THE WINDOWS CURVED AROUND THE FRONT HALF OF THE OBJECT AND THE LIGHTS IN THE WINDOW WERE VERY BRIGHT. IT DID NOT MAKE A SOUND. MY BROTHER FREAKED OUT AND SCREAMED AT ME TO GET IN THE CAR. AND WE WENT TO HIS HOUSE AND WAITED FOR MY PARENTS TO GET HOME. MY BROTHER DOES NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING, AND I KNOW THIS WAS&#39;NT A DREAM BUT WHY HE CAN&#39;T REMEMBER IS BEYOND ME.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We watched the lights go over the bus very high and fast, and as I looked around the bus, sudenly I realized that everyone was sitting in their seats, like nothing happened; I asked people if they saw that, but they just sat there with a blank look on their face, and would not talk for the rest of the trip to Houston.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

We all looked up and saw a large fireball travelling north to south on a horizontal trajectory. The fireball was as large as the sun usually is in the sky. I told my mother about it and both she and my stepfather also came out of the house and we all watched it fly by until it was no longer visible. I now believe that what we saw that day was the Kecksburg object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was months later and I had contacted a local priest from Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Great Falls. This priest has since been removed from active service with the general public, he has suffered a stroke on the left side of his body and his memory isn&#39;t exactly what it use to be. In the early 1980&#39;s, maybe around May of 1982, during that late spring month my wife and I was awakened by a glowing light from the back yard of our home that was hovering over our very large weeping willow tree, it was as if it had landed and was gathering information or discharging a genetic message. The air was still and the sounds in the distance echoed as if you were inside a tunnel. Across the alley, on the next block... 2606-5th Avenue South a police car was parked in the middle of the street looking directly into our backyard, the sound of breaking glass could be heard for a very brief second from that location, the whole area of the neighborhood was as if it were in a vacuum and echoed each sound as if you could detect a pin drop from down the street, the engine on the patrol car was silent and there was no other vehicle traffic that could be detected in the general area that was mobile, only the flashing lights of a police car setting in the middle of the road out back and it remained throughout the night. Above our tree was a cloud that resembled a Maltesse Cross, its four triangular shaped inner arms were of a stewing blackness that could only be understood from the depths outside our planets atmosphere, this is what&#39;s really particularly curious in relationship to the Enfield Connecticut incident where a report of a 4 pointed cross was reported earlier in the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania incident which I believe is one and the same in more ways than one! Very interesting coinci! dence in deed!!!    The other portions of that Maltesse Cross between the cross figure itself was pure white and just as luminous as the light of a full moon on a clear night, even that of a bright florescent blub. It hummed as though vibrating as though it was discharging a message or extracting a source of matter that had called it forth in that midnight hour. Maybe from beneath the earth at the roots of that tree a line of communication was being established with the earth itself and its inhabitants, maybe it was answering a question that&#39;s fimilar to us all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This experience has vanished from most all records in the area after a military investigator came to the area and researched the sighting that many residents of Great Falls had reported to the Great Falls Tribune and to Military officials at Malmstrom AFB the days following its appearances, this phenomenon occurred during a period when I was employed for about a 6 month period as a supervisior at a local Sambo&#39;s Restraurant. The incident was centered at 2605-6th Avenue South in Great Falls , Montana . I still own the property there, for some reason I still feel attached after that experience, who wouldn&#39;t feel such a bond? This is yet another unexplained event that now appears to be totally erased from the record books because of government involvement. The priest I mentioned earlier is in a housing facility run by the church for aging priests in Great Falls . This priest was contacted by me the morning of that Maltesse Cross had hovered over our tree. I spoke with Father Hersinko a number of times about this event and told him that for some reason or another I was certain that Light would remain in the area for three more days and could be spotted above in the evening sky&#39;s canopy in its original shape in a northwest trajectory as a group of distinguished cloud formations resembling that Maltesse Cross or wheel with spokes; you think that during that time satillites would have detected this formation, maybe the military did! I expect the Great Falls Tribune that had front page coverage of this event from so many callers would still have information on this case in question, I think they do, but find it very difficult to locate. That priest after that event was over was removed from his position at Our Lady of Lourdes Church and placed in a small church about 30 miles out of town on Highway 200, I believe the town was Fort Shaw that serves about 150 perishioners. I found that strange seeing he was only in his earlier fifties and was the priest in charge of not only the church services, but the grade scho! ol it op erated in the community of Great Falls . Well, that night of the Maltesse Cross incident I told my wife as we stood 30 feet from that tree looking up at the swirling mass of black ink and that extremely white soft halo that divided the two prominent features into very distinct patterns that I should go and venture up to the tree and climb-up and see what if anything would occur... she ruled against it and seemed only interested in going back into the house and finishing her sleep. The police car was still parked in the middle of the street watching the figure with, I suspect, much interest. I imagine the police report was sanitized, as well in this actual case of multiple sightings that week, it shouldn&#39;t have been. Maybe you can further investigate and inform me as to what your findings were! Another aspect of this event which was discussed with the priest was the Montana State License Plate on my Vehicle, &#34; Sacrum&#34;. I had mailed one of these license plates to Pope John Paul II with a note that his life was in immediate mortal danger, that was 7 days from the attempt on his life where he was shot and a bullet struck his sacrum bone, go figure... I had never written a letter like that to anyone before, quite a coincidence, I had never communicated with the church prior to this event, but I did have an undeniable urge to get personalized license plates earlier that year... it was a plate that caused some interest with local officals, I retired that license plate after that incident. I was mostly consumed with getting my wife pregnant, my doctor told me forget it after numerous visits to his office... around 9 months after the Maltesse Cross incident we had a son... in 1983. His eyes were as if oriental, that&#39;s always puzzled me a bit. He&#39;s a good son, he works two jobs, has graduated from college with 3 degrees in business, I feel I&#39;m very blessed to have him. It&#39;s funny how life evolves, it&#39;s amazing the mysteries that sometimes make those blessings seem all the more important in our own particular lives! .

It was perfectly rounded with massive fingers of flames exploding from within its core to the surface, at 16 years of age I thought the heavens were reacting to the turmoil I had just escaped from inside the house with the audience my father had just had with my mother, brother and the rest of the family over the demand he join the military tomorrow because of a conflict of issues... what a psychological experience to behold after such a traumatic set of circumstances! I&#39;ve looked long and hard for others that might have noticed the extremely large fireball in the evening sky, it didn&#39;t crash, it made no sound, it maintained its elevation just above the treeline and it left no cloud or stream of debris in its trail. I assume was from west to east, whatever this flaming ball of fire was it has held my imagination ever since. I recall by brother moments just before I stepped outside as he was shining his shoes with a can of Griffin shoe polish for the big day to come at the recruiter&#39;s office tomorrow morning... he was just 30 days from turning 17 years of age, a special parental sign-off was required for him to enter the Marine Corp, it was a sad day for me, especially now that he&#39;s gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

12/9/65 00:00|Pittsburgh|PA|Unknown|5 seconds|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  I Saw The Kecksberg UFO!|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32677.html|13|ndxe196512| ((NUFORC Note:  Date, we believe, should be December 09, 1965, the date of the event at Kecksburg, PA.  We have amended the date above.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Saw The Kecksberg UFO!  It was a warm December night in 1965.  I was 14 years old and my cousin John was 12 years old as we left my house to sneak a few cigarettes down the alley.  We lived in the suburban community of Bridgeville; 12 miles southwest of downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  We came to this lithographic building which had a loading dock in the back.  It was the perfect place to sit and smoke in secret.  We knew we had to leave soon.  The time was getting late into the evening.  But, before we made our way back to my house:  Something pierced the night&#39;s sky over my left shoulder.  Our heads turned to the left and our eyes could not help but notice a bright ball of light!  Both John and I were stunned.  Our mouths dropped.  The object was about the size of a full moon and it trailed sparks or little bits of light.  The odd thing about it was the thing did not fall straight down.  The UFO went laterally; sideways; almost up!  Whatever this was...it could not have been a meteor.  A shooting star (or space debris) falls down.  A natural object does not move horizontally.  Meteors do not go up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound.  We could not tell its distance from us since the object appeared just like a big dot of light.  This was no saucer with lights or any kind of features.  The entire sighting lasted for approximately 5 seconds.  Then, the object passed over the southern hill; behind the trees of what was called Cook School hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> John and I immediately reacted.  We ran to my house very excited.  My father, an old skeptic, thought we were crazy.  UFOs were not a part of his belief-system.  Nevertheless, I convinced him to drive us up to the top of the hill and check to see if anything came down there.  At the time, my cousin and I thought the thing could have hit somewhere around Cook School.  My father humored us and drove us around.  We saw nothing strange.  This convinced my dad that there was nothing to this UFO business.  &#39;Ah, UFOs&#39; he would say and had a good laugh at my expense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thirty-eight years had passed.  I don&#39;t smoke cigarettes anymore.  I had seen a number of UFOs in my life.  When looking back at the past, I almost did not put this experience in with those other unexplainables.  Probably, the reason was it did resemble a close meteor fall.  I assumed this was merely a natural event and was nothing extraterrestrial.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very recently, on television&#39;s Sci-Fi Channel, they showed previews of &#39;Kecksberg Exposed.&#39;  This was a 2-hour special hosted by Bryan Gumball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked forward to this because they were calling it the &#39;new Roswell&#39; and it happened in the Pittsburgh area; my home town.  Minutes into the show, my mouth dropped (as it did 38 years ago) and I said &#39;Oh, my freaking God.&#39;  I saw the Kecksberg UFO!  I certainly should have heard of this event and I&#39;m a little ashamed that I&#39;m not that up on UFO history.  Actually, I&#39;m glad that I didn&#39;t put 2 and 2 together before this point because that would have lessened the revelation that occurred during the documentary.  The most compelling factors in the show that led me to conclude I saw it was:  1) This was the time I had my sighting; late one warm December night in 1965.  2)  Kecksberg is 25 miles southwest of Pittsburgh; Bridgeville is 12 miles southwest of Pittsburgh.  The object moved south and it appeared to us to pass over the southern hill.  3) The UFO, according to all reports, did look similar to a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In an old newsreel film, an interviewer asked a very young Kecksberg resident:  &#39;What did it look like?&#39;  The boy answered:  &#39;A star on fire.&#39;  A street in the small farming town of Kecksberg was named METEOR Street because of this encounter with the object.  People who were able to get a good look at it said that it was acorn-shaped.  An acorn monument was erected in the town and stands to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first reports came out of Canada and the thing in the night&#39;s sky continued southward.  The UFO buzzed the Pittsburgh area and turned...which, of course, indicates that it was not a natural phenomena.  Thousands of reports flooded into news agencies.  KDKA received hundreds of calls alone.  If I was only mature enough, I would have searched through newspapers the next day.  This would have told me that my cousin and I were not alone in our observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kecksberg was another Roswell because the military was dispatched.  Oncemore...government agents, soldiers, Men in Black converged on a small American town.  Guns were pointed at citizens; people&#39;s lives were threatened; there were &#39;radiation&#39; scares; and authorities told people to lie.  People witnessed that federal &#39;suits&#39; seemed to give orders to the military.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This convergence of government officials does not happen when a meteor falls to Earth.  Of course, there are those that will say the Kecksberg UFO was a piece of Soviet intelligence...and that was the reason for military intervention.  The same was said about Roswell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A large, flatbed truck was seen entering the wooded area where the thing seemed to come to a soft landing.  The truck was empty when it went in and covered when it left.  To this day, the Kecksberg controversy rages on as townspeople are divided as to what really occurred.  Some deny the fallen object and that feds made any appearance at all.  Others claim to have had been in direct contact with government intimidation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This writer is very pleased that something did happen at Kecksberg.  I wish my father was alive so I could tell him that I was not crazy.  Or...look dad; there are many others that are just as crazy as I am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report by  Doug Yurchey  Permission granted to post report and name of the witness.

In the year 1965 I was living in southeastern Pennsylvania in a small suburb town 35 miles west of Philadelphia called Newtown square,  in those days i had taken a part time job after school in a new music store,  i got done work about 5 pm  , i was standing on a small stone wall outside the store waiting for my mother to pick me up.   i remember  i was facing east  when over my  right shoulder i heard  what seemed to be that of a jet engine or a very roaring fire overhead,  when i looked up  i saw a large very low flaming object  moving  in a northwesterly direction  i could hear  it  burning through  the air and could easliy see  the flames whipping off the the back of it  i remember thinking it looked like a flaming ice cream cone on its side the way the flames looked fanning around from the front of it  and meeting in the back of it  i remember  there seemed to be some kind of a nipple shaped object on the front of it kinda like  whata bell has,  the object kept going in the direction  until it had passed over the buildings and wasnt outta sight , while seeing it i started yelling to the various people on the street to look at that thing i fell back wards off the wall on my butt while i watched it go out of sight ,again it was very low ,moving slow,  not like a meteor  which moves fast , i could easliy see the flames and hear it  . my mom picked me up and i told her about it   when i got home  i called the local nike sight to report what i saw and ask about it  as usual noone new nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> as the years passed i never forgot what i saw in fact i can still see it to this day  but never heard anything about it until  in 1990     on the tv show unsolved mysteries the  story popped up   then again just a few years ago on  bryant gumbles special, this is a true story  and id swear on a stack of bibles   as to what i saw  , also  that night the sky was still in thetwilight stage  and i remember it as being unusualy warm for that time of the year as i remember now, that christmas season  was in the 50 degree range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness may have been witness to the object, which caused the Kecksburg Incident.

12/1/65 17:00|Poughkeepsie|NY|Triangle|5 min|Early evening  encounter at intersection near Arlington High School with object hovering obove interestion, then quickly disappearing.|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48131.html|16|ndxe196512| Early evening  encounter at intersection near Arlington High School with object hovering obove interestion, then quickly disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was driving to Arlington High School for a basketball game (therefore probably a Friday night).  It was still daylight (getting near dusk, so the date of Dec. is uncertain as it has been a long time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached an interstection with Route 55 (?) from a rural road just east of the high school, I saw a very distinct object hovering at very low altitude above the intersection as I approached.  I stopped and had a visual sighting for several minutes (there was no other traffic on this back road I was on.)  I believe the object was traingular in shape, but it did have what I remember to be 3 blinking lights on its perimeter.  They were different colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as the lights changed colors, the object quickly and silently took off in a westerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
