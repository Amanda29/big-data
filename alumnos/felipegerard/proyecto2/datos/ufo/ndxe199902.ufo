Hovering,moved when I took picture,returned,left area when approached by aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way to bed at 11:45pm,when I noticed a bright glowing light in the sky. It was about 20 degrees above the horizon SW of my position. The sky was about half overcast in light cloud formations. I was the first one to see it,so I got the binoculars to take a closer look. It was a bright glowing blue,red and white object,looked like it was spinning.I then called my daughter and wife to take a look to see what they thought. It was obvious that it was not an aircraft,because both fixed wing jet,and helecopter flew over and the object remained for awhile longer,untill the helicopter approached too close,then the object drifted off in a westerly direction.The object looked to be kind of round.I went outside to get a picture,which I did!at this point the object drifted off in the distance,but still in sight. When I went back in the house the object returned,thats when the helicopter approached too close and the object left.<n>

2/28/99 21:02|Binghamton|NY|Formation|45 seconds|2 groups or 4 orange lights that individually interchange in a non-cyclical pattern. Also, instant 90 degree turning ability.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18684.html|4|ndxe199902| 2 groups or 4 orange lights that individually interchange in a non-cyclical pattern. Also, instant 90 degree turning ability.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 2 groupings of 4 orange lights that within each grouping would cross over one another. It appeared to be a cyclic pattern, but once they were closer to being over head, there was the same pattern of movement over and over. It took only 30 seconds or so for the crafts (or whatever) to go from one horizon to the other. As they got further away, and closer to the opposite horizon, they took an immediate 90 degree turn, without slowing and rapidly sped out of viewable sight. My brother and I witnessed this. We could make out no &#34;craft&#34; only the lights. The odd part about this was that they were no more than 300 to 400 yards above us. Another interesting observatyion that my brother brought to light was the fact that there were no clouds in the sky before we noticed these objects. Upon reeling from what we had both just witnessed, we realized that there were now thick clouds on the original horizon, and fog was now moving in . Very wierd. I do not think that this is anything more han coincidence, but thought I would state the fact. Let me say for the record that I mearly beleive that the possibility for other life in the universe &#34;could&#34; exist. After that event, I beleive that it does. At least something does.<n>

It would be best described as looking like a soccerball with flat sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 2/30/99, at 6:00p.m. I was driving my car and coming up to a stop sign.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed something dark grey in the sky.  (It was an overcast sky with about a 500ft. ceiling.)  At first I thought it was a bird or an airplane but when I took a second look, I realized it was niether of those possibilities.  I live a stone&#39;s throw away from Wright-Patterson AFB so I thought it may have been a weather balloon or possibly a kite or kids helium baloon.  I don&#39;t think it was any of these because it was not moving or rotating.  I was close enough to it to see that it was approximately 3ft. in diameter, spherical, with flat sides (not shiny).  It looked like something you would see on Star Wars used as a probe.  I studied it for about 30 seconds before someone pulled up behind me waiting to turn.  I headed east to get a better look.  I could see it through the tree lines and was anxiously driving to a clear spot.  When I arrived at an open clearing, about 3 blocks away and 1 minute later, it was gone. The day was overcast with little wind.  It was also raining a bit and had been doing so for most of the day.  This would discount the possibility of it being a kite unless we have the second coming of Ben Franklin.  There was also no thunderstorm activity in the area.  Secondly, it was not a balloon because the slight breeze would have moved it.  The clouds were moving around it but it was dead still. I did not hear any noise either. I was also close enough (500ft.) to see that it had two cylindrical objects sticking out of the side, side by side (almost looking like a nose).  I would say they were about the size of pop cans.  I did chase up and down the streets loking for a kid or someone in the rain reeling in a kite but found noone.<n>

At 0844 in the morning we looked up to see a bright orange fireball arching  up from the canadian border..it was moving south...it had a black smoke plume..when it was approximately 40degrees above the horizon it seemed to explode and broke apart in a shower of smaller lights. we thought it may be a missile,but then it would have been heading out to sea..and also would have had a white plume,not black. it was fairly large ,about the size of a pea. I am a manager for a jewelery store in Salem ,Oregon. My friend works for MSN in Washington. This may not apply,but I became very ill after the incident. I am still feeling the effects today as I write this message. I dont know how my friend is feeling.<n>

Slighty Illuminated in a dark orange/burnt sienna color, no blinking lights/silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx 12:25 am on Feb. 28th 1999...I was a DJ for a local party. After the party had ended, I was loading my equipment and jst about finished when 7-8 people were standing in the parking lot of the restaurant looking up at the sky directly overhead. A few a the men and women(mixed crowd) were continually saying in amazment, &#34;what the hell is that&#34;??? They kept saying that for a few seconds and when i looked up it was directly overhead moving from southeast to northeast at a very slow pace. Newark Int. Airport is approx 5 miles from the sighting area and the object was witnessed crossing against the local approach pattern for incoming aircraft.The object was witnessed moving at a very slow rate of speed...slower that any aircraft on approach to landing Approx. moving at a speed of 100 mph or less. the object was observed for approx. 45 seconds and was circular in shape, however, looking up from belore it may have been round. There was a very subtle cloud scatter of very ligyt nature but even with the clouds visibilty was about 90 percent. The object was deep orange in color and almost had a transparrent look to it. there were no blinking lights or strobes and the object made no sound at all.after we veiiewed it for 15 seconds or so..one of the men ran inside to some of the others whom had remained at the party a little later.Several more people came out and witnessed the object for the 20 seconds or so, but by that time it was quite out of range for the human eye to see. from the direction it came from...it had to have passed over a very busy Meadowlands Horce race track the was still in session at the time. It also may have passed over the southern tip of New York City&#39;s Lower Manhattan before making it&#39;s way across the Jersey Border. That&#39;s about all I can tell you at this time. what an experience..!!!<n>

I was paralyzed and watched them for an unknown amount of time. Before I knew it, they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 discs, I don&#39;t know how big, metallic looking, possible lines on the side. They hovered and paralyzed me. It made a low pitched sound that I could feel in my teeth. The power was out at my house. I could see their shadows cast on the ground from the streetlights. The air pulsated around them. I don&#39;t remember much else. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before. When I got inside my house, all the clocks were blinking, as if there had been a power outage. I got scared and ran over to my boyfriend&#39;s house. He thought I ws crazy. I&#39;m a biology major in college. And I don&#39;t usually believe in this kind of stuff. But what I saw really scared me. I want to talk to someone who will understand me. None of my roommates remember anything like this happening. They think I&#39;m crazy too. But I know what I saw was real.<n>

2/27/99 21:32|Laughlin|NV|Light|6-8 min.|A group of approximately 50 adults watched 5 white lights, the apparent size of bright stars, maneuver in the night sky.|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05798.html|12|ndxe199902| A group of approximately 50-70 adults watched 5 white lights, the apparent size of bright stars, maneuver in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting occurred during the banquet and closing ceremonies of the 8th Annual International UFO Congress, being held in Laughlin, NV.  I had been a speaker at the event on the prior morning of the sighting reported here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2130 hrs. (Pacific), a friend approached me in the hallway of the hotel and urged me to run outside immediately, stating that a UFO sighting was in process.  I was skeptical, but since I know the individual well, and know him to be a serious-minded person, I responded to his request.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out to the east side of the hotel, and found approximately 50-70 individuals looking to the east over the Colorado River, generally in the direction of Bullhead City, AZ, which is directly across the Colorado River from Laughlin, NV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked in the direction that they appeared to be looking, approximately 80-90 degrees (azimuth; true), and quickly spotted 5 small, luminous objects, which at first appeared to be prominent stars, approximately the same magnitude and &#34;size&#34; of the stars that form the &#34;belt&#34; in the Orion constellation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of the lights on the right, approximately 45-50 (est.) degrees above the horizontal plane, were in a formation that made me believe initially that I was looking at the Orion constellation, but the &#34;lights&#34; were in the eastern sky, and the Orion constellation is located in the southern sky at that time of night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 2-5 degrees above the three lights, and approximately 5 degrees to their left, were two more, similar, &#34;lights.&#34;  Just a few seconds after I had begun looking at the two lights on the left, I observed that they were moving relative to one another.  They were turning, accelerating for a second or two, slowing suddenly, and then changing direction again.  Their movement seemed almost random, although they clearly were changing position, circling one another, etc..<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I was intrigued by the display, given that it was profoundly bizarre and anomalous.  The display was like nothing I had seen in 51 years on this planet!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked back at the three lights on the right, and was even more intrigued to note that they no longer formed a straight line, but they were moving, and within seconds they were beginning to orient themselves relative to one another in a triangular formation.  Within an estimated 5-10 seconds, they had formed into an isosceles triangle, and all of them were moving generally to the southwest, or south-southwest, at a very slow (angular) velocity, e.g. approx. 1 deg./sec..  That is, they had reversed their course from generally south to north, when I first observed them, to north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire group of witnesses stood in place, watching the lights slowly drift in that direction, for approximately 6-8 minutes.  All of the lights passed &#34;below&#34; an almost full moon, becoming fainter, it seemed to me, as they moved to the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, the lights were no longer visible to me and they became progressively fainter until they were no longer visible to any of the witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what the objects were, but they CLEARLY were not meteors (!!), conventional aircraft, birds, insects, satellites, or any other object of terrestrial origin, with which I am familiar.<n>

Then I saw only one. It was moving in a strange way up and down and then up and down. I noticed them because I was looking at some strange contrails in the sky on my way home that night. They were very strange. The contrails were at night lit up by the full moon. They were also very wide, low to the horison, and crisscrossed in loops, mt least 4 or more that I could see. Then the contrails got very wide and stayed in the sky a longer time than usual. Then the clear sky became full of many small clouds. Just filled the sky. Where did they come from I don&#39;t know. When the moonlight hit them, they looked different, like water looks when it shines on water with oil in it.<n>

Using my dss dish as a reference, I say they were at about 85 degrees magnetic and about 35 degrees above the horizon. I observed them for about 6 minutes doing this jerking movement. Then the two lights moved closer to the moon. It was harder to see them against the moon light.

We were on I-84 near the Idaho Utah border maybe further into Utah, I&#39;m not exactly sure. I was looking up at the stars from the back seat when I spotted a brighter star. I stared at it realized it was moving parallel to the freeway probably a mile or two away, it wasn&#39;t low to the ground probably about as high as a plane. At first I thought it was a satellite so I informed my friends who began to observe it as well. We quickly concluded it was moving to fast, was too bright, was way to low, and as its path started to change from a straight line to an arc we didn&#39;t know what to make of it. We observed it for another 15-20 seconds before it went above the clouds. Just as it dissapeared we saw a plane moving very fast from the opposite direction. It was on a direct path to possibly intersect the bright light some distance ahead but it too  went above the clouds. Their paths would have made an &#39;X&#39; in the sky. We saw nothing after that, the cloud cover obscured the sky for the next half hour or so. I probably would have dismissed the incident but the fact that a plane was in the area too makes it weird. Whoever was flying that plane might have seen it too.<n>

Suddenly, a second object, brightly reflecting sunlight, closed rapidly behind the jet from the aft starboard quarter.  I lost visual of said object as I scrambled outside with my digital camera, and never reacquired a visual on the unknown.  I would estimate object in question was at about 1500 yards distance from jet aircraft when observed, and closed distance by approximately half in the short duration of the observed event.  Whatever it was, it was way too close to the jet aircraft for normal flight spacing parameter&#39;s for safety.  No contrail observed from unknown!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only additional information I can add is that the jet aircraft was in a Northwesterly heading at time of said event!  The unknown was in a more westerly heading during time of event, as if to intersect with the contrail a few hundred yards behind jet!  Unknown appeared to be highly reflective of sunlight, but no reflection or glare from sun was observed from airframe at same time of sighting/event.  Though I am in Cumberland County, I believe the event ocurred over Franklin County to my west.  This was my 2nd such sighting of this type in this same air corridor over the last year or so!  My last was seen from Boiling Springs, and in the same general viscinity/air corridor!<n>

I have been interested in UFOlogy for about two years now and attended an event in Seattle last August attended by Mr. Davenport and Dr. Greer. I am not 100% sure what I saw was of unexplicable orgin, it was however like nothing I have ever seen before. I was driving north on the 101 freeway, 85 miles south of San Francisco, in a very wilderness area.  I was on top of a hill and had a clear view of the sky obstructed by very few trees.  I was momentary startled as a bright flash of light streaked from the top of my wind shield towards the nothern horizon.  It moved through the sky at incredible speed and flashed twice before disappearing beyond the horizon.  The streak of light was whitish-yellow in appearance and had significant thickness giving the perspective of something that was realitivly close to the ground, three or four miles would be my unfounded impression.  Also the light was very bright especially in the two instances when it flashed, the drama of the effect resembled a lightning flash close then resembled any meteor I&#39;ve ever seen, with exception that the line traced in the sky was straight and there were no clouds in the sky. Also the object did not appear to burn our and fade away as meteors do, rather it just appeared to vanish at a point 20 degrees above the horizon, as if moving away from me a great speed. For some odd reason the second flash the object made, reminded me of the intro scenes to star trek the next generation where the enterprise makes a flash before going to warp. Nevertheless, in summary. The object had a large apparent size given the thickness of the trail. The object made two flashes as it streaked across the sky. The object traved from south to north. The object traversed at least 70 degrees of sky in 1/4th a second. The object was very bright, and had the effect of startling me.<n>

As I observed the plane and the contrail with my binoculars I noticed a small light above the contrail which looked like a large star. It was still daylight and too light outside for it to have been a star. I continued observing this light from my car looking overhead slightly to the south. It suddenly disappeared. I kept looking for it in the same general area to no avail. Then, at about 17:52, I spotted a white oval craft (definitely a craft) hovering around 5,000 feet overhead slightly to the south. It began to move north very slowly (in the direction of the plane). It appeared to reflect the sun on its side toward the west and had what appeared to be a silver band around its midsection. It began to move over my car so I had to get out to find it again -- and it was nowhere to be seen. I do not know whether the light was this oval craft descending to a lower position or the light and the oval craft were two separate objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received a number of reports of anomalous objects in, or near, normal contrails behind aircraft.  We do not know what these objects are.))<n>

But I looked up at it a few minutes later, and it was still there, and it stayed there for at least 15 minutes, and I even went outside to look at it. The lights were red, white, and blue. It didn&#39;t move, and I think if I could have seen it in the day it would have been vertical oval shaped. There were four lights I could see, and the ship looked rather small. When I was outside looking at it, I got the creepy feeling that I was being watched, and the feeling lasted after I got inside. When I got inside I looked out the window, and it was gone.<n>

Then one went towards the west which is towards a town called Corning, NY the other two went up they were heading kind of north west then the all disapeared up into the clouds they were still moving kind of slow.<n>

I pulled over and it was extremely dark.  The craft appeared to be either chevron or triangular shaped.  One vehicle passed me going south bound and from this i estimated the speed of the craft.  As I was parked there the craft turned away ( towards the east slightly )  I must note that the exact shape is not known.  It appeared to have a bright light at each wing tip, one in the middle, a red blinking one behind it, which was not noticeable until it passed by and about six square window  like lights on the bottom surface of the wings.  It made an jet like noise but at a much lower decible level and the noise did trail the actual craft.  Shortly after I noticed the two light pattern moving northward at a very high speed, turn towards the west, then south then east over me at a much higher altitude and continue east.  It might just be an airplane, posibly a shape simalar to the B-2, the the extrememly slow speed is the main reason I am reporting in hopes to some insight as to what it was.<n>

We watched it for about 30 minutes and it moved only slightly during that period.  After another 1/2 hour it had moved perhaps 5 degrees higher in the sky and then abruptly disappeared.<n>

The object was going east to west. As it got about three to five miles from the house, there seemed to be something following it to the right of the object.I thought it might possibly be an aircraft following it. There was no sound whatsoever except the traffic on the highway. We watched this object for about 20 to 25 minutes. I called My dad to see if he could see anything from his house. He lives 70 miles from us. He did not see the object. The next day, the news media called the object an airplane. The object was too big and too quite to be any aircraft.

Top light was bright and white, bottom was less bright and orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed these objects from a second story bedroom window at approximately 1945 on Feb 23 1999.  I had a clear, unobstructed view, the sky was clear and the moon was about a quarter full, fairly high in the sky, with a large round but fairly dim halo around it, but the objects did not display this halo. I believed them to be a planetary conjunction at first, but was surprised that I had not heard about this occurrence ahead of time, because it was very unusual and dramatic, and hadn&#39;t noticed anything like this the night before.  The objects appeared to be stationary.  The top light was bright enough to cause a starburst pattern in my glasses, which frankly annoyed me because I wanted a better view and could not get one because of the distortion.  The bottom object appeared to be a planet, I assumed Mars due to the orange coloring, and the top object was what I thought might be Venus, except that it was substantially brighter than I recall seeing it.  Neither object flashed or twinkled in any way.  I watched for approximately five minutes and then returned to work on my computer. My wife arrived home at about 2015.  I asked her if she had seen these objects and she stated that she had, just prior to pulling into the driveway.  I went back to the window to get another look, and both objects were gone.  I went outside to see if they had somehow moved out of view, which seemed unlikely if they were planets, but could no longer see them.  While I was watching, I noticed what was probably an airliner with an unusually bright pattern of flashing lights traveling west to east.  Ordinarily, I am not able to see aircraft structure at night, but in this case there seemed to be a wide body visible even when the lights were not flashing.  I do not necessarily believe that this aircraft was related to the other two objects, but it was unusual enough to catch my attention. The following morning (today actually, 24 Feb 99) on my way to work, I turned on the radio expecting to hear about the objects of the previous night and was surprised to hear that at approximately 0630 there were wide spread reports of fireballs and bright lights seen in various locations in northern Michigan.  I did not witness these objects, although I was awake when they occurred.  State Police are saying that these objects were probably meteors.  No mention was made of the objects of the previous night.<n>

The very bright fireball appeared about as large as the end of one of my index finger. I was amazed because this supposed fireball or shooting star was moving very slowly and the tail was equally as bright at the circular shape of the object as it was bright at the very tip of the tail.  The tail was so finely pointed, as though it were as sharp as the tip of a needle.  The flared trail was clear and bright and did not flicker or have a smoke trail like a comet or shooting star does.  We both watched this in astonishment moving at what seemd like about the speed of a car on the freeway (70 MPH) although it was difficult to read speed.  This was very slow compared to a shooting star.  After about 20 seconds or so, the flared tail and the very bright golden-orange light cut out, as though a rocket or thruster engine was turned off.  Now the object appeared round or diamond shaped (and had the appearance of a solid structure) and had a few very small lights (2-3) on and coasted in a straight line in the same direction for about another minute or so before we lost sight of it on the horizon and behind a mountain. There were a number of airplanes in the sky not far from the object which must have seen it.  Because there were airplanes with their flashing lights on, you could clearly distinguish the vast difference in light and character of this extremely bright fireball/craft and an airplane. The airplane lights were not even comparable to the clear brightness of this fireball/craft.  There were a few drivers/cars on the road which we thought must have also seen the objec! t which was so striking in the night city sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional information about my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is in addition to the report I just made.  I just received an e-mail from ((Name deleted))I, NASA&#39;s Head of Astrochemistry. While the orange fireball my friend Brenda and I saw moved across the sky for a minute or so, I estimated that it was traveling at a speed similar to our car (70 mph).  When you look at this letter from NASA, it is clear that meteors travel much faster than 70 mph.  It reads: &#34;Most meteors travel in prograde orbits near the ecliptic plane (this is up to + or - 23 degrees from the equator, depending on the season).  This means that any meteors that you see from outside earth should travel roughly parallel paths; most meteors have velocities greater than 20 km/s - some travel slower, most travel faster.  20 km/sec comes to 72,000 km per hour. As you can see, what I saw was traveling much slower than 72,000 kilometers per hour.  How then could it have been a meteor?<n>

It was shaped like a ice cream cone, but flying on it side, with a stout tail and all blazing at the same color temperature of rich fire gold. As it crossed right in front of us it started to extinguish its flames, in much the same way your furnace turns off, showing hues of blue, green, red and gold. It seem to crackle, I didn&#39;t hear anything but the way the fire went out it was uneven and there seemed to be sparks. When it was just to our left, it was completely extinguished and I saw the outline of a craft, which appeared small and circular, with a single blue/green light. It continued to move very slowly and we then lost visual contact with it due to our direction of  travel. The whole event was approx. 2 minutes long.<n>

WALLACE NEWS-PRESS STAFF WRITER After more than a month of delays and 10 scrubbed launch attempts, the first satellites built by Denmark and South Africa were boosted into orbit Tuesday from Vandenberg Air Force Base, with both nations gratefully heralding the start of their own space ages. On the 11th launch attempt, the Boeing Delta 2 rocket burst into a clear sky at 2:29 a.m. Tuesday. The rocket carried into orbit the Danes&#39; Orsted satellite, the South African SUNSAT and the ARGOS, a global environmental and military space project that is the largest and most sophisticated research satellite ever taken into space for the United States. The rocket&#39;s fiery ascent through the stars could be seen by onlookers for more than three minutes, as the booster reached speeds of 10,000 mph. &#34;Thanks to the people of America, this is the first small step of ours into space,&#39;&#39; Garth Milne, SUNSAT project manager, said at a January press conference. It was a long road for the foreign satellites. The launch, originally scheduled for early January, was continually delayed because of bad weather and various mechanical problems. The launch was a highly anticipated international venture, but the more than 100 dignitaries, industry leaders and students from South Africa and Denmark who spent the first half of January on the Central Coast returned home weeks ago. South Africa&#39;s satellite quest began in 1991 at the University of Stellenbosch. Initially, 14 graduate engineering students were involved Ñ a number that grew to more than<n>

Each eventually faded from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximateley 20:00 local time, approximately due West, approximately 30 degrees above the (distant) horizon: I observed two fairly bright lights separated nearly vertically by about the width of two full moons. The lower was considerably brighter than the upper. They looked exactly like two planets and I assumed that is what they were. About 10 minutes later I noticed them again but perhaps 20 degrees above and slightly further north on the horizon. The spacing appeared to be exactly the same. I realized planets would not be moving this fast so I grabbed my 10 power binoculars for a better look. Through the binoculars the upper light had a pronouced orange coloration similar to a sodium vapor lamp. The lower light appeared to be an almost bluish white, then on longer inspection it seemed to be cycling through several colors. It was considerably brighter than the upper. At this point I called my wife, Debby, who has low vision but with her monocular observed the two lights. She describes one as brighter and possibly changing color. I steadied my binoculars on a porch railing. I was now able to just barely make out that the lower light was composed of either two white lights one above the other or a verically elongated white light. Between the two lights (or at the center of the elongated one) and barely to the left (south) was a red light flashing once every second or two. Apparently this is what I mistook for changing colors. I now called my uncle Tom, to grab his binoculars and look. No more than a minute can have passed but when I got back outside, the lower and previously brighter light had faded to near invisibilty (it was no longer visible to me without my binoculars). While I watched, it continued to fade until it was no longer visible (about 30 more seconds). So Uncle Tom only observed the upper light, but he also felt it was moving very slowly. I now concentrated on the upper light. The color and brightness were unchanged but as I watched, it appeared to slowly elongated vertically to a length that was still a small fraction of the width of the moon (maybe 5%). This may have taken half a minute. It then began to fade. Over perhaps another 30 seconds it faded to near invisibility and I lowered my binoculars. Maybe 15 seconds later I raised the binoculars for one more look and it was again visible but at only about half its original brighness. It then slowly faded away. Through all this its color never changed. Occasionally during this period I swung my binoculars to various stars. They all were clearly point sources of light, unlike the unknown objects that appeared to be slightly elongated. Yet the elongation of the upper object was so slight I kept wondering if it could have been caused by a trembling of the binoculars. Still I did not see it on stars. Still I repeat, although the lower light was tiny, even through binoculars, I could clearly distinquish an elongated white light with a flashing red light slightly to the left and centered vertically. There were no stars clearly visible as near the horizon as the objects but toward the zenith the stars were clear and bright. I am familiar with the sight of airplanes at night. I am 60 miles south of Pittsburgh PA and there are almost always one or two visible in the night sky. The unknown objects moved far two slowly to be airplanes and the lights were simply not the same. And although I obsereved airplanes elsewhere in the sky during this period, I never saw any near the objects. They were not LEO satellites. They moved far two slowly and they were much too bright. I am absolutely certain they were not celestial objects. The colors, the motion and the fading demonstrate that. I have seen many objects in the sky that were unusual at first glance but that I was eventually able to identify. Prolonged observation proved these objects to be more and more strange. I have no idea what it was that I saw.<n>

They were in the southern hemisphere, about 30 degrees from horizontal.  They were very far away.  They looked similar to 2 airplanes flying directly towards me.  I could not see any distinguishing features. The sky was clear, but since I couldn&#39;t see as many stars as usual, there may have been a thin layer of clouds. The clouds were thick enough to block out all but the brightest stars.  Very few stars were visible. The 3 stars on Orion&#39;s belt were visible but dim.  I was able to watch the 2 objects on my way home from work. I drive south on the Hutchinson River Parkway in Westchester.  They were in my field of view the entire time. I stopped at a golf driving range on weaver street because I had a clear view from there.  I saw several very small and faint objects moving in the general vicinity.  These objects had blinking lights.  They also seemed to be moving faster than they should have been for the distance they were from me.  When I arrived home, the 2 lights were still in the same exact relationship to each other and appeared to not move in the 30 min it took for me to get home. Once home, I observed their position for about 10 more minutes.  I could not detect any movement.  I left the room for about 30 minutes and when I went to check up on the 2 lights, they were gone.  I looked around the sky there was nothing that even slightly resembled their intensity or proximity with respect to each other. I showed my wife the 2 lights and some co-workers had also seen them. Since it looked like from my vantage point that they were over Manhattan, someone suggested it was 2 blimps. But their distance between each other never changed for the hour I observed it. I would like to know if anyone else has reported this and if you know what I was seeing. thank you ((name deleted))<n>

I had power windows and rolled the passenger side down to see better and there wasn&#39;t any sound or movement at all it was just stationary up above the treeline.I have always been a skeptic untill that evening.I haven&#39;t heard of any other UFO&#39;s with this shape,if I were to guess it&#39;s size it would have appeared to be larger than a helecopter and similar in shape to a cell tower without a support platform under.Every time we travel through that spot we call it UFO hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Again, was in hot tub at approx. the same time as 12/22 incident. In addition to my girlfriend,this time my 3 sons also witnessed it. First I saw a black + for about 3 seconds traveling west to east. I said &#34;look at that!&#34; But it disappeared before anybody else saw it. Then a minute or two later I saw a single &#34;light&#34; in the same general area as our previous sighting-near DIA area. This time the object primarily hovered with occasional quick horizontal moves. Grabbed my video cam but battery was dead, so took pictures with a 35mm (couldn&#39;t) see object thru viewfinder and haven&#39;t developed film yet) focusing on general area I could see the object in with naked eye. At first I though it might be a balloon as it wasn&#39;t moving much, but its quick movements dispelled that notion. After 10 minutes or so it just vanished. Before this all happened my girlfriend commented &#34;there go the military planes again&#34;. There were also 5 or 6 planes taking off from DIA right before this who&#39;s colors I was unfamiliar with, white body with blue tail&#39;s ???<n>
2/21/99 01:30|New York City (Brooklyn) (Bensonhurst)|NY|Light|15-30 min|A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY WITH A NARROW LINE GOING DOWN TO THE ROOF ETC. IT "READ" ME AND HID ITSELF|1/31/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34763.html|67|ndxe199902| A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY WITH A NARROW LINE GOING DOWN TO THE ROOF ETC. IT &#34;READ&#34; ME AND HID ITSELF<n> <n><n> <n><n> What my grandma and I saw was unbelievable. The whole experience took anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes. It was late at night, like about 1:30 am, in 1999 (Im not 100% sure of the year, or date, though). We lived (myself and the family still does) in a one-bedroom apartment. The windows are facing the back yard and an abandoned building.But if you look out of the window, to the right, you can see a crack which lets you see the buildings further down the block and a few blocks thereafter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night my grandma came over so I gave up my living room bed and slept on the couch. Well anyways, granny wanted to go to sleep so I turned off the lights. As I was heading to sleep, I passed the window and noticed a bright, strange-looking white light hovering above one of the apartment buildings further down the block. There wasn&#39;t much room to see it but I noticed it for the sole reason that it was so BRIGHT. At first I figured it was some crazily helicopter but it was absolutely silent, and it was so dark out that I could not see the structure of the object other than its light(s). As I came closer to the window I noticed that the light had a narrow but bright,white line (like a beam) coming down from it to the roof of the building and right on top of the roof, this line was connected to something rotating on the roof in a circular motion. I couldn&#39;t tell what it was, but I could certainly tell that it was rotating extremly fast and voilently. Right about then I was thinking UFO. After about 5 minutes of glaring at the object(s)I went to find my binoculars so I could take a better look but I had no luck as everyone was sleeping; Then I woke up my grandma, who was almost asleep and told her to take a look at this unbelievable thing. Granny wanted to turn on the light so she could see it better but that didn&#39;t help, so I turned the light back off. Right after, the object&#39;s narrow, bright line swooped to our window and shined a light directly at us through our window for about 3-5 seconds. It felt like a helicopter shining its light at somebody on the street except it was at least 1/7th to 1/8th (a guess) of a mile away, much too far. Imagine a giant searchlight on the roof of a 5 story building shining at you directly through your window. I guess that meant that it could probably tell that we were observing it because of the light switching. Well anyways, it felt like the light was &#34;reading&#34; me. I was scared like hell and my hands started to shake. Right after, the narrow line came back to initial p! osition and, along with the rotating object(s)appeared to have moved from the roof and into the bright light on top of them. Suddenly, the light slowly dissappeared behind the building and I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, it was very possible for other people in my building to see this, but most of them were probably asleep. And, oh yeah; One of my friends from high school tried to make me promise to never tell this experience to anyone ever again after I told it to him (we are not friends anymore). Who knows why he asked me, but the fact that someone like that seriously told me never to give this info away is crazy. I HAVE THE FREEDOM TO SAY WHATS ON MY MIND. Thank you for listening to my story. Please respond. I really want to know more about this strange occurence.<n>

So i got my husband to look out the kitchen window,out to the backyard..up into the sky.i showed him, and he was amazed.I was scared. I watched this thing, this light that had no sound, no body,lightly float over my house.my kitchen lights were Off.I ran into the next room, following it, and it continued on,till out of sight.it was so low, and no sound. it was about 100 ft above my house.My husband now denies seeing it,says there is nothing we can do.i see this still. and i close my eyes and walk away... Fearing looking out my window at night.Now.. there is 1 more incident that is fresh in my mind.the incident i just described happenes often.But this incident i am going to explain next.. happened in August/98. I even saw a shrink for this. she thought i was nutz, i never went back to her again...I cannot Tell you how scary this was. It was about 2-2:30 a.m. and a cloudy night.I awoke from my sleep,my son needed a bottle.i walked through the living room,looking out the slider,to see a bright ball of light. I thought to myself,&#34;wow, full moon tonight!&#34;..and still half asleep, i went to the kitchen.as i was preparing this bottle, i realized it wasnt a full moon. it was not a night for the full moon to appear, nor was a moon low to the ground, almost 10-15 feet off the ground.so i panicked. i froze.I went over to the window and peeked out numerous times, not to be seen, and took a streneuos look at what it was..maybe it was a flashlight,maybe it was something explainable.It wasnt. the light got smaller.then i told it to go away, in my mind,..telling it to go away.this light was in my neibors yard.Now thier house went up for sale soon after this.i am not sure if it is related to this experience....so anyways, this ball of light suddenly got bright, and dissapeared.That was it. But, i do remember the light facing twords my house.like, when a helicopter with a light flickers when it moves. this did.but not that you could really notice it.i swear it was something.I know it was a ball of light with no body,No sound, and dissappeared in seconds.the end.<n>

We sit out there quite often to watch the animals in our yard, three and a half acres in rural Rhode Island.  We were watching a fox feed on bread we had put out when the craft appeared heading in a southerly direction.  We stepped out to the porch for a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft passed over us silently, slowly, steadily.  The underside of it was dimly lighted by a hazy white light, thus making it possible to see the logo.  The logo was a triangle edged in yellow containing the Earth being struck by two red lightning bolts with a number &#34;1&#34; in the right hand corner all on a black background.  As it approached, a feeling of serenity and calm came over us making it a wonderful feeling to watch as it passed overhead.  I estimate the speed of the craft at approximately five to ten miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size approximately forty feet in length and forty feet wide at the rear of the craft with the nose of the craft forming a point. The craft looked very similar to the Stealth fighter, however, it was much larger than the plane.  The altitude of the craft was approximately one hundred feet.  I repeat, there was not a sound from the craft and it did not even create a breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will email you a copy of the logo we made. I would appreciate any answers you might have as to what this craft is or who it belongs to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

It then just moved around some more and the diappeared.<n>
2/20/99 20:20|San Jose|CA|Unknown|10 Seconds|The overcast north-eastern sky was flashing like a strobe light, lighting up the entire horizon.|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05608.html|71|ndxe199902| The overcast north-eastern sky was flashing like a strobe light, lighting up the entire horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a report of a craft sighting, rather, it is a report of an unusual event seen in the sky.  The event was witnessed from San Jose, California, just north of the Almaden Valley.  It was exactly 8:20 pm, Pacific time, on Saturday, February 20, 1999.  The sky was overcast. I was inside the office in my house, and I happened to glance out the office window, which faces due East.  In the nort-eastern sky, I noticed that the entire sky was flashing quickly and regularly, like a strobe light, only slower.  The flashes were bright enough to have been lightening, but I doubt they were, because they were too frequent, and too regular in frequency.  I would estimate the frequency of the flashes to be around 4-5 flashes per second, evenly spaced in time. The entire duration of my sighting was approximately 10 seconds.  The entire portion of the sky that I could see was lighting up, but it definitely appeared as though the source of the flashing lights was in the north-eastern sky, which happens to be the approximate direction of the Mount Hamilton observatory (I think that&#39;s the name of it -- during the day, the telescope is visible on the mountain top).  Just for reference, the San Jose airport is north-west of my house, and would have been roughly at my back at the time of this incident.<n>

Catty corner from where I was standing is, first a 4 to 5 lane road, after which is an entirely different apartment complex that is 2 stories high.  It was evening but not 100% dark yet, both apartment lights had automatically come on by this time.  I looked across the street at our neighboring apartments to see some lights floating above the building.  The lights matched the color of the apartment lights which were orange (that industrial orange you see everywhere).  I thought I was seeing things so I covered the apartments from my view with my right hand...  I then saw what it was that was floating above the apartments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was amazed to see 2 UFO’s they were round, and both had 3 lights shining, the lights were round and placed in a triangle pattern at the bottom of the UFO.  They were literally 3 stories from the ground.  They hovered around each other, in very close proximity to each other, without making a sound.  They did this for what seemed to be 1-2 minutes before accelerating to speeds of, I can’t even make an educated guess at how extremely fast they took off toward the east.  They took off almost parallel to the earth (if that makes any since) in other words they didn’t go straight up they left at an angle.  Their speed literally went from maybe 1-2 mph to an excess of 200 mph in 1 second. They both left at the exact same time as if they both knew it was time to go.  As they left,  they made not one sound, they were gone and I haven’t seen them again since, although I wish I would catch another glimpse of them because they do fascinate me.  I can only imagine the view from someone in that apartment complex, to have walked outside, looked up and seen 2 UFO’s hovering above them only 3 stories from reach.  Amazing!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Saw a single white cloud appearing object in the sky to the east. I had to bend my head backward slightly to see it. I could tell it was moving to the east. No other aircraft were in the area. I would guess it was 10,000 to 15,000 feet high. The entire object was white. I called my daughter about 20:00. She ask me if I had seen the object in the sky. They observed it and said it took about 35 minutes for it to get closer to the ground and appeared to be white and bigger than a jet airplane. It decended straight down and disappeared in a southerly direction. 5 people witnessed it from their home. There was nothing on the radio or T.V. about it. They saw 2 amber flashes of light from the object.<n>

The objects followed about a full plane&#39;s distance behind the airliner.  The ojects then moved around the airliner like swarming flies.  The objects abandoned the plane unharmed and commited gentle manuvers in all directions before disappearing from sight.  The objects I decided were spherical after seeing them through my father&#39;s binoculars.  I called both my parents out of the house to see the event and both saw the objects for a couple of minutes.  They too were puzzled.  The objects reflected sunlight however I know they were unconventional aircraft because they exhibited unconventional behavior.<n>

I observed the craft fly through or above one cloud.   I tried to show my 16-year old son, but it was almost invisable and I lost sight of it after seeing it only three times as it moved north in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired deputy sheriff.  I have lived in Elk Grove for almost 30 years.  I have always been interested in aircraft.  When I was assigned to Sacramento&#39;s Metro Airport, I became very familiar with the many different models of commercial, military, and private airplanes and jet aircraft.  I still watch aircraft flying high over the Sacramento/Elk Grove area.  I can usually identify the model of aircraft (747s, DC10s, 727s, 737s, DC-9/80s, B-52s, KC-135s, KC-10s, etc.).  I have never seen a &#34;UFO&#34; before. The single craft was almond shaped with the widest part at the rear.  The edge around the object appeared to be white.  The space inside the perimeter of the object was almost transparent.  I could see the blue sky through it.  The white edge around the craft looked like a slow spinning gear.  It moved north in a straight line.  The craft was flying at a high altitude.  It had no wings and it did not emit smoke.  There was no contrail.  No lights.  No sound.  At high altitude, it was longer than, and much wider than, a high flying B-52.  At least two times as wide.  It was not moving across the sky as fast as a large jet aircraft.  Because it was transparent, I can&#39;t estimate how tall it was.  I have never seen anything like this object.  It was not a large helicopter.  It was not a hot air balloon.  It did not look capable of flight. I tried to show my son the object, but I lost sight of it twice when I momentarily looked away.  I saw it two more times and then lost sight of it as it moved farther away. Please feel free to contact me via e-mail.<n>

The lights were different colors: red, green, yellow and blue.  The lights were arranged in a line diagonally.  The object was very close, but because of it still being dark out it was hard to make out the exact shape of the aircraft. I didn&#39;t tell a soul for several months afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was on my computer in front of a large window and it appeared within my view. A small area of the clouds glowed as if a large light was passing through it.  Only saw it for 5 seconds but it was a very smooth movement.  Can&#39;t offer much more detail because the view was obsructed by trees and the porch.  The light was very bright, more than that of the moon through the clouds.  My first thought is that is was an airplane with landing lights passing through the clouds, but it was a crisp light-blue color... and there was no sounds since it seemed very near, maybe 200 feet away. It couldn&#39;t have been a meteor because it was very much within the clouds traveling smoothly and slowly.  I was not able to see it anymore after i got up and looked out the door.<n>

At approximately 9:20 PM, I noticed a strange large amber light in the northwest sky, approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. At first I thought it was the moon, but I knew the moon wouldn&#39;t be in the southwest sky at 9:20 at night...it&#39;s too early. One of us commented seeing the object, and all acknowledged they had been watching it for about a minute. The object was about 1.5x the normal size of the moon in the night sky. The fog had rolled in by then, but about a half-sphere was visible through the fog, as if it was partially masked. The object did not appear to move at all, and within 10 seconds slowly faded into nothing. The object must have been some ways off because even travelling at 70 MPH did not make the object appear to be moving.<n>

It was about the size of the moon on a clear night, but this night was partly cloudy. As I watched it it stayed there for a few min. and then seemed to go off into the west and disappear. This was between 9:00-9:30 on the 19 of Feb. 1999. I have know idea what it was that I saw.<n>

We observed the objects facing SW from Sedona to the right of a crescent moon that evening. We watched incredulously for approx. 45 min. while the two objects would alternately brighten and dim- one at a time! The lower of the two objects would dim-out and become a small cloud- only to return a few minutes later. We joked that perhaps they were UFO&#39;s who were &#34;playing star&#34;. We took 3 photos and at the exact moment the camera flashed we each saw thousands of little beams or particles (like the old Asteriods screen-savers). The photos DID NOT develop when we returned home to Sacramento. These three exposures were in the middle of a known good roll of film (everything else obviously developed) and we&#39;re attempting to have the film company try again developing. We were quite surprised 2 nights later when we sighted these 2 objects again after leaving Boynton Canyon at about the same time in the evening. Once again we observed the objects for about 45 minutes before leaving the area to return to Sacramento. A few hours later we were too tired to continue and spent the night in Laughlin, NV. While there we seemed to be drawn to what was the UFO Congress event by sheer synchronicity so we spent another day there. We didn&#39;t think our experience unusual as we had both experienced strange energies the past 4 days and had spiritual experiences while at the Sedona vortexes. I heard Peter Davenport and Roger Leir on Art Bell the other night so I faxed the report to Art and he read it on-the-air. Somehow, neither of us seem the least bit surprised about the sighting you had described there. My girlfriend is an admissions counselor at UC Davis and these were her first UFO experiences. I am a musician on The Chapman Stick (and I performed twice for the Intl. UFO Congress on Monday 2/22). I have had two other sightin! gs in my life before this weekend. Neither of us drink or use any type of drugs.<n>

I saw a light in the distance which I thought was a plane. As I drove the light was not getting closer just dimmer then brighter. I came to a &#34;T&#34; in the road. The object was very close now. I got out of my car and noticed a white light in front of the aircraft then 4 red lights in a row along the right side underneath. I thought it was some sort of blimp until I estimated it going 100-200 mph (approx 5000 ft high). The object flew straight over my head with no sound. I chased it in my car. The object then vanished. I thought I saw it reappear miles ahead of me for about 2 seconds. It was dark but not pitch black. No stars were in the sky yet.<n>

I exited my front door at 4:45am on 2/19/99 to meet my neighbor to go offshore fishing that day. I ussually star gaze while waiting for him to show. I also can see rocket and shuttle lauches directly out my front door which faces due east toward port canaveral. This object did not fit that pattern nor was it in the appropriate location which is always ENE of my perspective, nor did it act like a meteor which i also enjoy watching while night fishing or during meteor showers. I also live near the Orlando airport so i have seen plenty of aircraft.  I noticed this object high in the eastern sky ESE of my perspective. It resembled the brightness of a planet on a clear night but slightly brighter and larger than venus. Its light appeared to pulse a bit more than i have seen in stars or planets in varing atmospheric conditions so i stared at it for just over a minute. As i was looking at it, it shot off into space leaving a blaze trail (sparkle trail) as if leaving the upper atmosphere. As the trail ceased the brightness of the object faded the object appeared much smaller but continued on into space until i no longer could see it, not beyond the horizon just due to its distance. At the point of vanishing it was still high in the east but ENE of my perspective.  I told my neighbor of this sighting as soon as he came over I also told one of my employees that evening when we came back from fishing as well as a few associates in the next few weeks afterwhich time i though it best to keep it to myself.<n>

One red light &#34;not flashing&#34; set centered between the two inner most lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Feb. 18 at about 11:30 pm, I was traveling west on I-76 in N.E. Ohio, While crossing over Lake Milton in the portage county area, I noticed 4 bright lights slowly moving across the sky at a low altitude for this area. At first I thought it was a plane, but this did not more at a speed that a plane would fly. It was about 100+ feet off the ground, I thought it was going to crash into the lake. I watched this craft for about 2 minutes, as it hung over the highway. It WAS moving but much to slow.  I got on the cb and asked if anyone else could make out what it was, everyone else said either they did not know, or that it was a plane. But no one could actually see the shape of the craft. It was to dark outside and the lights were to bright to make out any shape. One of the truckdrivers said that there was a military airport just north of us, but I live in this area. The base IS north of us, but it is not close enough for aircraft to fly this low. The 4 lights on the front of this craft were pointing down in a 45 degree angle to the flight path of the craft. I looked for other lights that would prove it was an airplane. I saw 1 red light directly center of the 4 &#34;headlights&#34; But it was not flashing, just glowing. Unfortunatly I could not stop to watch the craft or see where it would have went. No one else could tell where it had went to either. One driver made the comment that &#34;he thought it was going to land on his truck&#34; this craft made no noticable noise (what I could here from inside my truck) and did not seem to displace any air at the low altitude it was flying. Mr. Davenport, I dismissed this as an airplane, possibly military. However after listening to you on Art Bells show on Feb. 19th. I found myself second guessing what I saw. One of the ladies, that you had interviewed and replayed on the show, described what I had seen almost to a tee!  Now I am wondering just what I really saw. I know my experiance only lasted but a few short minutes, but it felt like many minutes longer. This is not far from Trumble county or from the Pennsilvania State line. Thanks for taking the time to listen. What ever it was!<n>

Visual confirmation by ATC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 02-18-99, at 0200, I observed an object in the sky approximately 30 degrees above the horizon, northwest (approximately 315 degree magnetic)of the intersection of US 1 and Edgewood Ave. in Jacksonville, FL. Initially the object appeared to be a brighter than normal star and was noticed to shift colors, thought to be due to atmospheric distortion; however, it was determined to be otherwise.  It was noticed that the object was strobing or changing from red to blue to white in a random order, but was clearly not a star or a planet.  It was observed through binoculars by myself and several other police officers, which verified the color changes, but no definitive shape of the object could be determined, because of the distance.  I made telephone contact with the tower at Jacksonville International Airport (JIA) and a controller visually confirmed the object west of his position (240 to 270 degrees), but informed me that he had no radar returns in that area, indicating that it was not an aircraft. (The airport was about 8 miles north of my location.)  The controller even joked that it could be a &#34;UFO&#34;.  Because the object remain completely motionless at altitude for an extended period, we ruled out a helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft.  The tower also assisted in ruling out a antenna, tower, or balloon.  After watching the object for several minutes I was distracted by more immediate business and when I return my attention to looking for it, it was gone.  I have not idea in which direction it proceeded.  If needed I can provide more specific directional and angle information.<n>

Warren in the Eastern Sierra.  Prominent light was a red strobe that circled the vehicle at a high rate, with at least two additional white lights on the side of the vehicle.  At ten miles the object was barely covered by one&#39;s thumb, making it quite large, possibly 1000 feet in diameter.  Observed with 10 X 50 binoculars by two friends who called me while I was watching the Fox UFO special that was airing at the same time.  I drove out to a vantage point overlooking the Mono Basin, but the vehicle had disappeared by the time I reached the vantage point, my friends stating that it gradually faded away rather than flying away as an aircraft might do.  It&#39;s interesting to note that this area has had numerous sightings in the past, the most recent being in Dec. 1998 when a lighted object was seen over Mono Lake flying west towards Yosemite National Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observers are long time friends of the reporter.  Their home is situated approximately 10 miles NE of the location of the sighting.  Weather was good, partly cloudy, no moon.  Venus and Jupiter, now situated in the western sky, had already set.  Observers have seen UFOs in the past.  The area where they live is remote, near the Ca-Nv. border.  Sighting is unusual because of the size of the UFO, as described.<n>

Convinced these were helos we rolled down our windows, but heard no sounds other than roar of traffic. I have lived on military installations for about 15 years and never have witness these types of manuevers. myself, husband and my 3 children witness this from our car. even as we approached gulf breeze we could see these 4 lights but they moved so that 2 were over pensacola sound and 2 were over 2 navarre sound so direction they moved was north. again we were almost onvinced that these were helos but after rolling down windows we heard no sound.<n>

It was a small plane and the seat next to me was empty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To begin with I thought it was a cloud but I was puzzled as to the appearance of a strange brownish cloud amid white ones. We got closer and then I noticed it had a shimmerring quality. It was very similar to the traditional shape of a UFO but it was as if the contours were shimmering along with the craft and the edges were shifting almost. There was no one sitting behind me either, the hostesses were at the back and I looked to see if any one else was looking. They were not so I closed the window shutter to test my own eyes. When I re-opened the shutter it was still there. Ithought it must be a UFO and I remembered that I had heard that they should spin. Even at that moment I could discern a very subtle spinning. At one point it reached out an angular arm and folded it gracefully back in. Eventually we flew past. I was amazed and somehow uplifted. It was beautiful and almost spiritual somehow. My mother does not believe me and attributes it to me being on anti-depressants and although I understand her concern I cannot believe that I imagined it just because I am depressed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry, I have given most of the information above. Apart from the moving arm it did nothing but hover. Colour chance happened extremely subtly and moved from brown to silver to a purplish hue. It was sort of a saucer shape but the form too had a shifting quality that was not easily discernible. It was broad daylight in a blue sky scattered with clouds at a similar level, if a little higher, to the plane.<n>

I could see lots of stars. I was smoking a cigarette and my nephew had to go to the bathroom and went in the bushes. While we waited to go home, I saw a rabbit and then looked up and told my nephew to look at the huge bird flying above us. I initially thought it was a bird because there were no lights on the object. The craft resebled a wingspan of a bird, long and thin. I thought it was going roughly 20 miles per hour at an assumed distance of roughly 150 feet up. I continued to watch the object while it flew toward the horizon (southeast with 101 fwy, oceanside). The opbject had what appeared to be stripes on each wing and I waited for wings to flap. There was little to no groung wind. After watching the objectgo into the horizon I was confident still that it was just a bird but still watched. Then it did something amazing, the object split in two parts just before it was near the horizon and each part/wing went off in east and west directions until I couldn&#39;t make it out in the sky. I was in the Air Force for the past 6 years before the incident and have seen many  planes fly in my presence including the B2 and it was definately not a public jet. The object made no sounds, and it was a quiet night. At first I thought it was dumb to report this but then I thought about all the other types of sightings I had seen on TV and thought since mine was different then all of them I should report it. I have made a crude animated gif file of the sighting I have uploaded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We received an illustration from the witness and will attempt to post it in the future.

This object was observed from a tenth story office.  At first a single object appeared.  This object appeared to be a black balloon floating, but rotating. The color remained black and occasionally reflected the sun light.  Suddenly the object decended rapidly.  The object reappeared after a couple of seconds and returned to its original altitude.  Another object appeared, similar size and shape, shortly after and merged, combined (as if liquid form).  The objects separated once and the lower portion decended once again.  The remaining object continued at the same altitude and appeared to change shape frequently as it rotated.  This object then decended for a brief time.  The two objects then reappeared, one above and one below the other, and continued to rise and disapeared straight up.<n>

We had crossed the San Diego County line on westbound Interstate 8 headed toward the Desert Tower that overlooks the mountainous area of the Anza Borrego Desert, or at least I think that this is part of the famous desert.  My girlfriend had fallen asleep, but as I was going around the many rock strewn mountains that cover this area, I witnessed what appeared to be a saucer-shaped object hovering about five to six feet above the ground in one of the canyons there.  It didn&#39;t exactly glow like in many sci fi movies but any light that hit it seemed to brighten its surface, like that material that glows in the dark when you expose it to light.  For about two minutes it just floated there silently.  It was shaped like a cross section of a cylinder, perfectly smooth, no lights, no portals or doors. In other words a smooth sided saucer with no curves. It then rose perfectly verticle into the air then zigzagged around the mountain peaks and finally disappeared into the night sky.  I tried waking my girlfriend but the events were so fascinating that by the time I could wake her the object was gone. I spent the rest of the trip trying to explain away what I saw.<n>

Took out my binoculars(10x50 - 341ft.at 1000 yds.) to look at the sunset and saw silouettes of aircraft coming into DFW Airport -- approximately 10 miles to the southwest. All aircraft have very identifiable fuselage and lights. Suddenly, I spotted a light at about 3 degrees above the horizon between two long cloud banks in the west. It remained stationary for about 5 minutes as silouettes of small craft an large airliners past in front of it. I could not see it with the naked eyes. It slowly began to drift to the north then rose at a 45 degree angle for another 5 minutes. It would drift through the clouds only slightly dimming. There were three distinct thin cloud bands with clear sky in between. It appeared to be a luminous soft light that would suddenly brighten and get larger with a shimmering effect. This would last about 2-3 seconds and then it would get smaller and at times disappear for a second. Most of the time it was smaller and white having a redish or bluish luminescence sweep over it. When it was brighter and larger the colors would be more obvious. It appeared as if it were floating -- wobbling a bit and shifting to the north then back to the south faster than when it rose. After about ten minutes, it had risen to about 4 degrees above horizon. I then spotted another one just like it above it and to the north at about 5 degrees above the horizon. This one appeared to be brighter or closer. I looked back for first light and it had disappeared. The second light was stationary and &#34;luminescing&#34; in the same manner getting brighter and dimmer for 5 minutes and then it began to descend very slowly at at 45 degree angle toward the south. I spotted the second one at about 18:32 and watched it descend to the horizon until 18:49. My guess is that it was probably 15+ miles away which would put it around Argyle or further west? I frequently watch the sunset out at the lake and have seen similar light before in November of 1998. They! are in no way similar to airliner headlights or helicopter lights. I noted both Venus and Jupiter as they appeared (after the lights appeared) and they were not twinkling or glowing with colors due to atmosphere - bright and white. The thin clouds were all to the west -- the rest of the sky was clear.<n>

We were...well, making good time and I had looked at the clock on the dashboard and it read 10:22pm. My partner and I were discussing our trip when he said holy... you know... and I looked out the windshield. Above the cross over an over pass some distance back was a bright light with a light green outer ring. We figured it might have been an aircraft or a light on a tower, till it dropped straight down with out an arc, with increasing speed so fast that it looked like someone had taken a picture at night and moved the camera while the film was being exposed, giving it a solid line of light because it fell that fast. Then it did a 90 degree turn like it was a giant log ride and shot out at the horizon. Disappearing from sight. I looked at the clock on the dash after seeing it and it read 11:38 pm. I don&#39;t completely believe in this stuff, but after seeing that object fall and speed off, I can&#39;t think of anything it could&#39;ve been. Nothing, that I know of short of a TOW missle, can arc in a 90 degree turn at that rate of decent without tearing itself to pieces. A TOW missle would have had a fire trail, instead of a white light with green outer ring. Then there is the matter of losing our time. Abducted, I don&#39;t know and don&#39;t think such a thing can or normally occurs, but we lost almost 45 minutes of time. The driver had been checking the time to gauge the trip back throught the whole trip and to keep from getting tickets. So what was it?? And what happened to the 45 minutes??<n>

This is the email I sent then: About 1:20 am tonight I was working here at my computer which has a whole wall of windows beside it.  We live on San Juan island in Washington BTW.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a very bright light in the sky. I looked over at it and saw it was very bright and looked unusual.  So I grabbed the binoculars I have here for ship watching. In looking through my binoculars I could see a triangular shaped thing in the sky, very bright with one side red lights and the other green.  It seemed to be just hovering motionlessly.  I thought it must be a helicopter but it just never seemed to move.  When I took down the binoculars I could see it was quite high in the sky near the off coast island of Chatham.  I watched it for about five minutes and it didn&#39;t move although sometimes it seemed to change angle or something as the lights got dimmer at times (as though it was being seen side on or something).  It then moved down a bit slowly, then stopped, then moved a bit etc.  The red and green lights were very bright at times and it was sometimes a distinct triangle shape and other times not clearly shaped (it seemed to move so that I was seeing it from different angles).  My husband was asleep so I didn&#39;t wake him up..until suddenly this object started moving *very fast* and very erratically..........just squiggles of light streaking and darting about in a very random way and very fast.  With that I called my husband and he came downstairs.  He came over to the window and I told him what I was still seeing and I said I know of nothing that moved that way and handed him the binoculars.  Unfortunately he was totally mistaken about where to look although I told him where (he wasted 2 or more minutes looking into the water!).  By the time he got that when I said &#34;I think I might be seeing a UFO&#34; it would be best to look at the bright object in the sky as I said, it had stopped moving.  I saw with my naked eye the object was now over the city of Victoria (this was about 1:40 am PST tonight Feb 14).  He looked through his binoculars and said yes it was red and green lights and he thought it was triangle shaped and it wasn&#39;t moving.  He watched it for about 7 minutes and then said it was getting fainter.  I looked through the binoculars and saw that indeed it was getting faint and it seemed to fade away (into the distance?). The lights were *not small blinking lights* as one normally sees on an airplane.  They were a *bank* of lights and did not blink.  The red was on the left and green on the right as I observed it.  My husband confirmed with me that he observed the same thing.  Also he confirmed with me that he watched this *unmoving* object for approximately 10 minutes.  Before I called him downstairs to see it, I watched it for about 15 minutes then as I was hesitant to awake him.  As I said earlier it did not move in that time period until its sudden darting movement which caused me to call my husband. Other than this one burst of sudden movement it always seemed to be stationary until it faded away.  I don&#39;t know of any airplane that moves that way or looks like that.  I have often seen planes in the sky and they did not look this way. As a test a few nights later (the night after I wrote the email) we both trying looking at everything we saw in the sky for over 1 hour both outside and through the windows.  Planes looked nothing like it. Stars looked nothing like it.  Planets (we could see Mars and probably Jupiter early in the evening) did not look like it.  I even tried to duplicate the darting type motion by moving my head as I watch through the binoculars and I had to move my head about a great deal to make the light I was looking at seem to *move*.  I assure you I was not moving my head when I watched the strange light on the 14th nor was I having any tremors in my hands.<n>

The light was seen while motoring west on U.S. highway 78 approximately 2 miles east of Stone Mountain Park, GA. This area is a densely populated suburb of Atlanta, GA. The local temperature was approximately 38 degrees F with clear cloudless skies and a brisk wind from the north. The light was approximately 20-25 degrees above the local horizon, was mostly circular and yellowish at its center fading to orange at its perimeter. It had no noticeable irregularities in shape, had no visible tail or contrail, was approximately 4-6 times the diameter and brightness of the brightest star, and was visible for approximately 15 seconds prior to its sudden and silent explosion. Upon exploding, the object split into two fiery fragments which rapidly descended toward the ground. Smoke was visible around the area of the original object and behind the descending fragments. The smoke appeared dark against the dusk sky and expanded in an irregular inverted triangular pattern. The two fragments descended southward toward a line of trees and disappeared from sight prior to reaching the horizon. This event was observed by one adult female and two adolescent male children. Many other motorist were traveling along the same route and appeared to slow down to observe the event.<n>

At first it looked like a star but as I concentrated on it, it immediately ( like it knew I had spotted it ) shot back directly ( directly opposite my line of vision ) up into the atmosphere at a high rate of speed. When I first noticed it it appeared to be ( best guess ) 2,000 - 3,000 feet altitude ( just hovering silently ) and when it shot back it appeared to leave the earths atmosphere and diguise itself as a star. As I continued to watch it it began to move again in a half circle ( clockwise 3 o&#39;clock to 9 o&#39;clock ) and sped off at a unbelievable speed ( North ) until it had disappeared. Just as it had disappeared another bright light shot in a westerly direction just as fast from the same area. I immediately looked at my watch  and it showed 11:12 pm and I desperately wanted another I witness but as I looked round there was no one else just the silence, no wind just the cold ( approximately -32 C). This sighting bothered my for approximately 5 months afterwards. Please tell me this was a military test ( holographic light from a satellite maybe ? ) If it was it was totally realistic and nervewracking. I have actually found a video mpeg on the internet of another sighting which is pretty much what saw ( dec27.mpeg  a sighting from someone else made on Dec.27, 1997 )<n>

From the east, a C-130 was flying in low toward the west. I commented on this to my friend, and we then noticed a small, flickering light in the general vicinity of the C-130, hovering stationarily. It appeared simillar to a star, or perhaps Venus. However, the time was approxamitly 5:10, much too early for any star to be visible or Venus to be rising. The object would flash very brightly, then dim in a flickering manner, and then seem to disappear. After a few moments, the object reappeared dimly, increasing in brightness, near where it had previously been. While visible, the object did not appear to move. But during its disappearing acts, the object would reappear in a different  but close-by location. During the event, three or four more C-130&#39;s followed on the heels of the first we had originally seen. My friend later informed me that he had seen a Huey about fifteen minutes prior to the sighting event. My friend retrieved a video camera and a set of binoculars. He filmed the object for about four to five minutes. Unfortunatly, due to the distance of the object (perhaps several miles), the focus was unable to lock in, and we have only  30-60 frames of a resolved image. Thru the binoculars, I determined the object to be metallic and spherical, like a ball-bearing reflecting the light of the sun. But a sphere would reflect the sun&#39;s light evenly and consistantly. Go figure. Within two minutes after the last C-130 had flown in low (and pressumably landed at Kirtland AFB very close-by), the object blinked out for the last time and did not reappear.<n>

The object was about the size of a pea from my vantage point and the ending location was South-South-East of highway 61.  The sky was very clear.  I&#39;ve seen falling stars before, and this was no falling star.<n>

At the time, we were in 11th grade.  We were dropping off our friend when the driver noticed this thing in the sky.  It was like a fireball only it was white with hints of blue, which indicate that Magnesium or Aluminum was being burned with possible traces of Copper.  The burning thing was huge and traveled very fast towards the ground.  It was far away, we couldn&#39;t tell how far, but we couldn&#39;t hear it.  The size of it would be the size of a pea held about 18&#34; from the face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it disappear behind the treeline (trees were primarily spruce and birch).

We were flying well above the cloud cover.  It was a glorious, sunny day.  Some distance away, I saw a small dark sphere that seemed to hover above the clouds.  Upon closer inspection, it almost seemed to be bobbing and weaving, maintaining its position relative to the cloud deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed distant, yet it was about the size of a pea as seen through the aircraft window.  It was perfectly round and dark, with a dark reddish-brown cast to it.  It was perfectly outlined against the brilliant white clouds, and did reflect sunlight back from its edges as if it were very reflective but part of it was in shadow. (?) There was only one object, and it remained relatively motionless, just sort of bobbing and weaving.  On several ocassions, the object seemed to drift too much in a vertical or horizontal distance, then it quickly and smoothly returned to its original position. It stayed in full-view for as long as I could see as the airplane progressed.  My seatmate was asleep, this being a flight from Birmingham, UK to Newark, NJ.  So, there was no one else for me to confirm the sighting with.  I don&#39;t know what it was, but it seemed strange.  Do balloons of any kind ascend to that height?  I seem to recall the pilot saying that we were at about 38,000 feet.  And the little inflight video screens noted that we were over the Atlantic Ocean, somewhere near Iceland. I am a marketing professional with no prior sightings of this kind. I was returning from a major trade show in the UK.  I am a 35-year-old male American.<n>

I have no idea why I drove toward it but as I got closer I noticed three white lights which looked to be in a straight line.  It was not moving.  There was no noise--I had my car radio turned off.  As I turned to go down a hill the thing kind of turned also and I noticed that the three lights were actually two in the front and on in the back forming a perfect triagle.  There were no other lights.  I did not notice anything connecting the lights.  The thing moved to from the left side of my car to the right then I watched it in the rear view mirror and lost sight of it.  Only to see it again a few seconds later further off in the distance on my right hand side.<n>

It traveled west to east and disapeared out of my view over the town of Cotati.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object first appeared to be a shooting star but normally when I those they appear high in the sky.  This object appeared to be much closer to the surface of the earth. By this I mean possibly at the same height of a low flying plane.  I did not at first think to do or say anything about it until I saw a news blurb on NBC for a later broadcast that people in the north bay had seen a green &#34;comet like&#34; object in the sky.  This was at 8:00 PM only 30 minutes from the time of the sighting.  I was eextremely tired from my day and missed the late night news.  No reports in the paper this morning.<n>

North on highway 680, to Antioch, CA., I could see Saturn, Jupiter, and Venus all lined up out of my car window to the west. Every few minutes, I would take a quick peek as I was driving. It was finally a very clear night and could not wait to get home to take a look around the night sky with my 4 inch binoculars. As I drove East on Highway 4, at the top of Willow Pass in Pittsburg, CA., at 7:20 PM. My attention was caught by a very bright green light flying next to me. My Corvette is very low, so it appeared to me (after looking at it) that the green fireball was less than a mile away from me to the North, and maybe 1000 feet high. My stereo was on, but I thought I heard a noise more than the wind rushing past my window. I was driving at about 85 mph, in the left lane, in traffic, so I know others saw it. I was able to look at the fireball for only a few seconds at a time, because I was driving. The Green fireball was not as bright as a welders arc, but had about the same sharp clarity with a lite green tint. It appeared kind of egg shaped overall, white in the middle, and a difficult to percieve tail of green flame. It was bright enough to where it was hard for me to see detail. Its size could be compared to a small pager (beeper) held at arms length. When my attention was first drawn to the bright clear green light, it was at the rear of my drivers side window. Because of my speed, I looked for 2-3 seconds, drove, looked 2-3 seconds, drove, looked 2-3 seconds. Because I thought it was right next to me, it appeared to be going about<n>

It was a crystal clear night with no clouds, and excellent visibility of the stars. My intuition told me to turn around as I walked through the parking lot, and there directly over my friends&#39; apartment building was a large, brilliant, orangish gold fireball, seemingly hovering. As I watched, I realized it was moving -- albeit very slowly -- from west to east. It had a trail of what I would describe as &#39;sparks&#39;. It took about 45 seconds to go from over the apartment building to over the parking lot... an incredibly long period of time for something &#39;flying in the sky&#39; to go such a short distance... at which time it was directly overhead and simply vanished. It made no sound. I have seen many many meteors over the years, and am a seasoned star-watcher. I have never, ever seen anything like this and it left me in awe and in wonder. It was extarordinary.<n>

The location was Makokibatan Lodge, an outpost on Makokibatan Lake which is only accessible by float plane. We had our own &#34;cabin attendant,&#34; a very sweet and down-to-earth woman in her 50s, who would knock on our door early every morning with coffee, and remind us that the fish are not going to catch themselves.  We got to know her well by the end of the trip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, my brother and I went outside, and stepped into a wooded area just out of range of the dock light’s glow, and looked up to enjoy the sky. I’ve seen many star-dense skies in zero light pollution areas, but this one, presumably because of our boreal latitude, was breathtaking. The thing that immediately struck us both though, was all the STUFF flying around up there!  I’m versed in the subject of aerospace, and my brother is a high-level electrical engineer that maintains a military security clearance for the work he does with the Department of Naval Intelligence, for which he has worked on satellite projects. We recognized this satellite/space junk mess above our heads for what it was, but it was quite a sight. I&#39;ve never seen so many star-like objects in transit across the sky in my life. The night sky in this place is alive.  At times we would see as many as 4 different satellites in various orbits at once.  My brother pointed out a couple that were in polar orbits, which he said were either military or WX.  We saw a very tight constellation of three evenly spaced satellites forming a triangle traversing the sky in formation, and a blinking star-like object, which my bro informed me was a spin-stabilized satellite of some kind.  I’d be lying though if I said I wasn’t watching all of them very closely for a change in vector or speed, but of course they were what they were.  Quite a show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, our cabin lady came in, and in small talk, we told her what a great sky we enjoyed last night and how we couldn’t believe how much garbage was flying around up there, and she related that the sky is one of the reasons she feels lucky to live up there etc. With last night’s light show still fresh in our minds, to my surprise especially coming from my brother, he followed up with, &#34;So, have you ever seen anything strange?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> She replied in her thick Canadian accent, &#34;Oh yeah, well, me, once.&#34;  Her response was patently nonchalant and innocent.  Surprised, we pressed her for more.  She went on to describe a night a few years previous, off-season, where she was up by the cabins while 3 or 4 &#34;hands&#34; were working at the dock, and they observed a &#34;large&#34; orange sphere, self luminous and about the brightness and color of &#34;one of those orange street lamps,&#34; casting shadow as it approached over the treetops on the opposite side of the lake, hover over the center of the lake at 300-400ft AGL (my estimation based on where she pointed), then descend to touch the surface of the lake. She said it &#34;dipped&#34; slightly into the lake and just sat there. (Note: It&#39;s a very large, choppy lake, so no &#34;ripples&#34; would be visibly cast and were not mentioned, nor did she mention any bobbing in the chop). It stayed there for a number of seconds, then ascended slowly, accelerated, and &#34;shot straight up&#34; and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She spoke in a quiet tone and gave me the impression as if she was almost a little embarrassed to share the story, but again, casual about it. She ended the account by saying dismissively, &#34;I don’t know what it was.&#34; and dispensed a shrug. She did imply during this conversation that many of the employees have their own experiences. As she spoke, i got the impression that her attitude was that in this place with such a conspicuous, immersive, impossible-to-ignore sky that occasionally seeing something &#34;strange&#34; is just kinda bound to happen eventually if you work and live here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In retrospect I wished I had pressed her for a little more detail, but didn’t think it was appropriate at the time. The previous night, while gazing at that crystal clear, star-blanketed dome that betrayed to us every single little chunk of trash parading above us, I couldn’t help but think, &#34;Well, if UFOs are real and one got anywhere near this place, you sure as hell wouldn’t miss it.&#34;  I think the unassuming, down to earth folks that work in this place are probably quite aware of that too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Then I saw it out another window just to the left of original location.  My wife saw it too this time, we both went outside and viewed it directly (it was behind some trees at times) and could notice rotation and also was disappearing and reappearing.  Overall we viewed it for about 20 minutes.  No sound whatsoever.   Maybe no more than 300-500 yeards away. We did not see movement, only disappearing and reappearing in same general location.

I first saw it at the kitchen window of our cabin and  called for my wife, who was on the couch to come to the window, but, it was gone before she could get to the window,  I went to get my coat and go outside to get more firewood when I saw the object.  I then saw it again through another window, it appeared to be left of original location.  I called for my wife again and she watched it, saying oh that&#39;s probably a light from a house, I reminded her that no houses are over where the light was, she then said I am going out and stood at the kitchen window watching it as she put her coat on.  I went outside before her and watched it.  It was spinning and had bright orange fire encircling it, about 1/10 the size of a full moon, it then disappeared so I went back in and said it was gone.  My wife  said &#34;No it&#39;s back&#34; as she was still at kitchen window.  I looked out and saw it then she went out as I went upstairs to get the video camera.  She was at slough (overflow of the Chena River) and viewing it clearly (before it was behind some trees at times) while I was getting the camera, I turned on the camera as a walked out the door,  It disappeared as I walked out.  My wife was white as a sheet and speechless, after all she has viewed the videotape of the  September 24th sighting and now saw what was on the video in real life.<n>

I live just 30 miles south of Huntsville and have seen some strange objects in the sky where I live. Since you listed the pilots reports about some of their strange sightings I would like to share with you what I saw one winter eve. On Feb. 10, 1999 that night at 8:15 p.m. central I was outside enjoying the clear skies and beautiful stars evident in the winter months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching what appeared to be a commercial airliner traverse the skies from south to north towards Huntsville. As the airliner got to approx. 45 degrees above horizon while I was fixed watching it, suddenly a brilliant white &#34;star&#34; like object (round and approx. 4-8 feet in diameter) just appeared out of nowhere above and behind the airliner. It just blinked on and was at a estimated distance of perhaps 5-8 miles in the planes 9:00 position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was motionless (for maybe .2-.3 second) after appearing then it zoomed down to the planes port side to a distance of approx. 1/4 mile away from the planes wing and the same apparent altitude. Once it reached this position it paced along the left side at the same speed as the airliner. I ran inside and got my wife and kids to come and watch as the object remained along side the plane until out of sight. The amazing thing about this incident was the objects speed. I&#39;ve since given thought and some calculations as to the speed the object moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since looking into the vastness of the space makes it difficult to determine exact distances but speculating distances and time the object traveled I surmised the object was at least 5 miles and possible as much as 8 miles away (assuming the airliner was at a typical altitude of between 28,000-32,000 ft. as a reference of distance from object to plane) and took only .3-.4 second to make up the distance that would equate to a velocity of between 45,000 to 96,000 mph. Pretty amazing to watch an object go from zero to 96,000 mph in an instant. The area where I live has in the past been a hot bed of UFO activity. One world known event occurred in Fyffe AL (1991 I think) where a cylindrical object was seen by hundreds of people including friends of mine. The object hovered over pastures where cattle mutilations were found the following day. One of my friends watched one eve coming home from work as it hovered and maneuvered slowly over a wooded area near Blountsville AL and shined a brilliant red beam to the ground. The next day the area was taped off with yellow tape and a crew resembling a bio-hazard team was scouring the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have done some research into older cases that date back to the early forties and before. One was a coworker of my wife that saw a disc shaped object hovering above their farms pasture. Once the man (a boy of 10 at the time) approached the object it instantly disappeared. He described it as metallic brushed aluminum color, 40&#39; in diameter and 10-12 feet thick as a perfect disc shaped and top/bottom equidistant from the center edge. This occurred in 1942. Another incident dating to 1938 where another acquaintance and a buddy was deer hunting in eastern Tennessee and saw a large disc craft between two mountains as he described &#34;down in a deep hollow&#34; move slowly below mountain peeks as if searching for something (wildlife?). I tried to shake him in his conviction to see if he would stick with his story and he told me &#34;so help me God we saw this......and we didn&#39;t tell anybody for a long time.&#34;  I am convinced that our government knows more than they are sharing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for this wonderful report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director Phone 1 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

A co-worker and I noticed what appeared as a jet contrail in the Western Sky of Tucson.  The contrail was heading Sout-Southeast at a great rate of speed.  The sun was setting at this time which added extra light to the high objects contrail.  The craft itself could not be seen.  At first we thought it was a normal jet.  The contrail disappered after about the first 30seconds of viewing, then reappeared with the craft still in the same direction.  Within 1 min of viewing the object made a sudden turn and headed West, leaving a shrp U shape in the sky.  What was strnge about this was the abnormal speed. I have not seen Airliners fly this fast, so our initial thought was a fighter jet of sorts.   When the craft was heading West a small but noitcable puff of smoke or some turbulance affected the contrail leaving a bulge or bubble in its path.  The craft appeard to pick up speed and disappered into the horizon.  Again this might have been a normal airplane of types at supersonic speed.  The sunset though allowed for some spectaculer viewing. I am not a believer in so called &#34;extra terrestrisalas&#34; but I am sending this report as to see if any one else saw the object.  I do wish to stay anonimous<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC:  This report, in several respects, seems to us to not be inconsistent with a contrail pattern that might be left by a military fighter aircraft.))<n>

The camp/station is not far from where the borders of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia meet. My brother wears contact-lenses, which I&#39;m sure he did that night. He used the trees as points of reference, and says Venus is out of the question. I&#39;ll refer you to my brother below.<n>

Then the revolv light got real bright again and then it started moving across the sky. It did not move in a straight line though.My wife saw it the next night. It was still in the same place the next day as it was when it faded away on me. It was just kinda hanging there. It was the wildest thing I have ever seen in my life.You hear about it but you never expect to see something like that.It then went away and we have not seen it since. It acted as if it was getting charged up from the power lines in the woods where I live.<n>

I watched as a craft flew over the residence bound West South West. The craft made no sound and proceded on a straight course at roughly 200 knots. The craft was triangular shaped with a bright circular light at each corner. No other lights were visible and the craft itself was dark (the triangular shape is a guess based on the position of the lights). Another interesting point is that the aircraft pattern to land at YYZ (Pearson International Airport) is ENE so this aircraft was headed against the commercial air traffic (I am an amatuer pilot).<n>

The was a conjunction of planets in the southwestern sky during the month of February 1999, which may provide a possible explanation for the report.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Late in the evening on the 8th I saw 2 objects west slightly south west I saw 2 objects in the sky being chased by 2 jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stated in the other block I saw the objects and wathced them for for about 5 min give or take, pulling my truck off the road. one object was alittle higher and to the left than the other and I thought at first passenger planes, since I&#39;m decent at geography and I really couldn&#39;t tell the altitude and size but they seemed to be right next to McGee Tyson airport in knoxville. Next I saw the jets they seemed to be coming from the same direction actually my direction and  the one on the left was a little more to the left of me like they were split off and were merging on the same point (the objects).This is when I pulled over and started watching them, I could tell that, well at least from my vantage point they seemed to be a lower altitude and were going up. The objects were yellow orange color ,I don&#39;t think this was there true color , because from where I was at they they were high enough that since the sun had just set, that they were still high enough that the sun was still hitting them. I couldn&#39;t really tell , but I don&#39;t think the jets were reflecting any light. I still wasn&#39;t sure if the jets were going after the objects or just moretypical passenger craft until, the object on the right jumped rather quickly higher and way to the left and it was not possible by any jet I&#39;ve ever heard of because the jet on the right veered hard up and to the left and thats when I could finally tell the shape of the craft and 2 tight contrails, the jets were giving off contrails the objects weren&#39;t by the way, and being an aircraft buff, the only thing I could thing of from the contrails they were giving off was that they were fighters, maybe a Leer jet could. but when this ting veered it had to be doing some major G&#39;s so that pretty much ruled out a leer jet. So clearly they were chasing it and gaining ground , but then within about 30seconds time they seemed to take off not really upward(not sure) but, definately away from me and finally out of sight, and the jets continued on in pursuit and it took the about a couple of minutes to get out of sight. The objects were spherical but at the distance I couldn&#39;t be sure because of the glow they were giving off. I also know cause I&#39;m about 45 mile from the knoxville airport , and I can see planes all the time coming and going from there and know what passenger planes look like at that distance, and fighters look like and if I had to guess they of F-15 or F-18 shape, cause when the one veered off i could see more of the top of it.As far as the weather it was pretty clear, well there wasn&#39;t any clouds in the sky where this was happening, and the sky was a typical orangish color like after any sunset. I don&#39;t know how possible it is, but I kinda would like to know if anyone else saw it , cause no one I know saw it, and my daughter who was with me is only 5 and she just kept asking me what I was looking at. I hope you find this useful and hope it might help support someone else if they saw it also. I would like to not give my address and phone for now, feel free to email me and if you seriously would like to talk to me then I would have no problem talking to you or whatever, I just don&#39;t want my address and phone bounced around to God knows who.

Also, he provides no video.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2000 Bonsall, Derbyshire type UFO in Rawalpindi Pakistan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This footage was shot by my parents (Dad) on a trip back home in Rawalpindi, Pakistan back in 1999. I had forgotten about the footage and just recently came across some ufo pictures that were remarkably the same as the one shot by my dad so i thought i should inform someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents had gone back home to Pakistan to visit and my dad would video tape everyday to bring back images of our home and everyday life for us to see and one evening before they were about to leave for shopping, my dad saw a very bright object in the sky. Knowing about my facination with UFO&#39;s he thought it would be something interesting for me to see so he turned on his video camera and started shooting the object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object is very bright and has the same distinct shape as the Bonsall, Derbyshire - 2000 ufo http://www.freewebs.com/nurmufo/bonsall.html. The interesting thing that i noticed on the footage my dad shot is that on close observation, one can see an object or two leave the bright orb and later come back into it. Also the ufo changes its colour from white to blueish and then electric red and you can hear my dad say on camera that the object is increasing in size and then contracting back to its original form which gives the illusion of camera zooming in and out, when it is not. The footage has many reference points, but is not more then 2 or 3 minutes as my mom forced my dad to get in the car cause she was getting late for shopping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad informed me that the object was there for quite some time before he started shooting it and also after he stopped. The footage was shot in a housing complex and i belive many people would have seen it but UFO&#39;s are not common place in Pakistani culture and usually ignored or dismissed as stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please get back to me if you would be interested in the footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cheers<n>

When first viewed we had the impression that the object resembled the spot of light formed by a search-light when shone on clouds, however there were no clouds of any type in the sky at that time and no light beam was visable from any direction, including none from the jet aircraft. This was the only aircraft that flew over this area at a low altitude during the 5 days we were at this location. I asked my son, who has many hours of flight time from his 5 1/2 yrs. as a Black Hawk helicopter crew chief with the U.S. Army&#39;s 160th Special Ops, if he knew of any natural cause for what we saw, his answer was &#34;no&#34;. If you are not familar with the Quartzsite area let me say that it is BLM land and is a favorite area for &#34;snow birds&#34;, and at the date of our sighting there were perhaps 25,000 to 40,000 persons in the area, have you any reports from there at this time and date?<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I described above the object was white in color and somewhat egg-shaped, the smaller end to the rear, it traveled in a straight line, it came from the north-west and disappeared, together with the jet aircraft, to the south-east. Due to the low altitude of both the object and aircraft they were out of view in about 90 seconds. The object appeared to be about 1/2 the size of the aircraft. The witnesses, 7 in number, are all senior citizens of good character, all known to me, as we are retirees from the same company.<n>

We went to get it, and noticed an unusually bright light.  We looked up and saw a strange, round yet triangle looking craft.  It moved low and fast, seeming to follow our street.  We decided to follow it though it was late.  We jogged half way down my street after it, then suddenly it stopped, hovered, and then blazed straight upwards into the sky and faded into the stars.  When we returned home and sneaked back into my window, I saw a few faint stars that seemed to move then disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was having a sleep over with two of my friends to discuss the facts about a new club we wanted to make concerning that of, ironically enough for that night, UFO&#39;s.  We had all had our own experience in seeing such strange things and we highly believed in it.  The only thing is, all of us have one belief.  If they land, it will most likely be not to make peace and exchange happy little gifts to us, but to take earth.  But who&#39;s to say what?  We have many beliefs, one that might make this bringing together make a little more sense is that we believe that if we evolved to look like this, what&#39;s to say that aliens don&#39;t look like us and walk among us.  And if they were to try to take Earth, we all agreed, it would be through the back door.  Well, we were talking about other matters as I sat up on my windowsill.  my room faces the street so I can see the clear acre of land across the street.  My two friends were talking when I noticed a small light shine off of something across the street.  I had lost my necklace near there earlier that night when we had gone out on a walk.  I jumped out of my window (we live in a one story house) and walked across the street.  It was near midnight, I remember that much, and no one, almost no one, is awake at that time.  I picked up the small necklace and one of my friends brought up the obvious, how could it have glinted if we don&#39;t have streetlights?  None of the patio lights are bright enough to cast that much light to make this small object shine.  Call it hunch.  The moon was bright, but there was an iridescent light that seemed to shine besides that.  We didn&#39;t notice that till a little later, but at the same time, we all felt the hairs on the back of our neck stand on end.  We all looked up at the same time and saw it.  it was a triangular object, too big to be an airplane and not shaped like it at all.  It was a triangular shape, with no wings.  It was round though, no sharp edges.  It didn&#39;t have blinking lights, it just glowed.  the light was yellowish.  I mysel! f notice d what could have been a small, red light in the center but I didn&#39;t tell my friends. &#34;That&#39;s not a plane.&#34; 1 of my friends and I both said at the same time. &#34;Let&#39;s follow it.&#34; The other said.  We all agreed and began to jog after it.  we all realized it moved too slow to be an airplane.  We ended up walking, rather slowly mind you, just to follow it.  It seemed to follow the same path as our street, which confused all of us.  I think I was the only one who could really tear my gaze from the object to look over at my other friend with long hair.  Her hair stood up almost on end.  I looked back up at the object.  It was moving a little faster.  We jogged after it, then it stopped.  So did we.  It hovered there for a few seconds, then flew upwards fast and faded into the stars.  we realized we were halfway to the end of our street standing in the middle of desert.  we jogged back to my place and I prayed my Dad hadn&#39;t woken up at the sudden silence.  Luckily, I didn&#39;t hear my name being called.  As my first friend began to climb back into the window, I felt a weird feeling wash through me again.  I looked up.  Nothing out of the ordinary, but still... I stared up into the sky and saw a faint star off in the distance.  It had more stars around it like it was a galaxy, but the stars around the first seemed to move rather quickly.  I tugged on my friend&amp;#8217;s arm. &amp;#8220;Toto,&amp;#8221; I said, &amp;#8220;We ain&amp;#8217;t in Kansas anymore.&amp;#8221;  She looked at me weird and then I pointed up to the stars.  She strained her eyes then saw them.  My other friend did the same. &amp;#8220;Now all we need is the Leprechauns,&amp;#8221; One of them said.  I smiled and watched till they disappeared then we climbed back into my window. &amp;#8220;Well, this turned out to be a pretty awesome meeting.  Now all we need is some &amp;#8216;Take me with you&amp;#8217; signs, and we&amp;#8217;re all set up.&amp;#8221; I said. (On the bottom, I have checked that I would like to be contacted.  I&#39;m not to sure though.  My parents still don&#39;t know about that night. i would like to be called though.  I am young, I was in teh 6th grade when this happened and I&#39;m in 7th now, but I can swear to you that this happened, and my friends will back me up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This is a very nice, very convincing report.  We would note, however, that the writing style of the witness is extraordinarily well-developed for a 7th grade student.  We commend the young lady on her writing ability.))<n>

Slow movement forming various formations. Changed color all at once &amp; disappeared all at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four of us were leaving a restaurant after dinner when we noticed four bright, yellowish-colored lights, much brighter than the surrounding stars, appeared just east of Glassford Hill. We watched them for a couple of minutes before the restaurant help noticed us pointing at the sky and came out to see what was going on. There were between 9 to 10 of us viewing these lights. We were at the south end of Glassford Hill and the objects appeared to be about a mile from us between 1000-3000&#39; high - it was hard to judge. An airplane on the way to Prescott Airport flew just west of and below the objects and they appeared to be much higher than the plane. There was no sound and no apparent movement at first. They appeared as if they were hugh, yellow stars. Then they started moving somewhat like a helicopter would move. Their formation at first consisted of three objects forming a triangle and a 4th off to the side (see Diagram 1). Then the 4th object moved to the bottom and off to one side (see Diagram 2). The remaining three objects then formed a vertical, perfectly straight line (see Diagram 3), moving very slowly. The 4th object remained in its position the whole time. All at once they changed color from yellowish to a dull orange all at the same time. One of the three objects then moved up towards the middle object and almost touched it &amp; remained there for a few seconds before resuming its original position (see Diagram 4). The three objects then formed a straight line again and once more one of the three come up to meet another, almost touching again. We have never seen anthing come that close together without a collision. Finally, all four of them made a horizontal, perfectly straight line and then disappeared all at once (see Diagram 5). We could not detect any shape to the objects or lights on them. They appeared, as stated before, to just be hugh, bright, yellow stars, except that they moved &amp; made various formations. Two of the observers own a business in Prescott Valley. Another observer is employed by them as a salesman and is a former police officer from Phoenix. The fourth observer is a department manager of a local store. We do not know the backgrounds of the restaurant personnel. We will be sending a copy of an official map indicating our position at the time of the sighting.<n>
2/4/99 21:30|Sonoma County (Coast of)|CA|Circle|1hour?|Craft flying at the beach!?|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15852.html|150|ndxe199902| Craft flying at the beach!?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Davenport and crew of the UFO Reporting Center. I wanted to relay a story that happened to me in early 1999, February 4th, on or around. A girlfriend and I took a trip to the coast from where we live in Santa Rosa, CA. We headed out to the Goat Rock / Shell Beach area. The coast is only 30 minutes from where we live, and it was around 6 or 7pm because the sun was still in the sky. We had gone out to catch a sunset. It was around 9pm or so that the coast was a little too cold and windy to be at, so we headed up the cliff to the car, to get warm and watch the sky for awhile, because you can see lots of stars at night on the coast here. Anyway, she pointed out that Venus was over my shoulder which would have been south. We were facing the ocean, and I was in the driver seat. I looked north to over her shoulder, and pointed out that Mars was out too and we looked at the big bright reddish light that we thought was Mars. Then Mars kinda.. started to move towards us. We watched in astonishment as it really began to move towards us, neither of us knowing what to do right away. It got to about 400 feet above our heads, and began to circle us. We could see the craft much more clearly now. The craft seemed circular if viewing it from underneath, with 4 yellowish white lights in the center like thrusters? And red and blue lights; two blues on the north and south points and two reds on the east / west points. I could faintly see some light coming from what would be the top too, but it was non-descript. Either way, not FAA standard. We watched in terror as the sky dark and somewhat cloudy now came alive with lights that were moving in unusual patterns across the sky in front of us and all around us. We could see the stars through the patches of clouds, but we could also see many white lights moving around and chameleoning themselves among the clouds and the blackness of the sky and the stars beyond. It was so odd to us that any aircraft would be out at the beach at all in the first place, much less flying in awkward patterns at night at the beach. These lights were flying over the water too. All of the lights except two showed themselves to us and the ones that did were the &#34;Mars&#34; craft - picture rendition enclosed - and one that flew from south to north from a LONG LONG way away very slowly making no noise coming all the while towards us. When it got close I could see it was a dark triangular craft. It horrified me to see this, because I had listened to Art Bell&#39;s experience seeing it, and others on the radio. This thing moved like a helicopter would. Like ONLY a helicopter COULD in my experience of seeing them move. Only it was fast. And agile. It - picture rendition enclosed - flew around our car the only one out there in the parking lot of the beach for about 20 minutes with the other craft, the circular one. I could hardly see the actual triangle craft&#39;s main hull or whatever it was really stealthy and dark amongst the dark sky, but I could almost always see the thrusters behind it. They reminded me of a Star Wars ship, the Empire&#39;s Star Destroyers. You know how they have three big thrusters in a triangular formation on the rear? Like that. One odd side note, we did appear to have lost about 3 to 4 hours of time as I know it was only about 9:30pm when this started and when all the lights in the sky ceased moving about in the sky  and it appeared to us to be only about 1hour in total that they did  it was almost 2:45 in the morning. Take it as you will, I have no explanation. Any earthly craft that could move like that would have to have made a lot noise, even over the pounding surf. No to mention the weirdness of them all flying around at the beach at night. Thanks!<n>

I was looking out my driver side window,which would be looking north west. I saw 3 craft with a steady red light on the left and a steady white  light on the right . I thought this was strange due to the fact that faa regulations require a strobe on all aircraft. I estimate the craft were around 300 ft and moving around 40-50 mph.as the craft went over head I pulled to the side of the road. It was a large moon and as myself and the passenger looked up we observed the triangle shaped craft fly to the north east. these craft made no sound .at that time I observed a small prop plane following these craft at a safe distance.I ((Name deleted)) saw the above craft and swear that the above statement is true and correct.2-12-99<n>

It had distinct lines, there was as I said, no twinkle and the light did not appear to be relected from any other source. The speed and manner in which it moved was astonishing. I have never seen an unidentified flying object before this, but it was definately under some control. The skies were clear, and there was no sound associated with the object.<n>

After all this time I have tried to forget.  As of two years ago (including tonight) I see at least two/three bobbing bright lights that I know are related to what I saw as a child. My husband and I last saw them July 1998 until tonight.  They gradually disappear out of view as if they just vanish in an instant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 7 p.m. I was walking from the frontroom into the kitchen area.  I noticed through the window (facing the West) a very bright light that I have continuously seen all through my life.  I didn&#39;t want to scare my children so I had my husband look into the night sky. There were two of them off into the West sky, one close to the other. They were turning around and around and the lights of the two were a bright white and then green sparkle shimmer.  They were constantly bobbing around which I assume is because of communication. We watched for a while and after about an hour they started to phase out of sight and eventually were gone. They always appear in that area and have since I&#39;ve been a child. My one child claimed to me that in the middle of the night he was awoken by bright lights by his window. I don&#39;t want him to be scared like what I have been all these years, so I told him it was just probably car lights coming off the road. This is something I&#39;ve held onto for many years now and I know it&#39;s not aircraft...it&#39;s UFO&#39;s.<n>

I managed to get a video camera on it for a couple of minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was on a nice sunny day around lunch time. I was sitting with my girlfriend in her back lawn.  A shinny/glimmering/metalic object caught my eye in the sky above me.  I showed my girlfriend and we both were mystified as to what it was.  It seemed to be appearing on and off like a beacon, visible one moment, gone the next.  It seemed to also be appearing close to us at one instant, and very far away the next.  The object seemed to stay close to the clouds.  I ran into my girlfriends house and grabbed her mothers video camera, and told here family that there was a strange object in the sky.  They also came outside and agreed it was odd.  I managed to record about 2-3 minutes of footage before the object dissapeared.  Recording quality was poor as it was a fairly old video camera, but the object is still highly visible.  I am a 20 year old male, studying Marine Sciences at Hamilton University. My girlfriend is 18 years old and works fulltime.  Her perants who also witnessed the object are 48-50 years.<n>

Shooting stars/metiors tend to &#39;burn out in about 1 second. This fireball lasted a lot longer and  never did &#39;burn out&#39;. It was huge (about half the diameter of the moon). It was in the north.westernn sky. It had a trajectory of due north. It appearded to be decending until it finally switched off. (it did ndeminh in intesisty) It just went out like a candle. It was Green in color but the perimeter was red/orange.  It did not change directions or make any manuvers to indicate a controllable aircraft.  I could not acertain altitude. However It was not a natually occuring item/event. I will include my personal info. However, I make my living in the technical community and do not wish for you to publish my name or personal info. fcontact you i<n>

Logged in as what though? I don&#39;t know!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Same as above(q.v.)<n>

Ones light was solid and others was flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving around the parking lot of The community college here when I saw 2 lights in the distance to the NW.  Being in close proximity to a military installation (Ft.Huachuca) that seems to be constantly practicing night aerial maneuvers, I thought this was merely two planes or helicopters flying in formation, one a little bit in front of the other.  However, as I continued to watch, the craft in the rear seemed to be getting closer to the lead craft (the one whose light wasn&#39;t flashing). At this point I parked my car and watched because I had never seen maneuvers like this before. It was as if one was chasing the other. The flashing (not really flashing like a strobe but rather like turning a very bright light off and on slowly and seeing the bulb fade as it cools)craft continued to get closer to the other one until the lights almost seemed as one. Then the flashing light was gone and only the constantly lit craft could be seen. While this was happening the 2 lights were traveling in a counter-clockwise direction from northwest to west and ended up directly over the Fort here. I still thought at this time that I was looking at 2 planes or helicopters and one just blacked out all its lights--they seem to do that a lot around here. When the light that was still visible got directly over the fort it ended its circular direction of travel and headed due-east torwards where I was parked.  It was not traveling very fast and I could still only see the one solid light.  As it got closer I again saw the flashing/pulsing light along with several more. I was amazed at the absence of sound as it approached. From the silence and the odd light clusters I could now see I thought perhaps this was one of the unmanned aerial vehicles they test here or maybe a balloon/blimp of some sort.  It wasn&#39;t. It was not flying very high and (luckily) passed directly over me and the entire campus here(there were several people in the parking lot and milling around the campus but I don&#39;t know if anyone else was paying attention).  As it passed I was amazed at its size and the silence (a faint rumbling/humming almost like a jet very very far away could be heard). I could not make out a shape because it was dark but, I could clearly see an unusually high amount of lights on its underbelly. Their were several small almost incandescent-like amberish lights clustered about what I&#39;ll call the nose section. The mid section only had a few lights grouped in pairs of two close to the nose, and then the rest of the mid- section was dark and very long. Towards the back, or tail-end, was the flashing light I saw earlier with a few other non-flashing lights.  Looking at the arrangement of all these lights reminded me of a stingray-like fish with a large head/body, and a long skinny tail with a point but I can&#39;t really say what shape it was only what the light configuration reminded me of. What I originally thought was one plane chasing or just gaining on the other was really the lights on the front of this thing and the flashing light on its tail. As it turned it created the illusion of one going faster and closing the gap on the other. After seeing this I still wasn&#39;t sure that it just wasn&#39;t a military excursion umtil about 5 minutes after it passed over me. It was at this time that I saw several small planes and/or helicopters flying at very low altitudes over the Fort. They seemed to be spaced out pretty far and just circling small areas as if they were looking for something or waiting for something. One large commercial-like jet could also be seen but it wasn&#39;t circling, it and two helicopters headed in the same direction as the craft did and all three passed directly over me as well as if they were following but not necessarily chasing whatever I had originally seen. These planes and helicopters around and directly over the Fort for at least an hour.<n>

It was heading down,right to left at a 45 degree angle until it went behind a mountain (Utah Hill).  It caught my attention just before it went out of sight.  I would have thought it was just a falling star but it was already light as the sun was coming up. Traffic was heavy, so I&#39;d be surprised if nobody else saw it. I&#39;m hoping to get other eye witness accounts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was a bright green light that was travelling at an unearthly speed. Unfortunately, I was driving and it only caught my attention just before it went out of sight. It was heading downward, right to left at a 45 degree angle. The only characteristics that were different from a falling star were the color (bright green) and the time of day (sun up). Just last year, many citizens from St.George reported strange lights and contrails in the same location and direction of what I sighted today.  Those turned out to be missiles that were being tested over a test range which is near that same location. I&#39;m trying to seek a logical explanation for what I saw. I&#39;m not sure who to contact.<n>

I was noticeing how beautiful the sunrise was, as it was just getting light over the horizen in front of me.  Then I saw a very bright green ball shaped object fall from the sky, disappearing over the horizen.  This seemed to occur just as the sun was coming up. The sky was just beginning to lighten up pink in color and I could also see the horizen of mountains, however the sky was still dark behind me.  There were a few clouds above me, but none where I saw this object.  This object was a very bright florescent green.  I&#39;m not sure how far away it was, but the mountains it fell behind are at least 60 or 70 miles away.  It was about twice the size of the &#34;lit&#34; part of a streetlight. It didn&#39;t appear to have a tail.

It lasted only about 30 seconds.  It was strange because it was flying very low to the horizon, just above the ground fog.  I thought of a missile launch from Vandenberg AFB, but the object was travelling SSE and most launches from VAFB travel WSW toward the Marshall Islands.  I mentioned this when I got to work, but no one else appeared to have seen it until someone spoke up during our staff meeting.  He was traveling East on Hwy 46 and the object appeared toward the south, out his right window, also travelling in a SSE direction.  He checked the time at 06:43.<n>

At first I thought it was a helicopter but the light then got much more intense with a reddish glow around it.  It then seemed to move backwards away from me extremely fast and then completely vanished.  I knew it could not be a helicopter because you don&#39;t see the helicopter headlight if it is moving away from you, and it moved way too fast.<n>

It was about 1/3 the size of a full moon, and about as bright.  It reminded me of a roman candle in reverse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a small business owner and was up late doing bookwork in front of my french doors when I saw this.

We got back in the car and followed it for about 10 miles before it took off very quikley until it was out of sight. We did not report it because we thought we were crazy or people would think that. till tonight when I picked up a book in a store and saw a picture of what we had witnessed and realized there was an actual name and other reports of what we had seen. right after we had seen the object we returned home were I told my sister and bestfriend about it.

It was enormous with twin rotars. When its motors started the whole neighborhood came out to watch it,the runway being vivible from our street. It wasn&#39;t untill a few days later that I made the connection with the strange light Id seen the night before. The light dropped down below the clouds then quickly zipped off at an angle back into the clouds at an incredible speed. My theory is that it was being tracked on radar and this was some sort of evasive manuver. That is why the heliocopter was searching for it, they may have thought it crashed and were searching for wreckage<n>

To be honest my memory of this event is sketchy but I can tell you what I remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was either 1999 or 2000 within the first few months of the year.  I think it was February.  I was an undergraduate physics &amp; astronomy student with Central Michigan University and I was with a group of two other students and our instructor.  We were taking advantage of some time with the NURO telescope on Anderson Mesa near Flagstaff, AZ.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night we left our control room to go outside and look at the stars.  I don’t remember what time it was unfortunately.  As we were standing there after a few minutes we noticed a “V” pattern of lights  flying in a counter-clockwise circular path that took it overhead, then to the north(toward Flagstaff),  toward the west at its other extent, south and then back up overhead.   This triangle was being trailed by a red light (not blinking) that was a good distance behind.  Too far behind to be attached to the tail of an airplane.  This red light was noticeable when we first took note of the formation but after 2 to 3 minutes it vanished while the formation was due west of us.  The triangular pattern continued its circle.  I do not recall the color of the V pattern lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If memory serves me correctly I counted twenty lights, ten to each leg of the “V”.  I ran in and grabbed a pair of binoculars and upon viewing the lights while it was directly overhead  I  saw the silhouette of an airplane with wings swept back at an approximately 45 degree angle and the lights were on the leading edges of the wings.  The silhouette looked strange to me.  The wings were attached to the fuselage about 1/3 of the way forward from the tail with the “nose” making up the other 2/3 of the length.  While some of the details are foggy in my memory, I remember these proportions as they seemed quite atypical of any plane I’d seen.  The body was slender and the wings were slender and relatively long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t remember what ultimately became of this plane.  As to whether it flew off or the lights went out I don’t recall.  Now at the time I was unfamiliar with the “Phoenix Lights” but was familiar with UFO sightings of triangular / V shaped light configurations.  My opinion at the time and even now was that this plane and its trailing light were, for whatever reason, deliberately trying to appear as such a configuration.  Hearing of the Phoenix Lights makes it seem even more plausible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now it could have been an aircraft in a holding pattern around the Flagstaff airport which is south of town and was to our west.  This is a possibility, however it still seems strange that it would have so many leading lights, would have a red light trailing quite far behind, and in the middle of the night would have to continually circle a small regional airport which according to my professor no longer received any commercial flights and has sparse traffic even in the daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
