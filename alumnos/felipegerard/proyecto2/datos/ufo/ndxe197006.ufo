We ran outside to see what was going on and saw a saucer slowly and silently passing over our horses and then our barn.  It had alternately colored lights, blue and green I think, flashing (or pulsing?) around it. After it left the horses calmed right down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of three seemingly credible reports of overt sightings of a UFO by the same witness.

We saw what we thought was a plane dropping straight down from the sky.  Thinking it had to be a plane crash we drove directly to where I thought it had to have crashed.  About a one mile drive to the other side of town on the other side of the little league ball field.  It fell like a rock but had a shiny trail as it fell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We found it right off.  Right where we thought it crashed but there wasn&#39;t any smoke or signs of a plane crash at all.  We set in the car and looked at it for maybe 15 minutes as I tried to talk my wife into walking over to the craft that was just setting in the meadow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was frightened and wouldn&#39;t even allow me to leave the car so after a while I wanted to see what was on the other side so I drove to the other side of the field and drove down the traitor lane in the woods thinking the trees would hide our approach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we got into position the craft could no longer be seen.  It just disappeared.  We were confused and frightened and apparently having lost all track of time it was now dark.  So dark I had trouble coming back out of there.  The craft was as big as a car but twice as tall with a dome top.  It just set there with at least one light source blinking.  It had not crashed at all.  It had landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see no damage.  It was like a dirty cad finish.  Not real shiny.  It made no noise that either of us could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we set there watching this thing we questioned one another about what the other was seeing.  Do you see it?  What do you see?  It dropped from the sky with a shiny trail but we didn&#39;t ever see any smoke at any time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We wee looking northward at the craft as the sun was setting in the west so I assume the sun was reflecting off the trail of what ever it might have been that was causing the trail to begin with. Finally it was pitch black along the mou! ntain and all we wanted to do was get home ASAP.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From beginning to end the whole thing lasted about an hour and a half and it took another 15 min. to get to her home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years we somethings told family but they usually just laughed and we would laugh with them.  I don&#39;t care what it was but my son told me I should report this incident to the UFO trackers so you can put a pin on the map for our zip code.  I don&#39;t think anyone else saw it because no one else looked up at the meadow.  That&#39;s enough about that.  Just put a pin in the map for the incident that occurred some 42 years ago in a meadow in south central Penna. where two young folk saw a plane crash that wasn&#39;t a plane or a crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s enough!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have a nice life!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((two names deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I really had my doubts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked where he was pointing in the sky sure enough, I saw it myself.  This was in broad daylight.  It was just above the clouds over the Mid-Hudson-Bridge in the southwest sky.  I would say about the same height as the cumulus clouds.  It stood still for abound 1 to 2 minutes, then suddenly flipped on its side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was visible as heck.  The Sun shown a reflection off the craft and it was unmistakable.  It seemed to have a small dome on top.  Then it flipped parallel again to the horizon.  Stood there for quite a few seconds, then suddenly took off, faster than the human eye could trace.  It was metallic and shiny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no doubt in our minds even today of what we witnessed.  To this day I know we witnessed something beyond this Earth.  I just wish I did not wait so long to report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both seen it in broad daylight, and I assure everyone, this was real and not of this Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

We went down and around 9 pm, approximately 8 glowing orange orbs passed overhead in a loose v formation.  They were soft orange in color, appeared spherical, and made no sound.  Their diameters were somewhat smaller than the full moon.  As they passed over us, the formation shifted slightly and one of them stopped overhead and hovered while the others went on.  We pointed a flashlight up toward it and flashed it on and off a few times.  It dimmed and brightened somewhat in what appeared to be a response. At this point we all freaked and got into the house.  The objects appeared nearly every night for about two weeks, and I have never seen anything like that since. My uncle, aunt, two cousins, my mom, stepdad, and I all witnessed this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate it, but the date of the incident may be approximate.

It occurred while my friend and I were traveling from our school in North Dakota to California where he was to be married.  To the best of our recollection, on or about June 20th, 1970, we were passing through Wyomming driving through to Colorado late at night in his Volkswaggen Beetle.  To the best of our estimates, we were proceding south on I-87 about 100 miles north of Cheyenne.  It was very dark and there was little or not traffic on the road and no houses, buildings etc as we drove, very desolate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was my shift driving and I noticed a lighted craft immediately in front keeping pace with the car and passing from my right to the left.  It caught my attention because it appeared to be traveling with the car.  Approximately 10 minutes after that I again noticed what appeared to be a similar lighted craft again passing from left to right the same distance from the car at the same hightg and again appearing to keep pace with the car.  My friend was sleeping at this time and I did not wake him until about 10 minutes later when I again saw what appeared to be the identical lighted craft in the same position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my friend what I had been observing and that I thought that this craft appeared to be following the car.  We decided to stop the car and got out to better observe.  The craft then passed directly above us and hovered maybe 500 feet above us.  We heard no noise whatsoever. It was a very clear night with no clouds etc.  As we watched the craft turned out its lights and we then became quite scared feeling that it was watching us and might mean us some harm.  We jumped into the car and started down the road and at that point the entire car lit up.  That was the end of the event as we remember it and did not see the craft again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have thought about this incident many times and after hearing of similar stories have wondered if there was any connection to some unusual objects that have worked there was from my body including a ¼ inch piece of crystal that came out of my right index finger many years ago.  About three years later an identical piece of crystal came out of my gum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Somewhere between 11 and 11:30pm I wanted to leave and began walking to try and find my way out of the canyon and back to Malibu Canyon Rd and the Ventura fwy.  As I was walking I suddenly felt something wasnt right.  There were alot of bushes and over growth on the side if the road and my attention was drawn to a small area that had very large bushes and I kept watching them as I walked past them because something didnt feel right, I get about 10-15ft past them, turn around, look back, turn back again to start walking and my next memory is Im standing on Topanga Canyon Blvd about a block from Ventura Blvd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Things seem foggy and Im thinking Im looking at a signal light, red, yellow and green lights but there has never been a signal light there where I stood.

While sitting in the boat fishing and looking out at our surrounding, all of a sudden coming up above the tree line, parallel to us was a silver hammered disc shaped object, no sound, moving very slowly towards us, about a 1/2 mile away ,heading north to Canada.  All three of us stood up in the boat looking at this object and then we saw four “Airsac” jets (being out of Duluth, Minnesota air force base) were roaring towards us, breaking the sound bearer, which was above our heads and in pursuit of this object.  Object went straight up into the air and we watched the jets take off after it.  It must have been about 7 to 8 minutes chasing it into Canada.  After perusing it a short time later the same jets flew back over our boat again.  About 1,000 feet above us, going slow and we could see the pilots, giving us thumbs up and w! e gave them thumbs up too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes, I do believe we are not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

We left in the early evening and by the time we reached the R.I. border it was dark. I happened to see a moving red sphere in the sky and mentioned it to my wife, the sphere seemed quite high and was about the size of one&#39;s small fingernail. We watched it on and off until it was out of sight. We talked about it a bit until we reached our destination. On our way home later that evening, there it was again, we were on a dark stretch of road with trees on both sides and I told my wife I had to stop and see if I could get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of the car and was searching for the sphere, all of a sudden an enormous object appeared directly over my head, it made no sound and seemed to be not too high over the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My guess is that the craft was about 100 feet or so in diameter, it cast a bright red glow which covered the entire area we were in, as I looked up under this thing I could see three spoke-like features, they looked like they might be a silver tone with a red glow reflecting off them, the rest of the underside was very dark with a reddish look. I later thought that the under side of this thing reminded me of an Automobile steering wheel with the spokes angled either upward or downward, witch way I couldn&#39;t determine; but it was fascinating. My wife began to yell at me to get in the car, that broke my fascination and I jumped in the car which was still running and sped away, as I looked in the rear view I could see the red glow and all of a sudden the thing just flicked away. Except for a few friends, I never reported what we saw. At the time people who reported such things were considered loony, so why bother, nobody would believe us anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am always looking to see if anyone else has ever seen an object like that one, but haven&#39;t heard of anyone yet. Has anyone ever reported such an object to you people? Any input from you would be great.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The picture windows faced out towards Lake Michigan &amp; Navy Pier.  All of a sudden, their dog (small poodle), scrambled and jumped up on the ledge seat of one of the picture windows and started barking furiously.  When I ran into the room to see what was going on, I saw a very bright white flat circular disk @15ft in diameter, descending perpendicular to the ground, moving slowly down the outside wall of the hi-rise, about 10ft away from the building and window. I was stunned as I watched this object and the dog continued barking as it went directly by the window. I was absolutely amazed and in awe watching this thing. The air seemed electrified and humming, but no obvious sound emanated from this light disc.  I visually followed it as it slowly descended down the building and watched it hover out over the Lake, go around the building an! d out of sight.  I immediately ran (took the elevator) down to the lobby to see if I could still see it out over the lake, but by the time I got out to the street, it was gone. I asked the doorman if he&#39;d seen the &#34;light&#34;, but he had not.    I will never forget this experience and I have spoken of it to family and friends ever since...some believe me, but most dismiss it and laugh.  Bottom Line: I KNOW WHAT I SAW!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At the end, they kind of went into the largest light. (mother ship?)This lasted for a long time. And neighbors came up to my mothers house to look at it.

It was a silver disk. I remember pulling on my father’s pants asking him what it was. He and all the other adults were freaking out. He said he did not know. It hovered for about 3 mins, then shot off like a rocket and was gone. It took me 30 years to get my father to admit he saw something and acknowledge it really happened.

I recorded something off  AM radio in 1970, when I was 10 years old.  Unfortunately it was on cassette tape and the thing broke years ago, (it&#39;s gone/lost).  It went on for about a half hour before I couldn&#39;t stand listening any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next time I turned on the radio a normal sounding, (Chicago?), symphonic station was playing.  I haven&#39;t heard anything like it before, or since that time. It was very scary, repetitive, yet always different. I think it must have been some form of music.  There was some kind of pig creature talking/or perhaps singing.  It made a guttural sound that no human could possibly make, (it sounded like it had a massive chest cavity).<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the background was a constant overwhelming clanging, coupled with a buzzing that seemed to fade in and out.  Occasionally I could pick out what sounded like human screams in the background.  Like someone in excruciating pain, or someone suddenly facing some dreadful unavoidable consequence.  There was tons of ambiance.  Ambiance everywhere, in the pig man&#39;s voice, the buzzing and clanging, even in the screams buried far off in the background somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know the AM band can skip, but I have to believe this was something different.  It was either a very strange broadcast for 1970 and the radio station it was found on; or was it something beyond this world?   I am sorry I do not know what frequency it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad changed the station to listen to the WGN grain prices.

The object was a saucer shaped object with lights surrounding it (amber and green), with no sound at all. The window was open and it was a very still night. It moved directly over our house, was bigger than 2 houses put together and was very low in the sky. I ran out of the back door and stood on the steps and watched it moving directly toward the FAA on Kennedy Blvd. It was the slowest moving airborne object I have ever seen. I went back inside to call the FAA to notify them, dropped the phone and awakened my Father who would not go outside to see if he could see it. He sent me to bed...

We lived approximately 21 miles west of the town of Geneseo, IL.  Our closest neighbor lived just across the road and down about ¼ mile and our house was almost completely surrounded by woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night in the summer, I became aware that I was not in bed in the basement of the house where I and my siblings slept but rather I was sitting on a bench in a “room” with one adult male who was about in his mid 20&#39;s.  The room was constructed of metal as were the benches, there was one door  in the compartment and on either side of the door were “windows” from which I could see a passageway going to the left and right and had a slightly slanted inward wall turning into the ceiling of the passageway.  The other person in the compartment with me sat on the bench to the left side of the door and completely ignored me even when I shook him and tried to get him to look at me, he just sat on the bench with his elbows on his knees gazing downward between his legs at the floor.  I tried to open the door but it was locked and I got up on the bench to the right side of the door and leaned against the glass which slanted outward and tried to see something beside the metal walls but ! all I saw was an empty passageway.   The room was lighted but I did not see any source of light such as a light bulb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I looked around the basically empty compartment I again tried to get the adult male in the compartment with me to pay attention to me and help me understand what was happening to us but still he just sat there.  I looked up at the window and saw a “creature” about 4.5 feet tall, I think covered almost totally with a reddish long hair but his face looked human like and it did not pay any attention to us in the compartment, just slowly walking by the window.  I was very scared and when I&#39;m afraid of something of someone I tended to attack.  I jumped on to the bench and them beat on the “glass” and screamed and tried to break the glass but at the same time was scared to death I would break it.  The being just kept walking by and it was shortly there after that I stopped remembering anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up the next morning about 4:30 when it was time to go do the morning chores.  I never did tell my parents or anyone else because I was sure that they would not believe me.  Additionally, I did not know the other person in that compartment with me.  I have never had another incident like this that I can recall.  As far as the creature that I saw there, I have never seen anything like it again until the time I watched the movie Star Wars and that “Woki” had some resemblance to the being.<n>
6/13/70 03:30|Rio de Janeiro (Brazil)||Disk|1 hour ?|A strange but very real fact|11/8/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32876.html|20|ndxe197006| A strange but very real fact  I will try to report what happened more than 30 years ago, so please consider that some details may be a little imprecise, even though as true as one can be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just 17 years old and it was in Rio de Janeiro, June 1970. When the weather was nice, I and my friends used to go a suburb named Barra da Tijuca.  In the 70s, Barra as we called it, had just a bunch of houses in its first 15 miles of unspoiled beach (now the place is full of luxury skyscrapers). As everybody else, we bowled, laughed and had a wonderful time with our girlfriends in front of a paradisiacal beach. Close to the beginning there was a biological marine reserve with barbed wire fences at both sides of the beach road. There is also a nice restaurant at the Marisco rock, at the end of the 15-mile long beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day however, on Friday or Saturday of the week before my 18th birthday, I was driving my girl home in my blue Opala Chevrolet from this restaurant a little after 3 AM. We were speeding fast on the bumpy beach side road to arrive at the girl’s home before her mother woke up. I was singing happily while listening to the radio and seeing the beautiful night sky with a full moon and bright stars. I was totally unconcerned while my yellow high light beams vanished the darkness ahead of us. When we started crossing the marine reserve with its fences, the radio suddenly started to give static and went completely off. I thought it was just because of a bump on the pavement. Then, the road lights also went off in a sequence of stretches, blackening out the entire beach, but this was not unusual at that year in Rio. However, to my total surprise, seconds later both headlights also went off entirely, and the ENGINE stopped!  That was something else ! We still had half a gas tank, and I felt it very strange that a motor could stop at such speed ! I had never heard of such a thing!  I hit the brakes at once and they worked perfectly (mechanic drums) while trying not to leave the road, as we were going damn fast. Since the road was perfectly straight and there were no close trees, only the beach on the right side and the long lagoon and vegetation about 150 feet on our left side, I managed to stop safely at the side of the road. Both of us were a little startled, but I dropped from the car to see if the tires had suffered any damages, but they were intact. I tried to start the engine, but it refused to go and more - there was no sign of electricity whatsoever. This puzzled me as everything had been working perfectly. I checked the circuits, cables and connections using a cigarette lighter but everything seemed OK. Well, we were stuck in the middle of nowhere, with a small chance of getting mugged, robbed or worse. I walked around to see if there was any house or lights approaching, but we were entirely alone. A wind started and I looked up to the sky, but it seemed to me that it was going to rain as I could no longer see the stars. A big round black cloud was just in top of us and I could already feel some cold and electricity in the air, just like before some storms - but the sky had not a single cloud moments before! Well, what a bad luck !  We first stayed outside near a tree, so that if a burglar came he would not find us, but as no car appeared for 10 minutes, we decided to get into the car, get some shelter and relax. The last time I looked at my clock it was about 3:30 AM. It seemed to me that I had dozed for a while, when I woke up suddenly with a loud noise coming from shaking fences, the girl screaming at my right, and a super-bright beam of light - so bright in fact, I thought it was the highlights of a motorcycle gang. The girl immediately complained from a strong headache and eye strain, but I could barely see and was not able to do nothing besides hugging her at that moment. When the lights diminished I got out of the car. First I looked around and could see the barbed wire fences stopping to shake and shivered. How strange was all that! Then I looked up to see the cloud, and noticed that the black cloud now had bright colored lights shining in a circle over us. At that time very few people cared or worried about flying saucers, and my mind was in beautiful girls not UFO’s. I guess that as I do not remember seeing people then, but a huge shape, I did not realize I was seeing a flying saucer but rather something very unusual. I met something unexpected and felt uneasy, dizzy, confused, a little scared but I do not know why, I was not in any way terrified, paralyzed or the like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed that the lights were splitting from half sides of the circle to meet at their opposite sides, going back and forth, I had a very, very strong feeling of being closely observed, tried to run back but felt suddenly weak, stumbled but continued to the car. I found the girl trembling and, ridiculously enough, we both yelled at those lights to get off. It took them a long time (10 minutes?) to leave. Then, the cloud literally exploded in light, and slowly got high in the sky above us. It took a few seconds at uniform speed to reach the beginning of the 15-mile long beach stretch (we were near the middle), and then it propelled itself to the beginning and then upwards in the direction of the open sea with a tremendous acceleration to become just a point in the sky, and join two other points. Minutes later, the beach road lights went on again, I could start the engine in the first try, the radio was OK, and we could finally get home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could never talk to the girl again. Her mother was really worried (read pissed off) since she had to go to the hospital because her right eye had been severely injured - her retina suffered burns and seemed to have &#34;dripped&#34; in the white sclera area. I myself had a very strong headache for almost two weeks but it went off. Months later however, I started having strong &#34;surges of energy&#34; throughout my body (I still do), have some odd dreams, premonitions and feel like floating at night (I still do sometimes). Strangely enough, for some reason (mental block, innocence ?) I can recollect fear but no panic at any moment, besides people made fun every time I tried to tell them what had occurred, so my mind repressed what happened as &#34;unimportant,&#34; and I did not made any effort to remember it clearly until fifteen years ago, during a spiritualist meeting. Spiritualists are a different kind of people who always look to expand the truth - like it or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As strange is the fact that, thirty years later, I got acquainted with a good friend of my wife, ((male&#39;s name deleted)), that has my own age and is also an engineer, and passed through a very similar experience in the very same week, in almost the same circumstances, and also suffered from similar after effects! He even told me the UFO had been detected by the Navy radars, Rio’s traffic air controllers, and even noted on the news. I can’t remember all these details, but later learned they were true. Anyway, by different paths, we both became spiritualists, and give &#34;energy healing passes,&#34; and are very good friends. One day I shall do a regression to dig more about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I obviously think the governments know all about this kind of phenomena and there is a huge cover up, which makes me wonder how far from the whole truth is &#34;The Great Conspiracy&#34; of Ernesto Bono. It is clearly much exaggerated (sometimes a total fantasy), and is poorly documented, but if just half of it is true we are in deep trouble!

And it seems to coincide with a report on the same day from Princess Anne which is due West-South-West of Ocean City, MD.  I would have been 11 in June of 1970, my birthday being August 17, 1958.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a fast moving object in the North Sky, at an elevation of between 45 and 60 degrees.  It was nothing more to me than a bright light, but what struck me was its speed and dissimilar shape to that of surrounding stars.  To me, an Amateur Astronomer, it appeared that if all the surrounding stars were between magnitude 5 to 8 this object was closer in magnitude to 3 to 1.  It was that stark in the night sky, and I have to tell you 1970 was a time in Ocean City when light-pollution was not a problem.  Often during the summer months one could easily see the bright belt of the Milky Way tracing across the sky at about 12 o&#39;clock high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object traversed almost straight across the sky, as I said at a high velocity, but suddenly it turn north, and began to sink slightly and veer off to the left.  Then all of a sudden it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say I was dumb-founded, and terrified at the same time.  I would not tell anyone of what I saw out of fear of being ridiculed as a kid with a very active imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My guess is that the event sighting in Princess Anne was to do surveillence over the Wallops Island NASA facility, and the sighting I made might have been the same craft or another one altogether.  I surmise it was doing surveillence at Dover AFB, which is relative to the direction I reported seeing the craft traverse the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot begin to tell you how much this sighting upset, but it did, I was more scared at what I saw than I was excited, and for years I wondered if anyone else saw the same or similar events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came to your site after seeing it the ABC News Special Report on UFOs which aired this evening (24 FEB 2005) and when I researched your database for Maryland sightings I was shocked to find something similar occured in Princess Anne at about the same time.  To me, this is no mere coincidence, for I am certain that what I saw that night WAS NOT a star, nor a meteor, nor a comet, its path of progress across the sky was too varied an the turn that it made to the north, which was abrupt, does not coincide with any natural law pertaining to heavenly bodies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I did not hear anything, but I am sure it was not a normal airplane.  Comparatively speaking, it was a minor event, but it has always been a puzzlement to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

It made a very brief &#34;phhtt&#34; sound I recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the brief time period in which I saw it, it absolutely appeared to be way up in the sky and it instantaneously appeared and disappeared and that’s the last I saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I absolutely do not connect this object with anything like a model rocket.  I had flown model rockets in early years, and the UFO I saw did not have any of the characteristics of any kind of rocket, model or full sized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying horizontally toward the east over a residential area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We had stopped at a lake and camped then my ex husband, and son (he was about 2 years old), did some fishing.  We left around 10 am heading towards San Louis Obispo.  We both saw the craft; it was the typical &#34;saucer&#34; shape, aluminum color.  I had always thought for about 2 hours.  Recently I underwent hypnosis, and it seems the time frame was probably around 4-5 hours.  Our final destination was Salinas to visit relatives.  We had planned on taking an inland scenic route on the way up (from the Los Angeles area), then come home the coastal route.  Shortly after leaving the campsite we started seeing the craft, it was like it was magnetized to the car.  No matter how fast or slow we went, or what direction we went, or how fast or slow we changed directions.  It stayed exactly the same place in my field of vision.  At one point he stopped the car and cleaned off the windshield, thinking, “maybe it’s just a reflection.”  Needless to say it made no difference.  My son, who is now 35, has no recollection of the incident.  My ex husband would not discuss it with me at all, other than to say we both did see the same thing.  I was 3-4 months pregnant with my daughter.  When we were about 10-15 minutes out of San Louis Obispo, it was gone.  In the blink of an eye, one second it was there the next it was gone.  It has haunted me ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I have something I think might be an implant on my right thumb. This was not there a couple days ago. This looks like a small brown purplish color dot.  Before I have a weird small lump on that same hand above mu wrist.  Now that&#39;s gone.  This lump felt weird when I touched it.  Like it moved when I touched it.  Now it&#39;s not there.  I was wondering if that small lump moved under my thumb nail.  This is weird and I can not explain this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was in my teens I witnessed a what you might call a craft.  I was hitch hiking towards Port Hardy.  I know what a searchlight is.  This sighting was near the airport runway.  First is looked like a large flashlight beam of light coming from the skies.  It came down pretty fast.  Then it stopped.There were strobe lights on and off as it floated to the left very gently.  Then this craft floated behind the trees and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.I finally got picked up for my ride.I told this guy what i seen he no interest in it.  That&#39;s my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was younger, I started to have this thing they call flying dreams.  I was little then and we didn&#39;t know at that time what this was.  One dream I had I was walking towards the back yard of the house.I came a cross this small hobbit looking being sitting on a small rock.  It had this alien ears looking being I might say.  This little creature got up with a flash ran.  It was behind some large stinging nettles.  I placed my hands and divided the nettles trying to find this creature.  I did not even feel a thing when I touched the nettles.  I came a across my dads large fence and there inside was a some pulsating lights.  I did not know what this was.  It threw a beam of light rays through the fence.  Pulsating.  Then I woke up.I was about 8/9 years old then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above stories are adding up to what going on with me.  Even though I am a 1st Nations and wondering why I am choosing for this events.  I am an artist and I did a painting of Jimmy Page playing a violin bow on his guitar.  On the top of the painting there&#39;s a UFO craft shooting a laser beam towards the end of the violin bow.  I placed a diamond on the end of the bow.  There&#39;s a small rainbow effects coming from it.  There is also a dolphin watching Jimmy Page playing this violin bow to.  I do not know why I have choosing a dolphin.  I still have that painting to this day.  It&#39;s on my website on page 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://sky-lite-stencils.bravepages.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> And I will stop here for the time being.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in Vancouver area living in Burnaby BC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time.<n>

I estimate the speed at approximately 100 MPH, and I am sure of the size because the object passed between where I was and an adjacent building located 200 feet away.

We were preparing to sleep under the stars at his farmhouse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 11:00 PM, we were all laying on our backs looking at stars under a clear moonless night.   One of my friends pointed out a bright &#34;starlike&#34; light at about the zenith.  It was about the brightness of a zero magnitude star.  It was a single steady white light.  There was no apparent sound.  The light appeared to be a great distance away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched it, the light moved around the central part of the sky in a random path.  It sped up and slowed down.  It made abrupt turns at about 90 deg.  It moved around an area of sky about 10 degrees.  We watched it for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend ran into his house to bring out his telescope which was a department store 2 or 3 inch refractor.  Once he got the scope out and set up we lost the object in the sky.  We watched it for about 5 minutes total time.  Its brightness did not change.  Its movements were erratic and unlike an aircraft would make.  The turns were sharp, not like an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We both lived in the country and were on a country highway.  We were seniors in high school and it was 1970.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we came up to a country home just off the highway both of us exclaimed what is that?  There was a UFO over the S’s house, very close to the roof and about the size of the house.   We pulled off the highway and watched it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowly moved along side of us and just stayed there for about a minute.  It had a few colorful lights and had a sound, not very loud, that I could not identify.   I never heard the sound before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both looked at each other and then it started moving slowly past us along the route of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled to follow it and my friend turned her car around and we sped trying to catch up to it.  Soon, it went very fast, maybe what they call warp speed and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We only told my mother what we saw and this is the first time I am reporting this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I looked up at the sky and saw several round ships flying around the sky.  Like a fool, after seeing them I ran up the street and told some people what I saw.  They ran back to the park with me and they were gone.  Needless to say I felt like a jerk.  I continued on my walk as this night I was meeting a friend of mine to go out for the night.  When I met my friend I told her what happened and she got a good chuckle out of the story and told me I was crazy.  We were walking on Riverside Avenue and went down to a field area in order to save time and take a shortcut.  I saw a dog running and barking.  I thought this was strange as I knew if a dog was barking there was someone in the field.  I am thinking at the time, a person was down here.  Believe me I was not thinking space ships.  I then looked up and there was the ship.  It was very white, round, and had lights around the bottom of it.  It was over our heads so I could not see the top of it.  It was so close to us that if you had a good arm you could have thrown a rock and hit it.   That is how close it was to us.  I was scared shitless.  This ship made no noise at all.  I could not understand this.  I then said to my friend, look there is one of the ships I saw before.  I told you I was not crazy when I saw them in the park.  My friend started to run away and I was (no way) going to stay there by myself looking at this thing.  I ran after her.  I tried to tell our mutual friends what we saw.  In fact, one time when I did tell others my friend got very upset with me and did not want to admit seeing anything.  She just gave me a look when I was telling the story to others that I should just shut up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

THE YEAR WAS ABOUT1970,  IT WAS IN THE FALL IN COLUMBUS OHIO. AT FIRST I THOUGH I SAW A BLIMP WITH LIGHTED ADVERTISING (THE KIND THAT IS COMPUTERIZED) OFF IN THE SKY BUT IT WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO SEE CLEARLY. A UFO WAS THE LAST THING ON MY MIND. BUT AS I STARED AT IT TO SEE WHAT IT WAS  ITSTARTED COMING DOWN TOWARD ME  FROM THE SKY AND HOVERED JUST IN FRONT OF ME  ABOUT 50 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. IT WAS DEFINITELY A SAUCER SHAPE AND IT  WAS SILENT, IT WAS GOLD AND THE CENTER OF IT  LOOKED LIKE REVOLVING MIRRORED PANELS THAT NOW I WOULD SAY WERE SOLAR COLLECTORS BUT BACK THEN I HAD NO IDEAL WHAT SOLAR POWER WAS. IT WAS IN THE AFTERNOON ON A CLEAR DAY WITH THE SUN SHINING ON THE CRAFT FROM BEHIND ME SO I DEFINITELY SEEN IT IN THE BEST LIGHT POSSIBLE. IT JUST HOVERED THERE FOR A SHORT TIME ANDTHEN JUST FLEW UP AND AWAY FROM ME TO THE RIGHT  VERY FAST AND OUT OF SITE. AT THE TIME I WAS HEADED FOR A WOODED AREA WITH A BB GUN IN MY HANDS. I DO NOT KNOW IF THE GUN HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH ITS INTEREST IN ME BUT I THINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN  THE REASON. IF I HAD NOT SEEN THIS I THINK THAT I WOULD NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THE UFO STORIES THAT WE HEAR OF. I FIND IT VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ANY BEINGS FROM OUTER SPACE COULD TRAVEL SUCH A VAST DISTANCE BUT MAYBE IT&#39;S JUST BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION. SOMETIMES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SECRET MILITARY AIR CRAFT OR TEST CRAFT BUT I SAW IT OVER 25 YEARS AGO AND HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING AT ALL LIKE IT SINCE. BELIEVE ME OR NOT THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND ABOUT WHAT ISAW. I CAN&#39;T EXPLAIN WHERE IT CAME FROM BUT I CAN TELL YOU WITH CONVICTION THAT FLYING SAUCERS DO EXIST. PLEASE POST THIS AND MY EMAIL ADDRESS. IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME ABOUT THIS SIGHTING  I WILL TRY TO ANSWER THEM. IF YOU THINK THAT YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THIS VERY SAME TYPE OF CRAFT PLEASE EMAIL YOUR STORY TO ME. derenberg@hotmail.com<n>

The object was shiney on the upper section and rather darker on the under side due to being shaded from the sun, however arrayed around both upper and lower sections were dark panels, those panels on the shaded underside were more pronouced then those on the more shiney upper section. The object never moved during this whole duration then suddenly shot in a northerly direction with a speed that was astonishing... being stunned at this tremendous acceleration I yelled at my cousin &#34; ..did you see that !!...&#34;  he said yes it disappeared,I said &#34; no it didnt it shot to the north like a bullet &#34; this object never made a sound, and no shock wave was heard. My cousin wore glasses and I don&#39;t know if contributed to his failure to not see the sudden acceleration of this object .......in later years when I began to look into this phenomena I looked over this area on maps and noted there was a Naval Air Station very near the area of this sighting. I have refrained from reporting this sighting due in part to the unfortunate witnessing of other objects dureing other times in my life, realizing that the chance of seeing one ufo is remote, but to have other sightings years apart is even more remote, how ever I will submite these other reports also so that perhaps others whom might have witnessed the same object during those time frames might have some comfort knowing they were not alone, and I would gladly take a polygraph in all reports that I have submited.......<n>

I confess that we both had read books about UFO&#39;s. Then whatever it was, began to slowly move across the sky and then accelerated at what appeared to be an extreme high rate of speed leaving a contrail that did not disipate as quickly as the departing airliners at SFO.

There was a gradual lighting until the entire sky was light, and the a gradual darkening - much like a sun rise and sun set. It took approxametly 15 minutes for the entire event.

My father worked for a local paper manufacturer that is located on the James River. He was a shift worker and one night he was taking his break in a location that had a clear view of the James River. He said that he observed a saucer shaped object come down from the sky at a &#34;moderate&#34; rate of speed, hover just above the water for a few seconds traveling maybe a few hundred yards then dived into the water disapearing from sight. He told me it had lights but i cannot remember what colors he said they were. My father grew up on the river, living in a house boat as a child. He told me that he had seen this sort of thing happen quite often over the years.
