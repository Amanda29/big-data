We saw the object as it came into view very close to the top of the S. Mt.   We could observe the top of the N. Mt. and observe it far below the top of the East Mt. (Mt. Baring/Gunns peaks lying S.E. to N.E. resp.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object hit/landed, about 3/4 mile E. of Lookout Point, looks like an inverted V (carat?) above, and directly N. of the street that runs S. to N., from the car bridge North to where that street butts up to N. Mt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pictures or drawings available on request.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition to the object at the end of the summer, I awoke to see a grayish figure in my bedroom at the doorway as tall as the door (6&#39; 10&#34;),  I yelled for my father. and pulled the blankets over my head.

I looked up and saw what I thought was a sphere, but could have been a disk,passing overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could not tell how high it was but seemed to be fairly low but well above the pine trees.  I estimate the size to be about 30-50 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t know what it was and never heard of a UFO unil at least 2 years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

6/1/46|||||Member of  1946 elite secret  military crash team describes UFO search, crash scene, and field test on sample|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17601.html|4|ndxe194606| Member of  1946 elite secret  military crash team describes UFO search, crash scene, and field test on sample<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have interviewed an expert witness to a UFO crash. This person was a member of an elite, secret, military airplane crash team in the 1940&#39;s. The team investigated several airplane crashes. Then, about 6 months before the Roswell event, this crash team was ordered to race by land to a crash scene in a mountain wilderness area. The team had to force hike into the crash site.  The hike consumed the better part of 11/2 days since it was extremely difficult to find the crash site. Once discovered, it was quickly obvious that something had slammed into the top side of the mountain, and %100 exploded into thousands of palm sized pieces which were strewn all over the forest floor. My witness picked up a sample and conducted simple field tests on the strange object. The tests defied the known laws of engineering and physics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Original report Description follows:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1940&#39;s secret, elite military crash team member  reveals  another UFO crash  event  months  before  Roswell<n> <n><n> <n><n> My witness is a former crew chief who in the 1940&#39;s was in charge of a team that  repaired military fighter airplane engines at a famous military airbase. The crew specialized in fast engine repair. My witness was also a member of a secret military airplane crash team. This elite crash team was always on alert to speed to a disaster either by air of ground. The team was composed of civilians, enlisted men and officers. My witness became experienced in airplane crashes. He knew what to expect, what to look for, what to do upon arrival at a crash scene. At this particular crash, it was quite obvious that the craft had slammed into the side of a forested mountain and blew up into thousands of small objects scattered over a large area. Field tests revealed startling results. A shroud of secrecy settled. After that came Roswell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate; location is unknown.  We have spoken with the individual who submitted the report, and he seems to us to be serious-minded.  We have requested that he attempt to establish the exact date, if that is possible.  We have assigned an arbitrary date here, in order that the report will be sorted to the 1940&#39;s era.  We suspect that the alleged event occurred after 1941, since it seems unlikely to us that the U. S. military would have had a &#34;secret military airplane crash team&#34; before the outbreak of the Second World War.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>
