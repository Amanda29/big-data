My girlfriend, Her two brothers and I had come back to her home about 8.30 pm after swimming at the club pool. We joined her parents and an older sister on their front lawn drinking lemonade. Her Dad was a retired LT.Col from the Indian Army and a Japanese prisoner of war. At about 9.00pm one of her brothers points out &#34;Look at that funny shaped cloud forming&#34;. We all looked up and over their house at an angle of about 45deg a Church bell shaped cloud was forming. It would have been about 2-3000 ft altitude and lit by the city lights. There was no other cloud in the sky. WE would have been looking south and the final size of the bell shaped cloud would have been 3-4cm across at arms lenght. The domestic Airport would have been south west and as the crow flies about 10km away. IT did not move or appear to be effected by high wind as clouds are. We all soon caried on with our conversation till a few minutes later the brother breaks in saying &#34;look what the cloud is doing now&#34;. WE all look up again and just below the bell shaped cloud three smaller clouds form, all bell shabed, evenly spaced, and about half the size of the origional.They formed a equilateral triangle shape in the sky. Soon the three smaller clouds merged with the large one, formed a bright orange ball, bright enough to throw a shadow of the roof near us. IT shot off at great speed downwards towards the Airport with no sound and when it seemed above the Airport to us it excelerated up wards splitting into four smaller orange balls of light vanishing into the night sky. WE were all spellbound. We were sure it was a UFO. There is a funny feeling you get when you witness a UFO which no other strange event will give you. The local News paper reported the event the next morning. &#34; Strange lights seen over City&#34;. The following day the same paper reports &#34; Army said they were testing new rockets&#34;..WHAT OVER A MAJOR CITY? They could have done better than that!!!! A small foot note, a very close fam! ily friend worked at the Airport as an electrical engeneer servicing the A300Airbus aircraft and was on duty that very night. He told us that roumour was the controll tower had the craft on radar for about 1/2 an hour!<n>

Pretty soon 3 fighter jets were headed toward it.  The jets looked like ants compared to the size of the craft.  As the jets got closer the craft started moving away from them.  It was moving very slow then as the jets got close it just disapered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was relaxing on the beach overlooking the San Francisco Bay south of the Oakland San Francisco Bridge. Looking toward the north west I observed a small red light at approximately 30,000 ft. It was heading basically toward San Francisco. Initially I assumed it to be a Navigation light of a large plane. I assumed it was coming in for a landing at San Franisco Airport. It began to lose altitude and surprisingly it came toward me and in front of me across the bay at a distance of perhaps a mile. Again I assumed it to be perhaps a helicopter now although to me it was still a round red ball of brilliant light. To my surprise it suddenly dove right into the bay and the light went out and whatever it was disappeared completely. It&#39;s speed at impact must have been aproximately 100 mph. I called FAA and the San Francisco tower but no one appeared interested. I gave up. There was no accounts of any crashes in the next few days and to this day I still do not know what it was. &#34;Ley Line&#39; fire ball? UFO? I have still the record and sketch I prepared ewhich is in my log for 1980. I was stationed at Alameda NAS at the time. There was another &#39;situation&#39; which occurred to both me and my wife several years previously. This time in Missouri, in Rolla, and I will provide this report seperately.

4/5/80|Seattle|WA|Triangle|3 minutes|Metal triangle seen over Boeing field in 1980.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36312.html|5|ndxe198004| Metal triangle seen over Boeing field in 1980.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the first week of April 1980 I saw at 2am a black triangle hovering over the north end of Boeing field near Georgetown just south of Seattle Washington. I was driving in my car on I-5 when I saw what appeared to be a craft as large as a jet fighter with heavy metal struts and no lights on floating soundlessly about 200 feet in the air.  I wanted to stop and observe it but it was as if emanations of fear surrounded the craft.  It seems emanations of forgetfulness also came off the machine because I forgot about it until two weeks later when a small article in the Seattle Post Intelligencer reported that a triangular craft was spotted by several people near the Boeing plant between Edmonds and Everett.  It seemed to me that either Boeing had developed an antigravity device or had a balloon that looked like it was made of metal or that Boeing was being observed by some sort of an alien craft. After 24 years I still have no answers to these questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It seemed to spin at a regular pace but sort of pulsed as a heart might.  The entity certainly was at least aware of my presence as it moved jn an unnatural process from a distance within my perceivable range of sight [without moving my head] to the right and then left of the center with ease.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it came closer and then farther and was kind of putting on a show of its capabilities.  Suddenly it was gone as if it disappeared into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
