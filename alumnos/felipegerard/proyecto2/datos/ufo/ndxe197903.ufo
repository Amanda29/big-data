We where looking torwards Middletown while TMI was having the Nuclear Accident. We watch this Supper bright light that was as bright as a star for about 20 minutes, but it was to close. The sun started to rise and the object was visible and it tilled a bit an took off so fast that it had shot straight out towards the moon and seemed like it went behind the moon. The object was in full view for both of us to get a really good look at it and was a silver-gray color. It was round and we could see a few rectangular windows, the very top looked to have a black round section on the craft with a lot of fins going to the center on the top. The next day the TMI accident was finally fiqured out to be over. It took TMI years to see the damage and it did melt down into the concrete.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We watch a extremely bright light from an object for 5-8 minutes looking torwards TMI during the Nuclear Accident. When the sunlight just started to become visible this saucer tilted enough that the sun light it the UFO making it completely visible and then it just took off up and behind the moon. This thing shot off so fast it was unbelievably. We could not hear any sound from it and with the super bright light coming off the bottom of it we could tell what it was until the sunlight hit it and it tilted to take off and go behind the moon. We could see 3 full windows and a partial window. That morning the people at TMI finally found out that the Emergency was under control. They claimed that it did not go into melt down and from what I was told that once it starts there&#39;s nothing that can stop it, the heat is so intense that it would melt thru the floor and have a complete meltdown, explosion to relieve the pressure. Bothof us Believe the visiters stop the melt down. The Govt. repeatedly claimed it did not melt. When they finally got into the unit they found out that it melted and it was alot worse than anyone thought.     TMI should have melted and there should have been a Nuclear Accident, like I said we believe the the UFO was there to stop the melt down. My friend and I agreed to never talk about it, I feel somebody needs to know and to me this is proof that something else stopped the meltdown.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stopped at one of the only motels along the road called Lucia in an area which was otherwise quite wild, and asked for a room but for various reasons were not able to stay there so began hiking south on highway 1 to the nearest campground. It was dark and we were very tired but there were no cars and we were walking so we had no choice but to continue. We left the motel (there was a gas station there too) and when we got far enough away from there that there were no more lights visible from the road we had the ocean to our right and the mountains coming right off the road to the left. We noted that any plane or ship passing the area could be heard more clearly as it echoed off the mountains. As we walked we looked out over the ocean and noted a silent triangular amber glowing craft hoovering above the ocean and casting a very large circle of light that appeared like a search light of some sort. We immediately realized that it was not from Earth. As we watched it began a lateral ascent, parallel with the shore and it dropped something amber glowing into the ocean. At that point it began leaving a phosphorescent trail of light resembling a jet stream behind it and then a few seconds later it dropped another glowing object into the ocean and continued to move slowly upward in a linear rise while still trailing the phosphorescent light. It was moving slowly and appeared to be about 1/2-1 mile out on the ocean.  Abruptly, it turned left and shot into space. My friend through up his arms and yelled “Wait! Take me with you!” at which point from a tiny yellow star in the night sky it sent back two phosphorescent beams of light that started out as superimposed triangles which came straight at us where we were standing and eventually stop! ped as a formation hoovering over the water near shore and reflecting in the ocean below us. We both agreed that the formation resembled a vertebrae if you were looking down a spinal cord. It had a black hole in the middle of it and 3 spines coming off of it like a vertebrae. That light stayed in the air for about 10 min. before disappating. The jetstreams were there even longer. We were entirely energized by the experience which has forever changed my view of the world. I had reported the incident to the local paper in Santa Cruz, California the day after it happened to see if anyone else had reported such a siting and it was published in the paper which I didn&#39;t realize until I was sitting several days later on the beach covered with poison oak from the hike we did there and I was approached by a guy on the beach who asked me where I got the  poison oak. I told him Big Sur and he told me about the article. He said he had lived at he campground where we slept that night and that there were all sorts of strange lights coming from behind the mountains there but when they would try to approach them, they would meet with force fields that would make it impossible for them to get closer. He felt certain also that there were very strange things going on there and wasn&#39;t surprised to hear our story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have this incident documented in a journal which is why the dates are so clear but the memory is as clear as though I saw it a minute ago. I have never heard of another encounter like this one. It definitely felt as though they knew we were there and that the light show at the end was for us. It was utterly spectacular. With all recent crop circles coming around the world, I have become very interested in becoming a part of the movement to understand and/or communicate with whatever is doing this. I feel that they are studying us like we study animal life on our own planet. We are primitive to them and they are being careful not to come on too strong, just giving us beautiful crop art and occasional sitings of their otherwise invisible craft. I heard recently that we have learned how to make things invisible and that this was learned through alien technology. I want to know more about this. How involved are you with the crop circle phenomena as it relates to the UFO sitings? Is there any way I can help with this? Please contact me.  I am a Masters prepared nurse midwife in New York City. Jimmy managed a food coop in Idaho at the time and still lives in Idaho.<n>

In the southern sky over the nearby hills/mountains, I saw a flashing row of multiple white lights, one larger/brighter light in the center and smaller/dimmer ones out to the sides in the formation of &amp;quot;wing&amp;quot; of an aircraft approaching you.  Like this * * * * # * * * * with the &amp;quot;#&amp;quot; representing the &#34;center bigger light. I would judge that the &#34;object&#34; was at least the size of a C-130 or larger sized aircraft....It&#39;s hard to judge as it never seemed to get closer/larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights alternated on and off through out the row including the center and seemed to &amp;quot;bank&amp;quot; left and right around the center light.  The lights disappeared (or went out) for a brief period, came back on for a few more flashing patterns and then disappeared completely. We lived near an airport but and I was/still am an avid &#34;plane watcher&#34; so can make the distiction between aircraft and something else.  There were far too many lights in the row for typical aircraft landing lights.  The area is not a normal flight approach to the airport and the lights did not get closer or further away but seemed stationary in the distance.  There was no sound. I have been around aircraft all my life and cannot explain what I saw as any type of aircraft that I know or have seen.  Never ever told anyone of the event........just found the website and decided it was time to tell someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

When I went to her room I realized the interior of the house was lit up from this object, which was about 100 yards away. We lived in a small one story house on the edge of the campus across from the indoor swimming pool.  Land had been cleared next and behind this building for a new athletic complex. This object I saw was in the cleared area and I would say estimate the size of it to be the length of two bull dozers end to end.  There was no activity seen.  However, the luminous light would slowly dim and gradually get brighter.<n>

Patches of low level &#34;cottonball&#34; type clouds, and lots of sky in between. Something caught my eye and at first I thought it was a &#34;search light&#34; moving across the clouds, but to my astonishment it was a VERY large chevron aircraft skimming the tops of the clouds. It made no sound. This occurance happened over the Stonewood mall area which at that time had those sodium street lights, they look orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft was smooth on the bottom and low enough to make out detail. It had no markings, no engine nacells, windows or bumps of any kind. Its color was tan as I believe it was reflecting the street lights on its belly. It had no lights at all. I started counting seconds right away. Total event duration- 12 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

S|9/26/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02584.html|14|ndxe197903| Summary : While in flight landing at Medford from Klammath Falls, I spoted what appeared to be another aircraft flying the opposite direction.  Since the moon was setting, when this craft siluetted againt the moon, I could see it had no tail.  I turned toward the craft, it turned toward me.  The encounter ended with the craft flying formation with me for about 30 seconds, where I could see much detail of two craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This encounter may be too old to be of interest to you.  I did report it to a Universite the day after, but I do not remember which University.  I got the phone number from the Medford Police for the University.  About 4 years ago I reported the encounter to Dr. Haynes.  I only mention it to you now, because I still have relatives in Medford, who sent me a newspaper clipping of a recent sighting there, that mentions the name of your organization.  If you have an interest in more detail, let me know, I will email you a full description. Russ Smith<n>
