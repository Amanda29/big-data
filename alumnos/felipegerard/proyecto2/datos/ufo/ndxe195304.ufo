4/30/53 16:00|Jamison|PA|Cigar|several minutes|In the spring of 1953 my mother & I saw an IMMENSE silent grey metallic cigar shaped object moving from Doylestown toward Jamison.|12/23/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26268.html|1|ndxe195304| In the spring of 1953 my mother &amp; I saw an IMMENSE silent grey metallic cigar shaped object moving from Doylestown toward Jamison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi Peter, Hope you are having a wonderful Thanksgiving! This is a story my mother has repeated to me throughout my life. She is now 79 years old &amp; I asked her yesterday to tell me once again so I could report it accurately now that I have discovered your site. In 1953 we lived in the countryside between Doylestown &amp; Jamison, Pennsylvania. I was 3 years old &amp; my mother was about 8 months pregnant with my sister, so it was either very late April or very early May. It was a warm spring afternoon &amp; before my Dad came home from work we walked up a path in the woods to the top of the hill into a field where we had pretty much a 360 degree view. My mother recalls that as she was looking off toward the hill to the North between us &amp; Doylestown she saw what at first appeared to be a blimp moving rather slowly through the sky. It turned &amp; moved toward us &amp; as it came overhead she realized it was IMMENSE, HUGE, it covered the sky, &amp; created such a shadow that the breeze ceased in the trees &amp; even the birds fell silent. She said it was 1000 feet above us, the size of three football fields from our perspective &amp; that this was no blimp! The object was a dull silver-grey, had no seams, no lights, no windows, no propellor, no cabin underneath &amp; it moved in absolute silence. She said she was terrified because of it&#39;s size. Apparently she told me to run home with the cocker spaniel &amp; she tried to run also, but being very pregnant could not move very quickly. She has always thought they did not harm her because she was pregnant. My father did not believe her when he got home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometimes I think I should be hypnotized to discover how I remember this event. I read on your site that something similar was seen in Galveston, Texas in 6/1953.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
4/15/53 16:00|Midwest City|OK|Fireball|15 min|Ball of yellow light with dancing spikes of light, around the circumference-one of the spikes reached out to  me.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36216.html|2|ndxe195304| Ball of yellow light with dancing spikes of light, around the circumference-one of the spikes reached out to  me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 3 yrs old, and observed a ball of light that looked similar to the sun--about the size of a beach ball floating over the power lines. It traveled silently and slowly from east to west. The ball of light had pointed spikes of light dancing around the edges of the ball. The power lines were running through the easement between the properties.  I was about 60 to 70 feet from the light. As the light passed over to the neighbor&#39;s property to the left of me, it paused--then one of the spikes of light shot down, through the chain link fence, right up to me! The light &#34;beam&#34; was about 3 inches wide and thin as a sheet of paper--and tapered to a sharp spike. I don&#39;t know if it actually touched me, if not, it came within an inch or two of me. The spike of light remained about 20 to 30 seconds, then it withdrew back into the ball of light and began moving slowly west again.  When the spike of light extended out to me, all of the rest of the dancing spikes of light stopped moving. After the spike withdrew back into the ball of light, all of the spikes of light began dancing again.  At that point, I ran into the house to tell my mother what I had seen.  She dismissed the report, after all I was only 3 yrs old. When I went back out side, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

West Covina is about 20 miles east of my siting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was playing catch with my brother in the parking lot of the apartment complex we were living in in northeast Los Angeles near the Glendale border.  I was facing east (towards West Covina) when I saw a large green &#34;meteor&#34; traveling north towards the San Gabriel Mountains.  I don&#39;t recall the exact day or time but it was a bright clear day and the &#34;meteor&#34; was very visible appearing low in the horizon and to move horizontally with the ground.  I recall that there was a brief article in the Los Angeles Examiner that mentioned the siting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I understand that at that time there were no big Flying Wings. I didn&#39;t know till years later, what I saw. Granted this is no UFO story, but it lets me know that there are really things up there unknown to most people. No need to contact me as that&#39;s all I know. We were looking northwest, Objects were about 3-5 miles, guessing about 4000to5000ft high. (low ?)  Thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Does anyone know whether the U. S. &#34;flying wing&#34; bomber was flying, by the spring of 1953??  PD))<n>

He is a old school French Catholic with strong family values and ethics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were having a discussion on a television program dealing with UFO&#39;s.  He stated that he had once seen a &#34;flying ship&#34;.  He went on to say that it was spring in 1953 when he and his friend, were walking across a field in Haverhill MA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He stated that out of know where, &#34;One of those ships&#34; that &#34;looked like a big glowing bananna&#34;  flew directly over them.  He stated that they had never seen anything like it and had know idea what it was.  He stated they watched it until it disapeared over a nearby hill.  He went on to state that they were so terrified, they just ran.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He is as straight a shooter as they come and his account was told with such conviction that I am convinced he saw something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
