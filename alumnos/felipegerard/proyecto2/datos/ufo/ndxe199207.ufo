We cut through our neighborâ€™s back yard and into a park.  As we were walking through the park surrounded by trees,  a huge disc the size of a condensed helicopter with rotating iridescent flashing lights (as a strip around the craft), swooped in and hovered above us.  It was hovering at about 5 stories high, right above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all looked at it and screamed and proceeded to run while looking back.  As we began to run, we saw the craft zip into the sky and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my best friend were only 14 at the time and never forgot what we had seen.

At the time she lived with her mother in the wooded areas in east texas near the La/Tx line...they both saw a diamond shaped craft move very slowly over the van. It had lights on each corner, with a forward light beam emmited from two diffent parts on the front of the craft. It produced a slight buzzing-electric sound that could be heard over the van engine. It moved westerly about 35 mph, with an approximate altitude of 100 feet, and maintained same altitude despite changing topography. The underneath side had strobe-like lights flashing at at regular intervals, lastly dark rectangular bands are seen at diffent lenghts on the bottom side of the craft with a circular light in the middle of the underside<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Airplane getting brighter and brighter and brighter than prvious brite star sized lites and obsever pointed out the unusual horizontal motion of the one as compared to the airplane&#39;s path which was predictable and approaching Nth end runway (5 miles out?)then we looked back to horizontal moving lite then rptr. looked back at airplane (formerly 10degrs. right of horz&#39;l moving lite and plane was gone.)Rptr. asked new observer where plane was and observer said didn&#39;t know.Plane would have flown overhead but no lites; no sound; no clouds-plane gone.If military,we win.If not,we must be somebody&#39;s zoo.(Sometimes objects moved from 0 to very fast without appearing to &#34;accelerate&#34; as most non-! physicis ts would use that term.)Possibly swamp gas or weather balloons that lite up and move fast or don&#39;t move at all or move in opposite directions and then disappear.Possibly jet powered helicopters flying close to each other near airport not worried about airport area or flight restrictions or crashing into each other by playing game and flying close but not crashing when lites turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

7/26/92 23:30|East Corinth|ME|Oval|45 minutes|A large object came across a field, hovered directly overhead at about 150', then played "cat and mouse" games with me for about 45 min|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05602.html|4|ndxe199207| A large object came across a field, hovered directly overhead at about 150&#39;, then played &#34;cat and mouse&#34; games with me for about 45 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location: East Corinth, Maine Occurred: 7/26/92 Time: 11:30pm I was just getting home from working the 3-11 shift at a local hospital. As I was turning into my driveway I noticed 2 bright lights over the field a couple of hundred yards away, at first I thought it was a low flying airplane, but as I watched I realized it was much to close and low to be an airplane, also there was no sound. I walked down to the end of the driveway, as I stood there the lights started coming closer, very slowly the object came towards me until it hovered motionless about 100 feet directly above me. I would approximate it to be about 100 feet long, not quite as wide as it was long, I suppose &#34;cigar&#34; shape would be close. The underside was very black, it was difficult to make out the outline, there was a deep red light off center on the underside, and bluish-white lights shining outward from each end and the sides. There was a low pitch humming like sound, no down draft that I could feel coming from it. As I looked around and realized there was no one else around, a panic came on me, I ran up the driveway and crouched down behind my car, (this seems almost funny to me now) as I looked back at the craft it began to move slowly off down the road. I ran back down the driveway to see where it was going, it stopped and hovered just above the tree tops about 60 yards away, it slowly rotated and made a high mechanical whining noise, it&#39;s difficult to describe because I have never heard anything like it. It then began to move off towards the main road. Where I got the nerve, I&#39;ll never know, but I got in the car and headed after it. When I reached the main road the craft was just on the other side of the street, right at tree top level, I got out of the car and stood on the hood of it and just starred at this thing, it was close enough that I could have hit it with a rock. From this angle I could see three lights blinking along the craft, one green, red, and a blue one, also a row of dim lit lights that looked to be windows. As I stood there for about a minute it began to slowly move away along t! he road heading south, I followed along at about 60 mph as this craft flew along just above the trees along side of the road, after about a mile I lost sight of it. Three miles from home I pulled into  the parking lot of a closed store and got out to look out aver a big valley, as I stood there it came out across the valley in a big arc and went out of sight. At this point I was very wound up and excited so I headed home to call some one about this. As I was driving home, I saw it again in the rear view mirror, I stopped and got out of the car and watched it again fly off out of sight. After I got home and was getting out of the car it came over the tree line at a fair distance away and flew off out of sight. I sat out on the deck for about an hour but did not see it again that night. The time from when I first saw it until I got home was about 45 minutes. A strange thing was that while this was going on there where no cars on the road, after it was over the were quite a few. I made several phone calls over the next several days, but no one could tell me anything, some people laughed, the was some ridicule from others, and some people said they believed and a few even shared sighting of there own. In closing I&#39;d just like to say that this is absolutely a true story and the strangest thing that I have ever experienced, it seemed as if this craft were playing some cat and mouse game with me.<n>

My 12 year old son was in the passenger seat.  We were driving up this road when I could see cars pulled over on both sides of the road.  People were out of their cars and looking up in the air to the right of the road I was driving on.  At this time there were trees to the right of my car and I could not see what they were viewing.  I approached where they were and off to the right of my car in the air, about 4 telephone poles high, maybe 160-200 feet in the air was a silver Plane, all silver, just sitting there not moving nor was it making a sound.....I&#39;m guessing it was about 1000 feet off the road to my right<n> <n><n> <n><n> The road I live on was 200 feet to the left past where people were standing watching this Silver plane sitting in midair.  The road I live on is a dead end road with 6 houses on it, I live in the third house on the left.  I turned and drove down this road where as I seen my neighbor pointing in the air toward the Silver plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shook my head in a yes motion and turned into my driveway...my son and I ran to the back of my house where I yelled for my wife to come out and look ,she did, with my daughter.  We watched this Silver Plane for about 8 minutes.  The plane from where we are now watch is about 1350 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no markings on this silver plane....No jet engines under the wings, it did have a windshield and they appeared tinted just because I could not see anybody inside.  When this silent plane decided to leave.  It made a slight bank to the left of itself and slowly flew off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This area is a fairly populated part of the city in a rural setting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This Silver Plane was about the size of a 727 I guess ,not a big Plane but big enough<n>

I was the sergeant in charge, we were on guard duty guarding an ammo point(Bunkers).I was sitting in the hummer with my driver parked at the entrance of the ammo point facing towards the main road that lead to the ammo point entrance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were sitting there we both saw green and red lights ,that looking  back it now it was like there were spinning. At first my driver thought that it was some kind of firing range and we were seeing tracer rounds, the army uses red tracers when they are conducting night fire exercises, but the only problem was the spot we saw the lights was a camping area for the non-commissioned officer school, I knew this because that was the area I went to school before I became a sergeant, and another thing is that why would someone be firing live rounds near an ammo point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I radioed in to the command center and notified the officer of the guard and advised them I was going to go investigate the lights. So I had my soldiers load there weapons and be on high alert and my driver and myself started up the hummer and rolled to the area we saw the lights, we used a spot light and we could not see anything and we identified ourselves and no one replied to or calls. There was a quit eerie feeling so after a few minutes we returned back to the entrance to the ammo point and it was not long before the officer of the guard showed up and we told him what we saw and he told us to make a report and that was the last thing I remember about that incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was three lights which I figured was one on top and bottom of the passenger area and one on the tail. Didn&#39;t see any craft due to the distance in the dark--only the lights were visible. Realized my window was down and there was NO sound from the aircraft. Watched it for atleast five minutes, and it did not sway or rotate. Was interupted by the person&#39;s house I was leaving and when I looked back, it had vanished. I had not been drinking or anything else along those lines to impair my perception. I tried for the duration of the sighting to rationalize it out completely, and couldn&#39;t.<n>

I wonder if you have a record of a plethora of reports of abductio|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30954.html|10|ndxe199207| I had the most vivid dreams two consecutive nights in mid-July 1992. I wonder if you have a record of a plethora of reports of abductions from the San Gabriel Valley about then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dreamt that my wife and I were abducted.  This was by no means the typical abduction experience that you hear about nor was it by any means a typical dream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first night featured a dream that included a massive airlift of people being abducted while asleep. My wife and I were raised off of our beds, traveled through the house feet first to the back door, out the door then gradually into the air. We moved at a slow pace through the air. We met many others in the sky. All were floating through the air feet first dressed in pajamas. We landed in the Angeles Forest in the foothills of the San Gabriel Valley near a flying saucer.  One &#34;alien&#34; removed here helmet. She looked orientally human. She gave us shots in arm. Then we woke up. I remembered the dream. My wife did not. But we both had sore arms where the shots were administered and there were red marks. I had fallen asleep about 4:00 a.m. and awoke at 6:30.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The experience seemed to last 20 to 30 minutes. Very clear like a single long scene from a movie with no cuts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a dream but of course what is a dream? This was by no means a typical abduction experience. No bright lights. No little green men. The alien looked very human.  There was no terror. There was no hypnosis required to help recall the dream. I remembered the dream as soon as I awoke.  But it was not a typical dream either!  Any similar reports in your archives from mid-July 1992?<n>

I should note here, before I discuss the details of the sighting, that there are several important contextual factors that should not go unmentioned. First of all, I am an amateur astonomer. Several thousand hours spent watching the sky have yieled but a single event, an anomoly if you will. The implications of this are open to debate; however, I think these particular noctunal habits strongly suggest the presence of a logical way of observing natural and unnatural (artificial) phenomena. Secondly, I have had cognitive testing performed by a praticing psychologist, and the test results indicated a very high perceptual score. Apparently this psychologist has not seen such a score over the years, save for a &#34;few&#34; other examples. With these factors in mind, hopefully my report will be given serious consideration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As indicated above, this event took place sometime around 1992 or &#39;93. The month was probably July, but it may have been late June or early August as well. I recall it was a clear, moonless (new moon, moon set early, or late rising) night, well after midnight, but not yet near twilight. A light breeze could  be heard in the pine and spruce trees. I was alone but with one other person, and we were sitting so that we faced, by chance, westward. My gaze, at one crucial moment, happened to be fixed on the cloudless sky some twenty degrees above the horizion. Very abruptly, as if someone had flipped on a switch, a luminous orange half-disk appeared directly in my line of sight. The half-disk moved parrallel to the horizion, from my right to my left, silent (as far as I could discern) all the while. After but a few seconds, it faded out, and I was to never see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can recall other specifics related to this &#34;object&#34;: it was of a luminous, dull orange color (my impression then ,as now, is that it was self-luminous); it displayed sharp borders all around and seemed quite solid in its makeup ; the flat section was actually slightly concave, thus it wasn&#39;t quite a half-disk; it appeared to travel with the aformentioned side in front; it left no trail or train that I could observe; it&#39;s apparent size was about 150% of the moon near first-quarter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is interesting to note that orange half-moons as well as disks are not unknown in UFO literature, however the precise characteristics seem to vary from sighting to sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  Witness indicates date in both 1980&#39;s and 1990&#39;s, and we have requested clarification from the party as to in which decade the event occurred.  PD))<n>

I sat right in front of the church, police yard and high school a bit off a ways, when I was so amazed that something had just flew right in front of me at a super high speed rate, it was so close that it almost felt like a bomb or something but just a radiating light that was fast and quiet.  I was with an ex-boyfriend at that moment and we both couldn&#39;t grasp even that it might been out of this world experience and just pretty crazy that we were actually together instead of being alone when it happened.  Being &#34;in love&#34; can bring upon weird things and that&#39;s what I thought it was weird but the only truly once in a lifetime experience that I&#39;ll never be able to grasp totally.  I wasn&#39;t abducted but I did see something exordinary that I couldn&#39;t explain as to what it was like how it might have been this or that (plane, imagination, whatever) I just know that I feel as though we all have a moment of total wonder of ufo&#39;s and if they exist and they probably will never know for certain.<n>

I was lying down on a sleeping bag outside on a field looking up in to the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something came from who knows what direction and stopped in the sky far above me.  It was closer than a star and it seemed to be spinning with lights all around it- like a Frisbee with lights I guess.  It stayed there for ten seconds or so, maybe slightly longer and then took off again at an incredible speed.  As far as I know an airplane canâ€™t stop in midair- spin in a circle, and then jet off out of sight in a second or less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, when I was older at my mothers I remember waking up in the middle of the night or the early morning.  There was a bright white light in my room and outside my window.  I got the feeling like something was checking up on me.  Then I went back to sleep.<n>

Sometime after dark, I was outside the trailer looking around the site.  I looked out and saw two red/green constantly changing glowing lights hovering erratically between 2 mountaintops to the North-East far in the distance.  After watching the lights for a few minutes one of the lights moved incredibly fast and sharp in the sky.  The distance was incredible. Almost as if it was transporting from one place to the next.  Over the next 30 mins this happened 7-8 more times. Each of the lights moving at sharp angles.  It seemed as if the movements were unstable.  I called the other worker out to tell me if he was seeing what I was seeing.  I had him tell me! when he saw the lights move.  After confirming that I was not just seeing things I resigned to the fact that it was unexplainable.  I went into the trailer for a bit and when I came back out I was watching the lights again.  Only one light was remaining when I returned.  While I was watching this the one light shot off to the right in a straight direct line into infinity in about 1-2 seconds.  Behind the light was a small trail of white light that dissipated quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary time above, in order to reflect a nighttime sighting.

A glowing, reddish orange orb was floating through the trees in my backyard.  It was about 30 feet from where I stood and just about at my eye level. The orb looked about the size of a giant beach ball. Our yard fell away steeply just feet from the foundation.  I watched this for several seconds as my brain tried to compute what I was seeing.  I watched as it maneuvered through the dense trees, yet never came into contact with one.  It then emerged from the other side of the woods and slowly climbed in altitude until it cleared the hill on the other side of the woods. It then disappeared in the distance.  I listened to the local news reports and scanned the paper for days to see if anyone else had seen it.  This happened in a heavily populated suburb.  One week later, about 10 o&#39;clock PM, I was driving to Blockbuster with my husband and we spotted the same orb near the edge of town.  We followed it until it disappeared into the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in the summer of 1992 in Cincinnati, Oh. It has haunted me ever since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 45 at the time and a homemaker. We have witnessed several other strange anomalies in the years since this sighting took place.

It was terrifying because we didnt know how to protect our family and keep them out if they wanted into our home. I hope you dont think I am crazy when I tell you what happened but I swear to you, its all true. Occasionally our kids still talk about it but none of us shared it because people would never believe it and we would be made to look like fools. Being a skeptic before the incident I know exactly how that would go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived in a new developement in Lexington near Kelso washington. Our home sat in a field alone, and it was very dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night around 10:30pm or so we were watching tv in the family room and I noticed my husband kept looking out the sliding glass door into the sky. I asked what was he looking at. He pointed to a light in the sky over the top of the hills in a distance. It did appear to be holding still. Then all at once a smaller light dropped out from the bottom of it and headed downward and to the left. We watched and I made fun of my husband saying &#34;oooh its a UFO!&#34; and I flashed our porch light off and on for probably 10 seconds in the SOS pattern. The light instantly shot over from a tiny dot in the sky to right over us- something so damned bright it blinded us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our daughter started to cry and hid under a blanket on the couch yelling no, make it stop! It was giant and looked like a big cross of light. I held my hand over my eyes squinting trying to look at it for just a second and started to cry and slammed the sliding glass door shut and locked it and turned off all the lights in our house trying to hide from &#34;it&#34;. but my husband and one son ran outside and stood underneath this thing. I was begging them to come in and not do that. It was so big. It covered our yard and home. It was so bright like no other light I have ever seen. Just writing about it for the first time makes me feel like crying. I have never been so scared. I didnt know what it wanted or what it would do. I was afraid it would hurt my sons and husband.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no noise. It didnt move. It just hovered over us. We couldnt see anything else. No sky, no trees nothing just the light.  After what seemed like hours but was maybe one minute it retracted back up to the sky. It moved so fast that it was there and then it zoomed away in just a flash it was a tiny light again in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all shook up. I held our daughter and comforted her. The boys wanted me to hold them close too. Our little girl and the two boys wanted to sleep in our bedroom with us. We put a sleeping bag on our floor for our daughter and told the boys to sleep with the doors open from their room to ours. I feel so bad now looking back. I should have piled them all into my bedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We fell asleep and woke to hear our boys screaming and banging on our door. I ran to their room and they were both shouting at the same time. I couldnt understand at first. Soon my husband came in to see what was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They described a bright light like a flame coming to their bedroom window and then a person type thing with long arms, but it was short, was just there in their bedroom. The dog &#34;bumper&#34; barked at it. It just stood there looking at them. The boys said they were screaming as loud as they could but neither our daughter or either of us woke. They said it was almost the second we had gone to bed. It makes no sence. why didnt we hear them screaming? The boys realized we were not coming to help them and One of our sons told the other on the count of three they were going to run past it to our room and get us. They said the &#34;thing&#34; just moved from the closet area to the end of the bed without moving its limbs. Like flash, it was here then flash it ws there. The boys were screaming for us and we couldnt hear it! Our bedrooms across the hall from theirs. It doesnt make any sence that we could not hear them. Im a light sleeper and had just crawled into bed. We never could make sence of it. They woke us up by banging on our bedroom door which we had left open, but somehow it was closed!! Even then we had a really hard time waking up to get to the door. It sounds crazy , but its true. So I got up and went to their room. I thought maybe they were making a joke or something. I felt really confused and dazed, and I didnt even believe them. I calmed them down and they slept on my floor beside our daughter for the remainder of the night. Later I felt just horrible about it because the next morning they were still all excited and upset and showed me their bedroom window. ( our home was two story and their bedroom faced the hills where the ufo came from.) their window had a burned hole in the screen and the siding of the house had a burn on it. there was ash inside their windowsill.  I brushed the ash into a baggy and was going to submit it to someone. We talked about it and I was afaid of ending up in some National Inquirer magazine or something horrible. We kept our mouth shut but the trama of it has never left any of us! . It too k about a week for the kids to sleep in their room. I felt so vulnerable. We called someplace and talked on the phone to someone who investigates ufo sighting because we wanted to know how to keep the beings out of our home. We never followed up because as I said before we didnt want to be exploited and our kids to suffer any further than they had already.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am pretty sure that I still have the baggy somewhere. I kept the ash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It IS okay to e-mail if you have questions, but its not okay to send some reporter or do anything to cause my family harm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,<n>

I have always hesitated in telling this srange story to many people in the past because they might think that I made the whole thing up, or am crazy.  Trust me, this story is very much true and accurate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw those two late nights back in 1992 etc. still gives me chills up and down my spine even today.  When I was a very young boy in my teens I had two very real and serious UFO close encounters.  They both happened in Kentucky, and were very much real.  There were other witnessess too.  I remember them both well, and they somehow changed my life forever.  They made a UFO believer out of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One was a very powerful loud object and light hovering above me and my cousins one day for several minutes.  Were we abducted?  I cannot remember.  The other sighting was of a very large glowing disk with lights that my Grandparent&#39;s and I saw in the black night sky up close.  The second sighting happened a few years later.  When I got older I left home and moved away to another city to start a career.  I lived alone in a small one bedroom apartment.  Late one night around midnight I was awakened by a very strong sense that someone, or something, was in my apartment with me.  I looked out into the hallway and I was totally astonished, and scared to death, at what I saw.  In my bedroom at the left end corner of the foot of my bed stood a man, a man in total black ( a shadow like person).  The hallway light was on, and his manly form was unmistakable in my bedroom.  I could definately make out the form of a man with an older 1940&#39;s style hat on, and his body outline with an overcoat on too-both completely dark black.  Believe me, this person or thing was really there.  I am a born again Christian, and my honesty is something that I hold in high regard.  I simply could not move-my body was frozen in fear and anxiety.  I quickly glanced outside my bedroom window to see if he was just a reflection from outside of some sort, but their was no reflection.  I opened and closed my eyes many times, and shook my head, to see if I was dreaming.  I shockingly finally realized that I was not.  My heart was beating so fast I could hear it pounding, and I really thought that I was going to have a heart attack.  I could not move, and the man just stood there in complete silence for close to twenty minutes staring at me.  Finally he just somehow vanished in an instant.  It took me an hour or longer to calm down and do a search in my apartment.  The doors were all locked.  About four months later the exact same thing happened again.  I was suddenly awakened, and there at the same location was the same black shadowy man standing at the left end corner of my bed staring at me.  Again I could not move, and was again frozen with fear and anxiety.  My heart was beating again very rapidly too.  This time though I finally managed to ask him who he was, and what did he want.  He just stood there staring at me again for around twenty minutes or so.  Then he just practically vanished again.  Even today I cannot begin to explain who or what the thing was that I saw.  I have heard strange stories of MIB&#39;s (Men In Black) visiting people who have had UFO encounters before, but this was crazy. I had never taken them so seriously before.  Now I wonder.  Anyway, the strange and mysterious man in black never came back to my apartment again-thank God.  I hope that you believe my story.  Yes, I know this story sounds crazy, but it really happened exactly the way that I told it to you.  Something happened to me those two frightening nights beyond my understanding.  I DO know for a fact that the UFOs are real!----JG<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was approx 3 ft off the tar. I saw it clearly from approx 300 ft away and it came towards my vehicle at a rapid rate of speed. All the time maintaning the same height off the road, 3ft. It seemed intelligent due to the fact that it followed the contour of the road perfectly, as the road was slightly curvy and hilly. As it past by me within 3 ft I noticed no sounds or extra illumination or smells inside my truck. It traveled very fast. Immediately afterwards I asked ((name deleted)) what he saw. He said a glowing ball in the road that came towards us. Just 1000&#39; ahead on Range rd were about 4 or 5 adults waiting to see the start of the fireworks at Canobie lake park. I wish I had asked them if they had seen anything unusual. But I did&#39;nt stop. I had ((name deleted)) to collaberate what I saw that July 4th, 1992 evening 12 years ago. It was not flaming like a &#34;Roman Candle&#34; balland was not hot or burning or changing colors like fireworks. If this thing had not come so close and just gone the other way, I would have brushed it off and dismissed and forgotten it.

We lived in Pembroke Pines Florida near Ft Lauderdale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around dusk, which was probably around 7:00 pm, I heard my neighbors who were in my back yard yelling for me to come outside as a UFO was passing directly over my yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I came out, I was stunned to see the brightest orange object I have ever seen in my life. The craft was flying several thousand feet in the air. The size of the object was about 50 to 75 feet across. The object was disc-shaped. The color orange was so bright; you could not make out any details of the bottom of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft made absolutely no noise and was cruising rather slowly in a north-to south direction. Upon realizing this, I quickly called my brother who lived due south of me in Miami to run outside with his video camera to capture this incredible sight.

I am 34 years old.  I hold an associateâ€™s degree.  I am also an expert in long-haul transmissions technology with six years of military experience in the communications field.  Prior to my military service, was in project management for five years with a large telecommunications company.  I lived in and around Garland, Texas, from age 5 until I enlisted at age 28.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I apologize, as the date and time of my account is only a guess, as it took place over 15 years ago.  However, I estimated the date based on a few facts: I had recently graduated high school in May 1992; it was summer; I was driving an &#39;87 Honda Civic during the incident, a car which I owned at that time.  The time was late evening, an hour or so after sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A childhood friend of mine and I were driving SE down what is today President George Bush Toll Way (TX 190) at around 2200.  Today, the area is very built up with shopping malls and restaurants.  But back in 1992, the only building in the area was a high school (my high school).  It was dark and, at the time, there were no street lamps.  As I&#39;m driving, my friend points to the sky through the windshield and tells me to look.  He&#39;s pointing straight up through the windshield to a point directly over my car.  And, while it was difficult for me to lean forward over the steering wheel to see what it was he was pointing at, I caught several glimpses of it.  This is what I saw: three reddish hued lights in a triangle configuration, with one brighter light in the very center of the formation.  And, while the sky was dark, the space between the lights was even darker, giving the shape a distinct triangular outline.  Because I was driving, I could only glance at the object for a few seconds at a time before I had to put my eyes back on the road.  It was difficult to tell whether or not the object was moving along with us, or if it was at such an elevation that it appeared motionless from our perspective.  When I would glimpse it, I could tell the object was rotating slowly in a counter-clockwise direction, at an estimated rate of one rotation every 30 seconds.  We were now approaching a stop sign, and I brought the car to a stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Without speaking, immediately after I stopped, I shut the engine and lights off; we exited the car and stood up in the road to get an unobstructed view.  To our delight, the object was still there, hovering silently.  Now that we were no longer moving, we could tell the object wasn&#39;t moving, either.  It was completely stationary (though it continued to rotate in place) and produced absolutely no noise.  As far as the size of the object, it was difficult to estimate.  But I recall that, from my perspective on the ground, the triangle appeared to be about the same size as the shape one can make by touching the thumbs and index fingers of both hands and holding them at arm&#39;s length directly overhead (approximately 4&#34; x 4&#34; x 4&#34;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch the object for another thirty seconds or so when another car began to approach us from the rear.  We quickly hopped back in my car, started it up, and pulled it to the side of the road to make way. As soon as the other car pulled away, we got back out.  But when we looked up at the sky, there was nothing there.  Nothing at all.  No noise, no lights.  Whatever we had been observing only seconds earlier had vanished.  I don&#39;t recall ever telling anyone about it, and I don&#39;t believe my friend or I ever discussed the incident with each other again after that night.  Of course, we haven&#39;t spoken to or seen one another in over ten years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize it&#39;s been many years since this took place.  In fact, I rarely even think about it.  However, it was several years ago that I first read an article or saw a news report about someone witnessing an object matching the exact description of what I&#39;d seen so long ago.  Since then, I&#39;ve seen or read many other separate but similar accounts.  And, since I&#39;ve always been somewhat of a skeptic with regards to UFO sightings, I tried my best to pretend what I&#39;d seen must&#39;ve been something else...maybe something I would&#39;ve recognized had it been daylight.  However, ever since that day, when I&#39;m outside at night, I still find myself staring up at the sky, semi-hoping that I might see the same thing again, if for no other reason than to prove to myself that whatever I saw actually does exist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though I still remain skeptical, I felt I should at least contribute my experience so as to at least add my account to the collection of other similar sightings.  Skeptic or not, I saw what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Most of us were celebrating on the second floor in an open balcony. We were dancing and laughing (not drinking)It was a clear but dark night with few stars here and there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, one of my friends screamed at everybody to look at the sky, all of us came rushing to look and when I looked up I saw a huge light that looked like a giagantic moon. This light started to appear closer and closer, and everybody started screaming. I was out of my shocked when my friend yelled at me to use my camara (I was taking pictures of all of us before this happened) I lift the camera and started taking shots like crazy, and in a frenzy went down the stairs to get under that beautiful and giagantic light. when I got down to the patio another of the students was coming from the grocery store and he asked what was going on?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told him to look up and he dropped all the bags he was carrying when he saw the light.  Right next to him and under that brilliant light I kept taking pictures when suddenly this magnificent object started emitting from its center smaller circles of lights of different colors.  It was scary at the beginning, but once I got closer to it I felt just amazed of its size and beauty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting lasted about 5 to 8 or ten minutes (I&#39;m not sure) All I know is that it was the second sighting of my life and I felt really lucky to be witnessing such as an amazing &#34;thing&#34;. I took my camera to develop the pictures from that night, and I got all the group pictures except the ones I shot at the light. The giagantic light shots all developed as a deep black empty space.<n>

I lived in a house with a Christian family.  They called up to my room one night to come outside and see something.  I went downstairs and joined them outside, and saw a very large round object hovering closeby in the sky.  The outer perimeter was illuminated by lights(they might have been blue).  It hovered there for a bit then zoomed off at an extremely high rate of speed not seen by normal aircraft and disappeared.  A few minutes later, another one appeared, but this one was a bit further away.  The first one was almost directly over us.  I lived in the Kill Devil Hills section of this area, which might have been about milepost 9 or so.  The other interesting thing was the woman I lived with was holding her dog, a Yorkie terrier, and the dog looked in the direction of the craft and was growling, which was not normal behavior for the dog.  I was so excited the next day to watch the news as I was sure this event would be on it, but it was not.  I was terrified that night and did not sleep a wink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Perhaps younger.   I was playing in my room with my younger sister and wanted to suddenly glance out the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lean out of the window and glance up to see a giant triangular space craft.  It was the shape of what appeared to be an equilateral triangle.  On each point was a bright round light.  The part that may sound weird, is that it looked similar to that of the Borg ship in Star Trek.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The outside of it looked like that but in a triangular shape. It hovered low and silently.  It was moving from my left to right.  I can only guess North West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to see most of it pretty well because the moon was out that night and from what I remember, the skies were pretty clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled my self back in to tell my sister, but my family often made fun of me for liking the movie Mack n Me so they never believed me.  They thought I was making it up.  I never told anyone this since because to be honest it makes me sound like a lunatic.  I dont know why I wanted to suddenly research this years later, but I did.<n>

She was outside pointing to the sky and what I saw that evening has haunted me ever since.  A formation of a couple unidentified objects were flying or more like hovering in the low skyline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first my thought was I was watching a couple helicopters except there was absolutely no sound being emitted at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had a flare or bright slightly reddish exhaust in the rear except no smoke was coming out.  The exact shape is hard for me to remember but they were not overly large and had a shape unlike any I had ever seen in a military or domestic aircraft.  What I remember like it was yesterday, though is how the formation was too perfect and why was there no sound being emitted if they were so low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of my neighbors&#39; children started to yell UFO mom UFO&#39;s.  I looked at mom who was white as a ghost and at the same time we uttered to each other frigging UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our neighbors&#39; parents came outside and the father uttered holy shit!  What the hell are those.  The objects slowly and in perfect exact formation started to drift out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember wanting to call the police or the Air National Guard base to report this sighting, because it absolutely spooked the hell out of us, but I decided not to, out of fear of not being believed.<n>

7/1/92 01:00|Willsboro|NY|Fireball|30 minutes|It was basically a ball of pulsating light, there was no wings, no rotors, and discernable body or fuselage.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45259.html|35|ndxe199207| In the summer of 1992, two friends and I witnessed a UFO in Willsboro NY. My father owns a house on Lake Champlain in Willsboro bay. We were up at night sitting on the back deck of my fatherâ€™s boat house. It was a very quite and still night, there was a heavy overcast, but at a high altitude. I noticed what I thought was a plane at that time, flying across the sky from west to east, and at first I thought nothing of it. But it turned around and went back from east to west and behind the mountains there. The light came out again and flew the same pattern, going from east to west and then turning around. The third time it came out I took notice because I thought it odd that this, what I thought was a plane at that time, was flying in circles. I was aware that there was an air force fuel depot directly under where this object was flying. This is directly north of Skagarack Mountain on the shore of Lake Champlain. So I mentioned all this to the guys I was with and I think we thought it was a government plane and one of us came up with the idea to flash our flashlight at it. Immediately, a beam of light shown out of the object and illuminated the porch we were standing on to the point that when we turned around there our shadows were cast on the wall. The distance between the object and us at this point is approximately 1 to 1.5 miles and none of us were aware that a light could shine precisely on 3 people from that distance. This is the point that we all knew that something very abnormal was going on. We all became very alarmed at this and I remember that we began to tremble. The object then went west, behind Skagarack Mountain again, on the north side of the mountain. We thought that it may have left because it did not come out again moving east as it had before. So we were slightly relieved, that perhaps the air force was not after us. However, it came out from behind the Skagarack Mountain on the south side, north of Rattlesnake Mountain, this time a little closer to us. At this point it was going strait up and down, repeatedly coming from behind Skagarack Mountain, and each time it raised above the mountain, the beam of white light was painting us. It was almost as if it was playing a game with us. Then it flew over the mountain and started flying around the bay, and this is when we got a really good look at it. It was basically a ball of pulsating light, there was no wings, no rotors, and discernable body or fuselage. Just a pulsating light that would change colors constantly, as the colors changed, one color seemed to just meld in the next color, I remember it being mainly reddish orange. Perhaps the oddest thing was that it was absolutely silent, it made absolutely no noise at all. It moved well within the normal envelope of normal aircraft, there was nothing remarkable about how the thing moved. At this point a train was coming down the tracks on the opposite side of the bay from where we were, and the object immediately lost interest in us and painted its light on the train and followed it for a short time. Then it left the train, floated across the bay maybe .25 miles north of where we were and headed to the same side of shore that we were on. It disappeared behind the horizon there and at this point my friends and I ran around the front side of the house to find it but it was gone, and that was the last we saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
