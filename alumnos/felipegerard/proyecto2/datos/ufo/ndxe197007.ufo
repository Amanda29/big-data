As it rose higher that light became so bright it illuminated the whole valley. And it just hovered there and didn&#39;t move at all. All we seemed to be able to do was watch, suddenly the light dimmed and the disk suddenly shot off to the north and two other lights joined the ffirst and all three shot off and disappeared. After that episode my sisters and I spent many nights in our sleeping bags watching for ufos. These were not weather balloones as we were told by the military and police. We have seen to many unexplainable things to fall for that lie. This was just one of many encounters we&#39;ve had. And I truly believe these vessels were not of this world, at this time we did not have the technology.<n>

However, we post it, nevertheless.  Date is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bright light shining with 4 lizard-like beings approaching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Late at night in the mid-summer month of July I was awakened by a very intense bright light shining from the back side of the house that I grew up in.  I was accustumed to seeing bright head lights from the railroad trains as they approached my dads property from the town of Grand Blanc.  But, this time there was no deisel engines roaring and the light never faded as would when the trains passed by the property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see this really bright light coming from the other side of the house and in order to really see it I had to go down stairs and look out the back porch door.  When I did this I was so blinded by this light that I had to cover my eyes and that is when I saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A small group of four short, very stout, Dark-skinned, weird looking....almost a dark purple or navy blue color Lizard-like beings. It felt like a circus or carnival coming right at me,no! Coming for me! I freaked and went inside in a sort of strange dream-like panic and desperately needed to hide somewhere. I could not think and quickly just layed down on one of our families picnic benches that we used for feeding the large number of siblings that I grew up with. I tried to imagine that I was invisible and turned myself into a bench, for I was only 9 years old at the time. They came inside and as a group picked me up and carried me away. I was paralyzed by some kind of hand held instrument and it all just seemed like some sort of carnival-like dream. When I regained what I thought was my consciousness there I was laying on that bench still. It was just starting to turn a tad bit light outside and I went back upstairs and went back to sleep. Later that summer I started having night scares and an intense fear of sleeping in my own bedroom. I did everything I could to spend the rest of the summer at my nephews home; we were close in age and I simply had no recollection of this experience, until I was a teenager and started having this exact re-occuring dream. For the longest time that is what I considered it to be, just! a reall y strange dream. Until I saw the movie,&#34;communion&#34;! The creatures were just like the ones they described visually in that flick! And then many years later my sister told me she saw them carry me out the door. We both have had to deal with this peculiar sense of being abducted and violated through some vague sense that we suffered through some ordeal. I believe that they zap you with this instrument to prevent  terror shock from killing us! Realizing this has in no way made my life any easier. It has been a burden on my psyche and self will. There are/were peculiar psycological and behavioral problems that I feel have stemmed from this occurence/disturbance in my childhood. I would sleep under my bed, seizures from out of no-where. Doctors probed my brain to see if I had epilepsy. An asthmatic condition would strike if I was suddenly spooked or surprised. To this day I still struggle with what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I remember there had been talk of alot of sightings above the Meadowbrook Pkwy. on L.I. NY.  It was a little after 9p.m.  I was around 17 yrs. old, coming home from my p/t job.  I pulled up in my drive way, got out of my car and noticed a saucer shaped object with a row of lights just hovering above my house.  I looked at it for what seemed about 3 minutes - I got scared but no one was home to call to come outside and see what I saw. Quick as a flash it took off and was out of sight.  The next day I went to work &amp; told my co-workers what I had seen, supposedly alot of other people had seen it.  The explanation we heard was that it was a weather balloon. (I don&#39;t think so).  Has any one else seen that?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

7/20/70 19:00|Kindred|ND|Oval|10-15 min.|When I was six, my mom and I witnessed a large glowing orb that flew alongside our car.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18078.html|8|ndxe197007| When I was six, my mom and I witnessed a large glowing orb that flew alongside our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the summer of, I believe, 1970; I was six years old. My mother and I were driving home to Lidgerwood, in southeast ND, from Fargo.  We were driving down state highway 46.  I looked out the passenger window into a field and saw a large glowing light, moving silently throught the field, pacing the car.  I asked, &#34;Mom, what&#39;s that?&#34; At such a young age, I was merely curious, completely unafraid.  I had no idea what a UFO was.  When my mother looked over at the field and saw the object, she was visibly frightened, and punched the accelerator of the car.  I remember looking at the speedometer and noticing we were driving 85 m.ph., which confused me.  Seeing my mother frightened began to make me feel a bit scared, too, and I kept looking at this glowing object as it stayed with us, approximately 100 yards into the field.  As I was so young, and all of this is a bit foggy in my memory, I can only give rough estimates.  I would say that the object was perhaps 50-60 feet long, it was difficult to see how wide it was.  It glowed brightly, and made no sound.  After a bit, i seem to have fallen asleep, I really can&#39;t remember how it all ended.  All I know is that we arrived home safely, and whenever I have asked my mother about the incident, she is reluctant to talk about the sighting, usually dismissing it as swamp gas.  As an adult looking back at what I saw, I find it hard to believe that we witnessed swamp gas glwong and pacing our car at 85 m.p.h.  Somebody regress me!!!! I want to know what I saw!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were both in about the 5th and 6th grades at the time and of course no one ever believed us.there were no visible outlines, just a light that had been in the sky with all the other stars for the 2 or so hours that we lay there watching stars. That also ended our sleeping outside as we moved  indoors for the rest of the night. I have had a hard time sleeping under the stars ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My father was an U.S. Air Force officer stationed at Hickam AB in Hawaii.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my bed in our military base housing.  My room was off the kitchen and on the first floor. All other bedrooms were on second floor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, my room filled with a greenish/blue light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember feeling paralyzed.  Awake but unable to move. Could barely life my head and I saw a smallish creature, greenish or grey in color, standing at the foot of my bed.  It was definitely humanoid, two legs, two thin long arms, a large head with huge round dark eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t talk but communicated with me some other way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It told me to not be afraid. It just studied me.  At one point it communiciated something like &#34;You don&#39;t believe I&#39;m real?&#34; &#34;Here,&#34; it continued, &#34;touch me.&#34;  My inability to move was relaxed in on arm as it moved closer to me.  I lifted my hand and tried to touch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My finger seemed to go right through it&#39;s wrist or hand.  There was a membrane but gelatin-like flesh inside of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was something else, I recall that there were holes of some sort in its palms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s all I remember.  That paralysis occured on occasion during my teen years but no more visitations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was I abducted?  My father incidently was -according to family stories - involved in Blue Book. We lived at McChord AFB from 1962-1969.

I saw the following from the front of my tent while on a Boy Scout camp out at October Mountain in Western Massachusetts. The date and time information is only approximate since I didn&#39;t record that information at the time. However, the weather was calm and the night sky was clear. A white light came in from the horizon rather rapidly, however, no quicker than a jet. The light wasn&#39;t spectacular or anything; something you&#39;d expect from an aircraft. It then slowed down once above the camp area and continued along until it went out of site. There were no sounds heard from the object. A few minutes later, another light came in rapidly from the horizon just as the first. My first thought was that it was an Air Force interceptor investigating the original object. However, it gradually stopped and hovered above the camp area. It was fairly high up, perhaps 500 feet (it was difficult to know exactly). There were no sounds from this object as well. It hovered for a short while until the next event occurred. The original object came back from where it went out of site. It stopped and hovered fairly close to the most recent object; perhaps within 50-100 feet. This went on for about 20 seconds or so. The 2 objects then went off together and went out of site to where the first object did. About 5 minutes later, the two objects came back and hovered above the camp ground again. Suddenly, one object moved out of the way a bit and carefully adjusted it&#39;s position. It then accelerated vertically. I could follow it for about a second. Then it suddenly picked up tremendous speed and literally bolted into the heavens. At that moment, I knew I witnessed a very special technology in action. I didn&#39;t know what it was, but I knew it was very special. The other object went to the same takeoff position about 5 seconds later. It then took off in an identical fashion. I don&#39;t know what these objects were. However, I&#39;m glad I saw them and will never forget them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Met someone I vaguely knew from London who convinced me to come with him to a field close to the festival site to see something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We passed through one field to another where I saw a very large saucer shaped object. One moment I was standing in the field next to this person looking up at this object. The next thing I remember was being inside what looked like a suergical theatre on a bed or trolley unable to move or react being examined by unfamiliar beings who appeared to be carrying out what looked like surgical or medical procedures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later I found myself back in another field near the festival site feeling completely disorientated. The festival was over so I made my way back to London Much later I developed a cyst on the back of my neck which seemed to be infected. Eventually it settled down and I was left with a small lump on the back of my neck which is still there. There were also 2 symetrical marks on my abdomen near the spleen which now look like moles. At the time i did not think much of this nor associate it with what happened at the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However I have decided to have these investigated out by my doctor<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It struck me as very odd, because it looked just like someone had taken a translucent, plastic model of a plane and put a bright light inside it.  The whole craft was a distinct bright white color.  That was the part that seemed odd, since normally one only sees lights at the extremities of a plane.  I watched it travel from due south towards the southeast at a normal pace for a plane of that distance and altitude (it could have been higher than a mile). The shape was very distinct with wings and tail fins in normal proportions. As I was watching it and noticing how strange it was, all of a sudden it split in two from nose to tail fin and one half went towards the northwest and the other went towards the southwest.  The whole event probably took between a minute and two minutes.  After the object split, the two sections took off in their respective directions at an accelerated speed and were soon lost to sight.  I might not have reported this incident, since it happened so long ago, if I hadn&#39;t come across a similar event reported in this database from Lewiston, NY on 10/2/99 at 12:00.  In my sighting, the large wings were in the front, just like a real plane.  I also heard no sound (it was clear AND quiet).  Again, there was no vapor trail.  I&#39;ve told people about this for the last 30 years, and they all think I&#39;m nuts; it&#39;s nice to see that someone else has had almost the same experience!<n>

We were chatting with each other, singing songs, etc, and took no special notice of the night sky. After about an hour or so, after we had chatted and sung ourselves out, I layed back and was looking up at all the constellations. The big dipper was directly above me and I remember looking at it for about 5 minutes, not noticing anything odd, when all of a sudden one of the stars in its handle shot off at a high speed in an eastward direction, stopped, shot off again in a nothern direction and disappeared. Needless to say my neighbor and I were stunned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that amazes me to this day was how well the object disguised itself. I knew the big dipper handle only has three stars but I didn&#39;t think anything of the fourth because it was spaced perfectly between two others, was sized perfectly, and was twinkling like the other stars. Nothing looked unordinary until it took off. Til this day I like to think that it waited for me and my neighbor to look up and conentrate before it took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize that this may not even be labled a Close encounter of the first kind because no object shape, texture, etc. was visible. Still it changed my view of the universe and life in it forever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

There were, as it looked sparks falling off the retreating end and falling straght down toward the ground. The lights were of many colors. There was a background reference of a tree line. I was able to estimate the size. This object was 100-150 ft. long and 1/3 that length high. This experience happed a long time ago but is peminently etched in my mind. I witnessed this and it has bothered me ever since. The object made no other sounds it was not anything of this planet unless the government has such technology for antigravity! I am relectant to report this but maybe it is helpful. I do not want to be called nuts! From time to time I have wanted to tell the authorities but you can understand the fears. This is my brothers computer and came across your website. I am 46 years of age now and I am convinced of other technology. Is it ours? Or from somewhere else. My brother, mother and father saw me very disturbed after the sighting. This object now as I have understood the stealth technology, was similar to how the surface on this object would reflect radar. But in the year 1970-&#39;71?<n>

It was put there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After supper I decided to sit on the porch for a while. I was fussing with my hands or something and when I looek up, directly in front of me was an object. It was shaped like a child&#39;s &#34;spin top&#34; toy only flattend about halfway.  It appeared to be on solid ground and was appoximately 75 ft. away from me. There were lights in the center. Blue,Green,red and white lights. The appeared to be shining through these windows.  I kept looking at these windows as if expecting to see someone staring back at me.  There was no sound.  When I turned toward the front door and yelled for my sister to get the camera, it was gone. I did no see this object appear nor disappear.<n>

I remember it well.  One of those silent peaceful nights’s when everything is still.  You can hear the engines running out in the channel from the shrimp boats and the people talking along the shore who are getting ready to go flounder gigging.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rocked on the front porch of my grandmother&#39;s house, looking across the road at my home.  I could hear the clear call of the whippoorwill, in the woods behind my home.  A sound that is rare to hear.  “O” how so lonesome that sound makes you.  A sound that stir the soul of a man.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There had been sightings of strange lights in the sky over the outer banks by the local people of Carteret County, NC.  People had gather at Radio Island and were on top of the sand dome with their cameras and binocular.  Seen mostly by the night fishermen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People would say some things about it at the local grocery store, but just laugh it off.  They knew down deep it was best to be silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, I and another guy were taking a ride over in Gloucester, NC, on the Straits Road. Yes!  There is was over the road a bright white light with a round shape at the fork of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The passenger began losing the radio signal and was adjusting the radio station before he had looked up.  He began complaining about the radio signal.  I said with a loud voice, “radio” Look!  Then the auto wanted to cut off and I was doing all I could frantically trying to keep it running by pumping the excellator.  She is going to cut–off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The engine in auto had cut off, we where rolling toward it.  It was very bright white light round shape about 38 to 40 feet diameter and above the ground about 30 feet.  Yes!  Time had lapsed.  It was there in the sky and went up some.  Then I could hear the loud sound of jets engines getting closer as they approach.  The UFO took off, fast away.  I then saw the after burners kick in and the loud sound from the jet engines as they took off after it.  They were just above the tree tops, they were so low.  I started the car and though to myself.  I had to put the car in park to start it.  No conversation were said, to one another until the passenger said put me out at home. So I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also went home.  My mother said where have you been.  I just had a phone call from the USAF who wanted to talk to you.  For you to call them.  I said, I’m not, because I haven’t done anything wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left and went back and stop to a little service station called Fake’s Store.  I went in and asked Fake if he heard anything.  He said, know. I said, you didn’t hear the jets.  He said was that what that was.  I thought they were going to take the roof off the building but that was about 2 hour ago.  I said, no, it was about 15 minutes ago.  Well, he said, I’m getting ready to close.  You are closing early.  He said, there nothing wrong with my clock.  I step outside and looked at my watch and it was 2 hour behind.  I then began to get worried.  Could I have been abducted and have lost 2 hours of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went home again. My mother said the USAF called again and I told them what you said.  They told me to tell you that you better keep your mouth shut if you knew what was good for you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes!  I had to go back to the area of the sighting, me and the passenger.  We saw a farmer feeding his cows at a Troff.  We slow down and asked him if he saw anything.  He said I have seen you boys riding by here a lot.  Did you see anyone messing with my cows.  We said no.  The farmer said it was the most ungodly thing done to them cows.  Well, they paid me for them and I’m not supposed to talk about it.  As he was looking around to see if anyone was looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that farmer&#39;s yield he moved his cows out and let the growth of woods grow up around it.  There is now a tower at the corner of the field and the government moved all the, cows, and animals off the outer banks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later the passenger said.  You know if we talk about this, people will mark us and it might make it hard for us down the road.  I think it would be best just to be silent.<n>

Even after seeing something a little strange when I was a kid that I’ve never really been able to explain.   I think I was about 14 or 15 (it was a long time ago, maybe 1970 or 71).  It was mid-Summer in my home town, Lansing, Michigan, and my best friend and I were playing softball with some other kids at the neighborhood school ground.  When it started getting too dark for softball, we walked back to our street.  When we got to my house, the stars had just begun to come out.  I went in the house and grabbed a couple sodas and went back outside.   We both laid back on the grass of the front lawn next to the driveway, looking up into the sky.  At the same time, we both saw a stationary point of light that was a blue-green color.  It wasn’t overly bright, but it was larger than any &#34;star&#34; I had ever seen, so it was distinctly noticeable, yet it seemed to be way, way up there amongst all the other stars.  I would estimate (from memory) that a bee-bee held between the thumb and index finger at arm’s length would represent the visually perceived size of the object from the ground.  Anyhow, we watched it for maybe fifteen minutes.  During that time, it wasn’t doing much, other than pulsating slightly (twinkling).  Then, we started seeing faint orange glittery streaks of light shooting from it.   I remember saying something like, &#34;Woah!  Check that out!&#34; and my friend said, &#34;Yeah, man, I’m seein’ it too!&#34;  They were shooting out from the object in all directions, and each streak ended in a tiny white sparkle, except for some of them that seemed to be actually impacting smaller &#34;stars&#34; surrounding the object, as if it was shooting some sort of weapon at them.  To a couple of imaginative teenage boys, this was pretty exciting stuff.  But even then, I remember thinking, maybe it’s a satellite, or some other man-made spacecraft, and the streaks shooting from it are booster jets being used to man! euver the object or reposition its orbit.  If only I had a telescope.  The streaks were like fireworks right after they’re launched, when you can just make out a faint spark trail as they shoot through the sky before they explode.  In fact, the scene was kind of like a miniature version of the finale of a major fireworks display where they shoot off a whole mess of fireworks all at once.  This &#34;stellar battle&#34; lasted for another fifteen minutes or so, and then the thing simply blinked out.  Just like that.  It was gone.  We told everybody we knew about what we had seen, and I’m not sure who believed us and who didn’t.  Like I said at the beginning of this accounting, I’m a little skeptical about things like this.  I’ve always figured that what we saw probably has some perfectly normal, &#34;down-to-earth&#34; explanation. (Not that I have any clue what that might be.) (???)  Anybody else ever seen anything similar?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Around 1a.m. we noticed the street light from outside the east window was actually coming in through the south window. Like it wrapped around the house before it came in. When we looked out the east window we saw an object several feet high rounded on top but flat across the bottom floating along the ground moving between houses. I remember that Barbara and I looked at each other and then went into a type of trance. All I know is that some time passed. In the morning we woke up as though nothing had happened. We didn&#39;t speak of it at all until about a week later. All I said to her was,&#34;Did you...&#34; and she said ,&#34;yes.&#34; even before I said anything. We never spoke any more of it. All my life I have had encounters, but this seems to be the first so obvious one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seems to be a brief event in my conscious memory. Barbara and I were around 13 or 14 years old. What I wrote above is about all I can say about this particular incident, although I have had numerous other encounters. This is the only one that I am absolutely positive happened as there was another wittness, and I know what I saw.<n>

Speeding up, slowing down, turning 90 degrees in an instant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were coming home from a drive-in around 23:30 and there were alot of stars in the sky. I was 8 years old at the time but this has always stuck with me. I got out of the car and looked up at the stars when I noticed 1 light shooting across the sky from east to west very quickly then 2 other ones came up behind it like they were following the first. Back then I thought they were maybe playing tag. I asked my mom and dad what that was and they looked in awe then said probably a shooting star. But they kept watching. The first one slowed down made a sharp 90 degree turn very quickly to the south for about 1 or 2 seconds then made another 90 degree turn very quickly to the west. The other 2 lights chasing it did exactly the same thing. Like making the exact same movements as the first one by slowing down, speeding up and making the very sharp and quick turns. When all 3 were going west again they sped up and disappeared. Like someone shut off their light. They just had 1 bright light. I think this sighting stayed with me all these years because of how my parents just froze when they were watching them.<n>

IT WAS THEN THAT MY FRIGHT TURNED TO MORE ON THE TERRIFIED SIDE, AND I TURNED AROUND AND RAN HOME. I ALSO SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO &#34;FEEL&#34; THAT IT WAS THERE.  TO THIS DAY I FEEL SOMETHING ELSE MAY HAVE HAPPENED, BUT WHEN I REALLY CONCENTRATE AND TRY TO REMEMBER SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT THAT DAY, I START FEELING TO ANXIOUS.
