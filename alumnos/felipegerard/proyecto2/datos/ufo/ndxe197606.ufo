We heard a hum and when we looked up it came right over a big oak tree, right over our heads. It was very close. I continued in a straight line until it was out of sight. It was an unbelievable experience. There was a number of sightings called into the radio station that same night which is the only thing that saved our face among friends. We have no pictures. I am now able to come forth and I want to get this info out as much as possible. It was so close that there is not doubt what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now 50 years old and in the medical profession. My risk of family, friends and job did not allow me to come forward in an aggressive manner before. I feel that this information needs to be known. I have reported this to Mufon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He ran in; I saw, over to my left, about 6 feet away and about 8 or 9 feet up from the ground, an object shaped like 2 saucers put together (tops of saucers facing so that the object was widest in its center and the widest part was parallel with the ground).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out onto my small porch to look at it.  The object was about 2 feet in diameter.  Where the &#34;saucers&#34; were put together, a greenish light shone forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A beam of greenish light shot out and I felt myself immobilized.  At the same time, I felt a message (feeling, not words)of kindness and goodness transmitted, and I felt a love for the mind(s) that sent the message and smiled slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The beam scanned me from head to toe.  No memory of anything else....I guess I just went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange thing is, I had no memory of the event for several years....I don&#39;t know how long this amnesia lasted.  All I know is that at! some point the memory returned to me and that I still have it and remember it with very positive feelings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if it makes any difference, but I was about 25 years old and had had a tubal ligation a few months prior; so, was unable to conceive any more.<n>
6/30/76 21:15|Elmira Heights|NY|Circle|10-20MIN|Not dreaming becasue I went back to the same police officer|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50010.html|3|ndxe197606| Not dreaming becasue I went back to the same police officer<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time telling anyone about this event since the occurrence, except really really close friends.  What troubles me the most is the first time I saw the alien was at a very young age on my way home from school.  But the siting was while myself and two friends were on our way from elmira up the road through elm hghts to purchase beer.  I was 18 at the time and I am currently 48 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, as heading down the road(Iwasin the back seat leaning between the buckets) and this light in the sky was coming right towards us as if it were following the road. We immediately pulled over and got out of the car, there it was hovering above (bout 15 feet above) the telephone pole.  It zigged zagged acrossed the sky east to west 3 or 4 times like it was showing off or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then headed up the road the same direction we were going to travel.  As you probably can imagine we were yelling and screaming like three girls. ((deleted))  and the like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it traveled up the road it was like it wanted us to follow it cause the speed of this was never seen on this earth.  After about 1/4 mile we were at the Chemung County Fair grounds where we pulled over again and it hovered over us and just kinda like it was taunting us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My two friends stayed next to the car (as I recall)  I went into the road and was screaming to cars passing &#34;stop stop look up look up&#34;  people just looked at me like nothing was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This haunts me to this day cause I know they&#39;ll be back again soon it has been a while since the last time.  We went directly to the police dept in Horseheads to report this and the officer said &#34;go home and sleep it off boys&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted so bad to get some kind of evidence I called the local airport which is 10 minutes away and asked for the tower.  They said because of the low altitude they could not verify anything on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to fly over the tree tops then we lost site of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second part that is most troubling to me is a few years later I ask the one guy I was with &#34; hey remember when?&#34;  He had no recollection of the event even happening, this really really disturbs me.  I know I wasnt dreaming and I know we got that ((deleted)) beer after that had happened. I was ready to get lit then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I havent spoke to the third party in this event cause I was afraid too after what already occurred.  BTW_ NONE of the ((deleted)) pics match the craft &#34;WE&#34; saw.And the ((deleted)) aliens arent little gray men cause the ones that have visited me are 5 1/5 to 6 feet tall and are flatt black with no whites in thier eyes.  The one time they visited me I was able to take my right hand and pinch my left arm sooo hard there was a black and blue mark when I awoke.  I couldnt open my eyes or move anything else......no otherdrugs involved here.sooo those that don&#39;t believe will be the most surprised..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.

Numerous colored lights lighting in a rotating pattern.  The lights themselves DID NOT rotate.  There was no &#34;cockpit&#34; or area on the bottom to act as one like a blimp would have.  It was round and somewhat flat unlike a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my mother and aunt who where outside and they dismissed us.  It was grey and don&#39;t remember windows.  It was light out and very easy to see but nobody else saw it or said anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The sky was clear and the sun was bright.  My Father and I were leaving the house with shotguns and a dog to do some hunting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An awareness made me stop, turn around and look up.  A gold saucer was just sitting there in the sky.  I turned back around and then turned back again and it was still there. I turned to say somthing to my dad but looked back at the sky and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never mentioned it untill years later.  Years later (1978), I was in Salinas CA. at night, standing around a camp fire with four other people.  I seen a large saucer rise above the tree line just a hundred yards away.  The bottom rotated and had lights all the way around it.  The top part had lights also and it was as big as a football field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told the others around the fire pointing to it, everyone stood watching it as it hesitated moumentarly then quickly acelerated away into the sky.  Not one of us said a word about it to each other!  Like it had some kind of control over our minds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These are the two that I have seen in my lifetime.

Missile Combat Crew received alarms of possible tampering of launch facility and contacted security specialist topside to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two man alarm response team was dispatched and drove several miles to the launch facility.  Written procedures for the security team to follow for all alarms was to stop within a quarter mile and conduct visual recon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before arriving within a quarter of a mile the team reported a fiery orange red object over the launch facility.  Following their checklist the team leader drove up the access road while the member followed on foot behind the vehicle for cover.  They observed a classic gray alien standing with a rod in one hand outside the fenceline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Following their training the member immediately challenged the being with his M-16 rifle and the being pointed the rod at him emitting some type of discharge knocking him out.  After this the being and object departed the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon examination of the nuclear warhead by Air Force technicians it was discovered that the missile had been altered so it was not operational.  This account was published almost word for word in the National Inquirer but drew little attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this same time period there were numerous reports of UFO fly overs and landings near northern tier military installations but South Dakota drew little attention because it was not considered a northern tier base like Minot Air Force Base North Dakota.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the early 80s a reporter from the Inquirer returned to followup on this story with base personnel that may have had first hand knowledge of this incident.

I have finally contacted one other person who was with that night. Besides me, my sister, her friend, my then-fiance, and his buddy, I remember other people outside watching it as well. I was 18. Believe me, I could make a verrry long story out of this. I&#39;ll try not to. Here goes,...<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 26, 1976, I, my sister, her friend, my then-fiance, and his buddy, went to a wedding in Morhead, MN.  I just recently found out the exact date of the wedding.  I was thinking that it was in &#39;75.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So then I decided to try &#39;76, and whallah!!  Found the bride and groom&#39;s wed. lic.  I know it was that night because, we went over to Fargo, N.D., right across the river.  That&#39;s where we saw it.  A huge silvery disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered over us for about, and this is where the old memory would come in handy,..I can&#39;t remember exactly.  I just remember it hovering, and it had lights running clock-wise on it&#39;s edge.  Or rim,..the lights were all colors.  Red, blue, green, yellow, white, and for some reason I even remember a pink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so close!  I remember, as it was leaving, I believe, to the east, I saw the structure of it underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it sounds weird, but,I remember seeing like, rivets.  You probably won&#39;t publish this, I know I sound off the wall, but, after all these years, I just need to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have done research and noone has.  Maybe some else who was there, will see this, and come forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We saw a disk-shaped object come quite close to us. It was noiseless and hovered off to my left (I was on the passenger side of the car). At one point it started to descend and that is when the shape became apparent. It had a row of very bright white lights that revolved (or the ship did, this was unclear) which it turned on an off a few times. There was a (either blue or green, I believe green) stationary light on the top which stayed on at all times. After descending it went back to approximately its original position.This viewing lasted around 15-20 minutes. Then the craft moved off to the south very fast and stopped. I could only see the lights at this point. An air force jet came from west toward the craft and turned and went back. Then a jet came from the east and did the same. The two more jets came from other sides, one at a time, and turned away. Then a jet came from the west side again only it came closer to the craft than the others had. Immediately the craft moved incredibly fast to the east side of Phoenix. The jet followed, at a slower speed. Then the craft turned to the south slowly with the jet in pursuit. At this point all the white lights on the craft went out. Immediately the lights on the jet went out. They moved to the south . I could only see the blinking of the light on the top of the craft. When they got to south Phoenix the craft was no longer visible to me. I believe the jets lost it also. For the remainder of the movie (which was around 2 hours long the jets combed the south area. The sky was clear. The weather nice. I am bad with measurements but I believe the craft was about two blocks away and approximately 100 feet in diameter. The craft could hover, move incredibly fast, was noiseless, revolved (I believe), and the white lights were very bright. I am unsure of the color of the object as the lights were very bright but it also didn&#39;t seem to have a color as such. My friend saw it and was afraid it was going to land and didn&#39;t watch much of it. At one point I got out of the car to not only get a better look but hoped to attract attention to it. I mentioned to a couple in the next car but they did not seem interested. There were no reports in the paper or news. I did hear of a man (through friends) who saw it also across town but did not know him or get a name. I was 19 years old at the time and did not know the correct way to report this. Also my memory has faded to exact date and color of light on top of craft. But the rest is quite clear. I remember the movie name and hoped to check the running dates for the movie but I am sure the drive-in is closed by now. I am interested in finding more information about this sighting, if possible. I cannot be contacted collect by phone, as I do not have long distance service but would appreciate any info on this.<n>

My partner and I worked swing shifts most of our lives and would comute from Woodside, Ca. to Boulder Creek, Ca. every night for 20 years or so. Skyline Blvd is a road on the highest point of mountain range that divides the ocean from the bay area.  One can see both the ocean (Pescadaro beach [a few miles north of Santa Cruz, Ca.] to Halfmoon bay)and bay area (San Jose, Ca. to San Francisco on a clear night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> On our way home that morning on a beautiful clear nignt with the moon reflecting from the ocean and shining on the bay area, we saw a large amber ball of light rising from the ocean around Pescadero beach area about 15 miles from the top of the ridge (one can see the waves hit the beach) We were on Skyline Blvd around Palo Alto county. I told my partner to stop so we could observe this object.  He didn&#39;t want to, so I (as passanger) removed the car keys from ignition which made the car stop in a turn out with a clear view on both sides of the range.  This object came toward us about 200 yards away and appr. 100 feet above us and stopped.  Our Landcruiser had a spotlight on top of roof, so I signaled directly to this object &#34;SOS&#34; and this object would respond moving slowly up, down, sideways, diaganal, the return to it spot.  I repeated this signal many, many times and this large amber ball of light would respond the same way each time for about 15-30minutes.  Then all of a sudden it went straight up out of sight within a second leaving a com-trail.  Of course with no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have two more incidences which are very interesting around the same area if you are interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We noticed an object behind us in the sky and realized it was not a plane or helicopter.  We watched this object, and decided we would follow it.  We drove around the area as it moved around in approximately a 1 mile radius.  We then noticed it looked like it was on Pinewood Drive so we headed up the hill onto Pinewood.  At the top of the hill where the Leonard&#39;s lived at the time, there was a tree right beside their house on the right.  As we got to the top of the hill we observed a triangle shaped object, with lights in the shape similar to a Mercedes symbol flying right on/in the tree.

I was around 9 or 10 years old. It was a very dark night, with no moon in the sky, so the stars were very clear. I was living in the Eastern part of Washington state, which is largely farm land. I remember being called out of the house to come and see something. What I saw was several lights, about 7 or 8, moving around in the Eastern sky. They looked no different than the stars, except that they were moving. They floated around each other for awhile, then one or two of them would streak off and vanish, only to appear in the opposite direction from where it went. Sometimes the objects would merge, then spread out from each other. This went on for about 15 to 20 minutes, it could have been more. My father, who is a farmer, along with my mother, brother, and sister all saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/15/76 23:00|Drumright|OK|Unknown|15 minutes|Enormous Craft  over a mile in diameter, witnessed flying at night and low to the ground ......|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28138.html|22|ndxe197606| Enormous Craft  over a mile in diameter, witnessed flying at night and low to the ground ......<n> <n><n> <n><n> Late one night, while traveling to my wifes grandmothers house in Cleveland Oklahoma, we had an experience that has always dumbfounded us as to what we had actually experienced. As I mentioned earlier it was very late at night and we were traveling along some lonley dark stretches of highway, way off the beaten path as you might say..My wife was asleep in her seat across from me and I was listening to the radio with my window rolled part part way down so I wouldn&#39;t get sleepy...As I was driving I began to hear what sounded like a high pitched humming sound..I thought maybe I had a tire going flat so I slowed my speed down to about 45mph to see if the sound would degrade accordingly, but it didn&#39;t...regardless of my speed the sound remained constant in pitch and intensity...After a few minutes of hearing this sound I decided to pull my car over to the side of the road and do a visual check of my tires to be certain they were ok...With the car stopped and engine turned off I got out with a flashlight to have a look..my wife had woken up during this time and I had told her what I was doing..It was pitch black outside and the only light were my headlights and the stars above..The sound was still there and I asked my wife to get out of the car and see if we could determine where the sound was coming from, because it sounded like it was coming from everywhere...I decided to look up and this was when I noticed that some of the stars were being blocked out by something moving and the size of the leading edge of whatever this thing was , was un-believeable! Accordingly the stars were being blocked out to the east and west as far as we could see in either direction as the object moved to the north...The object had to be over a mile in width and length and low to the ground... After 10 minutes of watching this thing  the object finally completed moving over us, because we were finally able to see the stars re-appearing to the back of the craft. We continuously watched this black craft until we could no longer see! its out line in the stars or hear it.  The craft was moving very slow according to our perspective on the ground since the speed the stars were disappearing in front of the craft and re-appearing at the back of the craft was somewhat slow...At first we thought it was a blimp flying close to the ground but there were no lights at all on the craft, so we decided it wasn&#39;t a blimp..Having just gotten out of the Air Force after 4 years of service, I was pretty familiar with most of our military and civil aircraft at the time, but I had never seen anything like this before and believe me I had seen alot of weird things in and around the many air bases I was stationed at..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a non-radar tower.  The weather was, ceiling unlimited and visibility unlimited.  A very clear clean air night.  I was in the control tower alone.  There was no air traffic in the area.  Around 23:00 I observed a flash of light that lit up everything for miles around.  It was like someone shot off a giant flash strobe from a very high altitude.  The entire landscape lit up like daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around midnight another controller that was off duty came up to the tower with his girlfriend.  I started to tell him about the flash and he couldn&#39;t belive they saw the same thing at the same time.  However they were coming home from Cloudcroft and at the time of the flash they were below the caprock.  The caprock is a shelf of land about 30 miles west of the tower.  He had the same description that I had.  We talked about it and thought it could be something the U.S. Air Force was working on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just re-read your note and found that I did not answer all of your questions.  I was facing North in the control tower but the light lit up everything everywhere.  I lost touch with the other couple after the controller strike in 1981.  But they were driving East and would have been facing East.  They also said it lit up everything in every direction.  Hope this helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I am unsure if it was indeed 1976. It could have been 1975.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First off, I am a realist.  I don&#39;t fall easily into the ghost/UFO sighting scene, but I know what I saw and it was very unexplainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my bedroom at approx. 2245 hrs. and just laying in my bed looking out the window when up in the sky in a west southwest direction I observed what at first I thought was a possible satellite.  I was in Boy Scouts at the time and we would always point out a certain satellite that would bounce up and down and change colors.  This object did not change colors but was moving up,down, and back &amp; forth.  Then it raced away towards the North completely out of sight and at an unimaginable rate of speed, but within seconds came back to the approx. area in which it first was.  It then raced off again at an incredible speed and returned again, but this time it came back from a different angle.  Again, it raced off which looked to be a diagonal direction upwards but again to the North.  It never returned. I remained at the window for at least an hour just hoping it would return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next door neighbors were out of town visiting family in Topeka, Kansas. When they returned, I informed my friend what I had seen and overhearing me was her mother. She informed me that while they were in Topeka that some neighbors of their relatives also saw the exact same thing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now 43 years old and a Deputy Sheriff.  At the time, I was approx. 9-10 years old.  This sighting has always bothered me since that time.  I read all these fantastic reports and they sound really silly.  But what I saw was totally genuine and I would really like to know of similar reports of this sighting.  I can&#39;t be the only one that saw this.  If in Kansas it was also seen, then I would think many people also saw it.  I am very determined to investigate this occurance just to possibly get some answers.<n>
6/15/76 22:00|Simi Valley|CA|Circle|10 sec.ish|I can witness to the actual size of a craft|9/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25110.html|25|ndxe197606| I can witness to the actual size of a craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 36 now, but when I was about 10 years old I saw a disk shaped craft glide between my home and my neighbors home, it was under the roof lines of our homes, and it was in a school zone area close to the inner city so our homes were very close together (I can&#39;t remember the address, but the street was Ulysses Ave, or maybe St., the elementry school was a block away, and it was/is called Arrora Elem., and it is on the left hand side of the road from our house, our house was in the bend of the road from there)  My room was on the second floor, and the craft was directly left from my window.  My window was facing my back yard, and the craft glided between my home and my neighbors home which was to my left (so if my house was facing north, the craft was gliding south to north -- I never knew the exact direction my house was facing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember thinking that something unusual was happening, and I felt as if something was coming.  Then I heard a whorreling sound, and I pictured (in my mind) my father swinging a long thick metal chain, about 20 feet of chain swinging around and around, then I thought of a hellicopter.  I then felt paralized, not out of fear, but something else -- but it wasn&#39;t alarming.  I then realized that this sound couldn&#39;t possibly be made by my father or a hellicopter.  It would have had to be so big, and spinning so fast that no one could make this sound with a chain.  I was surprised that it didn&#39;t wake anyone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was then scared, and wanted to stay very still because I knew that this was something that I have never experienced before.  Then I was sweating and couldn&#39;t move or speak.  The whorreling sound got louder and louder to the point where I was so scared that all I could do was wished dearly for the sound to stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the sound stopped to nothing, and I became curious.  I was then able to get up and investigate what I had heard, but at the same time I knew that if I looked out my window that I would see what was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And I saw it, I only saw about 3/4 of it.  It was a flat disk, like a freesbe, but had a definit point at it circumfrence an gradually raised to a top that was circular too, that center was about 1/4 of the craft.  It was a very dark &#34;shiny&#34; pewter color.  I remember circular lines like a music record from the rim to the center.  It had lights around the outside of its rim.  I remember thinking that it reminded my of Chirstmas tree lights.  I can&#39;t tell you the colors to be exact, but all I can say is that I saw every color in dots around the circomfrence of the disk -- colors that I would see in Christmas lights.  For example, I am sure I saw blue, green, red, and white, but I can&#39;t picture that in my mind.  I can&#39;t picture those colors in my mind today, as I did the moment after it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered, actually it hovered and glided with out a noise, it was perfectly silent as it slowly passed in between and under both of our roof lines, between our homes, and towards the front of our houses.  I watched it in a noiseless controled motion hovering, but moving in a steady pace, pass between my home and our neighbor&#39;s home.  I was at complete amazement, and awe until it past from my sight.  I also remember thinking that this is something that was special and real to the point where I should say something about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I layed back down, as I was suppose to be sleeping.  I remember thinking that I was looking at something that wasn&#39;t anything I&#39;d ever seen, and thinking that I had just seen something that no one on earth could possibly have created.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then jumped up again with a start because I realized that I could run to the front of the house to see this again.  I hadn&#39;t seen the whole thing, and I was so curious.  But, there was also a weird feeling that made me feel as though it was gone before I could have gotten there to see it.  I still can&#39;t put that feeling in words, but it was just like when I knew something was coming and didn&#39;t get up to see what was coming and making that noise, but this time it was gone.  I still kick myself for that today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told myself that I would never speak of this because, no one whould believe me, and it was too strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few years latter, I realized that I knew how big this craft was, or how big it wasn&#39;t because it passed between our homes.  My experience was small compaired to the things I&#39;ve seen and heard, but my story has a size that I haven&#39;t seen, heard or read before, and I could share that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been wanting to share this for some time now.  I still can&#39;t explain it, and I am very curious.  I am also curious because after that when our dog had puppies, we found that all the water that pooled up in our fenced back yard was toxic somehow, and the puppies drank that water died.  I don&#39;t remember how the adults figured it out, but I remember thinking a few years later that it was because of what passed through our yard and between my neighbor&#39;s and our home that polluted that water, could be a coincidence -- I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another strange thing is that I feel that somehow I brought them here with my thoughts.  I can&#39;t recreate this, as I have tried out of curiosity. But, whatever it was, and however it came, is a mystery that is always there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve watched every show on this I could, and have read every book I can too.  There is just too much garbage to weed through, and I don&#39;t have the patience to keep up with it anymore, and haven&#39;t for years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to know what it was, and if that strange time in-between have anything to do with what we (my sister&#39;s) are going through now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d appreciate your contacting me if you have any information that will clear this up, or as I&#39;m sure you can&#39;t, maybe let me know that I am not alone in this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Close up view of Triangular shaped UFO -Spacecraft communicates by repeating light signals<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting happened 25 years ago.It was a unique experience because we had a very long and thorough look at the craft(s), in fact we communicated with one of them. It was at night, around 9:30 pm, and I was driving me and my boyfriend to a Bowling Alley in the neighboring town of Wyandotte.There were railroad tracks we had to cross, but a train was on the track, so I waited there in the distance for the train to end. My car was parked perpendicular to the train,normally,the cars would be facing the train, but since I saw it coming before I reached the tracks,I just stopped at the  street corner before the tracks.There was an empty field directly across from me, so I could watch the train go by over my left shoulder. We each commented on how long this train was.Then suddenly we saw 3 bright white lights following the train in the same direction as it was heading.We thought they were helicopters,but quick movements and darting about made us suspicion they were something else.It was as if these &#34;lights&#34; were playing a game of chicken with the train. We watched in awe when just as suddenly, 2 of the lights sharply turned upwards at a right angle and disappeared in a matter of seconds.Then only one light was left, which continued to follow above the train, turn, then loop back and forth.This last &#34;light&#34; was flying much lower now, and we could see that it was not a helicopter.Imagine our shock, when this &#34;light&#34; seemed to discover my car, all alone, waiting by the roadside.It stopped following the train, and promptly flew over to the field which my car was facing.It was hovering so low, we were able to get a perfect look at the &#34;light&#34;, which wasn&#39;t just a light, but a triangular shaped craft,dull silver in color.It sat in the air silently as we stared in amazement. None of the weeds in the field even moved.It was silent and almost perfectly flat.We were frantically searching for an engine, a cockpit window, or anything that would make sense and make it recognizable, but nothing could be found.Whatever was piloting this craft could not be seen.In front, which was facing us, was the bright white light we had seen chasing the train.On the other 2 points of the triangle,there were red lights,as if tailights on a car.This is where my sighting gets unusual.My boyfriend suggested I flash my headlights at this craft.Being directly across from me and approximately<n>

In my adult life I have heard people on TV and in articles describe what they have seen and I have never heard anyone describe one like I saw.  Then I just came across your site and database, and went through all the months and years of my childhood hoping to find something that has troubled me my whole life.  All of the sudden &#34;Disco&#34; I came across that blew my mind and is about exactly the right time of when I was a child that I may have seen this.  The thing that blew me away was his description of the ship...when he described it the hair on the back of my neck stood up.  It was the case reported on 6/15/76 in Smithtown New York.  I am almost certain we saw the same thing.  Is there a way for me to get in touch with this person and ask him more questions?  I mean to be alone with this! my whole life and find this is no way a coincidence.  What I really want to do is see if we can compare sketches of what we saw.  Please help me this is so important to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I need to tell you what happen to me as a child though because I probably have thought about it every day of my life.  It was somewhere between 9-11 pm...I don&#39;t know exactly what I was doing prior to going into the bathroom, but I went into the bathroom and was standing in front of the toilet.  Immediately to the right of the toilet is a window that you can freely look out.  I glanced out the window and was immediately captivated by what I saw.  Above the tree line was this craft hovering above the trees.  Around the bottom of the saucer was lights flashing in a sequence all around the bottom of it, lights going in circles.  These light panels so to speak were also windows.  In the center on the top was a cap that may have been clear.  I knew the second I saw it exactly what it was, which was a UFO.  I also knew deep down inside something was aware that I was watching it.  It wasn&#39;t a scary feeling of any type, but I knew someone was aware of me.  It mostly hovered the whol! e time in the same place.  I knew what I was looking at and was so excited that I ran into the living room and was screaming for my parents to come and look at this.  We ran back to the window for me to show him and I pointed out the window.  He was starring out the window going, &#34;where, where??&#34;  Here is the total bizarre thing...the UFO was sitting there as clear as can be and I am starring at this thing pointing and screaming at it and he just could not see it at all.  I also was then set in with a feeling that for whatever reason, it isn&#39;t possible for him to see what I can see.  As this was going on, I can still feel this really weird awareness.  This sense that they are aware of me, and I am aware of them, and at this time I am only able to see it.  I don&#39;t know how that is possible but as a child this was all crystal clear to me.  I also was aware that they were now leaving and I watched it slowly move away from me as it is leaving, again I had this awareness inside ! they were leaving and still can feel them watching me as they ! moved aw ay, and then there was just this sudden zip away from me and it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am going to try and explain one other thing that is probably going to sound absolutely nuts!  Truth is, from the time I saw the craft out the window, to the time I ran out for my parents, I really have no idea how long that time is.  It feels like it is only a moment, but something deep down inside me feels like it was actually a lot longer, but &#34;made&#34; to feel like a moment or two.  I feel like I just completely lost a sense for solid time during this period.  Even after the whole thing was over, I still had this feeling of &#34;lost time.&#34;  My memories feel fluid, but even today there is this feeling of lost time somewhere in there like something happen to me but I really have no idea what.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is something else that is very odd and probably completely off the wall.  I have no idea why I associate what I am going to say with the sighting but I have always wonder this my adult life.  I have also never told another soul this in the world because I would think somebody is completely nuts if they told me this.  Around the time of all this in my life I have noticed a little bump under my skin on my shin that&#39;s like a small pellet.  I didn&#39;t have any type of accident, there is no scar, no childhood accident that would of cause this but my whole adult life I have always felt that something was put there by them somehow.  I have no memory of anything like this at all happening surrounding the craft, but something sick in my stomach tells me otherwise.  One of these days I am going to get that thing cut out and find out exactly what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway...the report you have I am certain by his description of the craft that we witnessed the same thing.  Is there some way of digging a little deeper into this?  Oh...I don&#39;t want what I reported to be put out to the public...it&#39;s really embarrassing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

I clearly saw it move toward me and came within @ 100ft of my truck. I was shocked by the Size and Depth of this Formation. I have studied ufo&#39;s over the years and never seen anything remotely close to what this appeared as. The Size is what is Especially interesting. Having lived in a Farming area I&#39;m clear on distances. Even though this was at Night and it was Dark I know exactly where I was. The object was @ 50ft&gt; high and 1/4 mile long. There was an Airplane Hanger at the location and the Glow of  Light overcame the Hanger so it was not visible. The Hanger was @300 ft. from the road.  This Energy Wave followed me about I mile before disappearing. I remember being very scared as the size was Amazing. I was alone and very aware of the situation. I&#39;ve had other types of sightings  but nothing like this. Imagine a Red Energy Form Moving and this Large !It seemed intended for me?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It is similar to the sighting in Thousand Oaks posted for 1/15/76. Simi is just a few miles from Thousand Oaks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a warm evening, and I was out in the front yard with my parents. I was about 14. We were just sitting there talking and enjoying the evening. I was looking up at the sky and the stars and saw something in the sky to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll describe it as a light, because that is what it would most closely resemble. It was more like a grayer area of the sky, but translucent enough to see the stars through it. The frightening thing is that it was shaped like the typical &#34;devil face&#34; outline complete with horns and a grimacing mouth. At first we thought it was being projected by one of those big searchlights they used to use for grand openings, etc., but there was no beam of light visible coming up from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad was working for Rockwell at the time, but not up at Rocketdyne. He was trying to figure out what was causing this quite obvious shape in the sky, and was getting pretty upset. My mom was just quiet and looked scared. We watched it for about 20 minutes, and it never changed or moved in any way. I don&#39;t know what size it was, but it was bigger than my hand as I held it up .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for awhile and then went inside. I was assuming there was some logical explanation, and we would read about it in the paper the next day, but as far as I know, nobody else saw or reported it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even stranger, about a month or so later, I was outside with some friends at about the same time, and was telling them about what I had seen, and described the shape. One of my friends pointed up and said &#34;do you mean like that?&#34;....and there it was again, in the same place. We all watched it for a few minutes, and it gradually faded and was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only indication I have ever had that anyone else saw this was a drawing on the cover of a &#34;Weekly Reader&#34; type newspaper they used to hand out at school. The paper came out a year or so later, but had an article about UFO sightings, etc. inside. The cover drawing depicted a night sky with the exact same shape in it, and I believe whoever drew it must have seen the same thing as I did. It was accompanied by the caption &#34;Are We Alone?&#34; or something similar. I kept that copy for many years, but can no longer find it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe the poster from Thousand Oaks saw the same thing or something similar. I asked my parents about it a few years ago, but they don&#39;t remember it at all. Strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I looked up, and about 100 feet above me was a craft.  It was big enough that it was about all I could see.  It was silent. It had a row of orange rectangular windows/lights, all around the rim. The lights were taller than wider (on end). I took a few seconds to try to understand what I saw, and once I had made sure I was not looking at anything normal, I turned to my friends and said &#34;what is that?&#34;. As I turned to show them what I was asking about, it silently moved vertically, and then just zipped off. So quickly, that all they could say is &#34;what are you talking about?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It drives me crazy that I cannot verify this sighting. No one takes me seriously, yet I know what I saw. Anyone have any input?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

There was something huge and black in the cloud. I had a very uneasy feeling that I was being watched and a feeling of a low level electromagnetic anomaly<n> <n><n> <n><n> Actually I can&#39;t describe the feeling well, some form of energy surrounded the area where I was sitting in my car outside my home. I felt contacted by some force but no message or no control of me.  But the weirdest part is when I woke up the next morning my pillow was covered with blood but I had no injury or sign of nose bleed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing like this has happeneed before or since. Something very strange happened. I&#39;ve been afraid to tell anybody because I was afraid of a return of whatever it was. I realize this is not a very good report, but that is what happened. It is not a joke or hoax.<n>

It was a calm night with only occasional clouds. I was outside waiting for someone, when an object came over the house. there was no distinct noise, considering how low it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was round in shade, and had a row of lights around the base, the lights either rotated, or had a sequence of rotation. The object was travelling very slow, in an easterly direction out to sea. The house was situated 1 block away from the cliffs, which dropped to the ocean, so i was able to watch it travel for quite a distance out to sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It sped up a little, out to sea, then for reason changed it&#39;s course to a southerly, direction, and took off out of sight in a near verticle climb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has stayed with me for many years, and i can still remember the shape and coulur of the object. My two brothers had been outside with me, but i have never asked them if they had seen it also. Probably for fear of being laughed at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I along with my mother, who passed away 1998, saw an odd black shape,  during a bright mostly clear day about 5 pm 1976, at least our vision of the item was not obstructed by clouds etc.   We both saw the shape defined below at a lower altitude then raise directly overhead until object was out of site.  The item appeared black in color.  the center of the object was shaped similar to a cigar HOWEVER there were two intersecting black lines.  Best way to describe for shape description.  Draw a 2 inch cigar shape..  Then move in 1/2 inch from each side and center a 1 inch cigar shape crossing he center, or may I say perpendicular to the center line.  I use the 2 inch description because that is the size it appeared in the sky.  I estimate this item to have been about 2000 feet up (I base this altitude estimate on my current perception of my past memory from 1976 and my! skydiving experiences in the mid 90&#39;s when I was fairly good at estimating height of clouds).  I may be incorrect on the altitude however the shape is still vivid in my mind.<n>

6/15/76 13:00|Winchester|MA|Circle|5 minutes|IT WAS SHOCKINGLY ENORMOUS|5/27/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28794.html|40|ndxe197606| IT WAS SHOCKINGLY ENORMOUS<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t recall the exact year, but It had to be between 1975-1978..I was about 13 and younger brother around 10.  We lived in a quiet suburb in massachusettts.  While driving home one evening with my dad driving and mom in front, we all saw a UFO.  It happened that whihle mom n dad talked away in front, I noticed first off that my lil brother looked &#34;stupid&#34;. I would have automatically thought he was making that face on purpose as we always joked around as kids do, but my immediate instinct (and i get goosebumps now at 39) was something is very wrong! All in a second it seemed..I grabbed his arm and shook him yelling his name, my mom turned around of course and is when she swore and yelled to my father to &#34;step on it&#34;! I looked behind us and there indeed was a hughe circular ufo with lights all around it..hovering behind us. I was screaming to my brother who seemed to be in a trance like, and I knew intuitively to not &#34;let them get em&#34;, and kept shaking him. This I now beleive is what others refer to as electomagnetic.. My dad did step on it, but I never realized to now, I don&#39;t remember the rest of the ride home. This thing was huge! It didn&#39;t make a sound. My brother was ok and &#34;woke up&#34; at home..and we&#39;ve never forgotten that. My mom phone Logan International Airport to report this..she was a complete wreck, and turned out many many ppl did report the same, from the same area.  I am a beleiver...for sure.  Turns out a few weeks after that I&#39;d gonen to a sleep over at a girlfriends house and we all decided to go outdoors and as late around 1pm i think. We laid on the grass in her yard, and talked away bout things in young girls lives.  Out of nowhere above us, were many, I would have to say eight ufo&#39;s..dangling..jetting very fast and rapidly appearing and disappearing, but above us.  When we noticed this we all were shocked and ran as fast as we could inside screaming. I don&#39;t know or recall if anyone reported that from that evening, but was shortly after my fist sighting. I couldnt h! elp wonder and still do sometimes, if it was directly related to me for having been witness to the earlier sighting, and I was being &#34;followed&#34;. I didn&#39;t talk to much bout it to my friends, was embarrassed. I am a believer for sure...I can&#39;t speak to any long term effects this has had on myself and family, especialy my brother who is now 36, but I know he prefers not talking about it. I have shared this story with my daughter and other relatives, but I certainly do think it&#39;s worth reporting...back in those days we didn&#39;t have online accessibility, or the open minded approach to this issue of UFO&#39;s that we do now.…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1976 is approximate.

I was it first and called out to my mother, brothers and sisters and a couple of neighbors to see the cigar/oblong shaped black/dark object just sitting still in the sky.  It was close enough that if it were a helicopter we would have heard the blades.  It preformed several fast short movements in different directions, returning to the same position.  Then it shot to the right and out of sight for several seconds and returned, the speed was to fast for a helicopter or a plane.  It stayed for only a couple of seconds more before it left and did not return.  At the time I was a teenager in highschool, my mom a wiatress.  I have not seen any other UFO&#39;s since. We are all sound of mind, no history of mental illness and above average intellegence (at least my family).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

My brother and I were sleeping outside in my parents back yard on a couple of hospital beds. My dog woke me up whining and jumping trying to get up onto the bed.  The dog then looked up at the sky, yelped and ran for her dog box on the porch and jumped inside. I looked up to see what had bothered the dog and there was a huge craft that at first I thought was a dirigible. The sun was just coming up to the east over the Sierra Nevada&#39;s and I was facing west where the object was. The first rays of the sun were being reflected by the shiny metal skin. The object was about very low---probably no more than 1,000 feet high. It looked like an old dirigible without the basket under it. The craft appeared to have five tail &#39;fins&#39;, again no basket under it and no markings. It made a low, grumbling noise like a jet plane sounds at some distance away--but steady, no undulations or variations in the sounds.  I would estimate the length at about 400 feet, and the diameter about 100 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, my brother and I are just gaping at this huge object that is gliding ever so slowly over the next door neighbors pasture. I decide to run in to wake up my parents-- who refuse to believe what I&#39;m telling them is outside. I run back outside and just get out the back door and my brother is telling me &#39;hurry up---it&#39;s starting to really move!&#39;.  I run out in time to see the thing accelerate at an incredible rate (without any change in the sound) going west, and just wink out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought then, and I still do, that the object behaved as if it were lost.  It acted as though it popped into existence to check its&#39; bearings and then took off again. It&#39;s the only UFO I&#39;ve ever seen...…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We had lived there maybe a month or so. I wanted to finish high school at Tyee Senior High instead of changing schools so my stepdad who worked at Mc Donald Crane in Kent would drive me to a friend&#39;s house during the week who lived on 188th and Pacific Hwy South (Sea-Tac International Airport across the street and Boeing Field is nearby too) and we&#39;d walk to school. It was nearing the end of the school year and was a  bright, sunny morning with no clouds in the sky around 6:30am. It was so bright that I could easily see in the truck and was doing my homework that I hadn&#39;t done the previous evening. There is a large clearing on the left coming down Hwy 410 out of Bonney Lake heading down into Sumner (near the Winery), which overlooks the Sumner valley, and some of Puyallup (Tacoma can be seen off in the distance). I&#39;m engrossed in my homework and suddenly my stepdad (who doesn&#39;t believe in many things, especially UFO&#39;s) very calmly turns his head towards my direction and says, &#34;(my name), Look at that UFO&#34;. He turns his head forward again to look out the windshield and never looked back at the UFO or me and neither of us said another word all the way to my friend&#39;s apartment. I raised my head and looked at him. Outside his driver side window (within the frame of it)was a UFO - the classic shaped kind that looked like two silverish grey plates inverted on top of each other. There was a dome on the top that looked like cloudy thick/heavy plastic. Underneath the dome where it met with the top portion of the saucer were big round bright white lights that were like strobes. They were blinking white or seemed to be rotating around it. I heard a whirring type noise but was unsure if it was the sound the extremely long antenna was making in the wind or if it was coming from the craft. I think my jaw dropped and I was completely awed! Didn&#39;t think to look around and see if anyone was looking because I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it. It stayed visually within his driver side window all the way down near the River Grove apartments..it sped up out of the window frame and was directly above the apartments when it suddenly got a little fuzzy looking and completely vanished-quic! kly! I w as so amazed, happy but confused too by my stepdad&#39;s reaction. Couldn&#39;t wait to get to school and tell everybody what I seen but I think only 2 people half-way believed me. I didn&#39;t know where to report the sighting but KISW had a number to call. Was interested if anyone else had seen it but procrastinated too long and never did it. That incident put me on a quest that I am still journeying - I felt &#34;special&#34; and extremely happy that I got to see it. The experience and everything I have learned on my journey has enlightend my spirituality. Throughout my life I&#39;ve had many strange occurences happen, not only lights in the sky, a very impressive encounter in Olalla, along but other types of paranormal activities as well. It took me nearly 15 years before I ever mentioned the incident again to my stepdad due to the weird reaction of his that morning and becuase he is so opinionated and closed minded about things I&#39;ve experienced or believe in - thought he would explain it away and ruin my thrill. But when I did finally ask him many years later what we saw that morning, he laughed and said, &#34;(my name, I don&#39;t know what that was)! His statement surprised me but reassured me that we had seen something very extraordinary - HOWEVER, whenever I bring it up to people in front of him, his standard answer then and now is that the craft was a jet and I&#39;m crazy!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a clear night and at first glance I thought it was either an airplane, or better yet, maybe a satellite passing overhead.  It was neither.  It was a tiny dot of medium brightness that moved rather quickly, in a straight line, for a seemingly short distance before coming to an abrupt halt.  It remained stationary for 1-2 seconds, then darted off in a direction close to that in which I first saw it move from.  There was no accelleration.  It went from nothing to all out speed instantly, then once aqain stopped suddenly and remained motionless for another second or two.  This display of short bursts of speed, in different directions, followed by abrupt stops continued for maybe fifteen seconds, give or take, then the little dancing dot zipped away and vanished, looking somewhat like a meteor.  While this was going on, I asked if anyone saw what I was seeing, but there was no answer.  They were sound asleep.  The next morning, I told them about what I saw... and it took me quite a while to live it down.  Should have kept my mouth shut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea of the size or shape.  It was the same color and intensity as a high flying aircraft&#39;s white tail light, or a satellite.  It blended in well with the stars and I&#39;d have not even noticed it, at all, had I not happened to be looking up, in the right place, at just the right time.  If I were to hold a ruler out at arms length, while this object was darting around, it would have been viewed as performing all of its maneuvers within about a two inch square window before &#39;zipping&#39; away and vanishing.  Not very spectacular, but noteworthy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/15/76 02:00|Odessa|TX|Disk|45 min|In the summer of 1975 or 76 I had just gotten off work around 2:00 am. Went home and got into bed with my wife. I was lying there liste|2/22/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21679.html|49|ndxe197606| In the summer of 1975 or 76 I had just gotten off work around 2:00 am. Went home and got into bed with my wife. I was lying there listening to the radio when the disc jocky made a comment about a phone call of someone reporting a ufo around one of the parks that we lived close to. This stured my interest so I got out of bed and went into the front yard which faced the park in reference. At first look i only saw a light that appeared to be a bright star but of a bluewhite color. After several minutes of watching this one light which was constant, I noticed that it was moving in my direction, slowly. I would est. at this point it was about 300 to 500 ft. off the gound. Distance from the object to myself as a bullet would travel, I would say 1000 yards. It was northwest of my positon moving very slowly to the east. When it reached about 500 yards away it stoped, alt. was still the same. At this point I could make out a &#34;disc&#34; shape. Being in awh, I ran inside to wake my wife. At first she thought i had been drinking, but i was able to convince her to come and look. When we returned to the front yard I noticd that the object had begun to move in a southerly direction at a low rate of speed, estimated to be 5-10 mph. It continued to travel to the south until it&#39;s position was about 200 yards south of my front door which faced due west. It stopped again for several minutes then began to move north at the same rate of speed,  It traveled about 400 yards to the north and stopped again. It made the same trip again but stoping due west of my front yard, &#34;about half way of the trip it just made&#34;. This put it directly it front of me. My wife was shouting to get back in the house because the shape of the object was deffinetly clear at this point &#34;disc&#34;. It had one light on it which was on the bottom midship. It stayed at this position for quiet sometime. I had gone inside to get my deer rifle to use the scope for better vision, didnt work to good so i got my binoculars, this gave me much better vision of the ! object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say it was approx. 25&#39;-30&#39; in dia. disc shaped and appeared to have a port hole or window on the upper side of the object. What I didnt notice that it now was about 200 ft. of the ground moving straight toward me, its speed had slowed to only several mph. Its skin appeared to be metalic with a very low luster, it appeared to absorbe light rather than reflect it. There was absolutely no noise, no visual signs of proplusion,prop,engines, exhaust etc. No rotor blades, no vertical or horizonal stabelizers. To put it bluntly it was a flying saucer perfectly still 200 ft. over my house at 3:00am in the morning. At this point my wife totally lost it running back into the house. I was able to get her back out in the front yard to help me with the id so we wouldnt forget anything. After 10 min or so it began to move to the east again straight over my house, when it passed over us looking straight up at the object we felt a little sick to our stomachs and we felt like we were in a vaccuum. As it passed over our house we ran through the house into the back yard to continue watching. It continued for about 400 yards at this slow rate of speed when all of a sudden its speed went from a few mph to an unadentified speed which I can only relate to that of a meteror, tail and all. It traveled straight for a sec then started in an upward motion at about 45 deg. heading straight up then disappearing into the clouds. No noise, no light other than the one i have explained did we observe. The next day or two someone called the local newspaper and reported seeing the object at the park close to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We keep looking and there is came from the middle of the sky doing moves like it was playing in the sky. It was very fast, then it returns to where we first saw it. Then it stayed there. Some people said  the paper said other people had see it. The goverment was saying it was planets, It was the way the sun was reflecting. I say no way!

This was in the countryside, very dark, with a great view of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at my brother-in-law&#39;s house helping him work on his drag-racing car. I left about 11:00 P.M. My home was about 150 yards from his. I got about halfway across his yard,almost in mine and I stopped to relieve myself. It was so pretty out, I was looking around while I was doing my business.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my head to the right and saw something I&#39;ll never forget.  It was hovering about 100 feet off the ground, not making a sound. It was oval  shaped and had lights that were all the way across it.  They were not going off and on but dimming and brightening. I stood there for about 15 seconds and thought about my brother-in-law. I called him and he came out wanting to know what was wrong and I told him to look and he couldn&#39;t believe it.  He said, &#34;What is that&#34;?  We stood there probably 30 sec. or more looking at it and all of a sudden it went straight up at a speed of nothing like on this planet, to an altitude to where it was about the size of my fingernail.  The object didn&#39;t make a sound and it stopped dead still and sat there about 5 sec. and made a 90 degree left turn and went about a half mile and dead stopped again.  It sat there about 10 sec. and made a 90 degree to the right. This time it went over the trees into the horizon and we never saw it again.  My brother-in-law wanted to get in the car and chase it but I told him it was probably long gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is nothing man made, to my knowledge, that can travel that fast, hover without making a sound and stop dead still when it stops.  All of this lasted, maybe, 3 or4 minutes but it seemed like a lot longer. I didn&#39;t tell many people because I thought they would just laugh.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then, my brother-in-law has passed away and I&#39;ve wished a thousand times I would have told the authorities and tried to find out what it was.  I&#39;ve heard many stories similar to mine through the years. I&#39;ve thought about being hypnotized to relive the experience.

I finally got up to take a look outside and saw a beautiful blue ball of light just above the ground in my yard.   It didn’t have a definite shape, just a soft glow of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it for only about four or five seconds but that was long enough then it just disappeared.   My little dog was with me and we went back inside and went to bed but I didn’t sleep much that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I called the television stations to see if anything had been reported but they said no and I wouldn’t give them my name.  I’ve only told a few people about this because it makes no sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived in the country where there weren’t any lights so it couldn’t have been any kind of reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I went out to look at the place where the blue ball had been and my little dog ran over to sniff the ground.  I wasn’t dreaming and I don’t drink.  This has puzzled me for many years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

My best friend an I were on out way back to Steptoe, WA, from St .John, WA.  This a paved road, but in the middle of farm land.  Very little traffic at that time, which we were driving it, 11 at night on a week day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I notice what I thought was nothing more than an plane about five minutes into the twenty minute drive.  Then this plane just started jumping around in the sky still a long distant from where we were..  I brought this to the attention to my buddy and we kept driving toward it, About to our destination, this damn thing jumped right above us.  All I can remember is a bright  white light.  The stereo was blasting before then the light and silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I recall was sitting in my car off the road, nothing  worked.  Luck would have it, my buddy had an aunt that was very close  to where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We knocked on her door for ever before she finely opened it up.  The first thing out of her mouth was I thought you were the UFO’s.  She then let us in she offered ed us a coup of coffee, we sat down and said nothing for about an hour. just sat there drank out coffee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pretty soon her husband got home and asked what was up. I  told him my car won’t start. we then got to my car and it fired right up.  It wasn’t until then I notice that i was almost light out. We had lost at least four hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were so shook up got home and loaded all out firearms as if that would do any good. sat there until the air force started flying the area not normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK thin in 1990 I was sitting home thinking about space travel, lets just say my life was impacted by that encounter even though time had passed I still thought about it a lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden I got what I would describe as a download of information so intense that it rendered my parallelized for about four hours.  I begged for it to stop and it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now wish I had been strong enough to endure it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember very little of what I have stored in my brain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would under the right circumstance be willing to be hypnotized just to know what I know.<n>

On a trip back from Wva to Florida, I was returning from seeing my mom in the hospital in WVa., it was late at night probably around 11pm while driving back through Alabama/Tennessee going south on the interstate highway I-65. What occurred was that an extremely bright light that reminded me of a locomotive train light appeared just behind me about 50yds quite suddenly and it followed me at the same pace I was driving around 60 mph, its movement was so strange because it didn’t fluxuate with the contour of the road and I took notice there was no sound as if a helicopter. I wanted to alert my wife who was sleeping beside me in the car but I felt controlled as if in a trance or some hypnotic mind control so I kept my head straight ahead or forced, whatever, I even tried to take my foot off of the accelerator, tried to wake my wife but the only thing I could do was use my eyes to look in the forward direction and glance as well at the rear view mirror from time to time or maybe most of the time to keep track of its movements or was this what I was supposed to do, who knows, last of all I also noticed my palms were sweaty on the steering wheel but I couldn’t take them off to wipe them. It seemed like for hours this occurrence was happening or maybe time was standing still or whatever I don’t really know. I took notice as well, there were no cars in either direction the total time this was occurring, nothing seemed to be happening until this thing was gone and how did it go away well, Poof the light was gone is the only explanation I can come up with. When I was able to make movements with my body the first thing I did was move my head then wipe my hands off then I stopped the car on the side of the road got out and looked all around including the night sky, this caused my wife to wake and you can only imagine what she thought and said when I told her of this occurrence, finally I noticed life and back to the now time zone cars drove past in both di! rections , so tell me did my time stop or what, now doesn’t this event seem strange to you but anyway the years have passed and from time to time I try to take myself back to those memories and ask myself, why me. I have never felt comfortable talking about this subject, even to this day, but it seems like a lot of people are coming forward so why not me. I have had many reoccurring dreams which started from my early teens of flying in some sort of craft and I remember always looking down at the terrain and cities as we were moving and I distinctly remember being asked if I wanted my family to go and I always said no only because either I feared for their safety or maybe I knew it was not my choice to make or maybe I thought I was never going to return again, who knows.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were other reports on the event, but I have not located them yet.  The event took place in Newark Ohio accross the street from the OSU newark campus.  My Grandmother had gone to her room to change for bed.  A very bright light in the sky caught her attention.  Grandma watched the light for a few minutes and suddenly the light came right at the house.  I remember hearing Grandma scream.  My Grandfather, my Mother and I ran to her room.  She was staring out the window and told us to look.  There was a huge craft hovering over our house.  We were stunned.  Eventually the craft slowly started to drift to the back of the house.  We ran out the back door and watched the craft slowly move over our yard over the tree tops.  This thing was as big as many houses, made no noise, had lights around the edge and it was so close we felt you could have thrown a baseball and hit it.  We are no longer doubters.  We didn&#39;t see a flash, a blur, a light, we saw the craft up close and personal.  I remember there were other sittings reported the next day but I have not been able to locate them on the internet yet.  I am heading to the Libray soon to see if it was reported in the Advocate the next day.  I believe it was and by many.  Still researching!!!  I want to get the exact date and time...I will correct it when I get the info.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/1/76 22:00|Gresham|OR|Changing|30 minutes|We saw "it"  and got the hell out of there!  We then came back.......and so dit it!|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33980.html|67|ndxe197606| We saw &#34;it&#34;  and got the hell out of there!  We then came back.......and so dit it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just out of high school four of us friends went to a undeveloped area high on a hill, just south of gresham Or. We liked this place because of the view of the valley, and the fact that we could recieve our favorite radio stations (because of the elevation) much better. On this particular night we were just talking &amp; happy it was a weekend night &amp; that we could stay out late etc. (back then &#34;kid&#39;s had a curfew). All of a sudden the &#34;atmosphere&#34; changed. I dont know how to explain it other than to recall how all of a sudden we were all quiet and uncomfortable....about something. After a minute or two I saw a dim white light shinning towards us (or at least visible to us) coming from a ridge about 150-200 yards away, and probably 200 feet higher in elevation than where our car (a 1968 Chrysler 300 2 door) was parked. This light slowly started moving from the east to the south on somewhat of a semi-circular path. All 4 of us were discusing, as this was happening, how there were no road&#39;s or path&#39;s in the area that this light (if it were a person w/flashlight, or motor vehicle)could of been traversing. It(the light) seemed to be demanding all of our attention, and we were all (as I learned later) experiencing a sense of &#34;fear&#34; about this thing. We were in a place which we knew extremely well, with regard to the terain, and the proximity of this moving light, and there was no explination we could contrive in our mind&#39;s, either individually or collectively, that could explain it&#39;s movement. The &#34;light&#34; continued on it&#39;s path moving from where it started (in full view of the passenger side of our car) to a point south, almost directly behind our car (about 200-300 yard&#39;s) Everyone in the car had to turn totally around and now view this thing out of the large rear window of the car. The light started to fade out and disappeared all together for about 10 seconds. When it reappeared it was much closer to our position than it had been before. It started to fade again, then went out all together (aga! in) After a few seconds it reappeared and it was much closer to the car (again) and probably only 50 yards away. It started to fade again, and I yelled at the driver to start the car and get the *$%#&amp; out of there NOW! I just knew that when it reappeared again, it&#39;d be right on top of us! We shot down the very steep gravel road at probably 50 m.p.h., and had to stop at the bottom to make a turn and go back to &#34;Downtown&#34; Gresham. We did go back and told a couple other people we knew about what happened, and they wanted to go back up there right away! Two of the people on the first trip had to go home, but My next door neighbor (who was there with me the first time....about 30 minutes earlier now), and myself, rode back up with &#34;Duane &amp; Jim&#34; in Duanes 1963 corvair. On the way up to the hill we told them in detail what we saw, and instead of questioning us or expressing any doubt, they seemed to be uncharacteristically quiet &amp; apprehensive. When we got near to the base of the gravel road, after about a 10 minute ride, there were Two police car&#39;s parked face to face in the middle of the little country road that intersected with the road that went up the hill.They were about 50 feet from where we had to turn. The strangest thing happened. both of their dome lights were on, as were the red flashing lights on top of their car&#39;s (no blue lights back then!) The policemen, one in each car, were simply staring straight ahead, &amp; not even moving, or looking at our car which literely had to slow to about one mile per hour, and pass within 3-4 inches of their car&#39;s to avoid going off in the ditch on our side! Why didnt the police move? Why didnt they even look at us? Sitting in the corvair, passing them, we were only 4-5 feet from where they sat in their own car&#39;s! We could see their expressions! Nothing!! We turned and went back up the hill &amp; talked for maybe a half hour about what the police could of been doing and exactly where we had seen the lights earlier that night. Everything seemed &#34;normal&#34; there, and maybe du! e to the fact that &#34;Duane &amp; Jim&#34; hadnt been there earlier, they were starting to joke around &amp; talk about other thing&#39;s. After another 10-15 minutes, I got what I can only describe as a terrible feeling of &#34;being watched&#34; Things were immediately different, because before I said a word Duane (the driver) said &#34;let&#39;s go&#34;, and &#34;Larry&#34; (my neighbor) who was there before, looked at me with a &#34;really bad look&#34; in his eyes. I remember saying out loud &#34;Wait&#34; &#34;It is back&#34;. After only a few seconds a large bluish white &#34;orb&#34; with an orangish colored &#34;fog&#34; around it flew from down the hill closer to where the police car&#39;s were, to directly above the corvair! I remember in detail looking at it above the car (maybe 25-50 ft.) with my head out the passenger window! We all saw it! After what seemed like only a couple seconds it was just gone! I dont know where or what direction it went, it was just out of there. We went down the hill, found that the police cars had left, and drove back into downtown Gresham. It was very strange how none of us were scared, we just seemed to accept what we saw, and decided that we had a special experience of some sort, and wouldnt mention it to the police or newspapers etc. Not even to other people we knew. The experience seemed like it affected us all on some sort of energy level. I guess I have had many thoughts, since that time that MUCH MORE than a couple seconds were spent underneath that thing, but have never persued any sort of hypnosis or regression therapy to try &amp; find out what really occured. I just &#34;know&#34; in my mind (as do the others that were there) that much more happened that night than we are able to report. Maybe someday I will remember those missing part&#39;s! These thing&#39;s are very real!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

When I was growing up I lived with my parents in the countryside in South East Kent, near to woods and with very few neighbours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was about 19 -20 years old I was seeing my friend and neighbour (same age) to the door as she was about to go home.  She lived about 200 yards along the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stood in the doorway I saw a classic shaped craft emerging from the woods, low flying, just seeming to skim the tops of an avenue of trees lining a lane about 200 yards from my house. The craft followed the lane towards a big house (a sort of minor stately house) where a Justice of the Peace lived on her own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was about the size of a small normal plane I would guess, completely silent, flying slowly and carefully, and as I said before, a classic saucer shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t  remember the colour of the lights –  but I later described the lights around the base of the craft as ‘disco’ light (showing my age now) the lights seemed to pulse on and off in sequence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just above the stately house (which is hidden by trees) was a very bright light. It immediately made me think of the Star of Bethlehem as it is depicted in children’s Bible story pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft seemed to join up or merge with the light and the light seemed to grow and pulse with a surge of power (as if it was taking a big breath) before it flew off upwards and across the sky. When the craft merged with the light I could no longer see the craft – just the light.  It moved so fast it was hard to follow it with my eyes. Also it did not fly across the sky as a normal plane would but across and up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also tried to signal to it, by turning the outside light on and off. (not sure why I did that).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later I found out that the lady who owned the house had also seen it, and I telephoned her, to tell her that I had also seen it. She was a very grand and dismissive lady but I managed to get out of her that she had seen ‘them’ hovering in front of her house. She told me that she had reported it to the RAF.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently I was reading about cattle mutilations possibly being involved with UFO activity, and I remembered a boyfriend of mine being stopped by the Police, around the same time I had seen the UFO. He had been stopped and his car searched after leaving my house one evening, because there had been a lot of sheep mutilations in the area, and they had searched his vehicle looking for knives etc. There may be no connection at all, but it is worth mentioning here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, as regards the different shapes of UFOs: Go to the Pukka Pies UK website.  Click on Online shop. Click on Posters. Look at the poster entitled ‘ Pukka Pies Westminster Taste Invasion’-  now…....is that a cigar shaped UFO or a saucer shaped UFO? are people getting the two shapes mixed up?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

My best friend and I were playing night tennis at the tennis court of the local air force base. We finished our game and decided to play with matches that we brought in order to light the cigars we stole from his dad&#39;s stash. We began to play with the matches by &#34;flipping&#34; the matches back and forth at each other as if in a fiery mock battle. After several &#34;flips&#34; had occurred back and forth between us a &#34;spotlight?&#34; hit my friend and was actually off-center onto him. I got scared because he &#34;froze&#34; like he was in suspended animation or on &#34;pause&#34;. I began to get Very anxious about all of this and looked upwards for the source of the scary spotlight. It was a ball of light up in the sky,completely quiet,just hovering there. There were no connecting lights or beams between the two but I just &#34;KNEW&#34; that the ball of light was the source of the spotlight that froze my best friend. I couldn&#39;t believe what was happening to us. I squeezed my eyes together and shook my head very hard in hopes that it would just &#34;go away&#34;. When I opened them back up--it was gone! I was alittle shocked as I didn&#39;t really think that it would really work. But it did! The quiet ball of hovering light was gone! I quickly looked at my friend who was &#34;coming out of it&#34; and I was truely shook up. He was fine. I asked him if he &#34;saw&#34; the noiseless light in the sky. He said he did. Then I asked him how?-- as he never was able to physically look up and &#34;see&#34; anything due to his incapcitation. He said that he didn&#39;t know how --but he felt that he did somehow &#34;see&#34; it. I on the other hand &#34;saw&#34; everything and I didn&#39;t like any of it! It just wasn&#39;t right. It just wasn&#39;t! We used to refer to it off and on as we were growing up -but have now lost touch with one another. Something very wrong happened that night in &#39;76 and I have never stopped thinking about it since. I thought tonight that I would finally just write this all out, in hopes of possibly getting this off my chest and possibly out of my head. As far as I know-nothing other than seeing it, involved me that night. I just hope that what I do remember -is all that truely happened and nothing more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It moved very slowly from the south of the area I lived in. I could take you to the exact house to this very day. It was &#34;saucer&#34; shaped. The light encompassing the object was an off white type. It left no trail or haze while moving initially. It finally came to a hover behind our house. At this point my father, mother and younger brother had come over to see the object. At that point a plane came toward the object flashing lights at the object in a &#34;signal&#34; pattern. As the plane neared the object it went black. That is, the object turned off the light surrounding itself and was not visible to us. Then as the plane passed through where the object had been the object reappeared below the plane and sped off in the opposite direction it had been traveling in. Again, this was south. It moved so incredibly fast, without any sound, that it left a light trail in the sky for a few seconds. There was never any report on the news or in local papers about this, and it bothers me to this day. There MUST be some documentation as to who the piolt of the plane was and who sent him up after the object. The plane came from the direction I now know to be the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  PD))<n>

Our house was right on the ocean and also right next to the public beach and within walking distance to the boardwalk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 9:00pm at night (or whenever it&#39;s officially dark)and there were 6 us (4 kids 2 adults). Everyone was in a festive mood and excited to be going to the boardwalk that night, talking over each other, and some of the kids were racing ahead. But I was busy looking at what I thought was a very bright star in the night sky (green I recall). Then it suddenly began to move in a square flight pattern, first down, then left, then up, then right, over and over. It was very far away, almost directly above so I really did believe it was a star until it started moving. I was tugging at my mother’s hand to get her to look, but she was busy trying to keep everyone together as we trapsed across the beach. I wasn’t afraid, and I don’t recall thinking it was a UFO at the time, just that it was a very unusual star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, once we got to the boardwalk I too was excited about the rides and games and completely lost interest in the anomaly.  As an adult, I now realize just how odd that really was and wish I had been more persistent in getting someone to look up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Although time has faded my memory of the exact date and time of this event.  I will attempt to re-account my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was around 7 years old at them and it was in the evening perhaps in the spring/summer of 1976 and my parents, younger brother and I had stopped by a local McDonalds for a bite to eat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were eating inside our car in the parking lot when both my brother and I noticed a low flying rotating object flying over a strip mall across the street.  My parents dismissed it as an airplane or helicopter or something rationale, since Cecil Field was very close to this area,  but my brother and I were just fixated on this object!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was maybe 400-600 ft. up in the air as it flew over this strip mall moving from left to right in our field of vision.  The object was circular with multicolored lights (red, green, blue, etc.) around its edges, it rotated like a carousel with a slight tilt to the right and angled facing us so you could see it was circular.  I could see all the individual lights and the object itself rotating clockwise.  The object also had a single light on the top that illuminated a little bit of the surface around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not hear any noise that would suggest an airplane, helicopter or blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We eventually lost sight of this object, but I was left very shaken and the event has remained etched in my mind ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Anyway, my friend and I were playing foosball in Tacoma at &#34;Games Unlimited&#34; on 19th and Mildred.  Oswald Airport was located at the same site, but had been closed and was being turned into a strip mall.  Some of the old runway was still intact, so we&#39;d use it as a bathroom (I was 16 at the time).  I stepped onto the old runway to do my business and saw an orange sphere on the runway, behind some Scotch Broom (the runway was starting to get overgrown).  When my eyes made contact with the sphere it turned from dull orange to bright orange.  It flew straight up, and was out of sight in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather that evening was nothing but clear blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking southwest (in the direction of WPAFB). I saw a brite light that moved slowly in vertical and horizontal directions. It would move vertically, then stop and remain stationary for a few moments, then move horizontally, and stop, and it repeated that cycle a number of times. Then, in an instant, it disappeared by accelerating extremely quickly. It must have taken it less than .1-.2 of a second to disappear. A few points I&#39;d like to make. First, when it was moving slowly and turning at what appeared bo be exact right angles, and starting and stopping, it did not appear to accelerate. This is what initially caught my eye. In other words, it moved without accelerating; it moved at a precise and steady speed and motion. Second, when it finally did &#39;take off&#39; into the sky and disappear, it DID seem to accelerate, but at a phenomenal rate. Years later I was teaching in Taiwan. We had a discussion in class about UFOs. I asked my students if any of them had ever seen one. After a period of silence, one young man shared his story of having seen a UFO in Taiwan, I believe it was in the early or mid 80&#39;s. As he described what he had seen, I got goose bumps. He described exactly what I had seen in Ohio years ago. His description included elements such as turning at right angles, moving and stopping, then taking off ... it was uncanny. He was describing exactly what I had seen. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was about six at the time, and had never heard of the word UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father was a pilot in the Army, at one time we lived near Edwards AFB saw lots of wierd things the government was flying easily explainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were at my neighbors house in Glennville Georgia its located approximately 30 minutes away from Ft. Stewart.  ((witness #1)) who was also six, ((witness #2)) about eight, and his older brother about seventeen, my sister who was eleven and me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were jumping on ((witness #2)) trampoline and ((Witness #1)) pointed to the sky and said look at those lights over there.  There were two bright white lights in the distance. They looked like very bright street lights to me. Just ignored them and kept on jumping. I can&#39;t tell you the exact date when it happened but it was in the summer of either &#39;76 or &#39;77.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((witness #1)) had to go home to eat dinner and it was getting darker. Sometime later we decided we better head home as well. Before we set off down the road I looked over at the lights and they appeared to be getting bigger.  I dismissed them again and walked along side my sister.  My sister says she was watching them the whole time and that they were following us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed the wind started to pick up and dust was blowing everywhere which I was farmiliar with because helicopters do the same thing. My sister screamed out run they&#39;re following us.  At which point I looked up over my shoulder and saw a craft wing that looked alot like the Stealth.  But it had lights on it that had such a bright clarity to them like halogen lights but brighter and white.  It made no noise and its movements were serpentine in motion it moved very slow almost hovering and it made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took off running and left my sister behind.  I remember running into the house hysterical saying its got my sister, its got my sister.  Soon after my sister came in crying in a panic too.  So my dad went outside to see what it was and there was nothing.  It left without making a sound.  To this day my sister never talks about it, it was so horrifying. My dad being a pilot said that planes can cut their engines off and glide.  I excepted that and when they declassified the Stealth Bomber I thought that would explain it.  I saw the Stealth and it makes a lot of noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing I have seen flown by the military that I know of can compare to the technology of what ever that was that me and my sister saw that summer night. My sister can give you a better description because she was watching it the whole time, but she won&#39;t talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I thought that &#34;sure is a bright yard light&#34;. About that time we topped a hill on the interstate and directly over the trees we saw a large silver disk hovering right over the treetops. It was approx. 40-50 feet in diameter and encircled with different colored lights. Right from the center of the disk a VERY bright beam of light was directed into the trees. I had the feeling that it was collecting something or leaving something with the light beam. In just a few seconds the beam turned off and the disk rose about 30 feet in the air and departed at a fantastic rate of speed toward the horizon. Several cars slowed down to look also. We had our windows down and the object was soundless. My husband was terrified over the event. We listened to the radio and watched the papers for several days to see if there were any reports. But there weren&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed an oval shape object in the sky, with lights all around, just hovering over us, not moving, just stationary. I told my son to run and get the camera in my room. After about 2-3 minutes of being stationary, it moved very fast swerving from side to side. No noice all the time, then disappeared as it flew very far until I could not see it anymore. Much faster than an airplane. When the camera arrived, the object was no longer there. The following day, there was a small article in the Akron-Beacon Journal of some report of other people who witnessed the same. I never reported to anybody then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a medical professional.  Date is approximate.

We were crossing the Kaskaskia River bridge, looking to the East, I saw what looked like a new bridge being built... lights lit up the river and the trees lining the banks maybe 1/8 of a mile up river, there was an expance from bank to bank. we made the left turn in Fayetteville ( a very small burg with omly a few blocks in all directions)as we started out of town ( my dad driving)I looked to my left and what I thought was a bridge project was now rising out of the river bottom and heading our way, the lights on the thing went out with only what appeared to be &#34;cab&#34; lights, the sky was clear but dark only lit by the lights of St Louis and Belville Ill. It was black on dark you could see the shape but see no detail, as we made the trip this thing paced our speed and direction from 50 mph to 75 and once we stopped to see what it would do... it stopped we shut the car off and watched for a moment, it just remained there waiting, well we had to pick up a car and there really was nothing we could do about&#34;it&#34; so on we went, as we pulled into the repair shops lot the craft when overhead and headed in the direction of Scott AFB.The craft was large maybe 200&#39; on all sides, it&#39;s flight was around 500&#39;up and it did not make a sound.

My mom and I decided to go to our car and leave but for no apparent reason my mon and I both looked up into the sky overhead and both saw the under belly of a huge craft that appeared to be a couple of football fields in size we were locked on to the craft and were completely unable to move, blink,speak,or look away it had us both captivated it looked like a huge triangle with a rectangle somewhere on it its corners were lights and it was emense. all the sudden the craft turned onto its side and disappeared into a pinof light. At that exact moment both my mom and looked at each other and started talking to each other &#34;did you see that, What was that, so on&#34; we imediatly looked around at the croud of people who surrounded us and no one saw what we saw because they were all enguaged in conversation still. we went to a pay phone called the police.

It looked similar to the spaceship on the Boston album.  It was beautiful, and I saw it partially obscured by clouds in the sky.  I was so scared (I was 5 at the time) that I ran inside my apartment building and locked the main entrance door and went to my apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1 LARGE object in the sky, and, as I said, similar in look to the spaceship on the cover of the Boston album(their first, and quite a good one, I might add!).  By the way, I had never seen the Boston album prior to that (I do not know if it was even released at the time).  When I saw the Boston album for the first time, I was immediately reminded of what I had seen years before.  Anyway, there was 1 object, beautiful, with colored lights, and maybe windows.  That&#39;s all I recall.  I saw no movement in the object.  I saw it in the sky, looked at it, and got VERY frightened and ran inside.  It was immense in size, because it was high enough to be partially obscured by cumulonimbus clouds that were present, but those clouds offered excellent reference as to the object&#39;s size.  In the seconds I looked at the object, it did not move.  Then I ran in and locked the door.  As I said in my previous report, I would just like to document my sighting in case there were other sightings in that area at that time.<n>

I had been playing a ballgame with Barry F., Scott K., and Denny W.  It was lunch time and those three went to their respective houses to eat lunch.  I usually did not eat lunch so I waited in the open carport of Scott&#39;s house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately noon, it has been a long time so I am estimating the approximately month, day, and year.  It was near the intersection of Showalter Court and Seabridge Drive in the Laurel Park Subdivision in Orlando, Florida.  Barry&#39;s house was on the southeast corner, Denny&#39;s house was on the northeast corner, and Scott&#39;s house was one house to the east of Barry&#39;s house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat in the carport of Scott&#39;s house facing north.  I observed a white or silver in color craft which looked like a rocket sideways, a cylinder with a pointed top.  But the rocket looking craft was not flying upwards like a rocket launch, the craft was flying sideways in a counterclockwise motion from north to the west to the south very slowly.  The craft did not have wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived not too far from what is today the Orlando International Airport, but then it was not an International Airport.  And I had lived near McCoy Airforce Base before that house, so I had seen plenty of airplanes and jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the craft I immediately began yelling for the occupants inside Scott&#39;s house to come out.  I was even banging on the door. Finally, Scott&#39;s older sisters which were in high school came out.  But the craft had flown to the west out of sight.  I was very nervous trying to explain to them what I saw, but it was not there when they came out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then ran home as fast as I could.  I began explaining to my mom and grabbed her by the hand to come outside and look at the strange craft.  But two story apartments were built to the south of our home and the apartments blocked the view of the craft as it flew from the west to the south still in a circular counterclockwise motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had not talked about the incident for almost 23 years when I had a great aunt on my maternal side come visit and have dinner.  During the night she mentioned about actual encounters with alien beings which included time loss, implantation of a device (which she states her doctor removed from her abdomen), and several follow up visits by aliens.  I had not said a thing to her when she confronted me about seeing an unidentified craft.  Her words I cannot recall totally were something to the effect of &#34;And you know because you have seen one haven&#39;t you?&#34;  I could only explain this confrontation as strange.  I never said a word to her about the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not know a sight like this existed.  I am currently a field grade military officer in the Army Reserves.  I am also a sworn law enforcement officer working as a detective.  I cannot explain what I saw on that summer day, but it continues to be unexplained and unknown to me what the craft was that I observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I will never forget the event and wish to this day I could draw because I can remember it like it was yesturday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents and I were sitting in our living room in Federal Way, Washington on Star Lake Road.  We had a house that had two huge windows.  When out of the blue a very large round object appeared right in front of our windows.  It was about the size of 1/2 of football field.  There were rectangular lights that flashed in a circular motion.  There were to windshields that were the same size as the lights.  It was grey in color and made no noise what so ever.  My dad said&#34;  Must be some new boeing project&#34;  It just sat there for at least a minute.  My mom said ya right, I have never seen anything that that.  In a instant it shot straight up into the air and took off heading South towards Portland.  We called my aunt and she was like, I see nothing.  The strangest thing of all is the next day at breakfast my parents remembered seeing something but they both said it was a dream.  THen said, how can we all have the same dream.  I try now to talk to my parents about it, my mom is eager to tell it but my dad is dead silent and wont say a word.  I wish I could see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We had been invited to have chicken gumbo at their home. After finishing supper my Dad had fallen asleep while watching T.V. It was around 2:00 a.m. before we finally left for home. We were traveling east on Pineville Rd. when all of a sudden the entire inside of our vehicle lit up a bright blueish/white. We had no idea what was going on and were scared half to death. The light seemed to extend to either side of us. There were fenced fields to our left and right near the road and the light touched just beyond the fences to the best of my recolection. There was no sound and no other vehicles in the area. I remember my Dad stopping the car. My Mom said...&#34;What&#39;s that...where is it coming from&#34;? I was sitting in the middle of the back seat and couldn&#39;t figure out what was happening. My first instinct was to look up because I thought the overhead car light had turned on, but then quickly remembered it was busted out. I believe Dad had stepped out of the car, crossed the ditch to the right of us, looked out in the field, came back and said...&#34;It&#39;s not coming from out there&#34;. The next thing I remember is riding the rest of the way home and entering the house, looking at the digital clock on the dining table (can&#39;t remember what time it read) and going to bed.The next morning while Mom and I sat at the table sipping on a cup of tea she remarked...&#34;I wonder what that was...it seemed to come from above and behind us. I was too scared to turn around&#34;. Well we were all terrified...of what I don&#39;t know. It seemed almost &#39;taboo&#39; to discuss the subject. We all felt violated for some reason. Nothing made sense to any of us. We felt like silence was an &#39;instruction&#39; and we wern&#39;t suppose to talk about this occurance. It still haunts me today because I can&#39;t remember just what this was that invaded our lives. Both my parents are deceased now and I can only hope one day I&#39;ll find the a! nswers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We can only guess at the date.

6/1/76 02:00|Howell|MI|Unknown|approx 1 hr|Saw unexplained objects and beings|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84873.html|96|ndxe197606| Saw unexplained objects and beings<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awakened around 2 am to a light I could see through the window curtains in my bedroom and did not pay much attention to it.  I was a light sleeper at the time because I had a 3 yr old daughter.  Thinking I needed to go to the bathroom and then check on all three of my daughters, I got up and did this. About the same time I kept hearing a reedy voice (?) telling me not to look out the windows or turn on any lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to walk down the hall to my living room to look out the door window from across the room (I had sheers on that window and could look out without disturbing anything)I then saw a light traveling down my road in front of my home. It did not seem to have anything solid to it and was about the size of a beach ball.  It was swinging to and fro from one side of the street to the other. I then ran back to the bedroom and awakened my husband to make sure I was not dreaming.  I explained quickly to him what was going on and he followed me back down ! the hall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we reached the end of the hall where the living room, dining room and kitchen opened up he listened to me tell of the words that I had heard earlier. He didn&#39;t believe me right away when I told him we were not to look out the windows, turn on any lights of try to use the phone because all would be useless. Well..he immediately tried the lights, none of the available switches worked so he went to the bottom of the stairs to the basement and switched all the circuit breakers off and then on and still nothing worked. Three streets over we could see a porch light or two on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He came back upstairs in the darkness and went to the phone and said he was going to call the police or electric company because he felt so uneasy. The phone was dead. Now back in those days the phone did not run on electricity but on the phone line itself and would work when there was no electricity. Then I told him about the light going down the street and also what I had seen out the side w! indow in our bedroom when I first got up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had a small, deep lake at the north end of our road about an eighth of a mile from us called Earl Lake and I had seen something there hovering above the lake with a ramp of steps going from the lake up to a craft of some sort, it seemed so large that I could not make out its size or shape from where I stood in the bedroom. I did see, however, some sort of beings carrying what looked like sacks upon their backs going from the waters of the lake up the ramp and into the craft.  They were strange looking, dressed in dark coverings that came just below their bottoms with hoods on their heads.   There was light coming from the opening of the craft and below what appeared to be one end of the craft just over the edge of the lake.  They looked to be about 4ft tall and very stocky with strong looking legs.  I could not see their faces because of the hoods. Off to the side at the bottom was what seemed to be a very thin, tall being I could not see very well as it was standing away f! rom the brightest lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After my husband tried the lights and the phone he became very uneasy and both of us sat down in the hall out of sight of and windows. After approximately an hour I once again heard the voice and was told to resume what I wished and that all would be alright. When we looked out the door window and the north bedroom window facing the lake, we saw nothing. All was back to normal, the lights and the phone were now working. There was never a repeat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this had all ended , my husband and I agreed to just not say anything to anyone because we thought someone would think we were crazy.  I am now 70 yrs old and have never forgotten this incident. I still remember it very clearly. I had always had the ability to see visions and hear certain faint voices from the time I had been a very little girl. I never talked about it because when I was young I thought everyone had the same ability.  When a teenager and young woman I had told my mom and she said not to advertise it because others would think something was wrong with me.  As I said, I had certain things come to me but not of this magnitude.  I did tell my husband after we were married and was able to prove to him through certain instances that I could see visions and sometimes sense things in the future, although I did not try to cultivate this ability.  So when this particular instance happened I needed a witness because it was different from any other circumstance I had experienced in the past. It so frightened me that I prayed to have my abilities taken from me. I tried for years to suppress it but even at this time in my life I still see things but am freer telling others about what I see. (But not often).<n> <n><n> <n><n> In summary:  I tried for years to find someone else that had seen beings like the ones I had seen but didn&#39;t know how to proceed in researching any of it. There is more background and instances in my life but I hesitate to talk about them to too many people. When I listened to George Noory on the evening of Oct 25th I heard the request for people like me to report what I had seen.  Since I am now 70 yrs and this happened when I was 35yrs old. I thought someone else should know.<n>

My particular sighting occured outside of Scottsville, Kentucky during the fishing season in the spring of 1976.  This is the closest to the exact date as I can remember.  I am a Christian and I do have an open mind about many things.  But I still haven&#39;t figured out exactly what me and a friend of mine saw that one particular night back in 1976.  We had been on a fishing trip to the Barren River Lake area, and was returning home late one night-around 1:00 AM if I remember correctly.  Anyway, as we were driving back home to the Scottsville area we had to pass by an old abandoned oil well in a wooded area.  We had taken this route many times before.  As we were driving along we spotted something very odd sitting beside the abandoned oil well in the woods and it was very bright.  We decided to stop the pickup truck and get a closer look.  When we stopped we saw a solid mass of bright red light in the woods beside the well.  The light was perfectly round and circular in appearance and sitting on the ground.  It was as big as our pickup truck we were riding in, and just sitting there in the woods glowing.  There was no noise at all to be heard, and we had both never seen anything like this thing before.  The light was bright red, and it did appear as though it was a part of something of a solid mass-an object of some sorts.  Why it was near an oil well I do not know.  I must say that the night was really dark, and there was practically no moon shining at all.  Although I do realize that there might be a practical explanation as to what we observed that night, I cannot think of what it might be.  Believe me, we were not out UFO hunting or anything like that-it just happened.  We both know what we saw.  The Scottsville-Franklin, Kentucky areas has had many strange sightings over the years like this and it makes one wonder!

This must have been between June and August as I visited there on summer vacation from school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe I was around ten years old. I was sleeping out in the back yard at a friends house.  We were laying with our heads to the East and feet to the West.  The closest East running street is what used to be called Greenwood ave. (7800 So.?)   I remember being almost asleep and looking directly above and slightly to the South and I saw a boomarang shaped set of lights aproximately 500-1000 feet up. The object was moving in a straight line from East to West and made no sound that I remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see an outline of the craft only the lights.  The lights were smooth edged, round, and evenly spaced.  They were off white or pale yellow, the closest color I can compare it to is a halogen street light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember there being one light at the corner (point) of the angle in front and maybe three trailing the center light on each side at approximately a 45 degree angle like a carpenters square or boomerang.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember pointing it out to my friend.  As I stated before, I was almost asleep and must have fallen asleep after it passed out of sight.<n>

My mother, her best friend, and myself were driving on a section of road called &#34;Grange Road.&#34;  Today, there are a lot of houses, but at the time, it was all farmland with maybe one or two houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just after midnight, and I remember waking up.  I was alseep in the back seat, and I woke up feeling very frightened.  I sat up, and my mother and her friend were obviously worried.  The car we were in was cutting in-and-out, and finally died.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the car stopped, we all saw a blue light directly ahead, maybe about 20 feet off of the ground, and about a football field legnth away.  It glided towards us, made no noise, and as it got to within 15 feet, it stopped in midair, hoovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom grabbed me from the backseat and held on, and her friend was crying.  I was crying, too, because whatever it was, it was making us all upset.  After about five minutes, I don&#39;t recall what happened, because for whatever reason, I fell alseep.  Weird, I know, but I swear it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up sometime later, and we three were sitting there, shocked, and the light was gone.  My mom and her friend - to this day - swear they had missing time, about 10 minutes worth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this helps...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

We loved looking at the stars and northern light at night. Everything is so vivid. I had recently lost my job driving Greyhound bus, sold the house in Minneapois and decided to rough it for a while. We lived a primitave life style growing our own food, a hand pump outside and an outhouse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening when the family had gone to bed, I stepped outdoors to releive myself. I was facing north looking for the northern lights when I sensed movement behind me. There was a cigar shaped object traveling west to east and slightly downward. It dissapeared behind the treeline. I thought it was a falling star at first but then I realized it was moving much too slow and was not brightly lit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The more I thought about it the more I thought it must have been an UFO. Two days later I went to town and found everybody talking about some woman on a farm that had a UFO in their yard. It wasn&#39;t until later in the day that I put 2 &amp; 2 together that I figured this must have been what I had seen also. The event was recorded in the Pine City Press.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never reported this to anyone except my family and some freinds.
