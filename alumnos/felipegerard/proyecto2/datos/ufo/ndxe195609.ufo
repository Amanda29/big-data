I started looking up at the stars above when I noticed strange movements in the heavens above.  At first I thought I was seeing meteorites.  But instead of falling straight down, their paths were either curving or snaking through the sky.  Some apppeared to join up and then after a while, separate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my fiancee came out of the house I pointed the phenomenon out to her and after viewing it she became quite frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being a commercial pilot, I would guess these objects to be between 15,000 to 20,000 feet in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

They were silver in color and were in formation, sitting perfectly still.  After a time they shot straight up and disappeared. Made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

About halfway to the house the dog starting barking for no apparent reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up and to the west, I saw three round blue-white disks in V formation moving from SE to NW.  This would have been very near the Glen L Martin Co or Martin Maretta, as it is known now.  There was no sound and the disks did not change course but moved steadily until they were out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot be certain of the exact year but I would think this occurred between 1954 and 1958.  That this event has remained with me all these years seems remarkable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/9/56 05:55|Norfolk|VA|Cigar|1.5 minutes|Unidentified Object Hovering over Interstate 264, Norfolk, Virginia|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55241.html|4|ndxe195609| Unidentified Object Hovering over Interstate 264, Norfolk, Virginia<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving to work on 7 February 2007, from Virginia Beach to Norfolk Virginia.  As I was driving, coming close to my exit (Interstate 564).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving, this bright flourescent light in the sky caught my attention.  As I continue to drive, I observed this object in the sky.  I could not stop, because I was in the far left lane, and traffic was heavy that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it was a helicopter, shining it searchlight, but this flourescent light was too soft (I wasn&#39;t blinded by it).  This light shone exactly like a strobing light, but no flicker was present when it caught my attention in the sky. This object appeared to be a long cylinder (cigar shaped).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continue to drive and look at the flourescent light, it was very soft to my eyes.  I also caught a glimpse of a red light under the belly of the object (center of the object).  I tried to determine if this was a helicopter, but I would know if this was a helicopter by the sound they make, but this object produced no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It maintain it stationery position for at least 1.5 minutes before I had to exit Interstate 264.  I tried to see if the object from Interstate 564, but wasn&#39;t able to see the object anymore from my new position.<n>
