When the were not moving they look like stars.  They would move very fast and make 90 degree turns with out slowing.  They would stop instantly.  And start instantly. There was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/30/82 23:00|Garden City|MI|Disk|10 Minutes|Circular - Rotating and hovering east to west and back again at night in Garden City, MI in the early 1980's.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68456.html|2|ndxe198206| Circular - Rotating and hovering east to west and back again at night in Garden City, MI in the early 1980&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK, I&#39;ve never seen anything strange before or since and still can&#39;t believe what I say to this day.  So, being the internet age and all, I thought I&#39;d search for what I saw that night to see if anyone else reported it.  I think I found the exact &#34;thing&#34; I saw in the sky as reported on http://www.ufopicks.com/.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the early 80&#39;s and I was approximately 10 years old.  My older sister was in the phone with her friend and told me that there was a &#34;flying saucer&#34; outside.  I quickly ran to the front window (facing east) and saw what appeared to be either a relatively low flying circular craft with rotating lights (Like L.E.D.&#39;s) slowing pacing in an exact line from west to east and then back again from east to west.  Or it was huge and much higher in the sky than it may have appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night.  The &#34;thing&#34; was right above our house on it&#39;s east to west and back again pattern of flying.  I was mezmorized.  I was old enough to know that it wasn&#39;t a plane or copter.  It made no noise and very smoothly went about it&#39;s business.  I didn&#39;t see it &#34;exit&#34; the aky because it would come into view for a minute or two before going over the horizon and back again... then at one point it never returned from the horizon.  It seemed as thought it was surveying the area because of it&#39;s straight back and forth flight... it would move just a little to the south on each and every &#34;trip&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FYI... this &#34;thing&#34; was somewhere in between Warren and Ford Road (east - west roads) and seemed to disappear from the horizon once it hit Inkster Road (to the east) and Middlebelt Road (to the west)... due to the horizon being limited because of houses and trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the exact location of where I was viewing this object:<n> <n><n> http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=6607+Deering+Garden+City+Michigan&amp;sll=42.328981,-83.314819&amp;sspn=0.100384,0.21595&amp;gl=us&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=42.335073,-83.316836&amp;spn=0.025094,0.053988&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=addr<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else remembers the exact year or can add to my memory, please do so.  I KNOW I saw it, as did my sister and the friend on the phone that lived about a half mile to our west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The exacty description of the &#34;thing&#34; was a perfect circle with LED type of yellowish-red lights that rotated around this &#34;thing&#34;... It seemed to have a top and bottom (both circular)... with the LED&#39;s (or whatever) around the middle.  I could not make out the body of the &#34;thing&#34; because the lights were too bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not crazy... really. It was there. My best guess is that it was between 1980-1983.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

6/30/82 03:00|Leicester (UK/England)|||15-20 min|Alien standing at the bottom of my bed.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52257.html|3|ndxe198206| Alien standing at the bottom of my bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at home in bed with my wife sound asleep. We lived in a cottage in a small village in the county of Cornwall. The cottage was situated down a narrow small access lane on the edge of the village surrounded on three sides by rural farmland. There is no outside lighting and no near light pollution. I gently awoke from sleep for no reason. I usually sleep well totally undisturbed in the quiet and dark location. As I woke, I became aware that their was a light in the room, albeit not too bright. More akin to about half a dozen candels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was becoming more and more awake, I realised this was unusual and decided to turn from lying on my side onto my back, lift my head slightly, and see where the light was coming from. I first thought it must be from the one and only small window. That thought lasted a nano second as I was confronted with the light source only six feet away at the foot of my bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thought number 1. What the f&#34;%&amp; hell is that. I obviously could not take my eyes off it as my brain went into explanation overload but no answer was in the data base, and my own sense of reasoning told me this is not happening. But as time went on, just a minute or two, my brain and reasoning started to calm down and I regained control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me just say that at no time did I ever feel frightened or threatened, in fact just the opposite. Standing at the bottom of my bed was a creature not of this world. He or she did not move, but just gazed right at me. The eyes did move though, very slightly when the creature appeared to blink very slowly. I was overwhelmed with a feeling of calm and peace which the creature seemed to be transmitting like some sort of telepathy. I then felt it was ok to lift myself up further with my elbows to be more comfortable. Then just as I had done so, my sense of reasoning kicked in. First of all I have got to be sure without any doubt what so ever, that what I am seeing and experiencing is absolutly true, and not a figment of my imagination. Not a dream. Not some trick of light. Not some querk of physics or anything else. These thoughts were very strong because you can not explain what is happening, what you are seeing, but you need too, and quickly. So first thing I had to do is convince myself I was not asleep and dreaming. Well it is the middle of the night and I was in bed! I already knew the answer but I had to check and double check. Yes I pinched myself numerous times, but you do know when you are awake. The creature was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Happy with the &#39;I am awake checks&#39;, onto the next thing. Maybe, just maybe its a trick of some light somwhere, I have to remove that doubt as well. So first to the window and, nothing, pitch black as usual. Not even a hint of moonlight which you can get on a clear night with a near full moon. Right, window checked, I need to check the rest of the room now as well. The creature was still there. Gazing, and appearing to smile. The light just eminated from the face. I didn&#39;t want to take my eyes of him or her for a second but I had to, to check the rest of the room. I started to the left of me at floor level, and slowly scanned every inch of the floor and lower wall untill I had been round the whole room. I then moved up a couple of feet and repeated the process. I then covered the upper wall, the ceiling, the whole lot. Nothing. I then repeated the process again because my brain was not accepting it somehow. Well I had done everything I could do, to try to explain this thing, now I had to just accept that what I was seeing was very very real, and an alien to this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way I can descibe the creature is from the film &#39;&#39;Close encounter&#39;s of the Third kind&#39;&#39;The alien that comes out of the space craft towards the end of the film.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Similar to what is described today as the classic grey. The one at the end of my bed was just over four feet tall. The head appeared slightly more round than the classic grey. The eyes were large and slanted up, but not black. They were very open as I have already said. The pupils were large and what we describe as the white of the eyes, this was a faint very pale yellow. I could not notice any nose or ears. The lower body and arms were not lit by the light so a desciption was difficult. After I had accepted the truth of what I was experiencing, my main thought now was, nobody will ever believe it. You must have been dreaming. How many had you had last night? I glanced down at my wife to the right of me, sound asleep. She is my only possible witness. I then tried to wake her with gentle movements of my hand against her leg under the covers. My wife eventually started to make noises, turned over, and obviously didn&#39;t want to be disturbed. But I persisted. She started to talk without opening her eyes. &#39;&#39;What? What? What is it? I&#39;m tired.&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Jo. Jo. Wake up I said&#39;&#39; I gave her leg a good shove and looked down at her, and just as she was about to wake up and open her eyes, the bedroom went dark. I quickly looked round and the creature was gone. How? I don&#39;t know. Was he or she beamed down like something out of Star Trek? Maybe. Did I imagine or dream the whole thing? Absolutly One Million Percent No. The whole experience lasted fifteen to twenty minutes approx. Thats the way it happened. And it is firmly etched on my mind and will be untill I die. I sometimes still stare into the dark when I am in bed and expect the creature to return. And when I look up at the night sky I hope he or she will return and tell me of their life in the other world I Know exists, somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

6/30/82 00:00|Grass Valley|CA|Cigar|10-15 min.?|Cigar  craft  "encountered" over home in Grass Valley, Calif. 1981/82. Reported to Beale Air Force Base.|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57675.html|4|ndxe198206| Cigar  craft  &#34;encountered&#34; over home in Grass Valley, Calif. 1981/82. Reported to Beale Air Force Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching a late show one evening in 81/82 when I became aware of a very low basso tone. At first I wasn&#39;t thinking anything about it except how odd it was. But I continued to watch tv. As a little time progressed on the tone became deeper, stronger, and more insistant, much louder until it was rattling my glass table top and windows. At this I jumped up and ran for the sliding glass door to see if a Jumbo jet was going to land on my house. It sounded so low in the evening air. I knew we were on a flight path for Beale air force base and we were used to hearing planes now and again in the daytime but never this late at night. I was scared the sound was so invasive. As I launched myself out the back door I landed on a small concrete slab patio with a start as I tried to gauge where the sound was coming from. I looked up at a pine tree in our back yard tall or so and then swiveled toward the sound of the bass tone. As I turned looking up the whole time I could not believe what I was witnessing...there hanging no more than about 200 feet about the ground and moving at a smails pace was a cigar shaped gun metal toned UFO. I was dumfounded as I watched it inch thru the night sky. There were no other sounds but that deep bassso drone as it approached until it was right over my home, and partly obliterated by the roof of my house. Suddenly it stopped dead in the air and as it did so the drone stopped also. It was utterly quiet with not a bird, nor frog, no cricket. It was incredibly eerie! As I watched it just hang there in the void above me I searched its superstructure for some sign of familiarity with airplanes I was familiar with, but there were no wings, no propellars, no windows or portholes, no designs of any kind, just a long dark polished cigar shaped something right over my house dead still in the air. I had a long piece of property, longer than wide and it clearly could have spanned the length of a football field. I continued to watch it, I don&#39;t know how long, curious, and in w! ondermen t when suddenly one light ticked on and then off and a little ways away another came on and then off...this continued around the entire bottom of the middle half of the structure that had settled in above my house in a half circle arc and then it disappeared beyond the roof of my home until I finally saw the same light that had started it all tick on and off again and then with that a bright all encompassing light surrounded where I was standing and illuminated the top of my home. I remember thinking to myself &#34;they&#39;ve seen me&#34; and this is where I have an odd double memory of what happened next, I remember wanting to jump out of the light, but I do not remember doing it. I remember staying there and looking into the light. I remember when just before the light came on there was an odd metallic sound like something industrial going on, but I did not see any opening. It was not a blinding light but it was without a doubt the brightest light I had ever seen and yet it did not hurt my eyes and I do not have a remembrance of even wanting to blink my eyes it was all so intrigueing to me. It was almost as tho the light itself was alive, it was filled with rianbows and small moving things, I can only liken it to looking at semen, or bacteria under a microscope, it moved fluidly. It was truly one of the most unique and beautiful things that I have ever seen.I felt an intense euphoria as I watched the motions within the light swirling about in slow motion. Just incredible sight. Very hypnotic, and calming. I do not know how long I stood there, it didn&#39;t seem like long but I was utterly entranced so who knows. After awhile the light went out with the same metalic sound, just blinked off. And immediately the ship began to move again, but in no more a hurry than it had been in coming and that basso profundo sound was back. I don&#39;t remember moving from the spot, I remember thinking I should run and get my husband so he could see this but I didn&#39;t do that and I cannot explain why, at least not until the ship had just p! ast the trees on the other side of our house. Then I ran into my house and tried to wake my husband up, which was a bit of a feat, and then he refused to go outside to see as this thing had not gotten far away by then, but he refused to go even tho he could hear the sound it mad. His sister who was visiting also did not wake up. After this my life turneds upside down as I began a feverish research into all kinds of things I had never been interested in before. My life has never been the same. After the incident I called up and reported the sighting to Beale Air Force base and inquired about the possibility of them having such a craft which they assured me that had not. Years later I was recounting the incident to a friend when my son of 17 walked thru the door and said &#34;Oh, I remember that mom, I was watching from my window in the bedroom&#34;. Well he was barely 2 when this happend and I had never told him about it. But before I could get into the rest of the description he filled in the blanks with having seen the white light all around me and how it &#34;danced&#34; with rainbows and seeing me just stand there for the longest time staring at it, and then it going out and watching me watch it go. He saw all of that. It was a real shock to me...I mean I couldn&#39;nt understand how a child of that age would remember such a thing, but he did. I have had other encounters, and many sightings, and strange phenomenon happen in my life, but this was one of the most life changing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/25/82 00:00|Terre Haute|IN|Light|one minute|In June, I witnessed a bight object on a clear night moving east to west, then vanish out of sight in 3 seconds|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57419.html|6|ndxe198206| In June, I witnessed a bight object on a clear night moving east to west, then vanish out of sight in 3 seconds<n> <n><n> <n><n> In June, 1982, my fiancé and I witnessed a bright object traveling slowly from east to west. The night was very clear and the stars could be seen for miles. I got out of the car and for some unknown reason decided to look up in the sky. As I was looking into the eastern sky, I noticed a lighted object moving very slowly. I asked my fiancé to come and look at this object. She asked what it was in a very excited voice. I said, “I think it is a UFO! All of the sudden the object stopped in front of us about 10 yards away at tree top level! We were both getting a little concerned. The object or occupants in the object were looking at us maybe, but it was too far away to tell. The lighted object hovered in the same position for about 30 seconds. I was getting goose bumps and starting to perspire as was my fiancé. Then all of a sudden the object moved to the west again slowly for a few seconds and then moved out of sight in about 3 seconds! It was just like in documentaries I have seen in recent years  Now the sighting was about a mile and a half away from an airport and air guard base. However, the object made no noise at all! I know enough about planes to know that they make some kind of noise and that they do not hover like this object did and then all of a sudden move out of sight in about three seconds. I have been around aircraft since I was young and my dad was a flight engineer on a B-24 bomber in WW2. I wanted to call the air guard base, but I was afraid the airmen at the base would just laugh. However, many years ago, an F-94 from the base chased an unknown object, but gave up the chase after being outrun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spoke to a UFO expert about my sighting and he told me he believed that the occupants knew we were watching them and that is why the object hovered for about 30 seconds. I have gone over this sighting in my head for the past 25 years and wondered what the object was. I have come to the conclusion that it was either Air Force test vehicle or reverse-engineered object flown by our pilots OR, an alien aircraft. It was state of the art regardless of what the object was. The object in my opinion was saucer shape and very well lighted. My fiancé and I were married for about 9 years and then divorced and we had one son, now 19. He told me his mother showed him where we saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will say that I feel fortunate to have seen a UFO. I feel like a veteran and feel that it has changed my view on life differently. I believe there was a Jesus and he did walk on water, but I wonder if there was a scientific reason he was able to walk on water. Maybe we were seeded here on earth!  I would also like to convey to you about an incident that happened to my uncle at about the same time as my experience. My uncle was a farmer in Illinois. He told me at my wedding that he was riding on his tractor one day in his field. He told me he was driving slowly and this gold metal object came up to him and his tractor engine stopped on his tractor! He said he was very frightened. The object moved around him. He tried to start his tractor to get away from the object but it still would not start. The gold metal object finally moved away and moved out of sight in a few seconds. His tractor started up again, just like other people have experience with there cars when they saw UFOs. I believe my uncle was being studied by a probe. He told me he prayed the entire time the object was studying him and that he was very frightened. I just think that it is very coincidental that my uncle and I saw these objects about the same time. It may not be. I decided to write you because I saw SEEING IS BELIEVING, UFOS with Peter Jennings last night and saw the interview with the gentleman with National UFO Reporting Center and also this is the 60th anniversary of Roswell. I hope this helps by reporting what I saw 25 years ago and I have wanted to report this for many years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks You<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We lived in a 12-man tent, and went to many auspicious places.  I remember that I was young (9) perhaps, all the bonfire parties were over etc. 11pm-3am and I don&#39;t really know the exact date.  We were taking a beach stroll, gazing at the stars etc.  Many objects of light surrounded us, kind of like fireflies; we stood there for 15mins or so maybe longer, (while they observed us).  My father was a very intelligent man, not one to mistake anything.  So after we walked back to our VW bug talking about what we&#39;d all just experienced and drove down the freeway a bit I began to draw a picture of what I&#39;d seen.  If I remember correctly they were, either all sphere&#39;s or some were triangle, some maybe square, and that they were either all different illuminating colors or opalescent/reflective.  They seemed large, out of this world, but right there like fireflies.  Ok, so I give my mother the picture and she say&#39;s something like &#34;That&#39;s cute honey but they were much bigger.&#34; and my dad said some thing about them not being colorful, that they were dark black or silver, maybe reflective.  We argued back and forth for a while, and then we all felt weird like they&#39;d gone in saw who we were etc and then erased our memory, or scrambled it.  Perhaps messages that I now see. One thing I know, while we walked back to the bug we all agreed, and knew what we’d seen thought it was awesome etc. and then the memory faded away, very, very quickly.  I wish I still had that picture. When men in black the movie came out and they zapped their memory away, it was funny but real.  I’ll write of my most recent soon.   Everything matters, yet once you know that, then nothing matters! Lol<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

All three of them witnessed it (this is a friend posting this for the mother).  The object was metallic and silvery, and on one side it was spherical, and the back(?) side was flat and in the shape of a diamond.  The object was rotating on an axis that went through the center of the diamond side.  The rate of rotation was estimated at 1 revolution per 45 to 60 seconds.  Initially the object was moving away from their vehicle.  It went a distance away, and then the direction of its rotation changed, and began to move back towards them.  Soon there- after, the son (age 4) became very upset by its coming to them, and then the object just disappeared...no sound or anything.  On the flat diamond side of the object there was a black (amorphous) pattern around its center.  In the center of this side was a steady blue light. The total viewing time was about 5 minutes. After the object was gone, all three individuals went back inside the house and in separate rooms drew what they thought they saw.  The drawings agreed with each other. The father was disbelieving, and disheartedly, the mother ended up throwing the sketches away.  The 8 yr. old daughter still remembers seeing the object, but doesn&#39;t think much about it. The mother still thinks often about it.  There area at the time used to have a lot of air traffic, but there was none at the time.  Size of the object was estimated to be about the size of the &#39;bubble&#39; of a small helicopter.<n>

It was approx 40 to 50 ft from tip to tip. Their were three lights, one on each corner, which did not blink. We stopped the car on the bridge and watched. Looking up at the ship we could see what looked like a massave amount of hydrolics and smaller shapes covering the underside. It hovered for about 10 to 15 minutes above us. I estimate its altitude at 40 feet above us. I didn&#39;t believe what I was seeing until it started to move away (silently) and I could see it&#39;s reflection in the river below. We watched as it desended to about 30 feet above the river, at this height it was about eye level with us. It then followed the river heading west. The one thing I couldn&#39;t understand was that it did not seem to have any height. It was thin. I have no idea as to the size of the ship other than the dimensions I have already given. I realize this report is already almost 20 yrs old but it helps to tell people, especially people who believe you.<n>

When I looked up at the stars and noticed a bright star shooting up, down, left|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24255.html|11|ndxe198206| I was lounging in a pool back sometime in June of 1982. When I looked up at the stars and noticed a bright star shooting up, down, left and right. It moved very fast. Then it appeared that it was trying to find a good place to unload something. It found a spot to stop then three smaller light objects ejected from the big light and dispersed. At this point I jumped out of the pool, and I was running home to get a witness and I saw my pop who was a police officer driving down the street.

I had just bought a truck with a cab over camper.  I wanted to try it out and go camping down in Big Bend National Park, Texas.  I picked up a few friends and we left out of Odessa Texas about 8 P.M.  It had been 100 plus degrees all week is why we left in the evening, as it was cooler.  As we got closer to Ft. Stockton, Texas, we could see big thunder storms building up to the south.  We stopped in Ft. Stockton for a few hours,to visit friends and let it clear up some.  We left out of Ft. Stockton about 11 P.M.  We took US385 to Marathon.  There is a road side park about 30 miles out of Ft. Stockton, we had just gone past there.  It was 12 midnight and raining off and on, and thats when we saw it, off in a canyon, about a mile away facing west.  It was a huge dome, the color of a black light, and you could see movement in it.  This dome was the size of a football field, and it was making a crackling sound, like electricity  I was out of the truck and standing by the fence when I realized that you could only see it when the moon was out from behind the clouds.  It was cloudy and misting rain, but I wanted to go see what it was, but everyone else was freaking: they said they were leaving without me ,even though it was my truck.  So we left, went down to the Bend.  Two days later came back the same way and searched and found nothing.  I really wish I had climbed that fence and checked it out.  This was quite a few years ago, and I think most of the people that witnessed it with me have passed on.  I have had a few encounters in my life, that are odd.  I did have stage 4 cancer but at the present I am cancer free, and my wife , that listens to the Rense Show says I should share my encounters with the World.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Someone in our group said to look up. I looked up and saw a silver metallic disc in the southwest sky of our location. This object was zigzagging at such a fast rate. It was such an abnormal flight pattern. My first thought was that it was possibly a kite. So I looked down to see if anyone had a string below. After not seeing anyone below, I looked up again and continued to see this object zigzag. The best way I can think of describing what I saw is to compare it to someone holding a mirror or metal object, and then reflecting the sun off of it. The event lasted about 45 seconds. The metallic disc then just took off up and out of sight. There were no lights on it; no bulb; no haze; or any other crafts with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went home and expected to see something on the news about it. No such luck. Being that I was a juvenile at the time, I didn&#39;t really give it too much thought. I figured there had to be a rational explanation to what we had all seen. Then I figured, it couldn&#39;t be from outer space because UFO&#39;S were always depicted to hover, have lights and land. Not be visible in Chicago of all places. This recent report of the sighting at O&#39;Hare has compelled me to tell my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was just a few minutes after I entered the house that both of my sisters ran in the back door screaming that a giant black triangle had just flew over the house. My father and I ran out the back door and we could see the lights through the trees and could hear a low humming noise coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sisters said that the triangle pattern of stars had started moving down from the sky as they watched and then it glided right over the house with no sound until it passed.

I looked up and thought that I initially was seeing an aircraft coming in for a landing...not unusual, as I lived about 1 mile from New Bedford airport. The only reason that I continued to look for any length of time were (1) the craft was stopped...(2) no noise   (3) no blinking lights.  (4) strange appearance.  All of those quickly ruled out a chopper or plane, and every second the object seemed stranger.   As I watched, the shape was hard to determine but appeared somewhat triangular...there were lights, but they were just hues, no blinking.  There was no sound at all.  Craft made some sudden  &#34;nervous type&#34; moves, all followed by complete and sudden stops, which startled me.  It then slowly hovered across the highway, with a few complete stops,  then was completely stopped above the treeline in a non-occupied wooded area behind my home (I rented an attached apartment).  I ran and knocked on my landlord&#39;s door, but they were not in, and unfortunately I did not have any camera film.  The craft then went down behind the tree line in the wooded area.  I was shaken.  I was a school teacher (and still am)  I only told my parents and one other teacher in the area, and some close friends not from the area.  I overheard a student talking to another the next morning, stating he had &#34;seen something&#34; out near the New Bedford airport at appx. the same time...strikingly similar.  I did not talk to the student.  Another friend spoke to someone on an airplane from Boston a month later, a salesman, who suddenly spoke of seeing &#34;something weird&#34; recently....when asked where, he replied &#34;New Bedford Mass&#34;, along the highway and close to the airport.  I had never seen anything like this before, or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It began to pulsate and we heard a faint humming, and then it flew straight up, did about 3 loops, going higher each time.  Then it paused, it&#39;s glow seemed to get brighter, and it just took off at a super fast speed across the sky. Then the truck apparently started up by itself.  Our hair was full of static and the hair on our arms was standing on end...everything seemed to crackle from the static.  We sat for a moment, waiting to see if it would come back, but drove away after a bit.<n>

The sky was bright and clear. They were flying in a triangle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they were close enough for me to identify them, they looked like three burning, smoking clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were no more than 200 feet high, and they passed almost directly overhead. The bottom of these &#34;clouds&#34; looked like pure flame, violently churning inward toward the middle. The tops of these &#34;clouds&#34; were sort of bubbling, as the smoke did not rise in a column, but stayed with the body of these clouds of flame and smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen clouds like this before, nor have I seen any since. Some might think that the sun was setting, so the bottom of the clouds were reflecting the sun, but very high in the sky, I could see white clouds, and for them not to reflect the same red from the sun should be proof enough that it was not taken at sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These three clouds made no sound as they passed overhead at about two hundred feet, and traveling 60 to 80 miles an hour. These three clouds looked totally out of place for the sky above them. As they traveled toward me, a small amount of &#34;smoke&#34; did trail off from them. I remember the feeling of the hairs on my arm standing up, but I attributed this to static electricity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember thinking how weird, and unnatural they looked, but my first thought was they were some kind of tempture anomaly. Now all this would be left up to speculation, and disbelief if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that I had a still camera with me, and I took pictures of these three strange clouds as they came toward me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t until the movie Independence Day that I ever saw anything like clouds associated with UFOs. Recently I was listening to a program on television, and heard someone talking about UFOs that hid in a cloud or appeared like clouds. This made me look for the photos I have had for so long. I have found two of the three pictures I know I have. Two coming toward me, and one after they passed by and moving away from me. The two I have found should allow for a good investigation since they were taken close together, and you can see how the clouds details have changed in that short period of time. Below the clouds are buildings so I&#39;m sure a scale can be made from the pictures, and possibly the speed at which they traveled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If NUFORC is interested in the photos, please email me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I release them for investigation, I will have them copyrighted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date above are approximate.

When they turned back to see the object it had turned into a light and it streaked across the sky from north to southwest. The stranger part of this was that none of the witnesses recalled this event untill 12 years later. Currently the three sisters hold respectibale jobs and only one is a fanatic of ufology.

At that time I lived in the Juneau Receiving Home, awaiting foster care. Around 2 in the afternoon on a mid-June day, I had stepped out back for a cigarette.  In the back of this home was the driveway, a freestanding garage, and a dipsty dumpster. A woodland area surrounded the whole back side.  About 100&#39; from the porch and well into the wooded area lies a 10&#39;x10&#39; patch of concrete with a basketball hoop on it. When I stepped out, I noticed a deep black globe, about 3 feet in diameter, hovering in place about 80&#39; away and 18&#34; or so off the ground - right near the front edge of the basketball court.  The sphere was a pure black, almost as if it were a hole in space; yet I could tell it was fully 3-D and very real. Almost immediately after I noticed it, the sphere started drifting smoothly towards my right at about half a mile an hour. A low humming noise became evident at this point. The sound could be best described as the sound effect they use on Star Trek Voyager to indicate power going to the warp core; but it seemed lower and more intense. The object then emitted an intense, fan-shaped orange beam of some kind, directed towards my right; but sweeping slowly from right to left. As the beam swept past, objects in its path (tires, pop cans, etc.) glowed a kind of phosphorescent orange color; while the general background was darker. At this point I was more than concerned; I became somewhat frightened. When I turned towards the back door and reached for the doorknob (still looking at the sphere), the beam hit me, paralyzing me where I stood. And that&#39;s the last thing I remember, until finding myself back in my room some minutes later wondering just what the hell had happened. Just before this sighting occured, I had been trying to record shortwave radio broadcasts on my new JVC RC-M70 boombox. The tape was still running after the sighting - so being the curious person I was, I played my tape back.  At first, all I heard was what I expected: static-filled shortwave broadcasts. About 20 minutes into the tape, these broadcasts were replaced by a very odd warbling noise, modulated and remodulated with all kinds of harmonics; rising and lowering in general pitch with a period of about 20 seconds.This sound lasted for about fifteen minutes; after which the usual static &amp; faint shortwave station sounds resumed. Sometime between 1982 and 1990 the tape became lost though.  I sure wish it hadn&#39;t. There were no apparent physical effects from this encounter; although those strange paralyzing &#34;dreams&#34; from a previous sighting came back for a few weeks afterwards. The object didn&#39;t appear to be suspended by string or wire; the general terrain in that area would have absolutely forbidden any means of support for the kind of smooth, natural movement it had.  Not from above, not from the sides, and not from below.  My opinion of the object was that it may have been a probe of some kind; it was too small to have been a ship and it most definately wasn&#39;t a balloon. I never found out what happened to it; for it was already gone by the time I realised what had happened. Back during this time period, I was messing with lasers and electronics; and had constructed a device which produced some unusual EM effects; however this device had not been in operation for about a year before the sphere showed up; so I found no obvious connection between the two.<n>

My wife and I had stopped at a dairy store she went in as I waited in my truck. I was parked facing West about a block away was a two story building and over the top of it in the distance I saw an object that was long and wingless heading NE. The object seemed to be rotating as it went forward. As it rotated it changed color from flat black to shiney silver or reflective like chrome. Just then my wife came out of the store and I pointed it out she said to follow it. I drove North about 5 blocks West 1 block and North again for another 8 blocks. Meanwhile, the object was angling closer to our location. I was going about 35-40 mph and keeping with it. Then it slowed to a stop and hung in the air. My best guess is it was maybe 30- 50 ft. long and 200-300 feet in the air. At this point it was only about a block form my location. As we sat watching it hang there rotating chrome and flat black a young man walked by and I pointed it out to him and asked what he thought it was, he said he didn&#39;t know what it was and hurried on his way. We watched it for about two or three minutes then it started moving again. This time it headed So.E we had to go South to an East-west road and by the time we got to the next main road it gone behind the trees and we lost it. We went straight home and called the nearest AF base, Richards-Gabauer, in Missouri to report what we saw. They said they had no other reports but later that day the local weather man said the strange thing folks were seeing in the was a weather balloon.

This happened in broad daylight.  I thought I was familiar with most aircraft types since I have always been interested in flight and I spent 3 years in a Navy fighter squadron.  This &#34;vehicle&#34; matched nothing a had seen to date.  I thought at first it was a stealth fighter not having seen one at this time.  However, this craft was dull silver metallic in color and was shaped similar to a heart with all rounded contours. It had a small rounded nose like a pencil eraser that extended out from where the point of the heart would be.  It appeared to be made of one piece of &#34;metal&#34;, no windows, no vertical stabilizers, no apparent openings or exhaust ports of any kind.  It flew from north to south at approximately 1000&#39; elevation and was about 1/4 mile away from us.  My wife and I both saw it as the same shape and size.  I would say that it was about the size of a small airplane perhaps with a 30&#39; wing span.  It left no vapor trail and I could hear no sound, although I was driving in my vehicle at the time.  After about 2 seconds the trees hid my view of the craft and by the time I was clear again it was gone.  To this day I have never seen or heard of any craft including the now famous &#34;stealth&#34; jets that resemble what I and my wife saw that day.<n>

I lived within probally a mile or so of the landing pattern for Seymour Johnson AFB and have seen their planes numerous times. Also, my father was career Air Force and I have been around planes all of my life. To the point that I was able to identify certain types of planes just by hearing them, the distinct sounds they made. (Ex. F4&#39;s, C5A, C141&#39;s, F104 &amp; 105&#39;s to name a few) This particular evening I was about a mile from home, when I noticed &#34;these&#34; lights.  Being familiar with the area and what SJ landing pattern was, when I saw these lights, I thought to myself , &#34;these guys are really low&#34;.  I watched for about 30-45 seconds.  The lights appeared right at tree top level.  The closer I got to the lights, the lower the seemed to drop, now visibly seeing trees pass in front of these lights, evern at a distance. My thought at that point was, these guys are not going to make the runway.  From where I lived and where I saw these light and knowing where the runway was, they were just too low.  The runway was at least another mile to the east and they were at tree top level.  The first part of the road I was traveling on a straight away.  After about 30-45 seconds of watching this, the road turns to the right. No one on the roads at all that night. As I bear to the right towards my home, which is about 1/4 mile away now, I am now looking to my left, out of the drivers window, watching these light, which seem to bop from tree top level to below that and back up again.  At this point, I am really thinking that this plane is going to crash, these guys are in trouble and they are way too low.  Again, after I bear right and I&#39;m watching what I thought was an Air Force plane, I&#39;m only going about 20 mph, hardly taking my eyes off of this thing.  Also, there is a small wheat field off to my left on the other side of the road before the tree line. The tree line at this point where I am at is about 220-250 yards from the! road. As I&#39;m watching this thing, I use the term &#34;thing or lights&#34;, I notice something strange which at first I concluded was just some kind of optical illusion, because of the direction I am traveling now and the direction of the lights are traveling. I think SJ planes usually land in a west to easterly direction. I am now traveling west. As I&#39;m driving, I&#39;m glancing out of my window, the lights look like they are going in the same direction I am traveling.  I have my window down in the car as well, and after 150 or so feet, I begin thinking to myself, I should be hearing this thing as large as it is and it&#39;s seems to be going the same direction as me, this is really strange. So I pull my car to a stop. A complete stop in the middle of the road. I look out of my window and there slightly below tree top level is this huge craft of some type, now also, like me, stopped, not making a sound, no engine sound whatsoever, not moving, but clearly airborne and clearly a very large craft.  My best estimates on size were 300 ft long and about 40 foot high, multiple row of lights straight across for looked like each tier, three tiers. Anyway, I panicked after about 6-7 seconds of sitting there looking at this thing, punched the gas and flew home. I have had 2 other encounters/observations/sightings, one the very next night, at my house which was stange in itself and another about 10 years earlier when I lived in Alaska. The Alaska sighting I had was witnessed with a friend, whom I won&#39;t mention.<n>

I couldn&#39;t sleep and got up.  I went to the front door (which had a window in the top of it) to look outside at the neighboring houses.  We watched each other&#39;s houses to prevent crime.  I don&#39;t remember the date, or even the year.  I thought it was perhaps in the summer time because it was clear outside.  I was looking at the surrounding houses and happened to look up in the sky.  I was looking between two neighbor&#39;s houses.  In the sky I saw a triangle of 3 red lights.  The triangle seemed to remain in place for a period of time.  Then, in the blink of an eye, it moved from one place to another.  It didn&#39;t drift from one place to another like a balloon or a plane would do.  The lights weren&#39;t like an airplane&#39;s lights.  I came to the conclusion that it might be a UFO since I couldn&#39;t associate the lights or the movement with anything that I&#39;ve seen here.  I&#39;ve not seen anything else like it since.  This was my first experience with such a sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I felt annoyance and looked up and towards the right and seen a bright illuminated object moving at high velocity west, south west. um, the light seem to flash me like a glare. I watched it move peering at the shape wondering if I seen a satelite. I felt I seen a UFO. On reaching bridgeport I thought it followed me since miles away I thought I seen the object traveling east north east climbing in altitude. I seen my car had a dot I continued to notice when the car was parked. when I parked the car and walked away from it. I sensed something telekentic light occuring on the engine that would vanish abruptly. When I got to Bridgeport I thought I seen the object moving. I was completely alone on the highway 395 for some time and the jet fighter&#39;s didn&#39;t arrive until several minutes later.<n>

The space in between the lights were black and featureless. The ends were lightless and not much difference except a possible larger back end but not sure.The ufo produced no sound whatsoever. The craft was on a horizon track like following  the arc of the city lighted horizon where it turns blue to black sky. The craft was going at a steady fast pace that lasted no more than three seconds as I had sighted it to my right and followed it as far I could see it go to the left or north before leaving my field of vision. I had three other friends at the time with me but I could not even remark within that time of what I saw besides the ridicule I would have gotten with a mention of what I saw. As of this writing of this I am considering attempting making a paper mache replica of this since I still have a very vivid memory in my head of this occurance and desire to understand the craft and its movements like I have never have seen by any craft before or since by someone that used to work at an airport and know of planes fast and slow and none have ever compared to the speed and movement of said &#34;ufo&#34; that I had witnessed that life altering night.....there are other people in the skies and foolish are the people who do not believe in other life.<n>

I took a look down the lake to the east towards the marina some 3 miles away. I noticed two lights low in the sky which seem to be moving my direction, so I stopped and parked on the side of the road to watch. My thought was that it was an airplane heading to the airport to the west of my position. But as I watched, the two lights seperated to travel one on each side of the lake, both objects stayed at a very low altitude, possibly less than a 100 feet above the ground. This was really getting interesting. As they got within several hundred yards maybe further, the one on the right shore line moved across the lake to fall in behind the other and they passed my position one following the other, some 200 yard from me. The interesting traites where that these objects made no noise at all and as they passed, the objects stayed a ball of light no matter what angle they were to me, never did there appear to be any frame or structure to them. They may have been the size of possibly a truck tire, it is hard to figure the size and they did not have the halo glow like a street light, I don&#39;t recall them eluminating things. I watched as they passed and can&#39;t really remember how they left my vision. I had no missing time and have had no later memories of anything else happening other than the wonderful unexplainable sighting. Being a student of metaphysics, my interpertation of what I saw, was that these were energy beings checking on the state of the ecology here. Interesting to this was that a couple of weeks later, riding as a passenger in my sister&#39;s car, returning from visiting these friend again, crossing the same point, I looked out across the lake to the west and saw what appeared to be a UFO hovering and at that instance it appeared that a blue beam of light flashed from the object to the ground. Having recently read about abductions and that a lot of the people abducted stated that they were moved from the ground to the ship on a beam of blue light, I would guess an abduction may have been in process. This second encounter now adds the possible purpose of the first sighting as that maybe they were locating this abductee. I was unable to watch the second sighting unfold, being that may sister had no intention of stopping that close to what could be a UFO. I feel extemely fortunate to have had this experience as it has helped to open my mind to the fact that there is more going on around us than we can ever imagine.<n>

I always think about this experience even though its been over 20 years ago and really started to think about it after that police dash cam caught that light in the sky recently... that is exactly what me and a few friends saw out in the country while playing outside. We all were around 16 years old and in pitch darkness or at least hardly any light. It was very late and all of the sudden the whole sky lighted up like daytime and we all could see each other. It was so weird and we talked about it after but we never told anyone as we were kids and just thought it was a big meteorite.... I however have it etched in my mind that it was way way to bright for a meteor. It brought light as if it was daytime. The ground and everything lit up as if it was daytime. It was almost as bright as the sun or so it seemed. We actually could see each other for about 10 to 20 seconds. If you ever heard about this incident, I would really like to know what it was. I am not sure about the date but it was either in 81, 82 or possibly 83. I think it was closer to 82.  I also had another strange thing happen in a dream I had about a UFO one night. I used to live by fresno state college and one night had a dream about a ufo. The next day there was a crop circle in the field that was part of fresno states ag department. It happened right about the time that the movie &#39;signs&#39; was coming out about the ufo crop circles. They said it was a college prank but I thought it was strange that I would have a dream about it the night before it was seen. The dream was very strange and I could actually see the craft. The next day it was found. They would not let anyone in the field to view the evidence and threatened to prosecute any students that destroyed the crops. They said it was a prank but never caught anyone and never let anyone in the field to view the evidence. Anyway I always thou! ght that was a strange coincidence... the dream and the crop coming after it. remember, I was living at the time about a block away from where the crop circle showed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

During this time I fought off a very numbing feeling (I almsot felt drowsy) that I believe was caused by the flying object. It was not bigger than a car and it traveled with the cars.  As if bored with what it was doing it rose and went up 2 or 3 cars which traveled in front of me. Finally, it rose and sped at an incredible speed over the small town.  I&#39;m sure that no one besides me can remember it. I fought to stay on top of the incredible spectacle I witnessed.  I went home to tell my family and they all said that it must be something the government was testing.<n>

My parents had a 1982 Z28 and they used to let my sister and I ride on the back part of the hatch.  We would look up at the sky while my parents drove. I was doing so one night and saw a bright light that looked exactly like a star in the sky.  The only thing is that the light would move from one point in the sky to another extremely fast.  It would move across the entire sky in the blink of an eye.  I tried to notify my parents and they just blew me off saying something like yea that is neat. It did this about 4 or 5 times I would say.  It was not a straight line back and forth. It would go to one side, and then go down. E to W, then W to NE and so on.  Then it just vanished.

From directly behind the screen appeared a huge chevron shaped craft with many white and orange lights along the forward edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People instantly started yelling and screaming while pointing to it, several cars started and drove quickly and erratically out of the drive-in lot.  I heard no noise, but the noise of everyone in the lot was fairly loud so it would have been hard to hear anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several people starting yelling that it was &#34;ultra-lights&#34;, (small planes), and I felt very strongly at that moment that this thing was one object and not a formnation of several objects.  I am lucky enough to have also witnessed the small craft (ultra-lights) that were indeed flying the Hudson Valley at the same time as the famous triangle ufo and I can say with conviction that the two sighting were instantly and exceedingly different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first craft was very slow, very steady and it seemed that a jogger would easily keep up with it.  The second sighting of the ultra-lights was easily recognized as a formation of small aircraft, unable to stay in precise formation, drifting towards and away from each other, and recognizable engine noise as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the second sighting was not really a chevron shape, but more of a sloppy semi-circle of small white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can understand how those who never saw the first could dismiss the rash of sightings as bogus when they saw the second, but those of us who saw both things cannot be convinced they were one and the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although there were hundreds of witnesses at the drive-in that night, and the craft moved slowly towards Peekskill city proper and many more must have seen it, I don&#39;t recall reading or hearing any report of it specifically.  At the time it was one of the first of many sightings of this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate it to be about 200-300 feet at its widest and nearly that long as well.  There was a smaller red light at its center.  The larger lights were huge themselves, maybe 20-30 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw similar lights (very large) during daylight about three years later moving in the exact same valley as the drive-in, many people pulled off the road to see them as the were BELOW tree level.  The sighting lasted only a minute or so, and there were several  huge white lights in a staggered pattern.  I could not make out any structure, even though this was a midday sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/1/82 21:00|Great Falls|MT|Circle|3 days|Another troubling episode that has been even harder to explain when considering aspects of the Kicksburg, Pennslyvania UFO Sighting.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64441.html|44|ndxe198206| Another troubling episode that has been even harder to explain when considering aspects of the Kicksburg ((sic--Kecksburg)), Pennslyvania UFO Sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want you to understand that the date of this FireBall streaming across the treeline from my position facing toward Hartford in the south and to the existing river coming from the northeastern sector of the state from the other side of the forest just outside Enfield, Connecticut was the exact path this Orb took heading in a northeastern direction. It appeared as I said as if the sun itself had fallen from the sky because of its massive size and the circular diameter of the sphere, it made no sound and nor was there a sound previous to its appearance to indicate a major explosion of some magnitude coming from that region of the countryside, it appeared as though it was approximately 10 miles or so from the street we lived on that ran parallel to the trajectory of the object in question and that of the river on the other side of the forest, it was heading in a north, northeasterly direction after I reviewing my homes position to that of Hartford and the river that passed along side of Enfield and headed directly toward the Hartford vicinity, the Smith Family lived directly behind our house on the next block, the Zimmermans a few more streets over from them, if my bearings are correct. The silence of such a huge sphere ROLLING across the tree tops and emitting whipping flames from upon its surface gave you the feeling that the core of this object was solid while its surface was entirely engulfed in a all encompassing mass of burning gases and surface material, no wind, not a whisper of the massive flight of this globe of fire could be heard, no crash, no explosion, its as if it was headed toward the coastline and gravity had no effect on its elevation as it traveled the distance from which I was could visually detect and remain captivated by its enormous size and silence as it moved through the evening sky to a destination I had no indication wwas close by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d like to mention yet another personal experience, that wasn&#39;t so personal when you consider all the news at the time that was generated in the Community of Great Falls, Montana shortly after the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II. It was months later and I had contacted a local priest from Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Great Falls . This priest has since been removed from active service with the general public, he has suffered a stroke on the left side of his body and his memory isn&#39;t exactly what it use to be. In the early 1980&#39;s, maybe around May of 1982, during that late spring month my wife and I was awakened by a glowing light from the back yard of our home that was hovering over our very large weeping willow tree. The air was still and the sounds in the distance echoed as if you were inside a tunnel.  Across the alley, on the next block at 2606-5th Avenue South a police car was parked in the middle of the street looking directly into our backyard, the sound of breaking glass could be heard for a very brief second from that location, the whole area of the neighborhood was as if it were in a vacuum.  Above our tree was a cloud that resembled a Maltesse Cross, its four triangular shaped inner arms were of a stewing blackness that could only be understood from the depths outside our planets atmosphere. The other portions of that Maltesse Cross between the cross figure itself was pure white and just as luminous as the light of a full moon on a clear night, even that of a bright florescent blub. It hummed as though discharging a message or extracting a source of matter that had called it forth in the midnight hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This experience has vanished from most all records in the area after a military investigator came to the area and researched the sighting that many residents of Great Falls had reported to the Great Falls Tribune and to Military officials at Malmstrom AFB the days following its appearances, this phenomenon occurred during a period when I was employed for about a 6 month period as a supervisior at a local Sambo&#39;s Restraurant. The incident was centered at 2605-6th Avenue South in Great Falls , Montana. These kinds of personal experiences for some reason attach themselves to the psychi of those individuals and never let go, who wouldn&#39;t feel a special bond to these events that defy logic according to investigators that remain true to their integrity? This is yet another unexplained event that now appears to be totally erased from the record books because of government involvement. The priest I mentioned earlier is in a housing facility run by the church for aging priests in Great Falls . This priest was contacted by me the morning of that Maltesse Cross had hovered over our tree. I spoke with Father Herinko a number of times about this event and told him that for some reason or another I was certain that Light would remain in the area for three more days and could be spotted above in the evening sky&#39;s canopy in its original shape in a northwest trajectory as a group of distinguished cloud formations resembling that Maltesse Cross or wheel with spokes; you think that during that time satillites would have detected this formation, maybe the military did! I expect the Great Falls Tribune that had front page coverage of this event from so many callers would still have information on this case in question, I think they do, but find it very difficult to locate. That priest after that event was over was removed from his position at Our Lady of Lourdes Church and placed in a small church about 30 miles out of town on Highway 200, I believe the town was Fort Shaw that serves about 150 perishioners. I found that stra! nge seei ng he was only in his earlier fifties and was the priest in charge of not only the church services, but the grade school it operated in the community of Great Falls . Well, that night of the Maltesse Cross incident I told my wife as we stood 30 feet from that tree looking up at the swirling mass of black ink and that extremely white soft halo that divided the two prominent features into very distinct patterns that I should go and venture up to the tree and climb-up and see what if anything would occur... she ruled against it and seemed only interested in going back into the house and finishing her sleep. The police car was still parked in the middle of the street watching the figure with, I suspect, much interest. I imagine the police report was sanitized, as well in this actual case of multiple sightings that week, it shouldn&#39;t have been. Maybe you can further investigate and inform me as to what your findings were! Another aspect of this event which was discussed with the priest was the Montana State License Plate on my Vehicle, &#34; Sacrum&#34;. I had mailed one of these license plates to Pope John Paul II with a note that his life was in immediate mortal danger, that was 7 days from the attempt on his life where he was shot and a bullet struck his sacrum bone, go figure... I had never written a letter like that to anyone before, quite a coincidence, I had never communicated with the church prior to this event, but I did have an undeniable urge to get personalized license plates earlier that year... it was a plate that caused some interest with local officals, I retired that license plate after that incident. I was mostly consumed with getting my wife pregnant, my doctor told me forget it after numerous visits to his office... around 9 months after the Maltesse Cross incident we had a son... in 1983. His eyes were as if oriental, that&#39;s always puzzled me a bit. He&#39;s a good son, he works two jobs, has graduated from college with 3 degrees in business, I feel I&#39;m very blessed to have him. It&#39;s funny how life e! volves, it&#39;s amazing the mysteries that sometimes make those blessings seem all the more important in our own particular lives. If you find the information concerning this event in Great Falls during that time frame drop me a line, at the time I failed to document this important event in my life seeing it was all over the news at the get go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((initials deleted))<n>

We were hanging out on the roof of my parents house, just talking a looking at stars. It was a clear night and we would see an occasional plane pass by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then from the SE we saw a dim white light moving NW with another light rotating around it, on a horizontal plane.  The altitude appeared to be very high (I can’t estimate an altitude, it was just a light about the brightness of a star) moving very fast.  No sound.  Once it crossed the sky (approx 10-15 seconds), suddenly the rotating light separated and a third light crossed their path on a northern trajectory.  The light which broke off, I can’t remember it’s final trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since become a private pilot and have studied various aircraft at different altitudes.  I can say that it was definitely not an aircraft or any type of meteor.<n>

(81-82ish)  My grandfather, uncle and I were driving back to Lima, Ohio from a stamp and coin show in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was already dark out (not sure of the season, but I don&#39;t recall it being winter).  We were on the highway (I believe it&#39;s highway 70) and I was sleeping in the back seat of the car. I was awakened by the sound of my grandfather and uncle trying taking about something they were looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I leaned forward over the front seat and saw a large circular object in the sky, it had white lights on the bottom and red lights on it&#39;s sides (it might have been red on bottom and white on the sides, it was long ago).

The lights appeared for 1 to 2 minutes total and did not disappear except from view by going behind some trees. They appeared to be single lights, not multiple lights seen from a distance.  They looked like stars except for they were moving or twinkling.  They were about half or two thirds the brightness of Jupiter.  They moved about as fast as a commercial jetliner does but I&#39;m not sure of the distance, they could have been moving faster.  I don&#39;t think it was cold outside so it must have at least not been in the winter.  It was about 1982.  I saw them above Tullahoma Tennessee.  There was an air force base and a space institute nearby at the time.  I think that they are still there.  The triangle and  lights formed was about the width in the sky as an outstretched palm at arms length.  There was no audible sound. They came together from different parts of the sky without ever turning around the way a plane might and came together into what seemed like an isosceles triangle, then moving back the way they had come.  That&#39;s all I can do for you!  :)  Good luck, (Personal information deleted by HBCC UFO Research)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for sharing the report with NUFORC.

Off to the west  i noticed a sphere shaped object that appeared to be glowing as a fire. I watched as it seemedto climb parralel to a radio tower (the tower is a 1/2 mile away,the object was further) for about 3-5 minutes.Then with no warning it seemed to pulse brighter,as it reached the top of a tower i was using as a guide/landmark. but it didnt disappear,it appeared to intenseify if you will....it started giving off what looked like miniature sized objects of itself,i watched as about 6-8 of these objects came off and flew off in different directions.After the objects left the Larger shape (which i believe to be a mothership of somekind) decreased its firey glow ,then moved straight about what looked to me 100&#39; then took off toward the north at great speed. This was the 1st of 2 sightings like this i saw in that week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i stated in the earlier summary this was only the first sighting of 2 i would see in that week.I will tell about the 2nd here.As usual i had taken the dog out about 1700-1800hrs. I noticed that the object i had seen a few days earlier was back. It was sitting adjacent to the towers again in almost the same exact location as it was previous.The Object appeared to be very large but distant.It kinda reminded me of a small sun or moon glowing a yellowish glow. After watching this it again pulsed really bright,but this time it didnt dispatch the smaller objects it was recalling them. I watched as 6-8 small objects exact duplicates of the larger one but smaller return to the larger object.after they had returned which took about 5-6 minutes i realized my parents were inside i hollered for them to come see the object i saw earlire in the week as i had told them of the previous sighting. After they had come on the porch the object again took off to the north at great speed.If memory serves this was a time when several objects had been seen in our area and sevral were reported to our local Air Force Base which has now closed.I have never seen this event again since.<n>

It was flying very low, very slow and very close to me. It was avancing.It was flying on top of an empty field. I thought it was beautiful. I looked at it probably few seconds but it seems long minutes to me.I had time to really look at it. Then I realized that it was an ufo, I got a little bit scared and ran to my mum to tell her. She was talking with my auntie in front of the house. She did not pay attention to what I said. So, I went back where I saw it and it was gone. I looked on my right, my left, up, nothing.

We all saw what I am about to describe-  three lights in a triangular form, though we never saw the form of the vehicle.  They floated, hovered and moved slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were equidistant from one another, and they were white--and very very bright.  They remained the same distance from each other, the entire time, and it appeared to be 3 lights on the same craft.  I never saw an acutal craft, just the lights of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights moved FAR to slowly to be a normal object (like a plane), and at times didn&#39;t appear to be moving at all. I realize that objects appear to move slower than they actually are, the farther away they are.  I know that objects can look smaller than they are the farther away they are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years, as I have tenatively, and cautiously shared this story with a few select people, I have been given the following explanations.  &#34;Sue, you probably saw an airplane.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, do airplanes hover?   Are there lights completely equidistant, like the lights on the point of an equilateral triangle?   Do they hover? I know that they can appear to hover, if they are far enough away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the size of these lights made it impossible for them to have been that far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suggestion number 2:  &#34;Maybe you saw a spot light.&#34;   Maybe...if there were three spotlights and they moved in a straight line, and all moved together;  and, if they hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suggestion number 3:  &#34;Maybe your eyes were playing tricks on you.&#34;   Okay... for over half an hour, that&#39;s a long time for my eyes to adjust to the night light, whatever.   But what about my witnesses?  After being ridiculed, I decided it best just to let this event in my life stay private.   I am now 42, and I was 18 when this happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, you are the third person I have shared this with, Mr. Moderator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is your opinion?

One morning as I stood staring off at Victoria I saw 3 very large oval orange glowing objects hovering over the water near Victoria, they then moved off to one direction together and stopped and then back to the opposite direction and stopped and then flew what seemed to be straight towards me and then straight up and disappeared. I have never forgotten that event and never will. That proved to me that we are NOT alone..I knew that it was not from this planet and I knew that it wasnt something normal just from the way that it flew back &amp; forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It might have been 1983, but I am pretty sure that I had just completed my first year of college and I have a vague memory of feeling irresponsible about missing too many days of work at my part-time job. I have to admit that I can&#39;t pin this down exactly. I know it happened no earlier than 1982 and no later than 1984. There were green leaves on the trees; the temperature was neither particularly hot nor cold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a close friend who was several years younger. I think I was 19-20 years old, so she was 16 or 17. Her father was a boy scout troop leader, and he, her mother, and other adults were taking their troop camping at Swallow Falls State Park, near Oakland, Maryland. (Here is the url for more information: http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/western/swallowfalls.html.) She was a bit of a problem teen, and there was no way that her parents were going to let her stay home alone while they took the troop to Swallow Falls. She had to go, but they told her that she was allowed to bring a friend. She asked me and I agreed to go along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at the Swallow Falls camping maps, I believe that we camped in the Youth Group Loop. I’m not sure exactly where on the loop we were positioned (http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/maps/msfmap.html), but my gut tells me we were in camp site number 2 (http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/maps/sfyg.html). I am sure that no one was in camp site 3, but I am not clear if any one was in camp 1. I have no recollection of seeing any other campers outside our party during the entire trip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The camping loop went fairly deep into the forest of huge old trees. On the first night, there was a heavy rain storm. My friend and I were sleeping on the ground in a small two-man tent. We were utterly miserable; our tent was damp and leaking. It kept raining into the next day, and in fact, by the evening, it was absolutely pouring. We decided to spend the night in her father&#39;s car. It was parked facing the loop road, next to the encampment. My friend, who was a tiny person, took the backseat, and I planned to sleep in the driver&#39;s seat in recline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recall that we sat in the car talking for hours while the rain pounded the car. I don’t remember thunder or lightning, just driving rain and some winds. I don’t think the car had a lighted clock. (Now that I think about it, I’m not sure cars had lighted clocks in the early 1980s.) But I guess it was around midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point while we conversed, I noticed a light through the front windshield.  I can remember that it illuminated the hard streaks of rain hitting the glass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both stopped talking, so I assume that she also saw the light. I never turned my head to look at her in the back seat as the light wended its way toward us. It was yellow-greenish and about as bright as a car headlight pointed full on very bright. It did not have a defined shape because of this brightness, but I assume its core was round. It moved smoothly, about 3-5 feet from the ground, swerving gently a few times to avoid trees. I remember wondering whether it was a car on the muddy loop coming from camp 1. Then I thought, &#34;Maybe it’s someone walking with a really bright lantern.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> My last memory of the light is as it reached the front of our car.  I retain an image of it crossing in front of us, as if it was going to follow the loop out of the woods to the parking area.  But I can’t recall it actually doing that.  I think I saw it start to illuminate the tents that were to my right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I remember is disorientation then turning around to my friend to say, &#34;That was weird.&#34; The two of us immediately picked up our conversation from before the light appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that night in the woods, I didn’t think about the odd light for years. I don’t recall ever mentioning it to anyone until the early 1990s, when I read a description of ball lightning.  How it can glide and make unusual maneuvers. I decided that was what we had seen and mentioned it to my husband and friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was in my 30s, my friend visited from Arizona, where she then lived. I asked her if she remembered that night in the car. She did, except for the light. In her memory, we sat in the car talking in the driving rain until we fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, after another decade of consideration, I’m no longer sure what I saw was ball lightning and lean more toward a UFO-type experience or that I am simply misremembering an event with a rational explanation: a car; a camper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to rule out it was a vehicle for several reasons. First, there was only one light, not two, although I concede it could have been a car with one headlight. But I don’t remember a car. Second, the only source for a car would have been camp site 1. From where I sat, site one would have been at approximately 1 o’clock. I would have been at roughly 7 o’clock. My memory is of the light coming toward us from about 10 o’clock, out of the woods. I don’t remember seeing camp site 1 occupied. If it was, and this was a car from that site, why would they drive the long way around the unpaved, muddy loop in the storm to exit into the parking area?  Was it a person with a lantern? It might have been someone armed with an incredibly bright light, but I don’t remember a person. I’ve wondered if it was someone from camp site 1 walking to the toilets. I personally have no memory of the bathhouse that is shown on the youth group loop detail, however, a site 1 camper would again be taking a very long route to get to the toilets, through driving rain on a muddy trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also wonder about the disorientation I felt. I don’t know exactly what time it was when the light appeared, so I don’t know if we were missing time, but something felt wrong. I also wonder why my friend and I never discussed it, and why I barely recalled the incident until I read the description of ball lightning years later. I don’t remember any other experiences that could be construed as abductions. Perhaps they were coming for her? We had a falling out in the late 1990s and no longer are in touch or I’d ask her if she has had further experiences. Aliens? A one-headlight car? Another camper? Ball lightning? I don’t know what I saw that night and I never will, I suppose. It’s been bothering me so much recently that I thought I should file a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

A friend of mine and his dad were coming back from the Bellaire movie theater in Euless. during the drive home we saw a long line of cars on what seemed to be a back road that we were on. all of the cars were stopped as well as ours. Just to the left of us and all of the other cars was a huge oval shaped craft about the size of a football field. it was covered in lights and moving extremely slow. it looked to be a hundred feet off the ground. it was so long ago that i cannot remember what happened after that. I know there were alot of other cars there that were watching the same thing. Im twenty five years old now and have tried to find anything in the old news papers relating to the incident at that time. It happened during the time Tron was in theaters.Upon asking my friend about it years later he acted strange and avoided the question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
