I was a young teen accompanied by a friend for these witnessings.  The object was across the Ohio River from us, hovering over a large steel mill (J&amp;L Steel in Aliquippa, PA)  The object would hover for many moments, then move extremely quickly to another location, hover - and then streak to a new location and hover again while we watched.  It was &#39;saucer-shaped&#39; - the main color being an orangish-peachish (almost fluorescent) rim with a black rotating center.  We could definitely see the center rotating separately from the main body of the craft.  We saw this craft on probably 3 -4 occasions within the span of 2 - 3 weeks and each time we witnessed it, it would stay visible for about 20 mintues or so. We told our parents about it, but of course were not believed... As time went on though, I talked to quite a few people in the vicinity who had witnessed the same thing.  Why it was never reported to anyone, I have no idea!! PS:  I am now 54 years of age, and have never forgotten these episodes.  I live a normal life working my 9 -5 job, and am not some sort of nut!!!  :-)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
4/15/59 21:00|Mendham|NJ|Disk|five minutes|A saucer-shaped UFO hovered at eye-level about fifty feet away for five minutes, then took off at great speed.|1/31/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34670.html|2|ndxe195904| A saucer-shaped UFO hovered at eye-level about fifty feet away for five minutes, then took off at great speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was attending boarding school run by Episcopalian (Anglican Catholic) nuns in Mendham, New Jersey.  It was situated on a large, rather remote piece of property.  My dorm room was on the top floor of the main building on the back side under the eaves. The building, itself, was on a hill, so that the back rooms were four floors above ground level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just after lights out and I was lying in bed with the windows open.  The room was tiny and the bed was about four feet from the windows, which came down to about two and a half feet above the floor.  I heard a sudden very, very low thrumming noise which appeared to be right over the roof.  It lasted for about three seconds and faded.  I had never heard a sound quite like it and wondered what it had been.  I decided to get up and have a look out the window.  I kneeled down and looked out and saw a saucer-shaped object hovering at my eye level over the tennis courts about fifty feet away.  UFO&#39;s were not really in my consciousness at that time, so I didn&#39;t comprehend what I was seeing at first. The craft seemed to be shaped like a round clam shell.  It had approximately four or five large colored lights (or lights that changed color - white, red, green) spaced around its rim and it appeared to be revolving slowly because I could see the  lights moving to the back and then reappearing around the other side.  I kept asking myself what on earth this thing was and then suddenly realized with horror that it was a UFO.  I was terrified.  I silently begged it over and over again not to land.  While I watched it, it slowly descended toward the ground.  It stopped and hovered about ten feet above the ground (I couldn&#39;t hear the thrumming noise from that distance), then it rose a few feet, it tilted a little one way, then tilted a little another way, then descended again, then rose again.  All of a sudden, without any prior warning movement, it took off from the hovering position at enormous speed and disappeared over the very far off horizon in about two to three seconds. It looked like a star as it disappeared. The horizon was many, many miles away (I was high up on the hill and could see a great distance).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, I went to my Physics teacher and told her what I had seen.  She believed me but told me not to say anything to anyone because I would be labeled a nut, at best, and maybe thrown out of school at worst.  She then confided that she and her husband had recently seen something while they were driving at night, but she dared not tell anyone for fear of losing her job and she swore me to secrecy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family all said I was hallucinating and I just decided that it must have been some military experimental aircraft that I would soon be seeing flying the skies.  But the years went on and I didn&#39;t see it manufactured.  Years later, I was sitting beside a top-level air force officer at a conference, told him what I had seen, and asked him why this experimental craft had never made it into production and use.  He looked at me and said, &#34;That wasn&#39;t a military prototype.  You saw a UFO. We see them all the time.  We have no idea what they are, but they are commonplace.&#34;  I have to say that it was a relief to have my experience authenticated like that.  Later on, I read accounts by other people who saw almost exactly what I saw and who described the same take-off speed of the craft.  I have since seen several other UFO&#39;s, the most recent in January in Georgia, which I reported on this site.  It was very different from the first one I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
4/1/59 01:00|Miami|FL|Sphere|30-45 Minutes|1959 childhood encounter with a spherical, faceted object, that had landed in my back yard in Miami.|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60545.html|3|ndxe195904| 1959 childhood encounter with a spherical, faceted object, that had landed in my back yard in Miami.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was some time in 1959.  I can&#39;t verify the date.  I was 5 and hadn&#39;t started school yet.  My family lived in Miami (our address was considered to be Opa Locka) but I would attend school the next year in Carol City.  We lived a short distance from the Opa Locka airport (then, a military airport).  Our home was not near anything but rock pits and cow pastures.  We lived on 1/2 acre lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some time, in the middle of the night, I woke up.  I saw the cat was inside and followed her through the house.  She wanted to go outside, so I opened the door and I followed her outside.  I walked into our backyard and saw at the back corner of our yard a large dark sphere.  Curious, I went closer to see what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object sitting in our yard was about 40&#39; in diameter and faceted - like a disco ball.  The facets were small and bevelled, but clear - like glass.  There was a lot of moonlight, so I could see the color of the glass appeared to be bronze.  There was no light emanating from it, but it looked like whatever was in it could have seen out the glass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became afraid thinking that a door might open (and maybe it did - because I have a vague memory of seeing a black ramp extend from the lower fourth of it) and ran back inside the house and locked the door.  (Back then we NEVER locked a door.)  The next morning, my mother asked me what I was doing up.  (I think my return to the house and slamming the door woke her up.)  I told her I was letting the cat out of the house.  She thought I was sleepwalking, she said the cat wasn&#39;t left in the prior night.  I can&#39;t remember if I told her what I saw in the back yard.  If I did, that too was probably written off as &#34;sleepwalking.&#34;  I may talk in my sleep, but I have not had any other experience with sleepwalking.  After this incident, I began having a recurring nightmare about being abducted by people who looked like my parents, but weren&#39;t.  I would be in the back seat of the car riding along with my parents, when I would realize they were different, not my parents.  I would jump out of the moving car and run back to my grandparents&#39; home.  When I would get there, my parents would be there.  But, I could tell they weren&#39;t my parents either.  This recurring nightmare went on for about two years before subsiding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 53, female, have a slightly above-average IQ, and that&#39;s it.  I have often wondered if there&#39;s a relationship between the nightmare and the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
