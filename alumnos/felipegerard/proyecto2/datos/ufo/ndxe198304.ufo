I observed something in the sky going very fast and flying very low(about 100 feet). The strange thing about this object was the way it looked. The best way I can describe it is as a &#34;jellyfish&#34; type thing. It was probably moving at about 70-90 MPH. We didn&#39;t get a very good look at it. All I know is it was not something I had ever seen or something I have seen since. I would estimate the size as about 100 feet long and 60-70 feet wide. It could have been a ship of some kind. It was either clear or it was distorting the air around it. I use the term jellyfish loosly because it didn&#39;t look like one, that is just a good way to describe the exterior. My mother and aunt looked at each other and asked &#34;did you see that?, what was that? and also turned to me to see if I had seen it. Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had just crossed over into Arizona when I saw what I thought was a meteor heading towards the earth.  It started to get so close to the ground that we pulled the truck over to observe.  Other vehicles on I-10 also pulled over and watched this most amazing sight.  In a split second the object stopped dead in its tracks and hovered there making a whomm whomm whomm sound.  Then it split into two balls of like fire and started moving in and out of each other.  It looked like the sign for atomic energy!  After I have no idea how long, it formed toghether as one and landed on the ground.  I have no idea how much time passed before everyone that had stopped just got back into their vehicles and drove away.  This experience has had a profound impact on my life and opened my mind to other forms of intelligence.  It is something that I will never forget!<n>
4/23/83 20:30|Oshkosh|WI|Triangle|10 minutes|Triangular Object in 1983 exactly like one reported here May 2003 from Kirkland, WA|9/12/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31373.html|3|ndxe198304| Triangular Object in 1983 exactly like one reported here May 2003 from Kirkland, WA<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am responding as I read a reported sighting posted here (May 2003) that a triangular shaped object was reported in Kirkland, WA in Feb. of 2003. This person&#39;s description is exactly what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home with my two daughters and first I noticed what appeared to be two close aircraft flying quite high together and a high speed. My daughter, who was in the front seat, then noticed that after they crossed the sky (coming from east and moving west) all of a sudden turned around (in perfect formation) and came right back what seemed to be toward us. I was curious, and didn&#39;t want to continue driving on the highway, so pulled over into a school parking lot just off the highway. The object was just above the tree line and that was when I saw the outer shape of it, we then realized it was one object and those two bright lights were on each end and an amber light in the center front point and the huge size (I went back in the daytime with a friend the next day just to figure out just how big this shape was) and it was the whole length of the parking lot plus almost the length of the school building...so maybe 200&#39;??. There was just enough light to see this shape of a &#34;long V or triangle shape. My girls were quite upset, one in the back kept saying she didn&#39;t want to die and I didn&#39;t want to drive &#34;under it&#34; as the exit was underneath what seemed to be the front of it. It had the light arrangement similar to the Washington state one and my observed object did stop and hover just above the treeline in front of my car. It too did on/off of lights especially in the center edge closest to us. Those lights were colored like the &#34;old computer screen green&#34; and I got the feeling as they were pulsating back and forth that it was taking pictures of us. It then abruptly made a right angle turn and departed south and accelerated up at a very rapid speed with absolutely no sound. About two weeks I went back again and noticed all the trees in the path of its departure were defoliated. To this day, they are dead still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girls were in denial and didn&#39;t want me to go blabbing all around about it...and only a year later on the &#34;Today&#34; show was there a sighting in New York that around 400 people saw/called in and an artist drawing of the description was on TV and it looked exactly what we saw. My younger daughter finally after seeing that on TV opened up and we started talking about it again. I have never forgotten this incident (It is my second sighting...other one was back in 1960 in broad daylight and others saw it (people eating at a Sandy&#39;s drivein)...but it was a small metallic disk with something rotating and hovered just above the telephone in my back yard. I was out working in a tomato patch and again I had a feeling of &#34;pictures being taken&#34; and then it just moved vertically up at an incredible speed and disappeared. (amongst all the gaping people chomping on their hamburgers)...so I continue to search the skies, read other people&#39;s sightings and feel some comfort that my &#34;triangular&#34; object has been seen by others. Fortunately, we did not have any &#34;missing time&#34; or strange marks on us....just my mental imprint that &#34;other things are out there&#34;. I am a passenger in a Cessna 170 and many times we have flown over the area....at night there is a striking strobe light acorss Lake Winnebago...maybe the triangular craft was honing in on that or &#34;mapping in picture form of the area??. I just can&#39;t imagine it &#34;singling out our car&#34; to play &#34;light games&#34; with.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It made no sound and took off at a right abrupt angle and soared back up into the sky. Two weeks later, we went back and the trees/vegetation area was all defoliated and it took about 6 years life to come back to that what seemed to be the &#34;take off&#34; point. It was so close that I didn&#39;t want to drive &#34;under it&#34;...Something just made me stay put in our car. My girls to this day never forgot what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

I HAPPENED TO LOOK OUT THE BACK WINDOW BECAUSE I SAW A GLARE FROM MY PERIFERAL VISION. THERE WAS A HUGE LIGHT FLOATING OVER OUR HOUSE, CLOSER TO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE. I CALLED MY 2 BROTHERS (1 YOUNGER, 1 OLDER) AND SHOWED THEM. NOW I WAS ABOUT 15 YEARS OLD AND WAS INFATUATED WITH OUTER SPACE. THIS IS HOW I KNOW IT WASN&#39;T A HELLICOPTER OR ANY CRAFT OF THIS PLANET. IT WAS THERE FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES, ABOUT 20 FT. ABOVE THE ROOF. WE WENT OUTSIDE AND STOOD ALMOST UNDER IT. IT DIDN&#39;T MOVE. I REMEMBER EVERY DETAIL LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY. WHEN WE WERE OUTSIDE I REMEMBER LOOKING TO SEE IF I COULD SEE WHAT KIND OF MATERIAL IT WAS MADE FROM BUT COULND&#39;T TELL. ALL WE COULD SEE IS LIGHT BUT IT WASN&#39;T BLINDING. I LISTENED TO SEE IF I HEARD ANY SOUND COMING FROM IT, BUT THERE WAS NONE, THIS IS HOW I KNOW IT  WASN&#39;T A CHOPPER. AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES WE MOVED FROM THE WINDOW, WALKED BACK TO THE WINDOW AND IT WAS GONE. I KNOW WHAT I SAW, AND I REMEMBER IT VIVIDLY. I USED TO THINK ONLY CAUCASIONS SAW UFO&#39;S, I AM AFRICAN AMERICAN, AND FROM THAT DAY ON I AM A TRUE BELIEVER. OH, I DON&#39;T KNOW IF THIS IS OF ANY SIGNIFICANCE, BUT OUR HOUSE IS ABOUT A MILE FROM THE BEACH. I AM NOW 34 YEARS OLD, MY BROTHERS, WHEN I ASK THEM ABOUT THAT NIGHT, TO THIS DAY SAY &#39;THEY DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS, BUT LET&#39;S NOT TALK ABOUT IT&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ST.

We were on our 40&#39; boat.  I was outside on the stern, one early morning, when I noticed our dog on the edge of the boat and looking down at the ocean rather nervously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to him right away and saw what&#39;s best described as intermittent sparks three to five feet above the ocean.  They were coming out of the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around our boat and it was on all sides of us.  (We were in the middle of it)   As we were moving (I believe it lasted about five mintues) I put my fingers in it with no reaction.  However, my fingers were not wet!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This really spooked me.  Nothing else happened.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wheatland-Douglas 1983 CattleMutilations UFO&#39;s seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While an undergradute student at the University of Wyoming, I had a job working at the University stock farm out in West Laramie.  My co-worker and I were called into the state veterinary labe which was across the road from the stock farm.  We were sworn in as livestock brand inspectors and were told that our intructors were told reschedule any quizzes or exams becasue we could be gone for up to 3 days.  So far, everything is legitimate our supervisor tells us that if we want to quit we can quit now but we had to tell him by the next morning - the pay was excellent.  We both acepted and were given physicals again including one for whering respirator gear.  On and off we were told to go to a ranch and pick up some diseased (brucellosis most of the time or bangs) or dead cow.  Later learned the normal crews were swamped with other cases, this where it gets weird.  These other cases were cattle mutilations and in 1983, WYOMING and COLRADO had their fair share.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident that stand out occurred in April of 1983.  The first was near Wheatland, Wy. and there we picked up cows that had the skin from the jaw peeled back or the uterus lkiterally extracted out - with out any blood!  Oddly there were no strikes from scavengers or predators, what stands out to me and scred the hell out of me on this one was that there were 5 dead cows laid out neatly, no foot prints like they were dropped.  The affected meat was grey like it was cooked and the cutting was not done by a scalpel becasue I had seen and assisted in too many operations to note that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other time occurred near shirley basin where there used to be a uranium mine.  this was scrub brush country, the rancher had 2 bulls that were castrated.  He admitted to us that he had seen it take place a couple of days before.  There was a &#34;helicopter&#34; black in color with a spot light, his horse was getting nervous so he decided to get over to his folks place and on the way would check some pens where he moved the bulls, before got there he saw the helicopter there withe the light on a bull and literally lifting by the beam, the bull swivelled by its nose at the lightin apparatus of the &#34;helicopter&#34;, the &#34;helicopter&#34; turned into a large black heel shaped object and humming as it lifted the bull over the ridge, he heard some screams from the bulls and it came back and did the same thing on the other two bulls.  When he made it to his folks place his horse settled down.  He mentioned what he saw to his Dad aand Mom and they said look at what coming over our way and it was the big black heeled object, his dad wentto the truck and got a rifle out and took 3 shots at it!!!  The object wobbled and then sped away east.   These people were terrified, if it had not been for insurance they would have been screwed, these were prize bulls, now worthless. We had to drop them and bring them in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last day on the job there were some US ARMY veterinarians at the lab - very hush hush you and my friend and I were debriefed (interviewed) about what we saw and heard from the rancher.  I aksed them waht was that the rancher and his folks saw and their reply was that it did not happen and that we were sworn to secrecy as livestock brand inspectors.  I got pissed off at one of them and they said they would arrest me if I did not shut up, I am by nature a very tempermental person and can turn mean quickly which is why I have no time for joking around.  These army characters were abunch of weanies anyhow.  The government is up to something but I don&#39;t know what they want with ripping up livestock.  I am not a loon just anormal citizen who came upon your number and e-mail address on the radio.  This is the Gods honest truth.  I don&#39;t want to be bothered by this again.  If I see one of those pencil necked Army veterinarians again he&#39;s gonna be asked some straight questions.  I am in the veterinarian supply business in oklahoma, don&#39;t need the publicity.  Thanks.<n>

Walking out the west end of the barn and was looking north west towards the town of Mission. Then I noticed in the clouds a darker cigar-shape moving in a east to west direction.The object was just slightly darker than the srounding cloud cover.  This was opposite the winds of that night. It was at a distance of about 2 to 4 kms, looked like it was following the Fraser river, and in front of the hill that Mission is built on. There was low, fast moving clouds (fully overcast)that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was in my mid twenties, very involved in my church, rasing my young family. Being spritualy aware (there is much more going on than meets the eyes)but not at all beliving that UFOs were from outer space, but a trick played by Satan to pull people to his side. That is the reason that I did not report this to anyone till recently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Twenty years changes things<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

At times the light divided to become two, three or four separate lights of different colours, and at other times it threw off lights like flares. The craft took up space that was normally active with take-offs and landings from Brisbane Airport, however for the duration of the event, no other aircraft were seen. A half hour after the light disappeared over the Great Dividing Range, a fleet of five or six black helicopters came from behind the mountains, and roughly retraced the pathway of the light. Only after the helicopters left did flights from the airport resume. There was absolutely NO media coverage of this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This sighting occurred while fishing in the Mississippi river , in the spring of 1983 , probably April.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77833.html|14|ndxe198304| My story is short but True .  This sighting occurred while fishing in the Mississippi river , in the spring of 1983 , probably April, between one and two o’clock in the afternoon .  It was a crystal clear blue sky , with not even a wisp of a cloud anywhere.  We were fishing from a floating dock , where river pilots , shipping agents and river workers catch their water taxis to the ships.  My fishing buddy and I were using heavy tackle and we caught three large catfish that day.  I was on the westbank of the river facing east , and after casting, put my pole down , sat next to it , with my legs over the side , and leaned back on my elbows , looking above the horizon .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly thereafter , I witnessed an oval , light grey object  - coming from Out of the blue sky , on my left (N) at incredible speed and bolt across it , due south.   The length of sky it traversed was approximately one and a half to two feet of space between outstretched arms. ! It was probably 45 degrees above the horizon or a little higher .  Then it disappeared - Into the blue sky , in a split second.   The total time of the sighting was no more than 2 or 3 seconds max - no wings , no blinking lights , no sound , no sonic boom , no contrails.  It had absolutely no resistance from the atmosphere whatsoever !  I immediately turned to my fishing buddy and asked, “Did you see That ?” , and he said, “ See What ?” – well that figures .<n> <n><n> <n><n> My location was several miles south of New Orleans.  It was very high in the sky , 25,000 feet or higher ? ,  and about the size of a BB or smaller,  at arms length , but clear as day against the blue sky.  It didn’t stop and ask directions, it was in a big hurry.   I felt lucky to see it , even though it felt like I saw something I wasn’t supposed to see.   It was either a black budget toy that could fly 10 times faster than a jetliner , in 1983 , without wings and that nagging - friction from the atmosphere problem , or ‘something even more interesting’.  This was 27! years a go but I’ll never forget those 2 or 3 seconds for the rest of my life – been looking into the whole matter since then , with negative results as to the whole Truth , but quite satisfied with a bias.  Maybe the Truth is too much for us right now ...     - Anonymous<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was oval to saucer shaped and possibly one hundred to one hundred fifty feet between the above cited twin towers at an angle of about forty degrees. It began to move very slowly in the &#34;makai direction,&#34; or toward the water direction behind the tower facing towards the beach on block away close to St. Augustine Catholic Church.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was much larger than the scale of the Speilberg special effect, but this was not a movie, it was real life. At that distance it took more than half the angled vertical space between the towers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved, behind the tower I tried to &#34;keep a low profile,&#34; walking not running towards Kuhio Avenue, across Ohua and around the other side. There was nothing there, and the greatest mystery to me is what happened to it, and only those in the building know where it went. That is why I need an answer, and why I am writing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any one of hundreds of people could have photographed this sighting, and people do carry cameras when on vacation, or even video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was lighted with multiple colors on its bottom, remeniscent but not identical to the movie close enounters of the third kind. There was no energy phenomenon surrounding it as in that movie. I saw no occupants, and it was gone after a brief time. As it went behind the tower closer to the ocean, I walked down Ohua Avenue crossing this street wishing to see if it were still there behind the building. Going across Kuhio Avenue, I looked but saw nothing. If I had a camera that could have photographed what I saw, I believe it would be the most convincing UFO photograph on record.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since early April 1983 I have been aware by direct experience that we are not alone. On an early evening walk in Waikiki, Honolulu Hawaii, I witnessed a brief encounter with a UFO that appeared quite jeweled. Its multi colored lights and freedom from any sound whatsoever is entered into my own life of perceptions. It appeared right between the twin Banyan Towers on Ohua Avenue, on my left hand side while I walked towards the ocean. Hundreds of people must have had an opportunity to witness this sighting, if anyone looked out their windows. I am hopeful someone will reconfirm my sighting.. I walked ahead after it flew past that tower, and I crossed the street to go around and look for it. It was gone. It was the most vivid impression I have ever had, and the only time in my life I have witnessed the wonder of this apparently extraterrestrial technology. Once you have actually witnessed the phenomenon, you simply cannot believe every debunking of it by the conventional media. If anyone was staying at the Banyan Twin Towers on Ohua Avenue at Kuhio Avenue in April of 1983 please let me know if you also had a sighting. P.S. This is only one experience. It is a wide universe, and the possibilities are open. I also have a notion that some civilizations have progressed socially and even morally along with their gadgets to be emminently proto human. At the same time I note that a great deal of anti-social conduct demonstrates the gravity of science at times outweighing the relationship of any and all sentient beings to one another. Philosophically this is the greatest weakness of social strucutures that may tend to abandon notions of consanguinity inherent to a vital existence. I feel deeply sorry for UFO occupants who exist with such a poverty of social understanding, and even moreso that with all their technology that they are worse than primates in our worst apparent understandings of the term. At the same time I have an intuition that those occupants in my sighting may have been socially adept, even a moral set of civilization.<n>

Never have I heard anyone talk about wha|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38086.html|20|ndxe198304| Hi,  I’m writing to you because I wanted to talk to someone professional about my experiences. Never have I heard anyone talk about what I know about aliens. I was watching your show on SCI FI channel and I’ve seen other UFO shows but this one peaked my interest.  Currently I’m writing a book about my dealings with a government agency and aliens. I will be using a pseudo name and an attorney in order to process this book because I’m afraid for my life if I use my true identity. In brief, I was only 8 days old when I died from Spinal Meningitis and revived over a minute later. After that I had a few unusual effects about me. My Father was in the military at the time and we were a bit poor. Suddenly we had some money which I believe came from the government. Due to our doctor reporting the incidents that were reported by My Mother, suddenly some people were interested in my abilities. Later in life I wanted to join the military but after trying to enlist I was suddenly pulled into a situation which placed me in an unknown place, an unknown room and unknown building that had the facilities to live. This room that I stayed in was normal except for the mirrored glass that was approx. 15 feet wide. I felt as if something was watching me. To make this story even shorter, I felt something trying to communicate with me behind that glass. I truly believe that my subconscious mind or 7th sense let me see what was behind that mirror. In my dreams I saw that it was not human. What I had figured out was that I was placed there for an experiment. It was watching me as I ate and probably copying me. Learning from me my habits. It’s a shot in the dark but being there for 2 months told me that that’s what was going on. The agency was definitely tied with the U.S. Air Force. There were mirrors in every room that I went to even the shower room. My abilities are telekinesis, telepathy and foresight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never practice anything. I am a strong believer of God and never believed in aliens until that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t believe that there is time travel. I do believe that our Air Force has experiments that they are playing with and people see those UFO’s yet I know in my heart for sure that there are aliens alive and not held captive yet instead they must be here learning about us. My dreams most of all tell me things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not imagining anything. When I finish this book it will need to be edited. Someone that I contacted in another state who is a professional writer is very afraid to take on my book. She read the detail and said that her life would probably be in danger if she helped me at all. I have resigned from the Department of Justice in March of 2004 here in California. I felt that someone was looking over my shoulder. I don’t know what interest you may have in this but if you don’t contact me at least you will eventually see my book on the shelves one day. 5 friends know about some of the things and promised to carry out my book providing that I pass on before I find a way to print it all. I told you in short but there is much more detail that brings this to evidential events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))-Pseudo Name  ((e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The observers were just a family of 4 traveling home. 2 adults, 2 kids. None of us has ever forgotten what we saw. The size and speed were way out of the ordinary! We were very &#34;spooked&#34; by the event and drove home to So. Cal. without stopping.<n>
