5/1/55 15:00|Holbrook|MA|Egg|1 minute|I turned around and over the trees was a large yellow object shaped like a football without the tips on the ends.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43164.html|2|ndxe195505| In 1955, I lived in Holbrook, Massachusetts.  I lived in a town next to the South Weymouth Naval Air Station.  On the day I saw the UFO, it was a sunny spring day and I was in a ballfield behind my home.  I turned around and over the trees was a large yellow object shaped like a football without the tips on the ends.  It was there a short time - a minute or less and did not move.  It went out like a light but faster.  Then, over my right shoulder, a Navy Constellation radar plane went toward where the object had been.  I have seen many jets and blimps go over the area many times and this object wasn&#39;t like any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen. At the time, I was seven years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
