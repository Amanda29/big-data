8/30/88 06:00|Las Vegas|NV|Unknown|90-120 seconds|Close encounter at home|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84841.html|1|ndxe198808| Close encounter at home<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report is intended to detail an extremely unusual occurrence that I have kept to myself for more than 23 years, partly because of its incredibly odd and unique nature, and partly because I haven&#39;t known what to do with the information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After hearing Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast AM this evening (Tu., 10/25/2011) urging witnesses to document their experiences, I decided to pull into the nearest late-night restaurant with a WiFi hookup and finally write this down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a report of a sighting (I will submit another report for one of several I&#39;ve had over a 40-year period), but rather of what I firmly believe to have been an alien presence in my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was breaking dawn on a Sunday morning at the end of August, 1988, about 6:00 a.m. when I found myself waking from a very sound sleep to hear my wife, who was sleeping next to me, speaking in a very high-speed whisper.  And then I heard the response from another individual, also whispering faster than anything I&#39;d ever heard like it in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suspect it was the sound of these two that woke me, but the experience of HOW I woke up was unique as well.  First, I was more clear-headed than usual compared to how I typically awaken.  Second, it was as if by instinct that I came awake without either opening my eyes or moving any other part of my body--as if subconsciously I had been preparing for just such an opportunity to observe as the one I found myself in at that point.  But I have no recollection of actually planning any such thing, only that when the moment presented itself, I &#34;played dead&#34; and listened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed of the back-and-forth whispering was such that I could not make out a single word being said.  It was as if two individuals were trying to mimic the sounds made by an old fashioned radio dial being turned back and forth as it nears a station signal; kind of a &#34;swishing&#34; and &#34;swirling&#34; of sounds, only being peppered in whispers at machine-gun velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listened intently as this went on for about one and a half to two minutes.  I noticed that there was no emotion, no sense of urgency, as might be expected when someone speaks much faster than usual.  Instead it was more like &#34;machine efficiency&#34;--a personal characteristic that I would never ascribe to my wife.  It struck me that information (it impressed me as being more like &#34;raw data&#34;) was being exchanged very quickly, like between two computers, as opposed to a conversation taking place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it suddenly stopped.  I have no way to back this up, but it felt like I had been &#34;caught&#34; eavesdropping (when I was &#34;supposed to be&#34; asleep), which brought this bizarre exchange to an abrupt halt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know why, but instinct seemed to kick in immediately, telling me to pretend like I had just started to wake up.  So I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second I began moving, my eyes still closed, I heard the sound of little feet running from my wife&#39;s side of the bed, out the door of our bedroom, then fading down the hall.  It was unnaturally fast, lasting less than two seconds from start to finish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I gently shook my wife&#39;s shoulder.  It took a moment for her to emerge from a very deep sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She remembered nothing of the encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not dream this.  I was wide awake and alert, and did not go back to sleep once it ended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The situation never repeated.  And I&#39;d never heard of anyone having a similar experience until one night recently on C2C-AM, when George Noory took an open-line call from a man whose experience closely aligned with mine.  But the caller had barely gotten out the gist of his story when Noory had to cut to a commercial, and he made no comment on it afterward.<n>

8/20/88 23:00|Farmington|NM|Unknown|8 minutes|Slow moving yellow/orange colored lights above Crouch Mesa|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53804.html|4|ndxe198808| Slow moving yellow/orange colored lights above Crouch Mesa<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was by myself, night fishing at Farmington lake for catfish. I was fishing from the east side of the dam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been sitting for quite a while without a bite so I anchored my pole with rocks and walked up to the top of the dam to stretch my legs and look around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked toward the south/southeast over crouch mesa and observed 6 lights that appeared to be hovering a few hundred feet above the mesa approximately 2 to 3 miles away.  The lights were yellow/orange, identical in color to sodium vapor street lights.  They were in a straight line, at the same altitude, and fairly evenly spaced.  The light on the left most side was much larger and brighter than the other 5, which were of the same brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought that they could have been street lights, but I could clearly see the mesa top and the lights were much too high to be street lights.  I also thought that they could be helicopters, but there were no helicopter sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, the large light moved east a short distance and stopped, then the smaller lights moved to catch up with the big light, one at a time. This caterpillar like movement continued for several minutes. The movements were short.  At the distance that they appeared to be from me, I would estimate each movement to be 200 to 300 yards with a 15 to 20 second interval between movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approximately 8 minutes I decided to go back down to the water and check my pole.  A few minutes later I returned to the top of the dam and the lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The next day in the news it was said to be a helicopter. yeah right!! no way it was a helicopter. with that many lights!!.. I believe other people besides my friends saw this object. The object was pretty low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My mother and I were riding home from the grocery store and as we approached the road we lived on we noticed a big redish/orange sphere above the trees.  At first we thought it was the moon because sometimes when the moon rises it looks red, but we marveled at how big it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer we noticed that it wasn&#39;t the moon and it was hovering about 30 feet above the tree line right where we had to turn.  Well, as we turned down our road the object was on the passenger side where I was sitting and I got very good look at it.  It was about the size of the top of a water tower and it was spinning very rapidly, it had the same texture as you see in pictures of a glowing hot sun, and vapor was shooting off of it as it spun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 8 years old at the time and I remember going to school the next day and telling my teacher and other students in the class what I saw because I was sure one of them had seen it too... unfortunatly none of them had seen it and found the story very amusing...lol<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was seen by me and my mother in Clayton off of Powhatan Rd. and Davis Rd.

I can remember quite a bit about what happened that night. It was a hot August night here in South Texas. That night, the sky was overcast, not a star or moon to be seen.  My friends and I were out in our backyard with a campfire (i was young at the time).  One of my friends and myself went to grab some more wood for the fire, so we walked about 50 yards or so to a road that runs behind our property.  as we turned toward the west, we noticed a large, spherical shaped object in the distance.  it looked as if it were the sun, very large and reddish-orange in color.  we sat and watched it for about 5-10 minutes then it vanished.  we didn&#39;t think much of it, until about 20-30 minutes later.  Out of the south we saw, some type of lights above the clouds.  it was reddish, moving at a fair rate of speed.  it continued moving north a few miles and seemed to stop about 2 miles from our property were a oil field had been carved out of the woods..  a few moments later,  we heard the loud thumping of helicopters, and soon after the sounds we saw them (they sounded much like hueys, loud dull rotor sounds).  we counted about five helicopters moving just over the tree tops, they went directly over us.  again, they were heading north in the same path as the light we saw.  over the tree tops we could see a few of them circling the oil field and we thought that they may have landed out there.  so my buddy and i proceed down a pipeline right-of-way that went directly to the oil field.  i guess we were about half way there when something caught my eye, i stopped walking.  my friend, slightly behind me, asked why i had stopped, and about that time, i told him to look down at his chest.   on his chest was what seemed to be a laser sight dot for a gun or something.  the same was on my chest.  we ran back the entire way to my house.  running into the house screaming,  my mom asked what had happened and we told her.   to this day i can remember the event ver! y vividly and my mom still remembers seeing us run into the house that night, looking like we had seen a ghost or something.<n>

The object  was visible As I was traveling  toward Marquette  the object  hovered for a few minutes and then went over the road and out over lake superior and slowly went under water after it got about 1/2 mile out it was very cool and a bit odd I personally prefer my special effects on tv or the movies this was the only time I have ever seen  such a strange object  it was many years ago but I could still sculpt or draw  a model even to this day<n>

Anywhere from 30 to 50 witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In August 1988, I was vacationing in Algonquin park Ontario, Canada. I saw what appeared to be 6 objects that appeared to break off or seperate from eachother in a swirling clockwise fassion. This all took place at an outdoor theater with at least 30 to 50 witnesses. One woman saw it before I did, and that prompted all the other people to look up at it.  The Naturalist who was operating the theatre that night saw it as well.  He immidiately repoted it to our Canadian government, and the next night when we returned the naturalist told us that it was a Japanese satelite that crashed. I wonder if anyone else can recall seeing or hearing about this.<n>

As it fly over my car it went much slower and you could see cells that were randomly changing colour,they were sometimes red changing to yellow or blue, as it came over the car the cells all went yellow. It then turned onto its side and went faster and higher until it disapeared out of our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Craft stopped directly in mid air to the right of me and hovered approximately 50 feet over the river.  Lost all radio signal in car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of the car, walked down to the end of the dock to get up closer. There were lights on the object, which was probably the length of a bus. There was no noise except for a humming sound. I put my arms up for some strange reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I can remember after that is standing there with my arms down to my sides as I watched the object leave.  It went to the right, then up to the left, and then went straight up. This probably took a matter of maybe 3 seconds before I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back into the car and it was 2:00am. There was 3 hours missing. I drove home and tried to sleep but couldn&#39;t, so I stood at my window which was in front of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rosemere is a small town that is in the lower laurentians.  Very few moose are seen in the area.  A bull moose walked right by the house and down the street while I was standing there by the window.  I woke my brother up to tell him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, this was reported on the news as the moose was taken by helicopter way back up North to where it had originally travelled from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved to Ontario in October of that year.

It looked like a star and was very very very high up. It could have been misinterpreted as a meteor, but it stopped all of a sudden.  I ran inside to get the binoculars and when I got back out, I looked at the object again.  It just looked like a larger white orb of light, just slightly larger than a star.  Then another one showed up. My dad was saying, “see that! See that!!” Then one backed up a bit and the then the other one did as well. THEN, in unison, they both took off like in hyper speed.  They disappeared out of the sky altogether it seemed. Very odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

This would be approximately south of me bordering US 99.  They remained in this position for approximately 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I neared Hatch Road the objects began to move toward me and were directly overhead just before I reached the intersection.  A young male and female in a car pulled over and the young man got out and asked me what they were.  We watched them for a few minutes as they continued north and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My estimation of their speed was 15 mph and the height was about 100 feet.  They were flying in formation and I could hear no noise from them until they were directly overhead when I could hear an extremely faint whooshing sound.  The objects were small, perhaps the size of a hang glider and triangular in shape.  They each had a small white spotlight on the lead corner shining straight out like a headlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later when I reached home I called the tower at the Modesto airport to see if they had observed these craft as it was only a short distance away.

I remember walking to the door and looking out to see this huge brightly lit &#34;ship&#34; slowly moving toward the front of our house.  A best guess at approximate altitude was somewhere between 800 to 1500 ft.  My mother, sister and I stepped out into the yard for a better view.  I immediately noticed the silence;our usual evening serenade of bullfrogs courting, locusts calling, etc was gone.  Our dogs were not barking; extremely eerie! As the ship inched closer to our home, I began to hear this low humming, the sound a refrigerator gives off.  It moved directly over our house, stopped, and hovered, giving us a dynamite view of its underside.  The ship itself had to be the size of several football fields.  There appeared to be a multitude of colored lights strobing its lower perimeter, with four huge lights located in this diamond-like pattern inside the perimeter. A good description would be like that of a baseball field, a blue light at first base, red at second, white? at third, and blue at home.  I distinctly remmeber one &#34;mega-light&#34;, white, and if my memory serves me correctly, it lit the point of a cone-like stem protruding down from the underside&#39;s midpoint.  It was absolutely the most fantastic sight I have ever witnessed.  Though the ship appeared to hover directly overhead, it was most certainly ascending in altitude because the lights began to get smaller and smaller.  It was amazing how clear the night was, and I note this because, from my upper right, came this gray cloudy mist, which eventually intercepted with the ship.  Once the mist had cleared, the ship immediately ascended straight up, and within two seconds vanished from vision. After having the privelege of witnessing this breathtaking phenomenon, I am certain that the human race is not the only intelligent life in the universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A &#34;kooky&#34; friend of mine had reported seeing a large &#34;alien blob&#34; of some sort about 1/4 mile behind the town firehouse in the middle of the woods. I had to laugh at first. No one really believed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He kept talking about it for several days, and finally I asked him to show me. He did! It was about 5ft across, and 2.5 feet high. Very irregular. It looked like a large mound of preserved animal remains. It had no bones. No birds, no bugs, worms or maggots were in/on it. It didn&#39;t smell either. I could see the pattern of veins in the membrane. I<n> <n><n> <n><n> poked it with a stick, and it was tough and leathery. It was also pale greyish-white in color. At the time I had no ideas about it, and I sort of forgot about it. Later I read two books, one about UFO sightings in the same area...and another about secret govm&#39;t experiments with anti-gravity. It seems that this is the effect that this technology has on living tissue. The authors of the books desribed things almost identical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a year or two of my experience, another friend said he saw a UFO (black triangle) about 1 mile from this location, still other friends reported seeing strange animals in the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was a very hot summer with many days over a 100 degrees. I awoke one night because of the heat and was having trouble falling back to sleep. Suddenly, I heard a quiet humming noise coming from outside. I got up and went to a window on the first floor of the apartment. Through the window, I saw an oval shaped craft hovering just above the treetops. It emmitted a soft and constant white light. It also emmitted a quiet and steady humming noise. It was not very large, maybe a little bit bigger than an average car. I was mesmerized and terrified at the same time. I wanted to wake up my friend, but I was afraid that it would leave. It stayed there for about a minute, then ascended slowly and flew out of sight. I checked the newspapers the next day, but did not find anything about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was traveling at a low rate of speed and seemed to be following me. I continued to see it until I pulled up into our driveway. It came and hovered over the front of our house and projected a bright beam that lit up our front lawn. The object was round and you could see light coming from around the top, like it may have had windows around the top. It didn&#39;t sound like a plane or a helicopter. It made a humming sound. I got out of my car and went to the door and called my wife. We watched it for at least 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it left it seemed to just dart it was so fast.

8/14/88 23:00|Ottawa (west of) (Canada)|ON|Sphere|5 hours|Procession of very large, multi-coloured craft.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91340.html|25|ndxe198808| Procession of very large, multi-coloured craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I am finally taking the time to submit my story is because I heard your recent interview on the Jeff Rense programme where you shared some recent sightings that sound so incredibly similar to the remarkable one I had many years ago.  It happened in 1989, about 80 km west of Ottawa ON. It was a calm, clear summer night and the stars were numerous. As I was enthralled with astronomy at the time, I was on the roof of our cottage with a friend and a set of binoculars, and I was teaching her the basic summer constellations. My parents were inside the cottage and they had two sets of friends visiting as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that across the eastern shoreline (about a mile across), there was a red light that was moving erratically in the sky, some distance away. It was perhaps the size and brightness of the star Deneb. I found it strange, so I focused the binoculars on them. Although it was tough to keep them still, I followed this red light zigzagging up and down, left and right. It was moving very fast and then coming to a complete stop. At times it would disappear below the treeline, and then pop back up into the sky. I didn’t say a word to my friend, as I wanted to make sure what I was seeing was really what I thought I was seeing. As I had been so focused on the one red light, I didn’t notice when a second and a third joined it, along the dark treeline horizon. Now there were three of them, all the same size and colour, zigzagging up and down and left and right and disappearing below the treeline and popping back. I went through the checklist of what they could be - weather balloon! s (just plain no), search lights (no clouds), helicopters (no sound), planes (can’t move this way)…and realized that what I had been watching for quite a few minutes were truly unidentifiable, to the best of my knowledge.  I told my friend to take a look, and she too saw the three red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood up, banged on the roof, and called down to my parents to come outside and see. As it was such a still night, I am sure the whole lake must have heard me. We came off the roof and met my parents and their friends on the porch. Ironically, the moment they came outside, the red lights dipped below the horizon and disappeared. They didn’t see a thing. What are the odds! My parents were extremely skeptical and were certain the red lights were weather balloons.  At this point, 5 of the 6 adults went to bed. I estimate it was around 11pm. One of my parents friends, though, came to me quietly and asked me to describe to him, more privately, what we had seen. He was a retired RCAF pilot, with many hours of service under his belt, and was presently the principal of an elementary school in Ontario. We told him what we saw and he was extremely interested in our story. He asked us to show him the direction of where we saw the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, the three of us (my friend, my dad’s friend, and myself) went down to our dock and watched the eastern horizon, above the treeline, with eager attention.  We had retrieved a second pair of binoculars. After about 15 minutes and no more red lights, we were thinking that our light show was over.  As we had been staring so intently on the eastern shore of the lake, we hadn’t noticed an ENORMOUSLY lit craft to our right, above the southern side of the bay we are situated in.  To say we were instantly startled and shocked is an understatement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The southern shore from our dock is about 400 meters away.  The treeline extends maybe 90-100 feet above the lake, with a small hill. I estimated that this craft was not much farther beyond the shoreline…perhaps another half kilometer, maximum.  It was also approximately the width of my four fingers above the treeline horizon (I am actually sitting on our dock, where we saw these crafts, writing this). Now, the size of this craft was around the size of a tennis ball.  It was enormous. Looking at it through the binoculars, you couldn’t see the whole craft…only parts of it.  It was moving from west to east, and very slowly.  And it wasn’t making a sound…it was completely silent.  I remember hearing people across the lake laughing and partying while we were watching it, and I wondered if they were seeing it too.  The next day I learned no one had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was shaped like a Big Mac (that was my comparison at the time).  It was rounded, but not fully circular.  There were no wings. There was nothing protruding out of any part of it.  All around the outside of the craft were a few dozen of individual red lights, equally spaced in an orderly fashion.   There were maybe 3 or 4 ‘rows’ of red lights. Inside the red lights were some individual green lights.  They were the same size as the red, just fewer of them.  And then, in the centre of the craft were some individual white lights. Again, the same size and brightness of the others…just white.  The reds were the most predominant.  The lights did not flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three of us must have watched this craft cross the lake for about 15 minutes.  All of a sudden, another craft, exactly like the one we were watching, appeared in the same place as the first.  Same distance above the horizon, same speed, same lights, same silence…moving west to east. It followed the same path as the first.  Over the next couple of hours, the three of us sat on our dock and witnessed 6 of these huge crafts pass by us, all following each other a similar distance, all looking exactly like each other…..all passing the eastern shore at the same place and continuing east.  We realized that once they had travelled eastward some distance past the lake they looked like the red lights we had originally seen on the roof of our cottage!  The green and white lights became invisible and the red lights appeared as one solitary light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end of this procession of craft, we saw two smaller crafts. They were maybe the size of a dime, and like a cheeseburger in shape (again, my younger mind comparison).  It was moving along the same path as the others, yet it was travelling faster, maybe 3-4 times the speed.  It appeared a similar distance above the treeline. The entire craft pulsated a lime-green colour.  In between flashes you could clearly make out the smooth disc shape of the object.  There were no wings.  There was no noise.  Before they reached the eastern shoreline, they stopped in the sky, pulsated a few times, and then flew southward, quite quickly. We soon lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember thinking that those two were like the end of the parade.  We decided that was it for us and went back into the cottage. It was 4am! We were shocked!  What felt like maybe an hour or two had been 5 hours! Why hadn’t we thought of getting a camera?  Why didn’t I wake my parents and prove to them that what we had seen earlier was real?   Why didn’t we alert our cottage neighbours, who were friends of ours?   We didn’t have the answers…and I still don’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day we went to the lake lodge and I asked the folks over there ‘Hey, did you see the UFOs last night? They were right above here!’ I was certain they HAD to have seen them.  But they didn’t. We listened to the news on the radio the next day and there was no word of anything.  I was shocked. How did no one else see these things?  To this day, no one has claimed they saw what we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents still see their friend who was with me from time to time, and he still brings up his recollections of this night. He still says what we saw is the ‘most incredible things he has ever witnessed’.  My other friend vowed to never talk about what we saw.  I emailed her last year, asking her if she’s ever spoken to anyone, and she didn’t respond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bit about me: I have a degree in History and Education and I have been an elementary school teacher for 13 years.  I am a married mother of two children.  As astronomy has always been a passion of mine, I have spent many hours throughout my life observing the nighttime sky.  I have never witnessed anything close to this, before or since.  The events of this evening were burned into my minds eye, and I can recollect the images and thoughts and feelings so clearly still.  I have rarely spoken about this to anyone…only a few trusted friends over the years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Much evidence of all types.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about that date in the early morning hours, my sister heard a loud vibrating on-going bang in the house.  She thought it was the boiler exploding.  The whole house shook with the noise and it lasted more than a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She ran to my father, asleep in the in-law apartment.  The house is a single level ranch.  She screamed to my father that something just exploded.  My father heard it too and it woke him. The noise was so loud and on-going.  He felt the noise and vibration was from above the house, not the cellar.  He ran out the door onto the porch and looked up in the dark, possibly overcast, sky.  He still heard a very strange loud vibrating noise.  The house was still vibrating.  He believed he seen some type of unknown craft, large and dark just above the tree line across the street and moving away slowly, very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He told me the story the next day.  It was in the local paper that many, many, people called the police that night, as they all reported a loud, loud, craft or crafts flying in the sky in west Methuen and headed towards East Methuen, where my father lives.  It was also reported to the police that someone on the west side observed several helicopters flying low in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The local paper did an investigation and reported on the front page.  Pease Air force base in nearby Portsmouth, NH, denied it was them, as they are forbidden to fly low and through neighborhoods. The manager at Lawrence Airport related that there were no incidents of any kind there, or connected to flights at the airport there. This all appeared in the Eagle-Tribune News Paper as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest surprise I got when I went to my fathers house the next day was, a large maple tree in the front of the house had broken tiny limbs all over the ground under the tree.  They had leaves on them.  They were basketball sized clusters on the ground. It was an abnormal sight and I seen it before I got to the house.  The strange thing was, the clusters were directly under the tree. Not scattered about. Which indicates a direct &#34;downward&#34; energy.  I took my father out to show him.  Solid evidence that something went over his house, as the tree was taller than the house.  Very good corroboration with this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It seemed to have more light coming from it than just an ordinary plane.  Believe it or not, it followed me all the way home, and hovered over our front lawn.  It hovered at about 2000 feet, and cast a beam of light over our front lawn.  The altitude of the craft could have been a little more or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of my car and called my wife to the front porch.  We stood and watched it for several minutes.  It made very little noise. The only sound that came from it was a humming noise, and when it moved the humming did not seem to get any louder.  The speed of it&#39;s movement was unbelievable. It seemed to move like a humming bird.   It  moved in any direction with ease.  The top of the circular craft appeared to have windows 360 degrees with light protruding from them.  I would estimate the diameter of craft to be between 20 and 30 feet.  I called the local airport, and they wanted to write it off as national guard having maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS: THAT THERE IS NO TELLING WHAT THIS COUNTRY HAS DEVELOPED!  It did not sound like an airplane nor did it sound like a helicopter or any thing else that I have seen in the sky.  I wish I had had a computer back then.  We wanted to tell someone but didn&#39;t know how to get in touch with anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was a passenger in a car with a friend of mine driving.  As we drove along, I noticed something flying over the mountain ridge in front of us, about 1 mile away.  The craft had two red lights on either side, with a bright white light in the middle.  As it came closer, I noticed that it was moving quickly and taking strange angles.  At one point, it was completly on it&#39;s side, and I asked my friend what it was.  We both agreed that it was not an airplane or a helocopter.  I then asked my friend to pull over so I could get out of the car for a better look.  By the time I got out of the car and to the side of the road, it was directly above me.  At this point, there were no lights, but I could see it&#39;s outline against the night sky.  It was about 400 feet above me, and moving very slowly.  It was silent, and about as big as a football field.  It was triangular in shape, with rounded edges.  As I looked up, I could see a strange pattern of rectangles on the bottom of the craft.  I stood there in amazement, just staring at it.  I watched it for about 45 seconds move slowly away from me, until it disappeared over the horizon.  for unknown reasons, my friend never got out of the car.  Even stranger, I never discussed it with him.  I just got in the car, and we went on our way.  for some reason, even though I&#39;ve seen my friend many times since this happens, I always forget to ask him about it.  I have never seen anyting like it since then, but I have heard descriptions of similar sightings.  I know this thing exists, and I will spend the rest of life hoping to see it again.  I tell my wife all the time that sooner or later, she will see it too.<n>

It scared me half to death and I vowed to always remember this experience.  I had just come home from saxophone lessons and while getting out of my fathers truck I noticed that the night sky was very dark. Noticing it and thinking nothing of it, I rushed inside and upstairs into my bedroom to put my sax away.  I closed my bedroom door almost all the way, flipped the wall switch on, and the lamp on top of my dresser came on.  As I emptied my pockets onto the dresser, some sort of movement outside my bedroom window caught my eye enough that made me look directly out the window.  I looked for just a moment and thought that my eyes were playing tricks.  At the very instant that I turned away, I got intense goosebumps all over my body, and the lamp on my dresser went out.  At this point I was startled by something out of the corner of my eye and turned and looked out the window to my left which i was standing less than 15 feet away from.  Outside the window there was a pulsating spherish orb of blue light about 1 foot in diameter.  It was such a luminescent blue light that I was captivated by it&#39;s beauty and scared to death at the same time.  I was so scared that I don&#39;t think I even tried to move, I was frozen in place by fear.  Shortly after I had noticed this Blue orb of light, it moved toward the window, and somehow moved through the window into my room.  Once this sphere had completely moved through the window, it dissappeared.  Now the sphere dissappeared, however instantly a band of light of exactly the same color about 1 foot wide appeard on the floor, walls, and ceiling forming a tube around the room, up the walls and across the floors and ceiling, accompanied by a loud electric hum.  It started at the window side of the room and moved across the room at about 2 or 3 feet per second with the hum.  The light travelled across the entire room much like the bar of light on a photocopy machine, and dissappeared when it hit the opposite end of the room.  The soun! d was gone too, and there was nothing to see at the window.  I was so scared that when the light and hum were gone I was still frozen in place for a few seconds.  Then I rushed to the switch, flipped it twice, and it did not come on.  Then I ran to the stairs, slid down them on my behind, and ran into the livingroom hysterically crying to my mother and explained what I saw after she said that she did not see anything or see anything.  She told me it may have been ball lightning.  I don&#39;t know what it was, but I know that it was there because I saw it with my own two eyes.  The lightbulb in the lamp on my dresser was burnt out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was 31 yrs of age then; I know the date because the event was so unexplainable to me that I wrote it all down in a notebook &amp; have looked back at it several times over the years. It all started about midnite with a hit &amp; run elsewhere that turned into a high-speed chase that ended across the street to the east, in Mr. K&#39;s backfield. My husband &amp; I jumped out of bed to witness the truck crashing through the fence &amp; numerous Denver &amp; Englewood Police officers surrounding the truck as it came to a stop. Our bedroom is upstairs with a window facing to the South, we have a corner lot, and so we do see a lot that&#39;s going on most of the time. My husband was tired &amp; after a few minutes of the usual police activity, we both went back to bed. He was out in a flash, which is normal; I on the other hand just was lying there with my eyes shut thinking about the goings on.  Then an extremely bright flash of light lit the entire room, so much so I don&#39;t know how to explain this. Close your eyes &amp; you see black, right, imagine that you see the whitest white. It causes me to sit right up in bed &amp; look around real quick. I went back to the window &amp; yes, police &amp; everyone is still in the field. A tow truck is now waiting for his tow at the corner. Then the brilliant flashes of light begin. It lights up the so brightly, so fully more so than lightening but large circles of light beam to the ground, with such speed. It happened at least seven times in succession. Beams of light touched in the field behind the truck, on the south side of our garage, onto the garden, on the north side of the garage, onto the home to the north of us, then onto me and finally onto Mr K. &amp; the tow driver walking back to the tow truck. No one below me acknowledges the light, no one look around or up. I ran to the window on the south side of the house, no lights. I ran back to the north window, no more lights, no helicopter noise,! no plan e noise. No lightening in the sky that day or night. I don&#39;t know what the lights were or where they came from, even was so shocked I even did the pinch test. I was awake I did see it. I decided after a few more minutes to lie back down, as I did I looked up at the alarm clock, it was 2 something in the morning. I lay there wondering where an hour &amp; half of time went; everything that happened wasn&#39;t more than 30 to 45 minutes of actual time. I may never know, but I do know that it happened, it was not a dream. I saw what I saw.<n>

She was pregnant and ready to give birth any day. As we were driving in the country, I noticed something above our car hovering or sitting on the roof. I leaned forward and saw a reflective spherical object just outside my windshield like it was sitting on my car. I would speed up and it stayed with us. My wife, who I am divorced from now saw the same thing. When we came to a large hill that dipped down, it flew away from the drivers side and continued to the horizon with no noise and no lights. This shook me up for days and I haven&#39;t said anything about this until today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

It had a bright amber colored light on the front corner.  It headed North east.  When we got to Plymouth we spotted it again coming over the town.  only then it had more colored lights.  It was huge.  I tried to get a police officer to get out of his car and see the craft that I was able to spot coming toward us between 2 buildings, of course he thought I was joking and he wouldn&#39;t.  Then all of the sudden it disappeared.  Like it just turned the lights off with a switch.  It made no noise.  This thing was huge.  I wish I could remember more fully the details.  It was over 30 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While in the vicinity of Basking Ridge near the wildlife overpasses with relay towers on the north side of the highway, I caught a glimpse of something large aproaching the highway from the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I leaned forward to get a better look and in doing so saw a airborn vehicle approximatly 40 to 50 yds from tip to tip.  The shape was that of a cresent moon or chevron which was light metalic grey in color. I would estimate that the craft elavation was no more than 400ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my parents as we passed under it but the brake lights were distracting them as both lanes of traffic were rapidly coming to a halt as people saw the object.  The entire viewable amount of time I had to observe the object was aproxamatly 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting was in broad daylight around 3:30pm.  The object was moving sideways tip to tip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I stuck my head out the window I noticed that there was no discernable noise generated by the craft.  The craft was moving far to slow to remain airborn by any conventional means of propulsion that I am familar with.  There were five lights across the front arc and a panel of white lights pulsing a pattern rythmicly as we drove under it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know other people saw this craft and am very anxious to speak with anyone with anybody who could confirm this sighting for me.

We were in a residential neighborhood.It was dark out. About 8:00pm. There were houses accross the street from us. Very close. While chatting with my friend i looked accross the street. And i glanced up, up above a house accross the street. There were tall trees directly behind this house. And what i saw was a ring of lights in a circle. It was very large, bigger than a couple houses put together. The lights were different colors, they were very bright alsmost glowing. They were in a horizontal plane above this house, just sitting there. And i said what the heck is that, well putting it nicely. My friend said i dont know. I said thats not normally there, and she said no. And i said its not making any sound. It was close enough we should have heard some sort of noise . I mean it was directly accross the street from us. I said well it cant be a balloon  becuase a balloon would have fire, and would not be out at night anyway. Then all of the sudden it started moving. It was almost directly over the house accross the street from us, and directly above the trees. It started moving away from us. There was no sound. It was so strange. Anything that big, should have made noises, and that close. It did not move up it went sideways , horzontally. Away from us. Almost as if it knew we were looking at it. Before it moved it was just sitting there above the trees, then it just started moving , away from us. So i said lets get in the car and chase it , and get another look, but by the time we went around the block , it was gone. I thought about calling the police, but said noone would believe us. So ive only told a few people about this, and most people say they believe me. Scince this happened to me, im always watching the skys. Hoping to see something again. I feel very lucky to have seen this thing, just wish i had a camera, but its forever etched in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

He then saw an object appear as it cleared the trees and told me to look. When I looked up I saw an object with multi-color lights that faded slowly from one &#34;set&#34; as another set of colored light started to light up. The lights were scattered uniformly all over the bottom of the object as it slowly floated moving west to east until it past over my friend&#39;s house. We were in his back yard when we saw the object. The object was dark other than the colored lights but we could make out it&#39;s silhouette as it floated past the stars. It was a clear warm night and the object appeared to be very high in the sky yet very large and circular although it was difficult to make out exact dimensions. I still remember clearly seeing those colored lights slowly fade from one set to another much like new Christmas lights can. My friend and I went inside and reported what we saw to his mother and then made a drawing of what we saw. My friend may still have the drawing. We kept looking out at night to see if it showed up again but I have never seen anything like it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was very dark area with only a couple of city light poles that were on. There were a couple of stores in that area but they were all closed. There are a lot of hills in this area so it further darkens the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about eighteen years old at the time. My friend and I were working at a Burger King until about 10 pm. We went outside to wait for a ride and we were talking. We went across the street where there was a pay phone that I was going to use to call to see where our ride was and I noticed that where we just walked from was a seeming to be round object just hovering in the air about 30 feet not very high no real noise except for humming. I felt and heard a humming just like an electrical sub station, there’s ones in every town. I felt my hairs standing up. The object was about the size of the Burger King, just a little wider. There were about eight, two foot wide bulbs around the round object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I walked under it at an angle and tried to make out the shape with the stars since it was the only light above, there was no moon and the stars were almost not visible. We first thought it was a hot air balloon with lights on the bottom but with the little stars that were out, we couldn’t see how high it exactly was, but we knew it wasn’t high like a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I need to say this, over the years I’ve read a lot about of what other people have written about what they saw, and what’s different about mine, is that I think my friend and I are the only dumb asses that threw rocks and tar from the road at it for about a good half an hour. And we didn’t even hear the rocks fall back on the ground and we didn’t hear it hit the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about half an hour of throwing rocks at it we watched it slowly rise up then whoosh, it went up fast, in like a couple of seconds it shot up, we saw the lights get closer together, get smaller, and dim, in a matter of two to three seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My take on why it left so abruptly, is that I think they were going to abduct us until they found out they’d have serious problems with the two dumb asses that were throwing rocks at them. Just kidding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more thing, there is one more witness, this was a little strange, it was my ride which happened to be my mom. She didn’t see it there, but at her job which happens to be on the other side of the hill / small mountain, at the Davis and Geck parking lot. We talked about it a few days after it happened, because we ended up walking home. She said she was afraid of it and went back inside to get someone to walk her back to he car. It happened at night, and that is all I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a very clear, hot day with no humidity or haze and only a few small, scattered clouds were visible. In the distance, I saw a helicopter and a small plane cross my field of vision (one heading north and one heading south); then I noticed two more &#34;objects&#34; in the same vacinity  that seemed too close to the others. As they continued heading in a westerly direction, I thought it was very odd that they were flying so close together, so I locked my gaze onto them. As they approached (flying directly toward me), I could see that they were not conventional aircraft; they were perfectly round, silver spheres and were highly reflective. From my perspective, they did not seem to be flying at a very high altitude, perhaps only a mile or so high and were moving relatively slow (no faster than a helicopter). As they passed directly overhead, my view of them was very clear. This is a heavily populated area; there were hundreds of people on the street shopping that day and not one other person was looking up, so I was left to assume that these craft were silent. After they were no longer within my field of vision, I ran out the side door to see if I could still see them in the (western) sky, but my vision was impeded by too many buildings. From this location, Newark International Airport is 14 miles to the southwest, and Teterboro Airport is 7 miles to the northwest; however, nothing was reported in the newpaper the following day.  One other note... About four months after this incident, I was watching a UFO documentary and in one of the segments, they showed these same two spheres moving exactly the way I described, very low in the sky (perhaps under radar?). This was the first time I had seen these spheres reported on a television show and thought it was extremely interesting since it was broadcast AFTER the sighting I had; at least there was some video foo! tage clearly showing that they were NOT conventional aircraft.  I would love to know if anyone else saw these craft on that day...

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere moved in an absolute straight line just above the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the backyard of my residence.  The residence is located in the pine woods of Bastrop County, about 5 miles north of the city of Bastrop.  The back yard was small, only about 30 x 50&#39;.  There were trees surrounding the rest of the house and some small scrubs then larger trees in back of the yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had notice a passenger plane passing over just a few minutes before.  I was shooting a BB pistol when something moving at my left side in the air caught my attention.  When I first looked up, my immediate thought was that it was a dandelion puff then I realized a puff would be too heavy to fly.  Upon closer observation, it appeared to be a sphere in shape, of metalic construction.  It was traveling about ten to fifteen feet above the tree line in an absolute straight line without wavering.  The speed is estimated to be about 5mph.  There was a slight breeze which made me think that this object was under some kind of power or it would have wavered in the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to get my camera but thought that it would be out of sight by the time I retrieved it.  As the object passed at about a 10 degree angle from where I was standing, and about forty feet away, I opened fire with my BB pistol.  I had my doubts that I would hit it but felt like if I could, I may be able to alter its course.  I shot at it several times and then observed it as it went out of sight beyond the trees in the front yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have relived this event many times, wondering just what it was that I observed.  I have never observed another unexplained object since that time or even before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The year of the sighting is unknown to us, given the error in the date submitted by the witness.

I was a patrol agent in charge on bo|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32330.html|47|ndxe198808| I am a retired U.S. Border Patrol supervisor, having spent 37 years in the Border Patrol and INS.  I was a patrol agent in charge on both Canadian and Mexican borders for last 20 years of my career.  I was also a special agent for a time in San Francisco with the Office of Insector General, USDA.  I worked as head of intelligence unit for the Border Patrol, working as liaison officer with RCMP in Canada. I am not a flake.  I have had a couple of UFO sightings myself and have known several people over the past 40 years, many in law enforcement in different parts of the country who have told me credible UFO stories that they experienced.  I reported most of these to MUFON several years ago and in 1977 I was contacted in Indio, California where I was agent in charge of that station about a UFO sighting there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO sighting that I refer to above was reported in the San Diego Union-Tribune and I contacted the reporter/columnist about what I saw after I read his story.  He plead with people who may have seen what he saw to call in or write him.  I called him and told him who I was and what I had seen.  He wanted me to go on the local TV station in San Diego and confirm what he had sighted as he felt I was the most credible of the 45 witnesses who had called him.  Another Border Patrol supervisor confirmed that he had seen the same UFO as he departed his apartment in East San Diego to come to work.  When I asked permission from my chief patrol agent to go onthe TV show I was told, &#34;you are not going to make the Border Patrol look like a bunch of nuts...permission denied.&#34;  The other supervisor acknowledged in front of the chief that he had seen it, also.  But when the chief made his statement to me, the other supervisor said, &#34;I am out of here...don&#39;t include me in this.&#34;  What I saw and described, and drew a diagram of, and can still vividly remember it and am able to draw a diagram, was a light that was travelling along a ridge along highway 94 as I drove west on that highway in the Tecate area.  I was going to San Ysidro to go to work at the Border Patrol sector HQ.  I was stationed and in charge of the Campo BP station at the time but had been detailed to work at the HQ for a month to fill in for a vacationing asst chief.  I had to negotiate highway 94 and try to watch the object at the same time.  But it must have moved along the mountain tops in what I thought was the Jamul area.  I was looking west towards SD and I saw a heavy bank of low clouds or fog which was not unusual in the early morning as one approached SD.  The light moved from behind the cloud bank and it had a conical beam that was extremely bright.  I thought at first it was one of our helicopters that was searching the ridge for illegal aliens in that arae.  But I found out that none of our helicopters were out at that time of the morning.  The beam was just too bright for a helicopter light and it could shine through the clouds almost as brightly as in front of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the light, and negotiated the highway, which is very curvy in that area, and I had to take my eyes off it from time to time.  The strange part was when I got to the bottom of highway 94 at Barrett Junction, i started back up the hill to the ridge where I thought the light had come from.  It was gone at that time.  I was very surprised when I topped the ridge in the Dulzura area, that there was no cloud bank and no fog.  It was very clear that morning and the city lights from San Diego could be seen plainly.  The incident went out of my mind until I read the newpaper article a couple of days later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reporter told me, and wrote in the paper also, that there were 45 people who called him and reported almost the same thing as we had seen.  The other BP supv also confirmed that was what he saw, too, but he saw it further out to the west, probably over the ocean.  Some people who called the reporter were jogging on the beach and they saw it over the ocean and said there was a small airplane moving towards SD from the west over the sea and the UFO swallowed the plane in it&#39;s beam.  There was no official confirmation from the Navy or any govt agency.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one incident that I reported to MUFON...and my report should be on file with them from back around 1977 was something told to me.  This is a really wierd story but I believe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1977 there was a story that came to me through a BP agent at my station in Indio that one of his classmates stationed at Alamogordo BP station (White Sands) had gotten into some real trouble.  It seems that he and another agent went onto the missile range that was south of Alamogordo.  I think it is called the McGregor missile range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, as it was reported to me, the two agents drove quite a ways down the range in their 4 wheel drive vehicle which they were not supposed to do.  If there were illgals walking up from the El Paso area, it was customary for the Air Police to pick them up and bring them out of the restricted area to the BP.  So, the guys were just going down to scope out the area and track aliens if there were any walking in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quite a ways into the restricted area, they spotted what they thought was a small cone shaped mountain which looked strange to them.  It looked like a small volcano cone, as they described it.  They reportedly parked there vehicle and climbed up the cone shaped mountain which wasn&#39;t too high, but I was not told how high it was.  When they got to the top they could look down into the crater part and saw a flying saucer parked in the bottom being attended by Air Force personnel.  They apparently realized they were seeing something they shouldn&#39;t and they crept back down the hill and got out of the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AFter work, that afternoon the two agents are reported to have met some other agents and people in a local tavern where they guys hung out, and after a couple of beers they started telling the others what they had seen in the restricted area.  AS the story goes, it was not very long when a couple of men in &#34;black suits&#34; showed up, showed their IDs and requested the two agents accompany them, to what is assumed an office at White Sands base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the story goes, they were debriefed, their agent in charge of the station was called in, and the two were immediately transferred to other duties with a day, and admonished in strong terms not to tell what they had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The agent in charge of the station was an very old friend of mine whom I worked with as partners in Carlsbad, NM for 5 years.  He passed away of cancer last year.  I called him on the phone and relayed the story as I had heard it and asked him if it was true.  We were using a government phone line.  He was an ex-Marine, very patriotic person, and the way in which he answered me led me to believe that it was true.  In a very measured voice he replied, &#34;Don&#39;t know anything about it...never happened.&#34;  And he made no further comment.  He left me to believe that he would not discuss the subject any further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some years later, after I had retired, another retired agent in charge and I stopped by this retired agent&#39;s home in Alamogordo.  This was in about 1995.  We were having a couple of drinks and I reminded him of the call I had made to him about the UFO incident in 1977.  I asked him if he remembered my call.  He said he did.  I then asked him again...&#34;We are all retired now, you can tell me the truth about the UFO thing.&#34;  He looked at me, and in almost identical words and same measured tone, &#34;Don&#39;t know anything about it...never happened.&#34;  That told me that he definitely knew and that he had been sworn to secrecy never to tell..probably by the people at White Sands.  His ex-wife was a long time government employee, a secretary and she worked at White Sands.  So there were reasons that he could not talk.  He was the kind of person, had he been sworn to secrecy about a national security issue, he would take it to his grave...which he did.  But he let me know in his answer that it happened.  That was my take on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The investigator from MUFON was very interested in that story alone.  He didn&#39;t seem to be interested in any of the other things that I had seen or had relayed to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was stationed in Carlsbad, NM in the early sixties there were UFO stories all over the place.  There were some vivid sightings by state policemen.  One, who was station at Alamogordo even took out his accident investigation camera and took photos of a flying saucer that had landed off the highway early in the morning, only to have the men in black suits from White Sands confiscate his film.  He personally told me about that incident.  That happened in about 1962 or thereabouts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard about another incident involving a state police officer driving north of White Sands when his car went dead.  Everything electrical on it went dead, according to him...no radio no anything.  He got out and walked a little down the highway and every other vehicle was dead along side the highway also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He walked back to his patrol car, got in and after a few minutes everything came back on and all the other cars were starting up a moving.  He said that someone told him that they were conducting some kind of experiments at White Sands but he couldn[t find out exactly what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strangely enough, part of our working area out of Carlsbad was Roswell and the ranch area to the west.  We contacted the air police people at the air base there which was still a SAC base and we never heard a word about the July, 1947 incident during that time.  But there were some other strange things that went on around the SAC base in those days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In about 1964 my partner and I were driving up to Clovis, NM to pick up some aliens that were in custody.  We had left Carlsbad abou 4am because it was a long round trip drive.  We passed through Roswell while it was still dark, and as we turned on to the highway to Portales, about 2 miles up the highway we ran into a state police roadblock.  There were two state police officers that we knew and they stopped us.  As I remember we were the only car stopped there.  They came over, and I was driving.  My partner (the same man who was in Alamogordo in 1977 that said &#34;never happened&#34;) was working with me.  We asked what was going on because there were helicopters flying over the sand hills there, and jeeps moving all around on the sand dunes.  They had spot lights and were obviously looking for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The state police said, since we were federal officers and had security clearances, they could tell us what was going on.  They said that the Air Force people told them that one of the Atlas missiles in a silo (there were about 20 missile silos that ringed the base and Roswell) had &#34;accidentally&#34; been fired and it had a nuclear warhead on it.  They said they were told the missile was able to rip through part of the covering steel and concete doors on the silo, and that the nuclear warhead had flown off it and landed somewhere in the area and they were frantic because they could not find it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we sat there for a few minutes, they finally told us to drive on through since we were in a marked patrol vehicle, and we did.  We were warned if we saw anything laying in the road not to get near it.  We drove through, seeing all kinds of AF vehicles prowling over the sand dunes with search lights, and drove on to Portales and Clovis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a month later we saw one of the same state policemen in their Roswell office and remembered the missile incident.  We asked him what had happened.  He said that the AF told them that they had located the warhead somewhere back east...I think Cleveland.  they said that an old Indian was dying in a hospital from radiation poisoning.  The AF people said that they figured someone had stopped and picked up the warhead when it landed in the highway, put it in their car and drove away with it. They said that is what the old Indian told them.  He had seen it on the highway, stopped and put it in the trunk of his car and drove to Cleveland, getting sick about two weeks later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The story didn&#39;t really make much sense to us but that was what the AF said.  We also heard that one other silo had been blown up by and accidental missile shooting in it.  I recently heard some retired AF captain or something talking about how the missile silos (around Roswell, I believe) were harrassed by UFOs and there had been some major accidents in the silos caused by the UFOs.  I always wondered if that wasn&#39;t what really happened that morning and that the AF gave a cover story about the warhead being stolen by and old Indian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was strange because had an Atlas missile been shot off in a silo, the crew in the control room down under would have been killed or something.  We never heard a word about anything like that.  It was a very strange incident that has always stuck in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are other stories that I have heard over the years from other officers, but am getting writers cramps right now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I enjoyed hearing you on the radio tonight as on occasions before.  Keep up the good work.  I will bet that your job is fascinating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))((city deleted)), New Mexico<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I CAN&#39;T REMEMBER THE EXACT DATE. MY TANK BATALLION WAS OUT AT ONE OF THE LIVE FIRE TANK RANGES FOR LIVE FIRE TRAINING DURING OUR ANNUAL TRAING. I KNOW IT WAS IN AUGUST. IT WAS A VERY CLEAR NIGHT AND YOU COULD SEE THE STARS VERY GOOD. WE WERE PROBALLY 20 MILES FROM THE MAIN POST. SO IT WAS REAL DARK AND WE WERE NOT USING ANY LIGHTS DUE TO LIGHT DISCIPLINE. THE CLOSEST TOWN IS PEMBROKE FROM WHERE WE WERE LOCATED. THERE WAS ABOUT 15 OF US GROUPED TOGETHER AND I LOOKED UP AT THE STARS LOOKING FOR SHOOTING STARS. I SAW A LIGHT THAT APPEARED TO BE AN AIRCRAFT ABOUT 160 DEGREES IN THE SKY. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRPLANE. BUT AFTER WATCHING IT FOR A MOMENT IT LOOKED TO BE TO HIGH OF AN ALTITUDE TO BE AN AIRPLANE. ALSO THERE WAS NO NOISE. I BROUGHT THIS OBJECT TO THE ATTENTION OF EVERYONE IN MY IMMEDIATE AREA. WE ALL STARTED WONDERING WHAT THIS OBJECT WAS. IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT SHOT 1/2 WAY ACROSS THE SKY IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE. WE ALL KNEW IT WAS NOT A WORLDLY CRAFT. IT WAS WAY TO FAST. FOR ABOUT THE NEXT 15 MINUTES WE WATCHED IT ZIG ZAG EVERY 2-3 MINUTES ALL OVER THE SKY. NEVER MAKING A SOUND. IT WAS TO HIGH IN THE SKY TO MAKE OUT ANY KIND OF SHAPE. ALSO IT APPEARED TO HAVE ONLY ONE LIGHT. IT LOOKED LIKE A CONTINUOUS SHOOTING STAR. I DO NOT KNOW WHY THIS OBJECT WAS NEVER REPORTED, AND I HAVE TOLD ALOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT IT. I WAS WATCHING UFO FILES ON TELEVISION TONIGHT AND THEY MENTIONED THIS REPORTING CENTER, SO I FOUND YOUR SITE AND THOUGHT I WOULD SHARE MY SITING.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
