I was with my girlfriend and a circular object hovered approximately at the seventh floor of Stevenson Towers for at least ten minutes.  Around the object were alternating flashing colored lights. I told my girlfriend to look out the window and check this out.  She said &#34;Oh my God&#34;?  Then the object raised over the Towers and a bright beam of light was projected into the towers.  The light was as bright as lighting, this lasted for about five minutes.  Then the object shot into the sky.  Did anyone else see this, the date may not be right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was about 2 am.  There was no sound, the weather was calm and clear.  It was strange because we both woke up at the same time.  The light was coming from above the house.  It was like a tungston light, not moving and not varying in intensity.   Just incredibly bright.  After about 10 seconds or so, it was off.  There was no aircraft noise or helicopter sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I called the Little Rock police to see if their was any activity in our neighborhood,  They said it was quiet and nothing had been reported.   I also called the utilites to see if a transfomer had blown or something.  Again, nothing unusual and nothing reported.  It was just strange.   We didn&#39;t feel abducted or anything... just woke up to this bright,bright light.   ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

As I got older, of course the more I remember. But what I&#39;m expressing in this story now is something I will never forget. Mostly because I witnessed a UFO with someone else, my brother. Don&#39;t get excited, we we&#39;re not abducted or anything, but it&#39;s a classic story anyhow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 1980, an average cloudless bright sunny day. I was like 6 years old at the time (I&#39;ll be 30 in March), and my brother was around 11 years old. It was in the afternoon, probably around 1:00 pm (the exact time is hard to remember because I was so young). My brother and I were both in the back seat of our family car while my mother was driving out of our neighborhood. As my mom pulled out of our neighborhood with us two in the back seats, I distinctly remember seeing something in the corner of my eye. My porifrial vision took over in a split of a second. I look to the right of me, up slightly outside of the car window, and I&#39;m stunned by what I&#39;m seeing...a glowing red oval shaped object, not moving at all. Dead still in mid-air. Then suddenly...GONE. It took off directly straight, away from the street we were on...out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother sitting in the back seat with me yells, &#34;Did you see that!!!???&#34; and I say &#34;YEAH!&#34; We were both freaked out and explained what we saw to my mom, and she continued to drive like we were her two little boys making a story up on the fly. &#34;Wow, you something in the sky?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This interesting, the shape of the object differs from what I saw and what my brother saw. I saw an oval reddish glowing circle, halow, so you could see a hole through it (like an aerobee frisby). My brother saw an oval shape, solid, no hole. Anyhow, we both saw that it was reddish orange, oval, not moving for 3 seconds and last but not least, it&#39;s light speed take off in mid-air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve made a picture of what we saw, remember this is an ILLUSTRATION, I made this in Fireworks (similar to photoshop), but it&#39;s pretty close to what we saw:  http://davidpaslay.com/images/ufo.jpg  If you have any questions, or have seen something similar in Colorado feel free to email me at:  ((e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I found it totally by accident while on a lunch break in a park called `Sugarhouse Park`. I was lying on my back gazing at the contrails in the otherwise clear sky. I spotted it and couldn`t believe what I was seeing. I lie there 45 minutes or so before I had to go and tell somebody and of course I could not find it again. Later on TV news was reported two similar sightings. One in Brazil, and one in Australia. The one in Brazil was moving at a high rate of speed at tree-top level with no sound and lasted about 90 seconds. The Australian sighting was out over the ocean off of a beach. It was stationary and was video taped until dark. The next morning it was gone. This all happened in a time of about two days.Absolute truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

5/15/80 22:00|St. Cloud|MN|Other|3 minutes|Saturn shaped U.F.O.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94660.html|5|ndxe198005| Saturn shaped U.F.O.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a passenger in a car with my brother and parents when i looked out to the north and saw this light.  It was very distinct and only a few hundred yards away.  It was right over the tallest buildings in St. Cloud.  It looked exactly like the planet Saturn.  It was a perfect sphere with a ring around the center.  The ring was also very distinct.  It was the color orange like molten metal.  Although i could see no structure on it,  it was obviously rotating.  If you looked down at it from the top,  it was spinning counter-clockwise.  As it was rotating, (about 1 rev. per second) the whole thing would tilt 90 degrees toward me,  hold for about 2 seconds and then tilt back to the upright position.  Then it would tilt 90 degrees away from me,  hold for about 2 seconds and then tilt back upright again.  After righting itself,  it tilted to the left, back up again,  and then 90 degrees to the right.  Once it righted itself,  the whole tilting process started ov! er again,  tilting toward me.  When it was tilted away or toward me,  counting the diameter of the ring,  it was the size of a full moon.  I don&#39;t know what the size was.  The tallest buildings in town are 6 stories which is i think 60 feet.  This object was about 2 to 3 times higher than the buildings were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t believe that everybody wasn&#39;t stopping and staring at this.  It was pretty spectacular and was burned into my head as one of my clearest memories.  I have looked for this exact u.f.o online, and have seen somewhat similar ones but none exactly like this except for a book in the library. The book had a page of different u.f.o.&#39;s.  All were just drawings.  In the middle of the page,  in a rectangle was a handful of drawings that was titled, &#34;The most commonly seen u.f.o.&#39;s,&#34;  and there it was!  It was a drawing of exactly what i saw.  The closest picture i&#39;ve seen was a black and white pic from Spain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somethings out there.  I know it for a fact although i can&#39;t say for sure what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Did not hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> May or June 1980 (Five Witnesses) Oklahoma City, Oklahoma  Location: N. Portland Avenue, Oklahoma City between 8:00 and 8:30 P.M.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed two bright objects, parallel to each other some distance away.  The objects were extremely bright and circular in shape.  At first, it didn&#39;t seem to be that unusual, because they were aligned with a transmitting signal tower (radio, television or cable station), the objects blended symmetrically with the tower, that is, until one of the objects shirfted its position.  The circular objects were still positioned on either side of the tower, except one of the objects was higher than the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before the sudden movement, I had been ready to head back inside the building, but this definitely caught my attention.  Suddenly, the object on the left side of the signal tower moved diagonally up and out of sight, and the object on the right side re-appeared directly over our heads.  The movements were made simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft over my head was approximatedly 15, possibly 20 feet directly above where I was standing.  If I had had a fire engine ladder I could have touched this thing.  For some reason, I was not scared, I just stood there looking up, saying - &#34;That&#39;s a &#39;blanking&#39; UFO.&#34; I must have said it five or six times, with no real excitement in my voice.  I stayed very calmed.  The craft remained there for about twenty, or thirty seconds.  I remember turning my head slowly, from left to right while looking straight up (head tilted completely back) to see the full scope of this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I regained my senses, I realized I was standing out there alone.  The other four witnesses had scattered, obviously frightened.  I don&#39;t remember how or when, but I must have gone back into the building to retrieve my purse and keys, because all I can remember next, is driving home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving, I could see military jes flying in formation, two or three at a time, darting across the sky in all directions.  There was a lot of activity in the skies that night.  I had had the car radio on and the DJ was talking about sightings in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and several other states.  It could have been Arizona instead of Kansas, I just can&#39;t remember.  This only reinforced my sense of reality.  Anyway, the next day the radio person announced that the military, or some official agency had issued a statement saying the sightings were merely weather balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was asked a few days later to describe what I saw, all I could say was it appeared to change shape depending on its angle of observation.  It wasn&#39;t circular as it originally appeared in the sky, or triangular.  It was more...uniquely shaped.  What I assumed to be the front was hexangular in shape, and the angles appeared longer toward the rear, and more so on its right side, forming a rectangle toward the back right.  This object had some unique dimenional geometry.  I remember thinking later that it had extraordinary aerodynamics.  I only saw the bottom and not the top or sides.  Although, I do recall a picture of the craft on the Phil Donahue show that would have aired sometime in &#39;88 or&#39;89.  Someone, I think in Texas had taken the picture of the craft at a higher altitude.  I only caught a few moments of the show on my way out the door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object did not hover. Hover to me, means slight movement while trying to maintain the exact location and altitude.  This object was stationary, solid matter, a solid mass suspended by some unknowned energy.  It defied gravity.  I do not recall any radiating heat, or hearing any sound.  And, because I could visually see the entire craft, I would guessimate the craft to be 1200 to 1500 sq. ft. in circumference with some type of grid outline on the bottom.  I think I saw lights within the grid, but I&#39;m not certain.  It didn&#39;t appear to be shiny or brightly lit, while suspended above my head.  I seem to recall it was grayish-silver color.  What I cannot explain is the speed of this craft.  It&#39;s like it manipulated, folded or enveloped the air space in dimensions I haven&#39;t... Yeah! I can&#39;t explain it.  Its departure was fractionally subliminal and left no residual effects.  It was beyond my level of intelligence, nothing I could wrap my mind around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting as it unfolded would have had Einstein either scratching his head or beaming with delight.  Either way, I&#39;m no Einstein or Newton.  It definitely wasn&#39;t a figment of my imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not saying I saw an alien spacecraft from some other galaxy.  I&#39;m simply describing an Unidentified Flying Object.  However, if we do have his type of technology here on this planet, then someone or some organization has developed a way to manipulate gravity and the speed of light.  Moreover, there must be a higher degree of mathematics, way beyond calculus and trigonometry that a secret select group of scientists haven&#39;t shared with the little minds of planet earth, because this definitely defies general physics and gravity, as we know it.  It is a form of energy that is mind-boggling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I believe I had a visual close encounter of some kind.  I have never wavered in what I saw that day.  Trying to explain the encounter is extrememly difficut, or next to impossible due to lack of knowledge and things beyond my comprehension.  I cannot remember who said this, but they captured my frustration in a nutshell:  &#34;For those who understand, no explanation is necessary.  For those who do not understand, no explanation is possible.:<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of event is approximate.  PD))<n>

When we stepped off the bus, we saw a shining craft in the sky, an elongated cigar-shaped craft with no wings or contrail or anything. It was flying in strange way, going up and down like a sine wave or something, straight ahead the whole time but in an up-and-down way, like it was riding on waves or like when you skip a rock across a river or something. We could tell that it wasn&#39;t a regular airplane. Joel ran into his house to get his mom and her camera, but by the time they got back out there the craft had flown off past a bunch of trees and houses and we just weren&#39;t able to see it any more. We went in their house and called the local airport to see if they had any unusual airplanes in the area or something but the guy who answered said no, asked us where we seeing it from and acted nervous and hung up pretty quickly. Which seemed odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of four reports from same source.  PD))<n>

My friend J and I Purchased  property in a remote area outside the town of Hat Creek Ca. We were in the process of putting in a road to it. We were camping out rather that traveling back and forth to town each night. We had returned to our camp sight just befor dark started a small camp fire had dinner and turned in for the night. I&#39;m not real sure about the time anyway durning the night I woke up and had to go ((to the toilet)), I steped out the tent the camp fire was cold. We were camping at the foot of Hog Back Ridge the moon was coming up from behind the ridge. The moon lit up the night I saw something coming very large coming from the east it was huge I called my friend J you have got to see this he thought I was nuts until he got out of the tent.  The thing came right over the top of us it was huge it made no sound . I to this day do not know how but J and I were on board this craft we were gretted by four humans  at lest I think they were they looked just like us. They spoke to us for quite some time I do not remember what they talked about but it seemed to be important. My memory from there on is pretty much a blank.  We woke the next morning back in our tent. This is the first time I have told this story out side of my family.   I have no explication.

It was only a few miles from home on the way back when my mother stopped the car and turned off the motor and began frantically rolling down the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were in the backseat and my sister had shotgun. My brother and I enquired as to why we stopped and my mother told us to look through the windshield directly in front of us. Upon looking ahead all four of us saw what appeared to be a large round white light moving very slowly and low to the ground from right to left crossing the road in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother was trying to get the window down to see if it made a noise, it appeared not to. When it finally reached the other side of the road above a field the object blinked out like someone flipping a switch and as quick as it appeared it was gone. We were all in awe and a little frightened by this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not report this to anyone outside our family, my mother being worried we might become the town kooks or something but we found out later we were not the only ones who witnessed this object. Apparently a farm family had a terrifying experience a little earlier that evening and had reported it to some sort of investigators I am not sure who, and a burned circular imprint was found in a field close to the family&#39;s farm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the best of my recollection this object somewhat harrassed the family by hovering near the home for quite a long time. I believe this sighting was reported and could maybe be found in some Greenfield newspaper archives. I have always wanted to report this sighting because the farmer family were not the only witnesses to this astonishing occurence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

We lived on a fairly flat, rural, open, ranch area.  I was walking home from our friend&#39;s house across the street when the objects caught my eye.  They were two bright lights high up in the sky.  One was amber and the other was green.  They were moving very fast from the east to the west, from one horizon to the other.  From my vantage point they looked as though they were spheres many miles up and to the north.  They were taking turns passing each other in &#34;leap-frog&#34; formations.  The green light would stop and the amber light would zip past it.  Then the amber light would stop and the green light would zip past it.  They went from the East horizon to the West horizon in approximately 3-4 seconds.  I ran the remainder of the way home scared.  Out of breath, I immediately told my parents about my experience.   Due to my insistence they eventually believed me, called information and were given a phone number to call to report UFO sightings.  My Dad called the number (I don&#39;t remember the name of the organization that they called) and reported my sighting.  They informed my Dad that they had just received a call, reporting my same sighting, from one of forty firemen responding to a false alarm fire at Discovery Park, in Sacramento (due north from our location).

At approximately 3 pm.  I sat down in the den to watch some tv when I heard and “felt” a hum in my ear. At first I thought it was the tv, so I messed with it, it was not. Then for no reason, I got up and opened the door that lead out to the back porch. As soon I opened the door, the hum got twice as loud. Once again for no reason I looked up just over the back roof of the house. For a split second I saw a bronze craft hovering just over the roof top. Its hard to explain what it looked like as I only saw it for a fraction of a second. I remember it being somewhat long in the front and had some type of tail. The next thing I remember was the feeling of waking up after being knocked out. It took me a few moments to get my bearings, when I remembered I had seen something over the roof. I then looked back up to see what it was and saw the tail end flying over the front of the house. My heart was racing. I ran around ! to the front of the house, but all I saw was a strange looking rolling cloud configuration dissipating up into the sky, and then it was gone. I went back into the house, it was not approximately 6pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was at the top of a little hill, when I  noticed some colored lights: green, red, blue lights hovering on the shore (Clearing) of Little Bay de Noc.  (At the bottom of the hill it T-s, Right or Left) If you went straight you would drive into the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is an old abandoned lumber mill to the right of what looks like a old boat launch.  We played there as kids and remember going into the water and feeling sawdust on our feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the lights and thought, &#34;why is there a  helicopter sitting on the shore&#34;??  I continued driving down the hill and shutting of the music and rolling my passenger window down simultaneously.  I was listening for the helicopter, but DID NOT  hear any noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped completely (after making the left hand turn) right in front of it.  The lake is appx. 150 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights either went out or the vehicle took off.  Not sure which.

I was at the top of a little hill, when I  noticed some colored lights: green, red, blue lights hovering on the shore (Clearing) of Little Bay de Noc.  (At the bottom of the hill it T-s, Right or Left)  If you went straight you would drive into the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is an old abandoned lumber mill to the right of what looks like a old boat launch.  We played there as kids and remember going into the water and feeling sawdust on our feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the lights and thought, &#34;why is there a  helicopter sitting on the shore&#34;??  I continued driving down the hill and shutting of the music and rolling my passenger window down simultaneously. I was listening for the helicopter, but DID NOT  hear any noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped completely (after making the left hand turn) right in front of it.  The lake is appx. 150 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights either went out or the vehicle took off.  Not sure which.

5/5/80 18:00|Livermore|CA|Disk|5 minutes|3 people clearly see large saucer shaped object 1/2 mile away|5/29/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81301.html|18|ndxe198005| 3 people clearly see large saucer shaped object 1/2 mile away<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were traveling South on N. Livermore Ave heading towards Portola Avenue.  I was in the passengers seat and spotted a saucer shaped object, about 1/2 mile away and 1/2 mile up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was stationary.   It was unobstructed.  Clear as could be.  Silver in color with many lights circling around the middle.  It made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled over, got out of the car and stared at it. I would say it was roughly 50 yards long and 20 yards high. The colors seemed to be unfamiliar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After just sitting in one place for 4 minutes it moved, at an angle, about 1 mile away, in 1/2 a second.  Still no noise.  It moved about 3 more times, faster than anything I have ever seen, even to this day.  Finally it sped away and was out of sight in 1 second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it left someone said to not say a word, that we should drive back home and each write down what we saw. SO, we did.  And without communicating a word regarding what we saw, we each wrote down the exact same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were never scared and it didn&#39;t appear to notice us. It was clearly something from somewhere else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/5/80 04:00|Los Angeles|CA|Light|5 seconds|Los Angeles CA.  28 years ago. Spheric light travelling at a steady speed.  I knew of nobody to report it to. But now I can!|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64063.html|19|ndxe198005| Los Angeles CA.  28 years ago.  Spheric light travelling at a steady speed.   I knew of nobody to report it to.  But now I can!<n> <n><n> <n><n> May 1980 Los Angeles California, approximately 4:00 am.  Clear dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 15 years old walking with my oldest sister on 9th street towards downtown Los Angeles, CA. Heading for the Greyhound depot.  It was dark and quiet.  All I had in mind was the approaching boycotted Moscow Olympic games.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A small spheric light appeared traveling horizontally in a straight line, and paralleling 9th street (West to East).  At a height of, I would say, half the height of the terrorized 9/11 tween towers of New York.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound at all. It left no trail behind (as an asteroid would).  It did not appear to be descending or decelerating.  A very stable and fast speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It disappeared in the skyline of downtown Los Angeles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feeling disturbed, I turned around and asked my sister,&#34;did you see that?&#34;. &#34;Ahu..yes&#34;, she responded.  We both kept walking disturbed and quiet since it was too early in the morning and we were still sleepy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, I still asked,&#34;did you really see it?  It was a light bulb, or something like that..right?&#34; She responded, &#34;yes&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What ??  A LIGHT BULB ? ?  IT WENT INTO ONE OF THE BUILDINGS, OR IN BETWEEN THEM, OR SOMETHING !&#34;, I said again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister was, I believe 18 years old, and I&#39;m sure her mind was into guys most of the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spheric light we saw seemed as big as tower window.  I can compare it so because there were many buildings around where we last saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That left me a question mark for ever.  I know I will never see that again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At my age of 43 and with so many TV programs regarding the subject, I need to say it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

5/1/80 12:00|Salt Lake City|UT|Cylinder|About an hour|Something in the Sky over Sugarhouse Park, Salt Lake City - Utah|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56190.html|20|ndxe198005| Something in the Sky over Sugarhouse Park, Salt Lake City - Utah<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember looking up into a very nice clear day with no clouds - I was looking for clouds as my Grandfather had said there was not one in the sky - which we could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up around I noticed a spinning cylinder right above us - though very high. I remember thinking to myself &#34;must be a satellite&#34; - as I was ignorant of the subject.  I looked at it for sometime off and on as I ate with my family. I pointed it out to my mother and grandparents and they also could see it - but they where more interested in me finishing my meal so I could go play. It was not alarming to us as we did not think about UFOs or such things – just figured it was suppose to be there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember seeing sun light reflect off (flashing like) a more silver-ish side as it rotated above us. The other &#34;half&#34; was a blue hue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, as I got older and re-thinking about how odd it was this satellite was so low that I could see it and it was not moving, just spinning above us.  I learned that a satellite would not be stationary at the altitude I was seeing this object at. It was hovering and rotating on its axis at about once every two or three seconds.  Very, very odd - still haunts me today as for my lack of understanding and realizing several years later that was not normal.<n>
5/1/80 07:00|Seattle|WA|Disk|5 minutes|It was very shiny silver and 2 Army helicopters followed it.|7/8/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37932.html|21|ndxe198005| It was very shiny silver and 2 Army helicopters followed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was waiting for the bus on a Monday.  There were about 6 people with me, but they saw nothing.  I was at 92nd and Greenwood.  As I waited, I looked up at the sky.  I thought I saw a silver bird (seagull).  It was quite far away.  As it came closer, I realized it couldn&#39;t be a bird because it was too big.  It was shiny silver and flew slowly towards me.  Then 2 or more (can&#39;t remember) Army helicopters (had camophlage paint on them)came behind it.  The craft suddenly dived into some trees and the helicopters followed it.  The people with me were frozen (they didn&#39;t talk or move).  Suddenly I said, &#34;Did you see that?&#34;  One of them said what.  I said I think I just saw a UFO.  He said, &#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell us when it was here?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/1/80 00:00|Pittsburg|CA|Oval|2 minutes|Saw bright white light coming from UFO, that left our atmosphere possibly, in Pittsburg, CA.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42279.html|22|ndxe198005| Saw bright white light coming from UFO, that left our atmosphere possibly, in Pittsburg, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We used to sleep out side in the summertime. One night I slept outside by myself. I noticed an object moving to the left in the air. It kept moving horizontally to the left until it stopped. Then it just rose until until it looked like a star because it seemed to have left our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like it could have been over the hills behind uptown Pittsburg. It was a slender, bright white, oval light radiate from beneath, so I figured it would have been circular if you were right underneath it. I guesstimate even for a child when I saw it, that it would have to have been hundreds of feet long. The bad thing was I could have woke my parents but I was to amazed by what I saw that I regret them not seeing and believing it. I would take a polygraph even to prove my truth. I was getting chills earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>
