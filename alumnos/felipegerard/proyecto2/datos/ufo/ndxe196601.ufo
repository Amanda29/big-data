Smith,  AR, sighting, circa 1966/1967 (with additional sighting details)<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report is a supplement to previous reports of sightings in Ft. Smith, AR ca. 1966/1967.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a child, my family loved in Ft. Smith Arkansas during these sightings and I can clearly remember being brought outside so view the unidentified aircraft.  Although I was very young  (4 or 5 years old), I can clearly remember a few items:  - The unidentified aircraft were clearly flying in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father (recently discharged from the Army) viewed the behavior and maneuvering of the aircraft as unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Multiple people in our neighborhood were out in the evening viewing the aircraft with a collective uneasiness bordering on panic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Real-time media reports (radio &amp; TV) followed the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The local paper had front page coverage, with photographs, the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less clear memories include recollection of the unidentified aircraft hovering and/or landing at the airport and of military aircraft in pursuit (roar of jet engines and visible identification of military aircraft separate from unidentified aircraft).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The timeframe for the sighting is only approximate, but -must- have occurred prior to the fall of 1966.  My family moved to St. Louis in the fall of 1966 (where I entered kindergarten)  Media coverage of this incident was extensive, so I am perplexed why there is no existing and/or available records of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

We turned on the 10PM news, and the announcer was saying that hundreds of people were out in the streets in Ft. Smith watching strange lights.  We immediately went outside and could see them. They appeared a lot like the moon, except about 1/3 smaller, and of course there were several of them. They were all round, and the same size. It was a perfectly clear night. They would be perfectly still,and then move slowly, or sometimes very rapidly. They appeared to be about 2,000 to 3,000 ft. altitude, and we could hear nothing, absolutely no noise. We watched them for 10-15 minutes until we got too cold.  I now live back in Central OKLA and there&#39;s a book in our local library which details this very sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It was triangular and about the size of a volkswagon.  It had no visible means of propulsion and was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 50 feet overhead before moving out of site over a nearby mountain.  I wondered if there were similiar reports during that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was cold and dinner time so no one else was out.  I spotted two black, saucer shaped disks flying over the small mountain in the distance. They never got out of sync with each other. When one went up the other went up,etc.  As they dissappeared over the mountain top, a small single engine plane appeared, seemingly in pursuit.  I expected to hear something in the news the next day. But nothing, not a word.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.   PD))<n>
