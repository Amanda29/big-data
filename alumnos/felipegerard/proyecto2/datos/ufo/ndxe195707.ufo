7/15/57 22:00|Kresgeville|PA||20 minutes|As a child, I watched a "star" move slowly around other stars for a period of 20 minutes|12/9/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15378.html|2|ndxe195707| As a child, I watched a &#34;star&#34; move slowly around other stars for a period of 20 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event happened when I was 12 years old. It was the Summer of 1957 and I was at boy scout camp.  One evening we had a sleep out in an open field under the stars.  It was an extremely clear night.  I was laying on my back staring at the enormous number of stars.  The Milky Way seemed wider and clearer than I had ever seen it. I must have been lookin directly overhead for a number of minutes when I realized that one of the &#34;stars&#34; was moving! I was convinced it was an illusion, so I looked away and looked back again, and couldn&#39;t find the &#34;moving&#34; star right away, but after about 30 seconds, I saw it again.  It was just another white dot like all the other dots, only it was moving! It&#39;s impossible to say how much area it covered or how far away it was, but I&#39;d say that it seemed to be travelling in an area about that appeared to be about four inches by, maybe, 6 inches of the sky, from my perspective.  I guess this would mean that it was happening quite far away.  It moved very &#34;slowly&#34; in an up and down meandering sort of way as it weaved a path between the fixed stars.  I then turned over and went to sleep. I never said anything to the other scouts, probably because I was sure they would kid me.  but I have never forgotten this event.  In later years I mentioned it to some people and one person pointed out that it might have been sputnik(?), which I guess was around that time, though I wouldn&#39;t think it was visible to the naked eye.<n>
7/15/57 22:00|Salt  Lake City|UT|Disk|15 min|5 Silver Saucers flying from over the Salt Lake, and flying over the Oquirah Mountains towards Dugway|4/30/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36574.html|3|ndxe195707| 5 Silver Saucers flying from over the Salt Lake, and flying over the Oquirah Mountains towards Dugway<n> <n><n> <n><n> GL son of an newspaper editor, and my self were looking through his telescope at the close encounter of a comet.  His telescope was a complex refractor, had variable power, 4 inch light gathering power, had tracking ability, and could mount a 33mm camera.  He had won the regional High School Science with his rocket project.  I had participated with my Coal Tar Project, and won honorable mention at the State Science Fair at BYU, the same time Dr. KT won the prise in physics.   After looking at the comet with binoculars and through his telescope and taking pictures,  we saw 5 saucer shaped, silver objects flying from the direction of the Salt Lake, and flying towards the area of Kennecott&#39;s copper refinery.  The objects were small with the unaided eye, but were much more clear through binoculars, and his telescope.  We focused the telescope with the telescope viewfinder. and brought them within view.  Originally the objects moved slowely, to the site mentioned, and then stopped in flight and started hovering.  We could see through the instruments, that there were several distinct separate objects, and they were not the lights from one single craft.  We looked for insignia to se if they were possibly US Air Force vehicles, or army helicopters.  There shapes told us that they were unusual crafts.  We brought it to the attention of GL&#39;s father, and he also looked at them also through the instruments.  He stated that we should mount the camera on the telescope and take pictures of them.  The occurance took about 10 to 20 minutes in total.  After the 5 saucers where hovering in a still position, which appeared to not spin, they suddenly started moving and spinning, and headed at an increasing speed, up over the Oquirah Mountains, in the direction of Tooele Ordinance/Deseret Chemical and Dugway Proving Ground, and suddenly disappeared out of sight.  They didn&#39;t change color, and there was no trails, and no noticeable sound.    We discussed afterwards the event.  When I went home,  I told my pare! nts also of the event.  Dad said that I should report it, since there had been a number of UFO sightings in the area.  I talked to GL over the phone about the matter.  He said that his father told us to wait until the pictures are developed.  After the pictures were developed, we also had them enlarged.  One could clearly see that there was some advanced technology, w;h;ich we were not familar with.  My friends dad, then said that since he was a newspaper editor, he had an obligation to first call Hill Air Force Base, because he didn&#39;t want to reveal any Government secrets to the public.  After calling them, an appointment was made for the Hill AFB Investigating Officers to come and talk to us.  Three officers, including an AF Major came to talk with us.  After sitting down with us, discussing and recording the event. and looking at the pictures, they started mak;ing recommendations and requests.  They said it was in the interest of the sec;urity of our nation, for us to release the prints and negatives to them for analysis.  My friend gave up the prints, and negatives as reequested to them.  They told the edi;tor not to release the materials or report to the press until fu;rther notice.  We waited a few days, and an answer came.  A call from Hill AFB&#39;s rep came, and he strongly advised us to forget the happening, otherwise action could take place.  The Editor questioned him, and the rep answered that he was advised by the Army CIC that severe penalties could take place if the word would get out.  I followed the advice, and didn&#39;t ever mention the incident until 1966 when I attended a UFO Conference in Denver, and also talked to Dr. E. U. Condon.   GL eventually graduated from MIT,  and I believe that he still has some secretely kept prints.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/15/57 22:00|Denver|CO|Light|15 minutes|A supposed star, at a time before there were humanly created objects in orbit, which behaved very differently from the other stars.|8/14/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58079.html|4|ndxe195707| A supposed star, at a time before there were humanly created objects in orbit, which behaved very differently from the other stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In July of 1957, I was a cadet at the Air Force Academy which was then located at the temporary site at Lowry Air Force Base on the outskirts of Denver.  At the time of the sighting, I was taking practice celestial fixes pursuant to becoming an Air Force navigator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The exact date escapes me, but it was in July.  There were celestial navigation trainers in the quadrangle, small enclosures with astrodomes inside, that each of us used with a bubble sextant hung from an astrodome.  The sextants were 1.5 power and were pre-set by the student for azimuth and elevation.  Once the settings were in the sextant, the student would look into the eyepiece and choose the brightest star in the field to set the sextant crosshairs and hold them there for two minutes.  The two minutes was necessary for the sextant averager to arrive at the proper elevation for the precomputed time of the shot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this night, I had precomputed a shot for Kochab in the Little Dipper, set the proper azimuth and elevation into the sextant, and had set the crosshairs on the bright star in the field.  I began the shot and was adjusting the elevation as the averager was ticking away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;star&#34; I was shooting held firm with other stars in the field for about half  minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed that the azimuth and elevation were changing in excess of what was usual and could see that the supposed star was changing location relative to the other stars in the field.  I took my eye from the eyepiece and watched the &#34;star&#34; slowly moving to the right and slightly downward in relation to the other stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two other cadets in the trainer precomputing for a shot.  I tried to show them the &#34;star&#34;, but they could not easily see it among the other stars and it was moving too slowly for them to notice it easily - so they lost interest quickly and never saw what I was attempting to show them.  I was not excited because the nothing exciting seemed to be happening.  Consequently, the other cadets went back to what they had been doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the &#34;star&#34; continuing to move for a distance of about ten degrees across the sky (perhaps it was less) and then it stopped and just stayed in place with the other stars once more.  I continued to watch the &#34;star&#34; for several minutes and checked its location again before I left the trainer (at least a half hour later).  The object never moved again during this time relative the other stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought about this for some time.  I never reported it.  This was before there was ever even a Sputnik.  Later, in the Air Force, I learned of many UFO sightings that were never reported (reporting them was unwise at the time), and I began to think that what I had seen was a &#34;mother ship&#34; changing its solar orbit (otherwise, it would have been moving all the time).<n>

I was resting while sitting on my bike after I finished my daily paper route.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked almost straight up and saw three disks in a close triangle formation, metallic silver or shiny aluminum colored. They were not moving. Although the sky was clear blue, the air around the formation shimmered, much as you would see the mirage effect in the distance on a hot highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them for a moment, trying to figure out what I was seeing, Seconds later, all three disks went straight up very quickly in formation and disappeared. The mirage effect lingred in the sky for a few seconds after the disks were not visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not told this to anyone, even my parents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was during the summer and I had just stepped out onto our back porch which was on the second story of an apartment building.  While standing there, leaning up against the railing, something shiny caught my eye on my left.  I glanced to the left and observed a small, metallic looking, oblong object traveling east, about tree height, through the neighborhood backyards.  If the object had not caught the glint of the sun, I never would have seen it.  The color was kind of bronze and slightly shiny and blended well into the surrounding area.  I do not remember seeing anything that resembled windows.  There was absolutely no sound and no noticeable lights of any kind.  Guessing, I would say it was about 20-30 feet in the air.  At no time was it higher than any trees in the neighborhood.  It was approximately 10-15 feet long, using the trees and length of our back yard as a guide.  It was traveling very slow, maybe 1 to 2 miles an hour.  It never deviated from a straight line.  As soon as I caught sight of it, I followed it with my eyes, watching its progression as it slowly made its way through the neighborhood backyards and I lost sight of it due to distance.  I am a 54 year-old female, and looking back on this experience my impression today would be that there was nothing alive in it.  It reminds me now more of what a remote controlled probe might look like.  I had the feeling that everything in its path was being recorded.  The other unusual thing about this sighting is that I never discussed it with anyone.  I did not run into the house for more witnesses or mention it to my family.  Years later, my daughter and I were discussing strange and odd happenings and I mentioned this incident to her.  She was very surprised that I had never talked about it before and in hindsight does appear unusual that I had never discussed it before telling her. In all the years since then, I have never seen anyt! hing eve n remotely similar to this UFO.<n>

We were swimming in the Briargrove subdivision swimming pool (off Westheimer Rd) one summer day in 1957 or 1958. Somebody said something like &#34;look at that&#34; and we saw a silver object shaped like two pointed &#34;moon&#34; hubcaps stuck together, slowly decending in what appeared to be a spiral, although from our vantage point it was just going back and forth. There was a tall fence along the west side of the decking around the pool and as the object descended several of us climbed up on a bench that was attached to the fence so we could see over it. I soon left the bench for the high diving board to get a prolonged view. The object was probably south-southwest from the pool. As the object got closer to the ground it passed BEHIND one of those water towers that looks like a golfball on a tee. That water tower was (probably still is) about 0.5 to 0.75 mile away so the immediate impression was that the object was 30 to 40 feet in diameter minimum, as it was not possible to tell how far behind the tower the object had passed. The object appeared to be about one third the diameter of the spherical part of the tank. The object continued it&#39;s decent until it disappeared behind a treeline. I did not believe in UFO&#39;s at the time. We discussed the matter and concluded that if it was a UFO we would read about it in the paper the next day, but no story appeared. I think there were about 8 or 10 people at the pool that day. The only person I can remember by name was my friend ((name deleted--initials &#34;BR&#34;)) who also lived in Briargrove. The incident left a lasting impression in my mind and I can still &#34;see&#34; it vividly enough to be able to sketch it out.<n>

We watched them for about 15 minutes and then two jets Edwards AFB came up from the other side of the mountain and hesded straight to the lights.  As they approched them the lights started to go to the east aat the same speed as the jets for a few seconds and then sped up to about three times the speed of the jets then disapeered out of sight to the east adn the jets returned to Edwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the lights Started to move they didn&#39;t accelerate they just instantly going the speed of the jets and the same when they were going three times the speed of the jets<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The roar stopped and then there was silence but we could see the craft above our heads low enough to see markings on it but not in any language we knew. It stayed hovering above our heads for several minutes. We could see lights in the craft. Then in what seemed to be a split second the roar started flames or something similar out the back and it was gone. We all stood there frozen and although I told my cousin to go in the house and get our parents he could not move either. We then continued on our way to the ice cream store when we met a woman with a small child in a stroller and asked her if she saw it. She said yes what was it. Of course we didn&#39;t know.

Although I did not personnaly see the event happen, the whole town knew about it, and it was reported in the Local Newspaper, and admitted by the local police department and the local U.S.A.F Base near Del Rio.  Here is Del Rio&#39;s real U.F.O. story as I remebered it from my youth in 1957:  One night, a local Del Rio traveling salesman who frequently traveled east on US Highway 10, from Del Rio to San Antonio (165 miles away}, was engaged by a cigar shaped UFO.  The UFO hovered over his car with oscillating multicolored lights.  The UFO caused the car&#39;s engine and electrical system to shut down.  When the salesman looked out his car window at the UFO, he was severely burned on his face.  When the UFO left, the salesman being terrified, restarted his car and returned to Del Rio, (he was about 30 miles east of Del Rio when he encountered the UFO). When he reached Del Rio, he went to the hospital for burn treatment and the hospital reported the unusual circumstances to the Del Rio Police Dept.  This type of encounter may not seem to odd until you hear the unusual thing that happened to the salesmans new &#34;two-day old&#34; car within the next few days.  The next morning, it was obvious all the paint on the salesmans new car had been completely burned off. Within a few days the outside of the car had &#34;totally rusted&#34; from exposer to the UFO. The local Ford dealer could not account for the &#34;sudden&#34; paint loss and rusting on the car.  As I recall, the local Ford dealer gave him a new car and the U.S. Air Force took the car away.  The local Del Rio salesman suddenly left Del Rio and was never seen in Del Rio again. This story is true.  It really happened in my home town in 1957.  Many of the old-time residents in Del Rio remember going down to the police station and seeing the &#34;new rusting car&#34;.  Many local residents are still reluctant to talk about this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Dat of incident is approximate.  Report submitted by a public employee.

I am thinking it was more in the 1958-1959 time frame. However, I documented the date to match up with a similar sighting that was entered earlier. The other documented sighting was just too alike not to be related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some friends and I were talking in the front of a neighbor’s house when a sphere of light caught my attention on the horizon. I glanced up, seen the object, pointed to it and told my friends, “Look at that.” They in turn looked up and we all watched the object travel the length of the horizon until it went out of sight.  The object entered the horizon from the West and exited to the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were starting to discuss what the object was, when an Air Force jet came over the hill exactly where the object came into our view, and proceeded to follow the object across the horizon in a west to east direction.

The object made no sound that I could make out. The color was a medium gray. (If you take a flash light and shine it across a cinder block wall you could get the same look.)

This event has been rock solid in my memory since that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/1/57 13:00|Mullens/Pineville|WV|Oval|3 minutes|USAF JETS BELIEVED TO HAVE SHOT AT OR DESTROYED UFO'S OVER THE SKYS OF WEST VIRGINIA IN THE LATER 1950'S.|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20777.html|16|ndxe195707| USAF JETS BELIEVED TO HAVE SHOT AT OR DESTROYED UFO&#39;S OVER THE SKYS OF WEST VIRGINIA IN THE LATER 1950&#39;S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were Living between Pineville and Mullens , WV in the mid to late 1950&#39;s and one day my father and my older sister ( i was a tot at the time and did not know what was going on) but the elder two saw what they say were space capsules of some sort being chased by aircraft (jets) which were probably USAF Jets. Anyway the AF jets shot these UFO&#39;s out of the sky or else were shooting at them and driving them away....my memory is vague but my sister is still alive and can give anyone more details concerning them. This leads me to believe that there could perhaps have been many encounters that our government has had with UFO&#39;s through the years and have shot them down for nation security purposes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know the exact date of this, but i believe it to be in the summer sometime between 1955 and 1957. My dad has since deceased but every now and again my sister mentions this sighting. Neither of the two made a big issue out of this or reported it to anyone. I can atest they they are both people of integrity and would have never made up a story like this....It is still a very real incident in the mind of my oldest sister to this day. Truth sticks in a person&#39;s mind forever, falsehoods soon fade in the passing of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  PD))<n>
