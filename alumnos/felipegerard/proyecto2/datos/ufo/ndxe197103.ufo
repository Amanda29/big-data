The whole family was home when I was upstairs on the terrace with my telescope over looking the Andean moutains I saw lights in the distance and decided to see if I could track the objects the strange appearance of rotating colors from the diamond shaped objects had me mesmerized. My father and brother said not to bother any urther yet I could not stop looking till they floated over the high horizon of the moutain range. To this day I have wondered if the family had been visited by aliens. The fact that we lived at an isolated area away from the city and neighbors. I have repeatedly asked my family about the incident. They admit to the strange occurence being a weather ballon or discounting the whole event all together.<n>

My family was taking out the trashcans for Friday morningâ€™s pickup.  My mom yelled for everybody to come quick. My sister, father and I came running.   In the sky there was a fireball that looked like an Apollo doing a reentry burn.  But it was coming out of the north.  Once the entry flair diminished you could see the object.  It looked like a huge intake valve with the small end pointed.   It traversed the sky toward the south it was still traveling at speed and went out of sight over the edge of the horizon.  There were glowing spots on the back (the large part of the object)  <n>)=======&gt;     My mom told me according to new paper reports that it entered the atmosphere over salt lake city and was seen both from Denver and Los Angeles. She also described newspaper reports that thousands of people had seen it and that it landed in the South Atlantic Ocean.  She also said the papers and TV covered it Friday and Saturday but not a word on Sunday or thereafter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.
