1/14/82 05:00|Fort Lee|VA|Disk|8 seconds|Silent, Fast moving Disc with color changing glow, over Army Training Base, not aircraft.|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57494.html|2|ndxe198201| Silent, Fast moving Disc with color changing glow, over Army Training Base, not aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After Basic Training in the Army I was sent to Fort Lee, Virginia for my job training school. I remember this all because I was turning 21 and was keeping a daily notebook at the time. One morning while standing at attention in formation, something made me look up and to my right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed what looked to me like a large disc with a multi-colored glow about it. This was not a normal disc, it was somewhat elongated in the middle. It had a glow that appeared to be steady, only the glow around it seemed to be changing in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The outer glow was not one color at any time, however, it seemed to be many colors at once. I observed it as it crossed the crystal clear winter sky going from my right to my left. I can&#39;t remember the direction, however, it took only about eight seconds to cross the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time I looked at the guys on both sides of me and whispered to them asking if they had seen it. Since we were at attention, they seemed annoyed at my asking. No one else seemed to see the object and I never asked again. Our Platoon Sargent then began talking and I stood still at attention without looking for the object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned to the building, I drew a sketch in my notebook, however, the sketch was stolen along with other personal item after I left the Army.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was so black, and the object so bright that I never forgot this sighting. It flew in a straight line and at a high rate of speed. My guess would be that it was at about 20,000 feet. The object was silent and the base was very quiet at 5 AM. This was not from a jet and flew to straight to be a shooting star. I could clearly see the object within the colorful glow around it. My view of it was as if looking at the side of a disc, not the bottom. The object may have been a long cylinder with rounded ends that came to a slight point, like a side view of a disc with an elongated center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No further action by me and did not hear anything about it as girl chasing was most on my mind at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
1/7/82 13:00|London (UK/England)||Sphere|15mins|SPHERICAL UFO sighted 20 METERS away IN BROAD DAYLIGHT for 15 min|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29506.html|3|ndxe198201| SPHERICAL UFO sighted 20 METERS away IN BROAD DAYLIGHT for 15 min<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the beginning of July in 1982, a clear bright summers day in Wembley (London, England) without a trace of cloud in the sky, and my brother and I, aged 10 and 7 respectively, were playing in our bedroom (The front bedroom on the 1st floor of your usual 3-Bed semi) when I noticed a dull metallic sphere hovering above the fir tree of our neighbours across the road (approx 20 meters away). I called my brother over to the window to have a look as I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes; even at that age I could tell it was a UFO immediately. We had a very clear view with no restrictions in the way so my brother was able to confirm what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was completely spherical and approx 1m in diameter (without any creases, bumps, folds, depressions or protrusions) and had no lights, emissions, or sounds coming from it, it was completely seamless. It was a non-reflective dull metal colour which remained constant throughout the experience. We watched the object from our bedroom window for approx 15 mins; it was motionless and remained hovering over the fir tree (approx 1m above it) without touching it or anything else for the whole time. We watched it for so long, I guess we were hoping it might move, but it didn&#39;t. We then decided to go out and see it, so we rushed out the bedroom down the stairs and out the front door, which must have taken 5-7 seconds as I remember running as fast as I could. As soon as I opened the door I could see the fir tree and the sphere was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day its one of the most vivid things I can remember, which can be best described as a &#34;Seamless Non-reflective giant ball bearing 1 meter in diameter&#34; hovering for 15mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I donâ€™t know if anyone else has seen anything similar but I know what I saw and it was definitely a UFO and probably of alien origin???????<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in July 1982 is approximate.

1/6/82 17:00|Edwards AFB|CA|Light|aprox 5 minutes|Late afternoon/early evening, series of 3 lights, equally spaced, descending, disappear/reappear Edwards AFB area.|12/14/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40937.html|4|ndxe198201| Late afternoon/early evening, series of 3 lights, equally spaced, descending, disappear/reappear Edwards AFB area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While at Edwards AFB, while on &#39;line standby&#39; duty waiting for the last aircraft to come back to the base, my fellow crash rescue fireman partner and I observed a series of lights descending from a somewhat high angle upper left to lower right. Thinking their was some type of aircraft activity or military flares off in the distance from another military installation, we contacted by radio the airbase control tower. They advised nothing was there. My partner and I looked at each other baffled, as we continued to watch this &#39;light show&#39; for approx 5 to 10 mins out of our vantage point in the crash rig. It was as if these white lights were on an escalator, 3 at a time, same distance of seperation, but as one would disappear at the lower right another would reappear upper left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I am baffled and have only said this to a few people. When the control tower said they had nothing on the radar screen, that was quite baffling.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/1/82 17:00|Newcastle (UK/England)||Cylinder|30 seconds|size,shape,were all unusaul but the speed at the flightpath it adopted prier to disapearering was beyond this planets compensation.|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28208.html|7|ndxe198201| size,shape,were all unusaul but the speed at the flightpath it adopted prier to disapearering was beyond this planets compensation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FIRST OF ALL FORGET THESE DATES AND TIMINGS AM GOVERNED BY THE DIGITAL FORM THEY ONLY SERVE AS An ESTIMATE. It was along time ago when I had my siting and can&#39;t remember even the exact year: between 1980 an nolonger then 1985 it was in the late evening yet it was very much a bright blue sky day because it was summer time: Discription: It was out of this world and I will never forget it for as long as i live. What a site it was incredable nothing that exists today could perform the speed that this graft took off like.  I was young in love at the time and was with my girl friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had just been giving the dreaded NO! FROM HER MUM that she could not stay out that night. (together) We were planning our next move whilst lying in this field which now bares the founds of our new local hospital.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Siting: I happened to glance to my right and there in the distance hovering still over a caravan park was a large silver/grome cylinder like shape graft just still in motion a few hundred feet above the ground image if you were to take the wings off a passanger plane and the tail then thats about it.  At this point I turned to my girl friend to tell her as we both turned to look once again I saw it shoot from its hovering posistion to the 10 oclock posistion in split seconds covering a distane of approx 1 mile it then imediatiately shot off into infinity again in split seconds towards the 1 oclock postion. It all happened so fast that my girl friend despite standig next to me never saw it at all. incredable I know I simple had to glance around she had to physicaly turn around so this will give you an idea of how fast it was.  I consider myself very fortunate to have seen a Ufo and it speaks volumes to me regarding my believes, seeing is believing they say,after what i saw that day they exist ufo&#39;s that is: make no mistake about we dont and can&#39;t possible no the other half. Thanks for this oppertunity to tell my story I have been dying to share it with some one who would mock my comments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
