It began to pick up speed and I pulled into the nearest open parking lot I knew of so I could see all around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were objects all over flying in the area. 2 objects were shaped like triangles and were not moving like normal aircraft. They were kind of just floating by slowly.They would slow down and then speed up again like something I&#39;ve never seen an airplane do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2 I saw floating slowly were black and had lights on each corner. The object also had red bright lights on one side of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other objects I mentioned were planes but there were about 20 of them I saw just flying over but very low to the ground. These planes looked like jets of some type. The 20+ planes would turn on a really bright light and then they would turn them off. You almost couldn&#39;t see the plane when they turned their lights off. I&#39;m not sure if they were the same planes flying back and forth really low to the ground, or if they were different planes coming from different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen planes flying this low in this area and they were coming from every direction.  They were flying extremely close to one another as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no close airport or landing strip that I know ofin the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure if these planes were looking for these weird objects I saw floating by or if they were performing some type of test operation. They were definetly looking for something. It was the weirdest thing I have ever seen.<n>

I knew it couldn&#39;t be an earth aircraft due to blinking lights moving in a circular fashion. I didn&#39;t hear anything but the music that my neighbors had left playing in their garage, but I estimate that it was about 1200 feet above ground, and about 30 meters in diameter. Note that this is just an estimate. I knew it couldn&#39;t be an earth aircraft once I started focusing on it. I just couldn&#39;t believe my eyes. My dad and brother seem to think I&#39;m lying, but I know there is life outside earth, life forms smarter than us. And that was their craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was almost like a water bubble in the sky to the West of my location, not sure of the exact shape, totally transparent with a defined outline, almost like a halo, it hovered for a split second, it kind of pulsed, or expanded then contracted and then it moved away from my direct line of sight in an upward arc to the North West, excellerating at extreme high speed, &#34;extreme high speed&#34;, almost as if it was aware that it had been spotted.   As the object moved away it got smaller untill it dissapeared totally from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was sitting in the back seat of my an SUV with my younger brother and younger sister. I was looking out of the window into the sky looking at planes fly above us. I glanced over a red flashing light. I thought i was a plane until i took a good look at it. As i began to focus on it, the flashing ball begain to flash several different colors. The flashing ball was flashing the colors red, blue, and green over and over again. No way this couldn&#39;t have been a plane because the lights were flashing so fast. I leaned over to my brother and told him to look out of my window and he gasped and said, &#34; What is that?&#34; We told My younger sister, Who was driving, to glance over at look at it. She looked at it and said it was most likely a plane. My brother and i continued to look at the flashing ball. Unexpectedly, The one flashing ball turned into two. The first flashing had another flashing ball seam to emerge from it. The same thing happend a few more times and then there was were 6 glowing, flashing balls. I wanted to tell my younger sister to look out the window again to prove that it wasn&#39;t a plane, it was something else; but i couldn&#39;t talk, no matter how much i wanted to, i couldn&#39;t talk. i was in shock of what was going on. almost imediantly, they formed two triangles then they zoomed away so fast; i can&#39;t even think of how fast they were going. it was there and then gone just like that. I knew it didn&#39;t disapear because it had a path of light behind it like jets but instead of a white stream, it was colorful just like the colors that it was fashing. five minutes l! ater my brother and i saw another White/teal orb that had a white glow around it. this wasn&#39;t like the other orbs, it didn&#39;t have other orbs coming out if it, it didn&#39;t move it just hovered int the same spot then it slowly disapeared. i was in so much shock becuase i didn&#39;t belive in ufo&#39;s ever. i thought that people just made up theses stories and i witnessed it. I was in so much shock that i didn&#39;t talk for a few days after the experiance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The driver of the car I was in spotted it first, and pointed it out to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was flying in close proximity to where the moon could be seen. It was not dark outside yet, and not yet dusk, but it was almost time for the sun to go down. The sky was light blue and clear, with no clouds or discoloration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was flying much faster than I would expect to see a plane flying, and we rarely see airplanes of any kind in my area. The shape was a rectangle, but it was like the main shape of the craft was a very skinny and curvy diamond with more faint parts filling in the corners of the rectangle shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing was a pink tint, like a jellyfish, but with a more definite shape. It didn&#39;t flash or anything, but it did look slightly fluorescent. It was very easy to see, and it was almost the size of the almost full moon, which was relatively large compared to normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute and a half, our view got blocked by trees, and by the time we could see the sky again a minute or two later, the object was gone.<n>

Another smaller white light started moving in un-airplane like manner down and around the blue light. I saw it several nights in a row. The last night I saw it the blue light headed toward the north and the white light zig-zagged around then went down out of site. Other airplanes went by it. I have not seen a blue light like that in the sky before. Or a white erratic light either.

Driving down Main Street, my roommate pointed out the flying object that kept coming down from the sky closer and closer. We quick swung into a parking lot, and I got out of the car… the UFO was approximately only 60- 80 feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My roommate observed the UFO closely. As well as I did, but my adrenaline was going… and I told her to draw out what exactly she saw right the second we got back home. Around the time of 22:00, we BOTH saw a triangle shaped UFO, Three Lights on one side of the triangle, another light on the bottom of the triangle, and a red light in the center. It made no noise what so ever, and stopped in the air for about 10-15 seconds, as if it was just floating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We quickly went online after my roommate drew her sketch of the mystery we saw that night, but we knew what we saw, and we found drawings online of the SAME EXACT IDENTICAL object that we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never have I believed in UFO’s or even had an interest in UFO’s in any years of my life; I know that what I saw that night was unlike anything I’ve ever seen.<n>

It was moving at a steady speed and past just over the Fort Lauderdale airport and crossing the runaway  at maybe around 4 or 5000 feet in a steady slow speed (maybe 100Mph.)the size of the object was almost about half size of a regular commercial air line plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No noise no green light no red light no withe strobe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something strange there s normally always many airplanes around that we can see  but during all the time about 3 minutes that this object was passing  there was no airplane around son after this object reach this ocean  we can see many airplane come back  around again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like if they were advise to not come around during the object was passing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for reading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jack scott    Here a copy of somebody who saw the same thing of me 10 minutes after over the Miami airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 8:15PM on 9/28/09 I walked out and as usual I looked up into the evening sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed a very bright light in the northeastern sky moving in a southerly direction. What made this unusual was the fact of how bright the light was. My first impression that is was an aircraft, since I live about 6 miles from the Miami International Airport. The best description of intensity of the light that I can describe is that of Venus in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked at it more closely, I could see no navigational markers (red, green or flashing strobe) visible. During the duration of the sighting I heard no noise from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed of the object was that of a jet flying at altitude, but the altitude was much lower, maybe 10000 ft (but that is just a guess since it was difficult to determine since it was dark).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living as close to the airport as I do, I am familiar with the flight patterns of aircraft. This object appeared to fly directly over Miami International Airport which is unusual again based on the objects apparent altitude. Another oddity observed was during the sighting no aircraft were visible either landing or taking off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued on its southerly course and made a turn to the east. Even when it made its turn the intensity of the light remained constant. IF it had been an aircraft I would have noticed its national markers. One other note was as I watched it make its easterly turn; I noticed an aircraft to the southeast and its navigational beacons where quite visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it made its turn, I moved to follow the object but lost it between tress and other houses.<n>

Black square box with white light protruding bubble on the bottom; about the height you would see a hovering traffic helicopter; about twice the size or larger than that of a helicopter. No helicopter blades (though there was a barely visible large circular almost fast ceiling fan like haze surrounding and extending far beyond the object as compared to a smaller circle on a helicopter), no wings. Appeared to be having difficulty, somewhat sputtering across the sky; almost as thought it was a helicopter having mechanical difficulty about to seriously have an accident. Then it came to a complete and sudden stop and just hovered motionless. I drove towards it, where it was at a standstill almost directly above and could tell it wasn&#39;t a helicopter or plane or balloon.  I drove past it, exited at the next exit and tried to visually located again! but it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The sky was very clear that night and there were hardly any clouds out, making the stars and neighboring planets exceptionally visible. As I gazed up at the stars, a boomerang shaped object glided at a moderate speed across my field of vision. Its altitude was much lower than that of a commercial airliner and was closer to the height a helicopter would be flying at. It was a very quiet night and yet when the object flew by, there wasn’t even the smallest audible sound. The object did not have lights and was rather dark but I followed it with my eyes until I couldn’t see it anymore. I was so convinced that what I saw was a UFO, I quickly ran inside and woke up my parents to tell them of my encounter. It was amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Shortly after first noticing the object, it disappeared behind the tree line, as there are tons of trees in this area. Did anyone else see this???<n>

I&#39;m no aviation expert but I don&#39;t think anything manmade could pull a manuever like that, so I am lead to believe it was some sort of u.f.o.

It was 5 times larger than the biggest star in the sky at the time and twice as bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It at first appeard to be an airplane since an airport is nearby and other aircraft were simultaneously visible, however as it went overhead there was no noise and we noticed a wobbling effect every couple seconds.  I should also mention that these aircraft were likely commercial or private and weren&#39;t pursuing this object.  There were also a couple satellites tracking across the sky high up in the background moving in varying directions, they were MUCH smaller and appeared to be moving MUCH slower than the object in question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light headed SE from NW and would suddendly wobble left and right, in a predictably rhythmic fashion every couple seconds or so.  It wasn&#39;t changing course, instead, it appeared to rattle and continue straight... then over again, similar to wathing the line on a heartbeat monitor.  It eventually faded out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen this object once before around the same time of evening on what appeared to be an identicle track, size, and brightness however there was no wobbling on the first occasion.  I chalked the first sighting up as maybe a VERY LOW flying satellite if a type I&#39;ve never seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best guess for this most recent sighting is perhaps a weather balloon caught up in a large airmass with some resonant turbulance.  Who knows????<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

In that evening the witness ( I ) at my normal post and have been working there for three years. Familiar with the flight patterns of the small planes, passenger airliners, helicopters and the normal air traffic. Did not notice anything unusual in the surrounding area. The witness was on his normal patrol that evening. The witness was walking do west and notices a light that resembled the normal police helicopter with it spot light on. And coming from the north, North West over the San Gabriel Mountains heading east. It appeared to have swept over the mountains then came lower into the valley. When it approached and was closer, the object looked more of a ball or sphere of light. A super white florescent light with a hint of blue, it had a slight haze around it. Just like the planet Venus in the sky. The witness was expecting a helicopter sound but there was no sound at all. Planes and helicopters at that altitude make some noise at the least. There was no tr! ail of any kind either. The altitude was an estimated 2000 to 3000 feet when over head. Could not tell exactly the size of the object for it was as big as a small plane at 2000 feet at the point the object was over the witness. The witness had a flash light in hand and begins to flash his light at the object. After a few flashes the object or the ball/sphere of light was wobbling erratically up and down as if the object was reacting to the flash light. It soon starts gaining altitude and speed. Heading east then turning south. At that evening and time it past in near the moon and the planet Venus and the object was three times the size of Venus. And it was well gone at that point about 40-50 miles away from the witness. After the object was not seen it was about 19:50 hours. The objects flight path was do south east and seemed to be moving fast. Then do east and slowed down above the witness. Then slightly turned do south and speed off as well as gaining altitude. At the ti! me of the event the witness took a picture a few seconds of vi! deo with his cell phone. The video and picture is of bad quality do to the darkness of night and the bad camera phones performance. The witness called his wife to notify her of the event. At 19:52 hours, the witness went to finish his patrol when he was feeling ill. The witness did feel like he was affected by the object as he felt dizziness, confused and disorientated as he was walking. The symptoms last for an hour. But wearing off and getting better as the hour progressed. Nothing else happened that evening. The witness is 99.99% sure that It (the object) was not a plane, helicopter or any other conventional know flying object but an unknown flying object that was in good visual detail to make an observance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a similar object the passed by before in the same flight patter but do east only. The object was similar in size, color and shape. And it happened just as the station fire started. It was around August 26 or 27, 2009 at around sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was as bright as the north star and high in the air. I thought it was a satilite but it never faded color. The object was spotted above me by myself and my 9 year old daughter.

I thought it could be anything as it went very quickly out of sight.  I kept my hand up to see if I&#39;d see it again and for the next half hour or so I continued to see these, all staying very close to the sun, not seeing more than three at a time.  I called my boyfriend to go outside and see if he saw any and he did.  He called his father who liveds in Tualatin to go outside, and he saw them too.  They never stopped flying around the sun but we went inside because the sun eventually hurt our eyes.  We would have taken pictures, but it wouldn&#39;t work because the sun was too bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Has anyone ever before gotten five hours of video tape recorded? The vehicle is black and is hockey puck shaped. It darts and hovers through the sky and flys behind the trees and mountains. It&#39;s favorite place to fly is in a remote area of the mountains, where radar can&#39;t pick them up. What&#39;s the best camera to zoom in and still get a clear focus job? I need a high resolution camera and a radar on the roof,for double verification.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were really bright. All i could really see was the shape the lights were in. The actual craft was hidden. I then just drove off real fast. I was so scared. It was very close to me, just above the trees. I have never seen anything like that in my entire life.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

If I was on a chair at the time and jumped up I could have touched it.  It was going very slow. It looked to be as long as a long straw, a half foot long.  It was glowing white.  It looked like a white shimmering laser lazer.  I should have chased it!  There were no signs of feet, head, wings, or tale coming from this creature.  I could see it clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened two weeks after another sighting I had that was reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The report is accompanied by multiple photographs of other sightings of anomalous objects.

They were moving at a kind of fast pace across the sky looking like some sort of fre ball glowing orange in colour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran and told my sister who was in bed at the time we both looked out of the window and the orange lights were moving in a straight line. We ran to tell our mum and dad and we all opened the patio dor to find that there were dozens more moving about half a mile away from my street in a straight line. I was scared becouse tey were just apearing from know were. They looked like they were aiming to get to some place. People were looking out there windows and dors to see these bright orange blobs. I have never seen anything like it in my life but there were reportings by my street frieands that they sore three orange lights fourb weeks before this bigger event. I thought there was actualy going to be an invation.  This has hit the headlines here in England as other locations in Great Britain have seen simeler events matching the event that I sore. Some apparently were Chinease Latins such as in Newcastle when police were called out but later got told they were lantins. I diserg! ree becouse I live way thurther south than Newcastle in England and I sore 28 orange lights and so did Wales. Whats is the truth realy!!<n>

It had even flown over the car and back to the plant area and it stopped and hoverd. It had made no noise and when it had gotten close the silloute of the vheical was still bar type. Only other possiblity would be a predator UAV from our local air force base but it is a small space command center so likely hood of that is zero.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First sighting, object was in the North Westerly sky.  Very Cloudy night, so much so that you could not see thru the cloud layer to the sky above it.  This object was slowly raising straight up at a pretty constant pace.  It can be described as a oval shaped, that had a fiery apprearance.  The object did not make any noise, nor did it emit any smoke, or anything that would lead you to believe it was actually on fire.  The color resembled a molten lava appearance, flickering similar to a candle.  It did not have a strobe light, or any flashing lights visible.  This object slowly raised, almost hovered, until it raised thru the cloud line.  About 45 minutes later, we seen the object again.  This time, the clouds in the sky had broken up a bit.  Still mostly cloudy, but you could see patches of stars between.  The Object was coming from the direction we had previously seen it.  H! owever, it was not rising up, but rather traveling in a Northwest to SouthEast direction, eventually traveling pretty close to over our heads.  At no point was their any audible sound from this craft. The object was moving much quicker this time, but still had the same, Fiery, flickering appearance.  Once this object traveled over our heads, it actually picked up speed traveling to the South.  It then actually made a subtle dart from left to right at one point, making all of us watching actually scream &#34;did you see that&#34; at the same time.  The most amazing part was still to come.  As we all watched this glowing fireball pick up speed, there was a patch of clouds ahead of it.  The object then appeared to &#34;turn off&#34; or change to a jet black appearance.  It could be described as it turned into a shadow, darker than the actual night sky.  It was at this time you could really see the oval shape of the object. When the object turned black, it was only visible for about 4 or 5 sec! onds more before it was out of our viewing range.  The witness! es inclu ded mechanics, computer analyst, sales men, plumbers, Managers, Nurses, and a Doctor.  Most of these people could be described as skeptical, but no one was doubting that we had just seen something very odd.  We are located 15 miles SouthEast of the Detro Metro Airport.  At one point during the first sighting, i actually pointed out a couple of airplanes in the distant sky.  The light was no where near as intense, nor no where near the size.  Also, the strobing light on the airplane makes it a sure give away.  I pointed out the airplanes just as a frame of reference for all of us witnessing this object.  Due to the proximity of the Airport, i have to imagine something was picked up on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/26/09 19:30|Las Vegas|NV|Light|30 seconds|Bright light moving across the night sky|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72629.html|49|ndxe200909| Bright light moving across the night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside my neighbor’s garage when I saw a bright light heading from the west-northwest to the east-southeast at a high rate of speed. The object slowed and changed direction once; about 30 degrees shortly after it flew over my head. It then Sped up and headed more southeast dimming then disappearing into my horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate the object was at 10 to 15 thousand feet in the air. This light had no strobes and was clearly not a commercial or known military plane, nor do I feel it was a meteor. I know this because of my background in A &amp; P and the fact that the object quickly surpassed a commercial aircraft that was over 30,000 feet in the air (with the usual strobes). This light was brighter than the planet visible at that time in the southeast Las Vegas sky, as I could see both at the same time.<n>

The light never made any changes of any kind just went straight. The light traveled about 50-75 miles from the time it was spotted to the time the light just faded out and disappeared. The object seem to be traveling quite slow. The object flew right over the flight path of the airport in Phoenix. The reason I know this is I live near there and watch planes land and take off all the time. This object seem to travel even slower than the planes that land. Once the light faded out it was never seen again. The object was about 2000ft off the ground and made no sound at all ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS overhead.  PD))<n>
9/26/09 19:18|Tempe|AZ|Circle|1 Minute|Bright circular light travels quickly and silently from NW to SE becomes brighter turns oval shapped zigzags abruptly and disappears.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72632.html|51|ndxe200909| Bright circular light travels quickly and silently from NW to SE becomes brighter turns oval shapped zigzags abruptly and disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside at 7:18 pm and the sky had been dark for just under an hour by that time. I had been relaxing and just watching the sky. I noticed a bright circular light coming from the North-West area as I was able to view it as it peaked over my house off in the distance. Normally I see air traffic (lots of airplanes) coming in from the north but this one was coming from a different area and look nothing like the other lights. This light was about 3 times brighter and bigger than the planes I usually see and not once did it blink. At first it was really bright but then it dimmed a bit. I thought I was looking at a plane at first but then as it dimmed it looked as if it were really high and I began to think it was a satellite. Almost immediately after that thought the light became very bright and was bigger than when I first spotted it. I immediately called my wife outside to see it as to see if maybe she could make out what it is. When my wife came! outside the circular light was just about overhead roughly 85 degrees above the horizon line. The object was very close and bright but made no sound as it traveled quickly through the sky. It took about 1 minute to go from when I spotted it peaking out from behind my house off in the NW distance to far off in the South East. When the light was far in the South East area my wife and I noticed the light became much brighter and a bit bigger than before, taking on more of an oval shape. The light then slightly dimmed made a zigzag pattern and disappeared at the end of its pattern, ending right where it would have been the line of travel had it not zigzagged. We don’t know if it went up or just simply disappeared. Up until just before the object made the zigzag movement it had traveled in a direct straight line from the NW area to the SE area, once again with no sound and at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was also moving left to right which was causing it to reflect sun off of it. I almost thought it was some advertising mechanism for a car dealership but then I realized it was moving too consistenly and was too high up.. and it was next to the airport and I&#39;m assuming there&#39;s no car dealerships there nor any clearance for objects like kites or promotional balloons to be allowed up there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I definitely saw this metallic donut object, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s part of the control tower or airport somehow .. it seems almost surreal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t observe it too long as I was on the highway and I exited and tried to find it again to no avail.<n>

PD))|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72737.html|54|ndxe200909| High Altitude silver object hovering over central New Hampshire on 9/26/09.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sept 26th 2009 I was in Milford, New Hampshire just west of Manchester.  I was with a friend of mine.  We are both highly experienced commercial airline pilots with almost 60 years and 40 thousand hrs of flight experience between us. Around noon time my friend called me excitedly to the outside of the garage we were working in.  He pointed high up in the sky to the northeast of Milford towards a position I would have to say was very nearly overhead the city of Manchester.  As I looked I saw an object that had to be at an altitude of 70 to 80 thousand feet in altitude hovering over the Manchester area.(please keep in mind that we are both experienced pilots used to making accurate judgements of an object&#39;s altitude.)  It was spherical in shape and a greyish silver color.  This object hovered stationary for some 30 to 40 minutes.  I have seen high altitude weather ballons and I know that it would be impossible for a weather balloon at that altitude to remai! n perfectly stationary for even a few seconds even on the calmest of days  As for the idea of a helicopter, the object&#39;s altitude rules that out.(Most helicopters can&#39;t hover out of ground effect much above 10 thousand ft. Cerainly none at 70 to 80 thousand ft.) We both watched the object for 30 to 40 minutes and then watched it takeoff to the northeast at such a high rate of speed it almost appeared to vanish. I don&#39;t know what this was but I&#39;m pretty damn sure what it wasn&#39;t and so is my friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was peering onto a constellation I like to call the wolf, I noticed in the corner of my eye a moving light. This light at first seemed too slow to be anything possibly alien, but moved 10x the speed of an aircraft and did not blink.  Immediately I alerted my girlfriend and we both watched it for atleast 20 seconds move steadil across the sky until it disapeared. It was a dot moving across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have done investigation into satellites visible in Arizona at this time of year, but to no avail have found nothing. I am left to the conclusion this was indeed a UFO, if it not for the impressive speed and lack of aircraft lights I would not think so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  0500 hrs is 0500 hrs.

Then appeared two disk or perhaps sphere objects moving in the south direction.  They were white in colour, had a slight hue or glow to them, and perhaps quite large in size. They did not appear to be to far up in the sky and moved at quite a speed, I only saw them in my vision for about 10 seconds at the most before the objects descended in to the southern sky; they disappeared behind some trees and were gone from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind raced as to what those objects could be.  They did not make a sound so I can rule out fighter jets as they frequently fly over, and rattle my apartment foundation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it is nearing winter I had the idea that they might be White Canada Geese flying south for winter, but their was no evidence of wings and the movement was far to fast for any bird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time in my 30+ years I&#39;ve seen an Unidentified Flying Object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since they were moving south I thought perhaps they were heading towards a military installation south of Saskatoon called Dundurn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m absolutely blown away.  It&#39;s to bad I wasn&#39;t more prepared to catch it on film.  I hope I&#39;m not the only witness to this, they were very obvious and flying over one of the busiest streets in the entire province.<n>

I noticed 3 lights in a triangular pattern hovering up in the sky.  Just after I saw them, the lights started shutting down one by one pretty quickly.  The entire event lasted approximately 4 seconds and she was not able to look up fast enough to see it.  The lights seemed to be emitting from very large recessed pockets.  Similar to light protruding from recessed ceiling lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see the craft due to all of the light pollution.  It was a clear night, so there there were no clouds for the city lights to reflect off of which would have made an excellent background.  I could not give an estimate of the size of the lights or how high it was hovering since it happened so quickly.  However, they came across as very, very large.  If I had to guess the shape of the object, I would guess that it was a triangular shape due to the positioning of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the lights disappeared, I quickly turned into the Braum&#39;s parking lot to scan the sky.  After not seeing anything for roughly 10 minutes, I turned around and drove through exactly as I had just done to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing a reflection on my window or a streetlight or something.  Whatever it was, it was hovering in an open area that could not be mistaken for anything.  I used Solidworks with Photoworks to sketch out what the lights looked like before they shut off.  I also used Google Earth to show where I was driving and the approximate location of the lights.  I will email those to the address listed below.<n>

Initially thought it was a planet because of the red color.  Passed it off as a star and didn’t say anything to anyone in the party.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next witness brought attention to a red, white, and blue alternating colored light that appeared to dance above the tree line.  There were seven of us sitting around a campfire and we moved farther out into the yard to look closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got a pair of binoculars out and took turns reporting to each other what we saw.  Each of us saw a circular pattern of multi-colored lights that erratically moved while seemingly changing shapes.  Two of us described it to look like a Ferris Wheel in the sky or what Hollywood has depicted as a UFO in several movies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One witness documented the times and duration of appearance and disappearances as follows:  Started 21:15 to 21:39 very bright, distinct and vivid rotation could be observed.  It was at its highest point.  Also during this time period, 4 people witnessed what appeared to be a shooting star in the same general area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 21:39-21:45 Object disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 21:45-22:01 Object reappeared, lower in the sky, appearing farther north somewhat less vivid. Telescope was used to tract objects movement. It was obvious that the object was moving by the way it moved from the center of the telescope’s viewfinder within seconds. Another shooting star was witnessed by all seven of us. One witness was viewing the lights through the binoculars when it just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 22:01-22:06 Object wasn’t visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 22:06-22:12 Lights reappeared, even lower but still visible. During this time five witnesses saw a flash of white light appear above the object. The object didn’t appear to be moving as much as it had been earlier and the light appeared more amber in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 22:12 Lights disappeared<n>

From the 302/5/113 traffic light in the center of Fryeburg - look from where NAPA used to be.  Locate Black Cap to the west of where you stand.  Follow the ridge line south to the next shelf, Middle Mtn?, look up anywhere from 15-45 degrees.  What I saw was a very slowly moving, appeared to be stationary unless you gauges it&#39;s location using a fixed object, one night climbing then dropping, others dropping, another fading from view then returning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object at first appeared to be a bright very flashy star, upon closer inspection there were colors present in the &#39;twinkles&#39; - green, red, orange &amp; white.   In conjunction with the flashing light disappearing another light to the north was noticed - strong white light, on then off.<n>

Initially I thought it was an airplane coming straight toward my house at about 500ft. Then I noticed that the light was not flashing like an airplanes light do, and the light was moving slower than an any airplane I have ever seen. I tried to tell myself that it was just an airplane coming toward me so it only appeared slow and from the angle it was approaching I could only see the front headlights. I now doubt it was an airplane because it simply disappeared...Vanished...Gone. I have never seen anything like it. It was as bright as Venus on a clear night, but was moving from the West to the East at a very slow rate, and then simply was gone. Anyone else in NW Arkansas see this light?<n>

This morning was no different when I received a flat tired just a few hundred feet away from my office area, so it was not too bad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end of the working day which is normally 6pm but today I stayed behind to finish up a new user account creation at one of our client sites, for some reason it did not work whilst I was on the phone with the customer so I retried at 6:00pm and it worked and fired off an email from the new mail box which I accessed over outlook over web cc ing our support@ email address.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any way sorry but I&#39;m tired and I&#39;m taking the time to write this so any way I fetched my bike and to be totally honest I downloaded a number of mp3sand  put them on my mp3 player, I  unlocked my bike and started the 20/25minute walk home slowly with player on etc, nothing was really on my mind and I was just thinking about my outside of work endeveiours, I am successfully at a form of homework I do similar to trading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reached the corner of what appears to be wordsworth gardens and felt a slight pain in my stomach (as if confronting some thing)and I looked directly to my left and saw a large ginger cat under the tree , I made eye contact and given I grew up with two cats and can make an excellent come here sound I attempted to beckon towards me the cat so I sort of sat down holding my bike up with my right arm (see image marked with x), the cat just stared at me and I got the general idea that he was not interested in moving his fat arse over to me for some affection which is fair enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok so this is when I saw the object, when I got behind the second car in the picture walking along the normal path I take(normally on my bike on the actual road path not left foot path) I looked up and saw a sort of silver object, I very often do double check most objects as I was interested in ufos in the past and have listened to rense .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of that I am able to give the rough elevation of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first few seconds looking at the object progress as such.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s a funny looking airplaine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yeah I&#39;ve seen this before, The airplaine can be at a certain direction or facing a way that makes it look strange or funny.(and not like a plane should etc) Wow it&#39;s not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok Its not moving because it&#39;s so high and when it&#39;s that high you can&#39;t tell unless you watch for longer than normal, if its lower you can tell it&#39;s moving , its more obvious, how high is that, wow if thats so high that its difficult for me to tell the height and I have been looking at it for a good few seconds it must be plus 50k feet? but it&#39;s not moving even a small bit, not even a fraction of a bit of sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then concentrated on the movement issue a lot and tried to detected any movement at all going so far as to maybe walking from quite slow to really hardly walking in step and being more mindfull of my movement vs its movement so as to lower my movement so I could focus in on this point, it was not moving at all was my conclusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then reconsidered the shape and size of it and it was very difficult to make out what it was, it did not seem to have wings but it was not a clearcut shape but square with silver to the right maybe some kind of silver metal beam, yes there was definitely solidness to it and a part of it which mimicked the appearance of a wing but not in the configuration or direction which a normal airplane will exhibit a wing, sort of off and to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very hard to tell what it was or its correct shape to describe now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then continued to look at it for maybe a few more seconds before I reached the end of the long red line (see images) and I put my head down and stepped off the small curb and to the left as this is the direction to continue my walk home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sooner had I put my foot down,  of course I wanted to look straight back up at this weird thing but it was gone, my head then sort of went on a instant out of control sweep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then felt like someone had pulled the rug from under my feet or someone had stolen something from me and I was a little bit pissed off about the fact it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One point I wish to add is that the visibility was 100% with zero clouds and due to the layout of the buildings my vision of the sky was  very wide, I don&#39;t know measurements or scale of what I can see but I can / could pretty much see the whole open sky and yet it had disappeared, that was a total impossibility I can state 100% there is no way at all it could have moved any were more than a short distance at the height it must have been if it were the size of a craft, to disappear is totally impossible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rest of my journey home consisted of me pulling my mobile out and calling my parents to say what I had just seen and scanning the sky. but I got through to voice mail so I hung up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only additional points of interest are the moon was out but it was to the left and back of me or 7/8 o&#39;clock when walking down the attached path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10 to 15 seconds after the object disappeared I saw quite a number of other aircraft one coming from directly ahead and to the left going to my 4oclock, and further along my walk another two Plaines going whichever way they were going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regarding how high it was if looking straight up is 12oclock and straight ahead is 9 clock , then my eyes were looking up at an angle of just below 11oclock, you could not look at it with your head in a normal position, and it was not bang between 9 and 12 o&#39;clock it was slightly higher than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My final submission now that I can talk freely is that the biggest thing that hit me was when it was gone, it was there 100% whatever it was but it was when it was gone that was the impressive thing, that it could be there and in under 1 or 1 and a half seconds it could clear out from someone who had such large visibility. That is what I will remember from this, this was the unusually factor and light had not yet fallen I could see the whole sky in close to normal daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional points : When I got home I told my housemates about it, I have a lumix Panasonic dmc fs4 digital camera and felt it important to get out there to document the site I saw the object and also see if it was there again in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will inspect this part of the sky tomorrow at the same time to see if it returns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please let me know if anyone else has seen it or if there is a valid answer for what it was. I was not so impressed with the object but more with its ability to disappear like that, that it was solid there and then gone, it upsets me that it went when I looked away and i did not see how it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Images This is a map of the location spoken about above with the red line indicating the path I took.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://i38.tinypic.com/nnl8c3.png  This is the location just before I looked up, I bent down at point 1, then moved off to point 2 looking up at around, 6:45pm by my watch, checking my time now against the internet shows my watch is off by +8minutes *source Google gmt time keyword search and compare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://i38.tinypic.com/smye0l.jpg  I first saw the object when looking up at the sky straight ahead marked between the yellow lines around here, I was somewhat focused on it at that point but that is a good estimate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://i34.tinypic.com/2iji4xj.jpg  I then kept my eyes firmly glued to the object without releasing it from my view along this length of footpath, I retraced how long this is in time and at a slow pace is around 45seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regarding the size of the object it was very small, this is why I felt it must be so high as I have viewed air craft which is so high or very high and it is also very small when so high, if you make a square with your fingers like I have done, that&#39;s a rough size, the square, quite tiny. Its apperiance was of white with solidness to it being silver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://i37.tinypic.com/2vx58c7.png   I do not wish to be contacted unless it is extremely urgent, I am willing to discuss this but all facts of the matter have been reported here. I do plain on carrying my camera for the next month for my return trip from work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wish is that this report is used against someone else having seen it or that this report is helpful in some other way, such as this report confirming something regarding another report or sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is true and correct as best as I know how and I am not aware of any reason for this event other than something being there and then not being there, or in other words I do not take drugs or drink and my vision is clear enough to see being I am only of 33 years of age.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please email me if there is an update to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> End report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [background) I am a 33 year old computer technican, I regularly visit onsite at an Investment bank here in London, I take presales and post sales calls for ((company name deleted))  and other brand equipment.

It was so strange and scary I didn&#39;t know what to do so I called the news no answer I called the Air Force they said it was nothing but yet 2 minutes later 2 jets flew over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was pregnant at the time and you hear so many stories I was afraid that maybe they were here for the baby. I stayed up all night alerted by every sound not knowing what it was. By the morning no news of any sightings were on any news channels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not go to work because I started having light contractions. Me and my children were the only ones out there and the next day I gave birth I was still worried about so called abductions when I was sent back to my room my baby wasn&#39;t with ne I started to panic and asked the nurse said the doctor would come talk to me. I was terrified not knowing until I asked to see my baby he was in ccu he had a few medical issues water in the lungs and would need to stay a few days. I always wondered if it was because of that night. My kids tease my son that he is an alien baby or we call them our friends now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight my dog made a weird noise that made me look out the window and the object is up there I went outside to get a closer look because it had moved to fast and it was gone. I still see some flashing lights up in the sky and wonder if it&#39;s the same object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looks like a sphere flashing red lights with white like whe a firework is set off and it spins. I know that there are lots of weird things but this time I don&#39;t know I wish someone else shared the same sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will wait and see if anyone will ever see the same thing we have seen and what it is or if it wants something.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was a light greenish white.  Possibly a white center with a thin ring of green on the outer edge.  There was no tail or trail.  There was no smoke.  No crackle.  Did not appear to be any sort of debris.  It was fairly close, I&#39;d say within a 1/4 mile from where I was traveling in the car.  Or it was extremely large. I lost sight of it when it passed below the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a light moving rapidly and silently from east to west. It appeared at first to be a very bright satellite but they usually travel north and south so that is one reason this caught my attention. It was moving fast and was about the same size and brightness of the two stationary stars. About the time it was directly overhead and forming an obtuse triangle with the stationary stars it came to a complete and instant stop. Now I was really interested because that seemed impossible to me. Next it started to move west again and very slowly. Then stopped and came back east and then turned north and took off so fast I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing. It stopped and came back south. It reminded me of a humming bird the change in direction was so quick and effortless. It seemed very high in the sky and that is why at first I thought it was a satellite or some very fast and high airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this is something the government (ours or someone else) is doing then there are flying capabilities way beyond what the public know about. I am a pilot and have flown for many years so I am used to looking at flying aircraft and tracking them. This was not an airplane. Maybe a small helicopter flying at a lower altitude but in that case it was silent and I don&#39;t see how it could have traveled across the sky so quickly since there is a limit to how fast a helicopter can travel (~200mph).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Witness stated that as they drove southbound (actually SE toward Atlanta) he observed a steady circular glowing light moving E to W (left to right) about 45 degrees above the horizon. The course seemed to be more or less straight and horizontal, but as it approached the extreme right of his field of view (about 2/3s of the way through the duration) it seemed to gradually arc slightly downward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE DURATION OF THE OBSERVATION WAS ABOUT 4½ TO 5 MINUTES, THE LIGHT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE MOVING AT THE SPEED OF THE MANY REPORTED FIREBALL METEORS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The traffic began to slow down and backup as they watched, as if other drivers were also observing this event. Witness thought that he lost sight either by it going into the distance or perhaps some obstruction eventually blocking the view. During further discussion, witness stated that he did not notice any burning-like effect, no glowing debris breaking away, no smoke or luminescent trail or terminal burst. It just appeared circular, steady, glowing bright blue-green, no fuselage-like structure observed. No electromagnetic or physical effects were noticed. Also observed was a large aircraft, perhaps large airliner size, moving rather fast in the distance, but unknown if related to the original observation. Witness stated the light&#39;s size was about that of three (3) lunar masses, but he could not specifically equate to the lunar diameters or mass. He estimated about the size of a quarter held out at arms length which is about three lunar diameters = about 1 1/2 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> GPS Coordinates for I-75SB @ I-575 Interchange: 33°59&#39;53N and 84°33&#39;39W.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A check of the data base at the &#39;Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies&#39; revealed no scheduled man-made reentries for the time period of the event described herein.

The experiment was launched on a NASA Black Brant XII Sounding Rocket.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Charged Aerosol Release Experiment (CARE) was conducted by the Naval Research Laboratory and the Department of Defense Space Test Program using a NASA four-stage Black Brant XII suborbital sounding rocket. Using ground based instruments and the STP/NRL STPSat-1 spacecraft, scientists will study an artificial noctilucent cloud formed by the exhaust particles of the rocket’s fourth stage at about 173 miles altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ground based cameras and radars were based at various observation stations along the Atlantic coast and in Bermuda. Because of the optical observations, the launch required clear skies not only at Wallops but also at the multiple observation stations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Spatial Heterodyne IMager for MEsospheric Radicals instrument on the STPSat-1 spacecraft will track the CARE dust cloud for days or even months. The SHIMMER instrument has previously viewed natural noctilucent clouds for the past two years. The CARE is the first space viewing of an artificial noctilucent cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Data collected during the experiment will provide insight into the formation, evolution, and properties of noctilucent clouds, which are typically observed naturally at high latitudes. In addition to the understanding of noctilucent clouds, scientists will use the experiment to validate and develop simulation models that predict the distribution of dust particles from rocket motors in the upper atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Natural noctilucent clouds, also known as polar mesospheric clouds, are found in the upper atmosphere as spectacular displays that are most easily seen just after sunset. The clouds are the highest clouds in Earth’s atmosphere, located in the mesosphere around 50 miles altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They are normally too faint to be seen with the naked eye and are visible only when illuminated by sunlight from below the horizon while the Earth’s surface is in darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A team from government agencies and universities, led by the Naval Research Laboratory, is conducting the experiment. In addition to the Naval Research Laboratory, participants include the DoD STP, NASA, University of Michigan, Air Force Research Laboratory, Clemson University, Stanford University, University of Colorado, Penn State University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Haystack Observatory&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> End NASA mission description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9Dec09, this investigator spoke with Dr. Paul A. Bernhardt of the Navy Research Laboratory, Plasma Physics Division, Washington D.C., 202-767-0196, bern@ppd.nrl.navy.mil  Dr. Bernhardt was the chief scientist and supervisor for the NASA &#39;CARE&#39; rocket launch from Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia on 19Sept09.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event was described to him, and he was asked if the resulting experimental noctilucent cloud could have drifted near or over Georgia in the days after the launch and experiment. He responded that things at that 100+ kilometer altitude (ionosphere) were very different and winds below would not influence the cloud. However he stated that it is feasible that the cloud, or a part thereof, might have drifted over Georgia or vicinity, but would definitely need to be illuminated by sunlight (as stated in the mission abstract) to be visible to the human eye. When asked, he replied that the color of the cloud at the time of the experiment, immediately following the launch, was blue. During additional comments, he stated that another type of experiment connected to research at Clemson involved a release of TMA or trimethyl aluminum. TMA chemically reacts with oxygen thereby creating a bluish effect or cloud that is self-luminous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A check of the various science departments at Clemson indicated that the TMA launchs were from several years ago and no recent activity was noted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness in this case stated that their observation occurred about mid-night on 24Sept09. This FI is of the opinion that the sun, being almost directly on the opposite side of the earth, would not provide any light in the ionosphere over or near Georgia to illuminate a cloud such as that created in the &#39;CARE&#39; experiment. Orbital satellites are not visible after about 10-11PM and until about 5-6AM, thus the lower altitude of any said cloud would likewise be in the earth&#39;s shadow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> General information-only descriptions of this event/time/date were forwarded to Peter Davenport at NUFORC and the independent TUFORC (Truckers UFO Reporting Center)in an effort to locate any potential motorists/witnesses in the event vicinity on 24Sept09.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Potential witnesses reading this request at NUFORC and TUFORC will hopefully contact MUFON of Georgia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the NUFORC data base:  Occurred : 9/24/2009 00:00 (Entered as : 09242009 0:00) Reported: 11/24/2009 11:02:55 PM 23:02 Posted: 12/12/2009 Location: Marietta/Kennesaw, GA Shape: Other Duration:5 minutes MUFON of Georgia is, as of 24Nov09, investigating CMS report #20271 which occurred on 24Sept09 at about 12:00 midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location of witnesses: I-75 southbound at its intersection with I-575 in Cobb County Georgia (which is just a few miles north of Kennesaw and Marietta Georgia).

He did state he would arrange all of this as things were resolved. Nothing more has been forthcoming as of 22Jan10.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As cited in the below email to the PAO of the nearby Dobbins Air Reserve Base, the PAO had failed to respond to the email request, as well as several phone messages left for him during November and December. One message was also left in the Operations Center of the 94th Airlift Squadron, the major unit utilizing this base. In mid-January, this writer emailed the PAO again explaining all that was needed was some information regarding the night of the event.....anything that the squadron may have been doing that might have been observed by the witness and mistaken for an aerial phenomenon. Furthermore that if this could be done by a simple phone call, it would prevent the red-tape of my filing under the FOIA. On 19Jan10, this writer received a phone call from a XXX XXXXXXXX who stated he was the PAO. He was immediately rude in tone, condescending in nature and openly hostile to the purpose of MUFON. He stated that the reason I had not heard anything from them was that they ign! ored anything to do with &#39;UFOs&#39;, &#39;space&#39; and such things. Furthermore, when such things came in they just put them aside and went on to something else or words to that effect. This writer then gave him a short &#39;MUFON 101&#39; explanation, concluding that there were members within our organization that militarily far out ranked him and his associates and that our goals and objectives were based in science and so forth. Before concluding, he indicated that nothing had occurred that would have caused such aerial activity as observed by the witness, but his statement was couched in terms that clearly indicated he would NOT have told us even if something HAD occurred that could be mistaken for an aerial phenomenon. This PAO was directly opposite in attitude when compared to the last such request from this investigator which went through LtCol. XXXXXXXXX of the Georgia Air National Guard......... LtCol. XXXXXXXXX being a true gentleman and professional, and very helpful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, 22Jan10, the aerial event described herein exists only through the claims of the primary witness. The data in this report was discussed with him in several long phone conversations and emails. He appeared rational and cooperative throughout and had initially told this writer that his situation at home was degenerating as the holidays approached and was due to the economy, his frustrating search for a better job and various health matters within the family. At such point in an investigation, this writer has an expectation of having successfully interviewed corroborating witnesses and receiving a witness sketch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has not been accomplished due to the reasons explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In classifying this case, the probable cause used to do so is WEAK in this investigators opinion, but the witness will be given the benefit of a doubt in anticipation of him providing the needed information as his situation improves i.e. the case being re-opened at that time in hopes that the corroborating witnesses will have come forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This case is classified as Unknown-Other, but subject to being re-opened when the additional data is received.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tom Sheets, MUFON Administrator of Professional Standards - Field Investigator........22Jan10  MUFON CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Investigator: Sheets ID#: 11417 Case Number: 20271 BALLESTER-GUASP RESULTS ---------------------------------------------------------- INFORMATION QUALITY INDEX =&gt; 100% = 1 Information Acquisition 1.

Sheets of Fayetteville Georgia here, State Director for MUFON of Georgia (Georgia Division of the Mutual UFO Network....the largest and oldest international scientific group researching aerial phenomenon).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are currently looking into an event that occurred on 24Sept09 at about 12:00 Midnight. This occurrence was observed by multiple witnesses that were traveling southbound on I-75 at it&#39;s juncture with I-575 in Cobb County, putting their position a few (+) miles north of the base at appx. 33°59&#39;53N and 84°33&#39;39W, looking generally SSE or SE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A brilliant blue-green round light appearing to be the mass of 3 lunar diameters was observed moving from E to W about 45° above the horizon. This light did not move at the speed of the commonly observed fireball meteors, bolide meteors, or even returning space debris. It was under observation for about 5 minutes (a long time as these things go) as the vehicles drove south on I-75. The light seeming to move E to W (left to right) at a more or less horizontal angle (perhaps the reported movement of the light may have been an illusion due to the forward motion of the Interstate traffic). The traffic began to slow down and back up due to the dramatic nature of this observation. We are currently scrutinizing the experimental artificial noctilucent cloud that was created by NASA on 19Sept09 after the Black Brant XII launch from Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. NASA has advised that this cloud may be visible after dark for weeks or months when the sun is illuminating it due to! the extremely high altitude. It is possible that this extremely high altitude cloud could have drifted over Georgia in the days after the launch and thus was illuminated after dark by the sun hitting it from the daylight side of the earth. That is one possibility we must check.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow, I wanted to ask if you could advise us if the 94th Squadron, Lockheed, or any other entity from the base might have been conducting training, flight operations, or tests of any sort that might have been responsible for what was observed. If so, we don&#39;t necessarily need to know the exact type of operation if it might be classified or confidential and so forth. We&#39;re just in the process of our elimination procedure common to all of our investigations. About 95+% of everything reported to us is eventually proved to be prosaic, mundane everyday occurrences, natural or misunderstood man-made etc. However, the remaining 5 or so percent does often get classified as unknown. As well, did your office receive any calls from the public on or about 24-25Sept09 regarding observation this event?  Any help you can provide will be much appreciated. (NOTE: I left a message on your office recorder on 25Nov09 for a call back).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best  Tom Sheets, State Director-MUFON of Georgia...........800-696-2944  --------------------------------------------------------  Mr. XXXXX,  Tom Sheets of Fayetteville here, State Director for MUFON of Georgia. We&#39;ve received your report here in the office and wish to know more. I too live here in Fayetteville so will be calling you soon rather than assigning this to one of our other investigators.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you agree, there are some more questions we wish to ask in our effort to identify exactly what you observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for contacting us!

At about 10:30 pm,as we packed up to leave we noticed a bright colored gold object in the distance.  We thought that it was another model airplane so we decided to drive closer to it and watch it.  As we headed closer to the origin we could see that it was not a model airplane.  It was cigar in shape and hoovered approximately 20 feet above the almond orchards.  We were not the only ones that saw it.  We exited on the Hammet Ave exit and there were plenty of other cars on the overpass that were braking to watch these strange lights.  We then decided to chase it down.  This is an area filled with nothing but almond orchards.  It took us awhile but we finally made it to the general area.  It hoovered there in the middle of the almond orchard approximately a 1/2 mile away from us .  We turned our head for 3 seconds and the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/23/09 22:00|Chapleau (Canada)|ON|Light|1 hour|Round, Star Looking White light with Red around it and and a single white moving light|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72633.html|83|ndxe200909| Round, Star Looking White light with Red around it and and a single white moving light<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Wednesday, September 23rd at about 10:00p.m., I was on a fishing trip at Wakami Lake which is in the area of Chapleau, Ontario, Canada. Within Google Earth the location of the object was ( 47°25&#39;21.60&#34;N, 82°49&#39;55.44&#34;W) and the area from which I was watching was roughly  (47°32&#39;9.03&#34;N,  82°50&#39;28.40&#34;W)  I had decided to take a walk to the shoreline to get out of the treeline and get a good look at the stars because there were so many that it amazed me. Well on this night I noticed directly across the lake, there was a star that was as bright as the Northern Star. The difference was the fact that this star was sitting just above the tree line.  I observed it for awhile and asked my uncle to come look at it because I have never seen a star sit that low in my life. He came and looked and agreed that it was strange. We both tried to rule out a radio tower because the light in the center remained white, but out of nowhere there was this red light that seemed to circulate around the white and almost seemed like the colors blended together.  I thought at one point that I saw smaller little balls come out of it, but I couldn&#39;t be sure from the distance I was away from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood and continued to watch the colors like a light show and then all of a sudden there was a quick burst of white lights, as if the object swelled in size and then went back to the same state again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My uncle asked me if I had seen that and I said yes. The flash of white light reminded me of the sensation of a bolt of lightning. He was weirded out and went back to the camper. I continued to watch in amazement and then all of a sudden I saw the object move. I called my uncle to come back and watch to make sure my eyes were not playing tricks on me because I was watching for awhile. When he came back to see, the object moved again. We both decided that ruled out the possibility of it being a radio tower. I continued to watch. The first movement was from left to right at a slanted invert, maybe 35 degrees. Then the object came back on the same path to it&#39;s original position. It then went from the left to the right again in a direct line and then make a movement in the shape of and N. I do not know of any Aircraft that can move in that way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did go back to it&#39;s position and remained there for a few minutes and my uncle left again. I had a big flashlight that shone a ways out and decided to try and flash towards the object in a signal fashion (On and Off and On and Off). I noticed that when I did this, the object would start to move again. The best way I could describe the patterns of movement was in the fashion of a diagnostic, but It would always return to the original position it started out from. I then decided to shut the generator off to kill all the lights at our campsite and get an even better view, seeing as I was the only one still up at this point. The part that made me a little nervous was the fact that within 30 seconds of turning off the generator and all of the lights, the object started one last motion from left to right, in an upwards direction of about 35 degrees again just like the first motion I had seen, it then disappeared in the blink of an eye. At this point I figured I should go to bed and that&#39;s what I did. Now it got a little bit stranger from here.... I was sleeping in the cab of the truck, in the back seat. The truck has slightly slanted windows so you can see the sky when you lay down. As soon as I laid down and noticed the stars directly above me, I noticed one of the stars moving. This star was just a white light and not as bright as the one I watched from across the lake. This star did follow similar patterns, but the movement reminded me of how a Water-Spider moves on the water. I really didn&#39;t know what to think at this point. The only conclusion that I could draw from the second object I saw was the possibility of it being a GPS Satellite, but I&#39;m not sure what movement patterns they would use or whether you can see a GPS satellite in Space?  I did watch the first object for almost an hour before it left and then laid in the truck and watched the second object for over an hour before I got out of the truck and went to the lake again to see if the first object came back. The first object never did come back. When I got back to the truck the second object was still directly above the truck and continued to move in random patterns until I eventually fell asleep. The second object I do question was it was because it remained but the major differences between the two was the fact that the second object I observed was outside Earth&#39;s atmosphere and the first object was definitely within Earth&#39;s atmosphere. I&#39;d say only several hundred feet off the ground. The next night was my final night at the lake and unfortunately I was unable to follow up to see if either objects we&#39;re back or still there because a storm front came in and the entire sky was overcast with clouds. I guess I will be haunted for the rest of my days with not knowing what I really saw, seeing as I didn&#39;t make out a specific craft or anything that would allow me to identify either of the objects. I&#39;m not forcing anyone to believe me, but I know what I saw and that&#39;s good enough for me due to the fact that I now have no doubt in my mind that there is intelligent life out there or man has created something that is truly amazing and that should be shared with the rest of the world. Either way, I felt I should share my experience and I hope this may get other people that will be in the area to keep there eyes towards the skies at night because it was confirmation that I&#39;ve waited my whole life to see and be able to put all doubt outside of my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thank you for taking the time to read this and sharing my experience with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Our hope was too catch animals off guard and maybe get interesting pictures. I was using a flash, on each and shot over a hundred pictures that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left at 8,30   Throughout  the entire evening,  we felt only that a calming ride in the country had occurred with possibly some good pictures . Pictures we&#39;d view in the morning  on the computer. The next morning when I looked through them enlarging them on  photo gallery, I saw the two pictures and a few others.  I&#39;m sending. 4 that night that I had no memory,, of taking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had no memory at all of anything seen in the images, the craft, or the thing in front of the car.    No memory of being stopped.    We returned on the next night thinking something cool had happened seeing a UFO and  thought since we were unharmed it would be safe to return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night we went we had similar results, a few more pictures that were strange even more frightening because of the activity in front of our car that could not be made out clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were  slightly worried but more curious about the ship we had seen twice in the pictures. and after a few more days thought again it might be safe, so we returned with tape recorders in the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And the things on the tapes were muffled but a few areas crystal clear,  one of these was our talking on the tape, and then the car stopping suddenly, the doors came open and my wife was drug out with a whimper, and the sound of me struggling in my seat unable to speak went on for some time, possibly 10 seconds, there was a humming sound in two short bursts, and I was heard struggling no longer, in fact neither of us  were heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a point where a voice makes a sexual reference, one sentence,,  and then that yea their dumb.  Afterward, some time later( yea there almost ready. )  the sounds of  arranging equipment? Like picking up stuff , closing a container, etc. Within the next minute we start the car, pull away driving again, and resume the conversation we had been having before the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We returned home, ready for sleep, having no idea anything had occurred.  We had by mid-night the beginning of severe abdominal pain and rectal pain as well, identical. These conditions lasted for the better part of three days.  This and the things found on the tape made it clear what  had possibly  taken place .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again photos were in the large set ,of only a odd shaped vehicle outside the car stirring up dust.  Its strange sound on the tape.  There were other things said so disturbing to us, I destroyed the tapes.  The photos I&#39;m sending are the clearest free of dust flakes that made the others unidentifiable.  We experienced a time loss of roughly an hour two times at least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During a recent  hospital trip a small round polished bead the size of a BB, the airgun ammo, was seen in my sinus cavity in a  x-ray.  Also, I have a hole on the back of my neck, near my hairline, that a  sewing needle could be inserted almost its whole length, eye first with no pain.  No blood or discharge of any kind.  It can still be seen.<n>

The colors were  crisp and bright, had a gem like sparkle, the red looking like a ruby. They flashed in different areas looking as though they were moving around a shape.  But at this point it sat so still, we continued to believe it was a heavenly body of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the lights looked so conspicuously different than anything else, we continued to observe it carefully.  At first it moved about the speed of a bright planet setting on the horizon.  Then it seemed to set  fast but had moved slightly south.  We lost sight of it and it looked like it was gone so we ignored it for about 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it was there again sitting in the sky higher up than when we last saw it and much further to the south, more in front of us. It started to move north at an upward angle for a short distance.  Then floated in a straight line down towards Earth.  Then upwards again ending with a slight but definitely perceptible fast, zig zag pattern.  It&#39;s hard to describe it&#39;s ability to change it&#39;s movements – it drifted, floated, cruised and had the fast zig zag motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Losing altitude it moved south at an angle, the lights stopped flashing, it took on a pod appearance and drifted south in a straight line and we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after wards, the sky appeared active with military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else see this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I went into the locker room and changed clothes.  When I exited the locker room I noticed it was much closer than before.  I walked about 100 yards to the shop I work in.  By this time it was flying over the shop.  I grabbed one of my co-workers and showed it to him.  At the same time another co-worker rode up in his work truck and asked me &#34;What was that?&#34;  By this time it was almost out of sight.  There is an air force base in the direction it was headed.  It was very strange to all of us.  We thought it might have been something from the base, but at the same time it was so strange it makes me think otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was facing north and i noticed the white bright light flying through the sky at a speed greater than any of the satellites i had previously observed at night. The object flew overhead at great speed in a north northeast direction. and began slowing down as it reached about 60 degrees above the horizon.  The Slowing of the object was accompanied by a spiraling movement.  When the object stopped it disappeared momentarily then reappeared moving in a zig zag pattern then resumed its original course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Together moving quickly southeast<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 06:15, while outside with the dog, I observed a dim to moderately bright yellowish light approaching from the north. As we live near an airport I at first thought it to be a plane. As it got closer it became a triangle shape of 3 lights. The lights were spaced too far apart to be any type of aircraft. When it was almost overhead it turned sharply to the East. I could then see that the 3 lights were slightly oval in shape, brighter in the center, dimming with a slight haze to the outside. As it (they) continued east the light in the right rear quickly moved to the left past the left light then back into position leading me to believe it was not a single object with three lights but three objects. The group then turned southeast and slowly faded. These were traveling faster than an aircraft would appear to be but much slower than a meteor. There was absolutely no sound. The sky was clear, no clouds, and no fog. I had a perfectly clear view. Th! e altitude was difficult to ascertain due to the size of the objects with nothing to compare but possibly 30-50k feet is likely.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went to look out the window and see how the weather was for the day. It was still pitch black out with a medium overcast outside due to the rain. I couldnt see any stars, just the street light in the distance flickering. All of a sudden I saw a bright light streak across the sky almost as if a shooting star but it was going straight and not downwards. The light looked almost like a rocket shooting across the sky. It was oval shaped and brighter than anything I have ever seen in the sky.It had a short trail behind it, but again nothing like a shooting star. It shot from the North East corner of the sky to the North West. I do live by missle fields, but to my knowledge no nuclear missles have been launched. What in the world did I see? What was it?<n>
9/23/09 02:00|Prescott|AZ|Flash|1:30 hours|UFO sighting Prescott Arizona|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72614.html|93|ndxe200909| UFO sighting Prescott Arizona<n> <n><n> <n><n> While at the look out in Prescott Arizona, a popular view in the Prescott National Forest, my girlfriend and I witnessed a rather odd occurence. There is a vast expanse of hills in front of the look out for miles, on the top near the ride appeared at what first seemed to be a bonfire, a very orange glow. After a couple of minutes this fire flared up immensely huge, larger than the sillouhette of a house at night. It was quite blinding to be honest. My girlfriend and I immediately convened that this was indeed paranormal at best. After a short spell of being very bright, the light died down and eventually extinguished. Within the next few minutes, another what seemed to be bonfire lit up down the mountain, what would have definitely been miles and impossible for any group of people to travel on foot in that amount of time. The fire grew and grew until it was again blinding, dying down but not extinguishing, and becoming blinding again before extinguishing ful! ly. Within the next 5 or so minutes, another bonfire lit up only this time very far left on the mountain, miles from where the second and first bonfires appeared. This one seemed to join up with another light that was already present on the hill and became extremely bright. Both lights extinguished to our astonishment. Over the course of the next hour in the immediate vecinity of the conjunction of the last two lights, the blinding light came back atleast 2 more times, the last being the very brightest and extremely blinding, this last blinding light existing for a couple of minutes whilst the others only were blinding for mere seconds. The light then extinguished permanently. After twenty minutes of not reapearing, my girlfriend and I were thoroughly freaked out and drove home. Also it is important to mention that there was no mentionable smoke emitting from the &#34;bonfire&#34;, and even though this is a season of prescribed burns in the Prescott area, they do not go through wit! h burns at night. Another important fact being that the &#34;fires! &#34; appear ed relatively very quickly after each extinguished miles from eachother,far too quickly to walk or even drive and light another blinding fire...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object had green lights around the outer edge of the saucer shaped craft with red lights top and bottom, nothing flashing. The craft would linger there like a old porch light in the wind and u can see that in videos. My wife and son went back to bed after about an hour, I stayed up recording and watching. I was not getting the quailty shots I wanted so I called local news room KTVB Channel 7 in Boise Idaho and told them to look for it. I hope they did, it stayed for about another 20 - 30 mins after that I went and looked and could no longer see it. I live in Meridian, Idaho and view it in the southwest sky. I never really believe in UFOs but that was something funky,,, a UFO.... The weir! d thing is we have a airport near by, BOI, and never heard or saw a plane in the entiree time watched UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We both noticed a low flying, yet silent unknown aircraft in the sky.  It sort of resembled a US Stealth Bomber.  There were vibrant colours flashing from the aircraft.  Purples, blues, greens and pinks. We stood there for a good minute observing the object.  It barely moved, it just hovered, very silently. I had my phones camera ready to record a video but then it quickly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It looked as tho it were really high up based on the size and comparing it to the space station which is viewable in the sky from my house right now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving in kind of a zigzag pattern, but would also come to a complete stop and then move again, the movement of it was like in spurts, it would slow down, come to a stop, then dash forward really quick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But to make it basic, it was an orange, pulsating, orb<n>

(I wish upon this same star everynight after work so it is always in the same place in the sky, at this time of year)  I joked to my friend to look at the UFO in the sky and he looked up and stopped laughing at me. He saw the same bright white light that I did and we stopped walking and witnessed it “bounce” across the sky.  There was no flashing lights like a commercial aircraft, no sound and it was not moving in a straight line, but bobbing up and down as it moved away from us slowly like it was going up and down on waves in the sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 seconds to a minute of observation, we witnessed it just fade away. I thought I noticed it dip slightly and turn further to the east just before it faded. My friend thought it was far away and moved at high speed away from us, and thought it was outside our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was much lower in our atmosphere, maybe only 5,000 – 10,000 feet up, as I am an amateur Astronomer and have looked at the moon and comets through both binoculars and a small telescope and frequently lie back and watch planes go over head, I know how high a plane is when it is flying the North Atlantic great circle route probably 35,000 feet up, you have to tilt you head way back almost to lose your balance, this object was an easy glance up, maybe only 45 degrees up from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun was fully down, so I don’t expect this was a reflection, I have never observed anything like this in the daytime or nightime sky before, my friend guessed it might be a flare if it was as low as I thought, but it was not losing altitude, it was maintaining it’s forward speed and altitude like a powered craft would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe in life in the universe, but have a hard time believing this was anything other worldly, but I’d love to see if anyone else noticed this object over Dartmouth Nova Scotia,<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I saw 3 bolts of white light shoot across the sky from the East to the West. They looked like lightning, but they were perfectly straight. The sky was cloudy, but there was not any adverse weather. It was about 80 degrees out side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One followed by the other two. I think the person behind me saw it as well. I believe it was between 150 and 200 ft above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was almost as if the object left a trail, but the trail disappeared immediately. I tried to call the local airport when I got home, but there was no answer.<n>

Thinking it was kids scoping out the yard/house for something to steal I sent my rotti out who did not react at all. Then the one sweeping light became two that were perfectly parallel and coming forward towards the house. I then thought it was intentional, and having an X with a restraining order, I thought for a moment he had someone out there and ducked under a glass table, that’s when the two parallel lights, about 10 ft off the ground, moving towards the house, went from a pinpoint white light, to a yellow silver dollar sized light, and I said, “ nothing does that, nothing moves parallel like that and comes at you!” my friend ran out and said, “there is nothing behind it!” I think meaning a light source. Still, my dog who goes off at squirrels, was not at all alarmed, and h! e’s 70% blind. There was no sound.  But the two yellow lights came about 20 ft into my fence line, and when my friend got to where it was, it just stopped and was gone.  We got a mag light and looked behind the fence for footprints, but there were dead tree limbs I threw out a week ago, that obstructed the path and there were no broken limbs, even on dried, dead limbs.  There was no way for someone to stand near my fence and with the dramatic angle behind my house for someone to shine any light up my 20 degree angled yard without being at the fence line aiming up.    There was no sound and my dog never reacted as if anything was out there. It was the most amazing and unexplainable thing I’ve ever witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was used to doing, I pulled my chair up to the campfire, sipped a coffee, listened to the CBC on the radio, and enjoyed the glory of the heavens.  Before climbing into my tent, I hit the &#34;head&#34;, which was a patch of bushes at the back of the site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I paused to take one last look into the clear, starry night. As I slowly scanned to the left of my field of view, I noticed what appeared at first to be a star, but soon realized that it was moving. It was a small, bright white light. It was no larger than an average star. There was no sound, and no other lights. Moved in a steady, unwavering path. It appeared to be quite a distance, perhaps orbital distance, but that&#39;s just a guess. I would say that its speed was twice that of a commercial airliner at that altitude. I thought, &#34;Hey, I think that must be a satellite&#34;, but it was now 2:00 AM, and satellites are not visible at that hour in my region.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed it, with my eyes trained on it, as it moved from far left, until it reached the center of the sky, directly overhead. Suddenly, it was gone! I kept looking, further to the right, trying to pick it up again. No, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After desperately trying to relocate it, I looked back to my left again. Again, I spotted a bright white light, larger than the first, and traveling the exact same path. It was the same as above, but larger, about thrice the size. I followed it as well. When this second one reached the same, exact spot as the first one, it too disappeared from view! I was shocked! It was right there, and in an instant, gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, it was a crystal clear night. There were no clouds. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early that night, and on other nights, I had watched jets cross the night sky, only to disappear beyond the horizon. These two craft, simply disappeared. Needless to say, I didn&#39;t sleep too well that night. I am still wondering just what it was that I saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I only just learned of this Web-site, which is the reason for the delay in reporting.<n>

It moved from north to south and low to the horizon.  I followed it for a couple of seconds and lost it behind a house.  It did not re-appear.  The object moved much faster than any normal aircraft and was much brighter than airplanes normally appear (it also did not blink).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the sky for another 5 minutes and then noticed directly above me a bright blinking light and appeared to be moving away from the earth.  It remained in the same spot in the sky, but became fainter and smaller over about 5-7 seconds.  I continued to watch the sky, but did not see anything else.<n>

Noticed redish tint, then green and blue blink off to edge and red again with white intermitting.  Went into house for binoculars; using 7 x 35 mm wide angle lenses, the image popped immediately into a sphere covered with a network of lights that were &#34;chasing&#34; in patterns across the exterior of this perfectly-formed globe.  I couldn&#39;t even begin to guess size, thereby distance, but it seemed to hold quite still for periods of time and as I saw it float gently to north, staying ever to my west, I ran to street, calling everybody I could think of at a rather late hour for most of my friends.  I found one who lived to the west of me about an hour&#39;s drive, approximately 45 miles direct route.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept her on phone for moral and mental support as I went back to house, got in car and drove to river, one block away, parked and turned off all lights to get clear view.  It was a very visible globe, confirming the viewing of earlier, red, green and blue lights chasing one another in blinking fashion, much like chasing christmas lights; only with a peculiar pattern.  The largest band of lights was around the center of sphere, and that was red, never changing but at times dimming to what appeared to be a muted tone; nearly black and white in color.  Then green would appear in 2-3 rows on the lower left quadrant and blue was blinking in ring above and below the red ring, with a smattering of colors continually blinking about this globe.  Imagine the framework of a geodesic dome that is a complete globe and the intersecting pieces of framework would be the positioning of the lights.  They always traveled in this perfect web of lights but not in a pattern that I would be able! to identify was anything beyond random, with the exception of the repeating of the red blaze from right to left from time to time.  That was dependably consistent.  It then moved from due west to southwest once again and seemed to move from that point south, and away.  Around 11:00 when I went back out to climb on roof to again search, I found absolutely no sign of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw; it appeared to be a hollow globe, the shape defined and formed by a network of connecting lights on a grid.  I&#39;m not sure if the illumination showed interior of globe or exterior.  Too far away and binoculars showed clearly the shape and color but not depth or distance.<n>

I was able to see more stars than ever before.  I then all of a sudden focused in on one star in particular that seemed like it was showing movement, i then called my girlfriend to come outside to confirm that i wasn&#39;t going crazy, she also saw what i saw and got scared just to go back inside.  I was amazed, i finally saw a craft that was flying in impossible angles, I would really like to report this to someone that is going to give me some kind of feedback, about what it was that saw.  Also, id like to add that at first when my girlfriend and i went outside to look at the stars, she was looking at a direction that i could not see with my peripheral vision when all of a sudden she said &#34;Ohhh my god!, I just saw a shooting star&#34;, but i assume that shooting stars fall down, not zoom up, which is the direction she said she saw it fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The entire sky suddenly became brightly lit in a bluish color. This lasted approximately 1 second. Another second passed and then the entire sky was lit again but in the pattern of 2-3 large beams as if the light were coming from the horizon line. This was too large and too bright to have been any type of spotlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 5 minutes later I was driving north on Forest Cove drive and a bright blue object (the same shade the lit sky was) flew through the sky in a large arch. The light was traveling very fast. The light seems to blink and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a passenger in the front seat who also saw both events.<n>

I witnessed a white round object travelling from the west at the distance of about 1-2 kms max. The background was a absolutely clear blue sky with patches of cloud and a heck of a lot of puffy, white chemtrail lines and even included &#34;X&#34;s. (Crisscross) Watching this white light for about a minute with the naked eye. I pulled out my binoculars for a better view. As I viewed the object at a great distance with a amazement. I could also see through the binoculars to the west. Six or seven smaller white objects around larger one.Or the larger object was closer to me then the others. This could be the first multiple sighting for me this year. I continued to observe the closer object with now my naked eye again. Now I focused on the larger one heading towards me from the west. This strange object appeared &#34;brilliant &#34; white in color, no intense light now.It was perfectly round -360 degrees. Y! ou could almost classify it like a large orb.It moved like the Pac Man game. After 2 minutes of viewing with binoculars on and off. It got closer to me now to describe. I called a Fed X Courier Driver across the street to view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 10 seconds where I pointed straight south of us, he too could see the white round object with the naked eye moving across the sky. I passed the binoculars to let him have closer look. He had problems to focus through my binoculars and passed them back to me. We watched the object. as it got closer for another 2 minutes. It was travelling east.Now it was directly south of our position and to our closest point to view. This object travelled in a straight line.. What&#39;s also interesting is a large grayish-white jet flying in from the northwest towards the southeast towards the UFO. The jet was dispensing one hell of a chemtrail and talk about rainbows just behind the jets trail. This jet looked military with a longer wings span, travelling about the same altitude as the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watch the UFO continue east, as the jet intersected behind the UFO&#39;s flight path. The jet was slightly turning more to a southeast away from the object. Makes you wonder if chemtrails are used to blanket crisp clear blue skies in obstructing vision of UFO&#39;s. The good news is I snapped a picture, the bad news is, it&#39;s a disposable and there was no image found when developed. But at least I have a witness, and it&#39;s his first sighting. The speed of the UFO seem that like a Cessna, and lasted about 5-7 minutes.Following September 22 at approx: 11:00 a.m.,I noticed low flying black military helicopter over head flying due south and turning east. One thing to note was September 21, 2004 is on a new quarter moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was very noticable,  is that this thing, followed along a thick chemtrail line just quarter mile south and few thousand feet above. I thought to share this sighting due that it happened exactly 5 years ago today. I understand that a day later on Sept.22, 2004. That Cleveland, Ohio had many reports of UFO&#39;s. Witnesses there observed the military on the ground, as well the skies in the early morning through the day.  Could there have been a connection to my sighting here a day earlier ?

I was facing east, and turned my head slightly right to see Orion, when I noticed what I thought was a plane flying north.  I thought it unusual since most planes that fly as low as I perceived this one to be, fly south to SeaTac airport or Boeing Field.  Then I noticed that the lights were in a triangle formation, seven lights in all.  I could not discern the craft itself, and I didn’t have much time to do so, as it was flying quite fast across the sky.  It didn’t make the slightest sound, and since it was early morning the area around me was pretty quiet, I thought it odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never seen such a formation of unblinking lights on an aircraft before so I wondered if I had witnessed an unusual craft; that is why I decided to report it here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

Looks like a station helicopter but very far away and very high in the night sky. my mom my step dad and me watched this object for about 45 min. 15 min into it I get my old Video recorded and I start to record this object. As I’m trying to zoom in u can see it change colors. And the camera is trying to focus on this object but it can’t. I had to plug it in because the battery is dead.

Something from past the stars looked like a huge flashlight beam coming down a long cylinder and flare out towards the bottom of the light. As we looked at it in aww the light sucked back up the atmosphere beyond stars. No clouds in the sky at all very clear bright night. As the beam went up the flare got thinner like it too was fitting back into the cylinder shape as it went up and disappeared. The beam of bright light that was higher up was very bright and defined contained beam however at the bottom where it flared outwards it didnt seem like earthy light/flash light type beam that flares out it seemed to be a more fluffy,foggey. Its hard to discribe. I can say whatever it was omitting that beam of light was not visble and the light even as big and wide as it appeared past the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It lit the sky up horizontally.  It lasted about 3 seconds.  I called a friend to come out and look.  She and I saw two more flashes of light that looked like a gigantic camera flash over the western sky, closer to the horizon this time.  It was a more yellowish color this time, more like the color of lightening, but there were no lines in it.  When I first saw this pink light, my first thought was the northern lights I have seen pictures of.  But the circular think was beyond anything I have ever seen.  This is the first odd thing I have ever seen in the sky.  I liver in a rural area.  This was not fireworks or lightening.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Rose vertically<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1835 hrs I was contacted by my mother asking if I had seen the colourful light in the sky.  I went outside but nothing could be seen, however I decided to sit out for a while  At approx 1845 two Orbs of light rose from behind the nearby houses.  One was distinctly ahead of the other. I would say these objects were no more than half a mile away if that, perhaps even a few hundred metres. They rose in the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lead UFO rose quicker than the other but extremely gracefully, heading toward my direction. Instantly I knew what I was seeing, this was no ordinary craft.  Suddenly to my amazement the lead craft stopped dead in mid air! It then backtracked for a second or two, then it rose directly vertically approx 200 – 500 metres again stopping dead.  There was absolutely no noise whatsoever and we live in silence in Mulbarton.  It appeared the lead craft was almost waiting for the other which as it came within 50 metres both craft headed off into the distance rising up eventually through the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best description of the ufos is as follows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lead craft was slightly brighter than the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each was a colour that I will describe as orange, however they were more than that As they were so close at one stage I could see that they were made up of many merging colours that radiated outward. They were obviously emitting an extreme energy but in total silence. I would also say that gravity did not appear to affect them. They left no vapour trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they rose from such a very low level I believe it possible that they may of actually been on the ground nearby. I live very close to a very wooded area surrounded by fields.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife is the biggest alien doubter of all time, however at the first sighting I shouted through our kitchen window to her to come quick. She to saw them and was amazed at what she was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were defiantly ufos, no doubt whatsoever. They were not aircraft with lights on head on. There is only one Venus, which was clearly visible anyhow. Also Venus is further away than a few hundred yards. And Chinese Lanterns is laughable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My biggest regret is that I could not video the event.  I believe the video would have been the utmost confirmation of the existence of ufos ever.  Nothing on Earth is coloured like that. Nothing can stop dead in the sky. Nothing floats like that in total silence.  These were real and I just want everyone to know it.<n>

I, too, am a skeptic about sightings, and 3 other people were out there with me, but none of them saw it.  I was telling a story and stopped, mid sentence, and stared at it as it flew by, but by the time my friends looked up where I was looking it was gone, as it only lasted MAYBE 2 seconds at the most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

After a couple minutes a second bright object began dropping but at a greater speed, catching up with the first object. Then a third object began dropping.

Directly behind my home there is a small protected wetland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching the news I became aware of a bright orange light, past the patio, illuminating the glass panes on the door.  I first saw it through the reflection on the mirror.  I turned and looked at the door and could see it at an angle through the door as well.  I looked back toward the mirror as the view was more directly at the door and saw clouds of smog or fog drift in front of the orange light.  Both the light and the smoke disappeared briefly and then only the light reappeared for a few seconds and then it was dark as if nothing had happened.  At no time was there any sensation of heat and there was no sound.  The smoke/fog first moved upward, and then from left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen or experienced anything like this.  I did not feel fear.  I thought to myself that it might be a premonition of a fire but the dismissed the thought. Oddly at one point I thought I should get up and look out - but then decided I didn&#39;t need to worry about it.  Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning there was nothing outside that looked amiss.  An internet search did not find any others reporting a similiar incident at the same time although there was a rocket on the east coast that caused some odd lights, but that is too far from me to be related.

About 1000 ft off the ground. We witnessed the object slowly hover away from us towards the moon. It was only illuminated by the moons light, had the moon not been out it could not have been seen. It was probably goin around 30 mph. It eminated no light or sound. It was observed from an upstairs porch by two of three people. The person who did not witness did not have her glasses. It was an opaque metallic gray color. The object itself looked like a massive boomerang with a wide wing span. After about 30-45 seconds of slowly hovering over the city it either dissipated into the clouds or disappeared altogether and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At that point everything was as bright as a football stadium.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as fast, the light went out and I could see the stars again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live on a flight path for Manchester Airport and when the light started, I was expecting to hear jet engines, but when the light went out, all was quiet.

We were heading back to Boston after visting my hometown for the day.  At that time, we saw a white, greenish light moving in front of us at a speed we have never seen in our lives.  It began up to our left &amp; was shooting to over to our right. It flew right in front of the car. It was really bright and moving in a downward motion very fast.  My boyfriend estimates at least 1,000 mph, I couldn&#39;t even guess how fast, in my 26 years it was the fastest thing I&#39;ve ever seen move by far.  It flew over us within a matter of 3 seconds. It probably started at 500 ft high and when we lost sight it was down to 75-100 ft.  It looked as though it was going to crash into the woods nearby, but the trees to our right prevented us from seeing anything further.  We decided to go straight onto the highway instead of t! aking a right to follow its direction – it was scary. I don’t know how anything moving that fast in a downwards motion could not have possibly crashed. It would have caused major damage, it was probably the size of a car. I kept looking back at the woods to see if something had crashed, but I saw no indication, it was completely dark. It was by far the most unexplainable thing I have ever seen in my life. We didn&#39;t hear any noise come from it at all. If it was an aircraft flying that close to our car, you can bet it would have been very loud. For the few seconds I had my eyes glued to it, the best comparison I can think of - remember Homer Simpson&#39;s radiation bar that bounced around during the Simpson&#39;s intro? It had the similar shape, though we think the UFO was a little rounder. It had a whitish/light green color and a bright illumination like I&#39;ve never seen. I wish I could find someone else who saw the same thing. With the direction it came in, it flew right over a high! way overpass so I feel like someone else had to have seen it, ! however there were no other cars on the back roads I was traveling, it was a very quiet night out there.<n>

I do not know how long the object was there for, but I observed it for five minutes until it just blinked out at 12:52 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving very slowly. It appeared to be moving North and possibly slightly West. I used two pine trees and the roof of a house as guides to determine that the object was indeed moving very slowly and to the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked like a fireball, but clearly was not a meteor, flare, or an airplane. The object made no noise that I could hear. I didn&#39;t notice any other aircraft in the area.<n>

But the I noticed it wasn’t moving in a straight line, it was moving in an elongated wavy pattern. As I looked closer I could see an Octagon shape behind the light. I watched it for about 5 seconds when it took a 90 degree turn to the right and headed south at the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise whatsoever.

It was a very clear evening and there were many stars out.  This particular spot of light had a very bright cone of light shining from the bottom of it.  The light actually looked like it was bathing another star in light.  It was bright in the sky for at least a minute.  It remained stationary and no other lights were visible on or around it.  The light moved straight up, the cone of light dissapeared and the object was gone.  At least 3 individuals clearly saw this phenomenon and concur that it was not a helicopter.  It was far too high in the sky and was completely stationary with no flashing or blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Me and 6 other adults ages ranging from 17 – 58 and 5 children witnessed this event. At a house on Woodlawn Ave. in Walled Lake, at around 10:00 p.m. on Saturday, 9/19/2009, we were all outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed a group of 3 round orange lights coming out of the southeast sky heading northwest, then turning gradually west. They appeared to be moving slowly and made no noise but they seemed to cover a lot of distance quickly; they looked like they were about 4 miles away when we saw the area they were coming from and it took them roughly 30 seconds to be over the top of us. Though they looked like about 4 times the size of the brightest star in the sky or the size of a porch light from 50 yards, we could not tell exactly how big they actually were.  They seemed to maintain the same size the entire distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the first group went over they disappeared overhead but not into the clouds; it was mostly clear except for some very light clouds overhead and I don’t think they were high enough to even be in the clouds.  There were many visible stars in the sky.  It made no sense that we couldn’t see them after that.  The glow of light was not like a flame though close to the same color. The glow of the light didn&#39;t go outside of the object. They stayed as glowing circles and didn&#39;t vary in shape. They didn&#39;t fizzle out, they just disappeared. Seemed to be burning off energy from the front while traveling forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the first group disappeared another group of 5 appeared coming from the same direction and maintaining the same course. They were grouped together at what appeared to be about half a mile from each other and maybe a half mile to a mile up in the sky.  We did see a steady flow, where there were at least 12 visible at the same time, at different distances, this continued for at least 15 to 20 minutes. We saw a total of approximately 35 bright to dark orange, round, orb like lights, no blinking lights on them, no headlights, just a sort of bright to dark orange glow.  Some of the ones we saw, when they were at their greatest distance away from us, moving toward us, looked like they glowed red at first then turned bright orange, then to dark orange, almost a rust color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, around 11:00 p.m., me and 4 other friends were a half mile away at another house in the same neighborhood on Fisher Ave. and we saw the lights, same characteristics as the others, traveling  the same course.  We witnessed at least 15 more within about 10 minutes, some traveled individually, some in groups of 3, some were in a triangular formation, twice there would be one straight across from one other, a mile or so apart, moving the same speed and distance like they were connected in some way moving together. We did see 2 jets,  one with blinking white lights and one with red and green, flying over, way, way above these lights, from west to east, the jets lights were only tiny dots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like it. The people that I was with speculated on what they could be. Some said flares;  flares would glow brighter or flicker.  Some thought rockets, maybe from Williams Research; they seemed like they came from further away and if they were rockets we should have been able to see them as they went by, they disappeared almost directly overhead.  Some thought maybe we had launched nukes and were at war; there was nothing about it on the news. This was not NASA’s launch from Virginia. In all 16 people,  including myself, witnessed this event, discussed the same details and agreed that it was the most bizarre thing any of us had ever seen.  None of us could identify the lights. Unfortunately none of us had a good camera handy; someone tried to use a picture phone but the picture came out blurry.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The taller IDS Tower is located to the left of the Wells Fargo Tower, the object would typically move slowly from the right of the Wells Tower, left above the top of the Wells Tower, and continue further to the IDS Tower, and would go out of view behind the IDS Tower.  The object would come from behind the IDS Tower back over the Wells Tower, then move to the right beyond the Wells Tower, and back again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object sometimes performed fast complete loops in the air, would abruptly stop, and would drift slowly once again.  Sometimes the object would change direction abruptly moving up, down, sideways, or diagonally at a high rate of speed, sometimes instantaneously changing direction at a high rate of speed several times before abruptly stopping and then beginning to drift again.  There were times when the object would appear to hover without moving for up to a minute.  On at least two occasions the object quickly, at a high rate of speed, darted down at a diagonal between the towers toward the ground, covering two thirds the height of the Wells Tower in perhaps one half second.  There were times when the object would go dark and reappear several seconds later, sometimes at the same, sometimes at a different location.  There were times when the object would become dim, then brighter.  There were times when the object would appear to pulsate in intensity.  The second witness, ! a woman who stopped to watch, stated that the object changed colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Luminosity:  Variable, from dark to dim, but often about as bright as Jupiter would appear in a dark sky.  Note that downtown Minneapolis is highly lit at night, as is the Wells Tower itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other:  The aircraft obstruction light on the antenna mast at the top of the IDS Tower functioned normally during the entire observation.  Several large commercial aircraft, apparently on approach to MSP International, made typical runs across the general area appearing to be at a higher elevation than the object observed.  There was an advertising searchlight scanning the sky in Minneapolis that night but it had no effect upon the observation of this object.  I observed the light for twenty five minutes, left and returned twenty minutes later to find the object still presenting itself as before.  I left and returned once again thirty minutes after the second observation and could observe no trace of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Opinion:  This was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, or bird.  The abrupt stops, instantaneous change of direction, zig-zagging, and fast rates of speed, loops, and abrupt stops are inconsistent with such explanations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

To my right in the sky, was something very bright flashing. I keep my camcorder handy and ran to get it. 09/19/2009 @ 9:19pm Creepy, huh?<n> <n><n> <n><n> A strange object flew East to N.West silently over my neighborhood. I could not identify this object and was startled at how bright the flashing lights were. The object was heading right into the adjacent neighborhood treeline. As it did, the object changed light formation. I saw a small violet, red and green lights turn on/around the bright light. Uploading video&#39;s removes some quality. I can not say for sure the size or shape of the object.  To the best I could tell by the point of reference it was only a few thousand feet off the ground.  Seeing those lights was disturbing but exciting as well. The object went out of my view and I lost sight of it in the trees.  The trees in my neighborhood are approx. 50 feet or more in height.  I no! ticed as the object was approaching, the dog a few houses down began to bark. I do not know what this was, but I hope this video reassures others that we may not be alone after all.  I am receiving information from people living in various parts of PA that saw my video and confirmed it to be what they saw last night also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: Point of reference was my neighbors garage with a security hallogen light attached above the garage door.  This is not the Black Brant xii rocket.  That rocket was launched from Virgina hours before and could only be seen as far as Boston. I live all the way in Ohio! It is impossible for this to be that rocket, that conclusion has already been debunked<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F413VRjXCU8<n>

It was a clear night so this was all very visible especially on top of the bridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four lights were in a perfectly straight line starting high then going lower towards the ground.  They were not stars because they were to low to the ground and not planes because they just hovered there. The line was diagonal and teh objects seemed to be in a pattern that was the perfect distance between each one. All at once two of the objects completely dissapeared and the others two began moving away. They were visible for ten minutes untill they were all gone. It was one of the wierdest situations ive dealt with and was something i have never seen befo! re.

We were eating dinner on our patio at night.  I looked up and saw what looked like a spot light shining down from the sky through a mist or a cloud.  I pointed it out.  First reaction, rational, was that it was a helicopter.   We heard no sound of a helicopter at all, and the light seemed to high up to be a helicopter, especially given the fact that it seemed to be emanating from a cloud.  About 20 seconds later, the light seemed to rise straight up, getting enveloped in the cloud.  I say this because the light became diffused as if in a cloud of mist.  Eventually it dimmed and was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There was no noise associated with it.  It was casting a light down like a bright spotlight. It was not a star or planet.  The light then seemed to disappear behind clouds (there was a bright, dissipating mist) however, there were no clouds that night. It was very still and crisp fall light.  Although we tried to explain the light, none of the parents could come up with a reasonable explanation. It could not have been a helicopter, as there were no other blinking lights and there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD))<n>

We were planning on having a small to roast marshmallows.  I was looking up at the hill while they were collecting wood and they were about 50 yards away loading wood into our ‘Ranger’ or off roading vehicle and they left it running so they could not hear me.  As I was looking up at the night sky I noticed a strange coned shaped yellow light coming from a cloud.  I yelled up to the girls asking them to look and what did they think it was, but they could not hear me.  I then looked around and didn’t notice any other clouds in the sky.  The reason we were having the fire was to sit out and enjoy the night sky because it was so clear.  The light came down from the sky the way a bulb would emit light into a cone shape with it smaller at the top and larger at the bottom.  It was nothing that covered the whole sky but it was! definitely not light from a plane or helicopter. Neither was it the sun because the light was in the east and there was no moon at that time during the evening.   It stood still with no noise and the top of the cone was covered with the small cloud.  The light was there for around 45 seconds and within a couple of seconds it disappeared from the bottom up, almost as if it fizzled away. The cloud also disappeared immediately after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD))<n>

We were looking up towards Jupiter, as it was really bright and the sky was so clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, to the right of the bright planet, there came this light that looked like it came through a cloud, but there was not a cloud in the sky.  It&#39;s hard to describe.  It got brighter and then a cone of white light shone downwards.  The cone of light was hazy as if there were a fog, but there was no fog or clouds.  It was a completely clear sky.  It traveled along towards us slowly and then slowly faded away.  The total time visible was 30 seconds.  Unfortunately, I did not get a picture of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were not the only ones who saw it.  The people walking next to us were gasping amongst themselves about it.  We walked further into the parking lot and the parking attendants were chatting on their radios about it.  The one man even asked me if I saw it and asked me to confirm on the radio what he was saying to the one other who hadn&#39;t seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the strangest thing any of us had ever seen and we spent a long time trying to think of plausible explanations for it, but couldn&#39;t.  The way it moved, how it appeared, no engine sound (helicopter or jet)-- nothing we could offer up for an explanation was valid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD))<n>

My wife and I stopped over to my mother-in-laws to pick the kids up after dinner. Mother-in law was outside on the back patio with a couple of her girl friends deciding on where they were going out to eat. This was around 19:50. Being a very clear night sky. Facing south, I looked up and noticed a very bright star a little Southeast from where I was facing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was just a normal star. I got involved in some conversation and then again at about 20:00 I looked back at the same star just noticing how bright it was on the clear night. I then glanced over to the East. I then saw another bright light that was very high, and illuminating light downward.  (like the sun does when it shines through clouds). First, I thought it was another star, but as I watched it , it was weird since it was shining a very noticeable light down like the sun shining light through the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just starred at it wondering what it was since the light shining down illuminated like the sun shining through clouds. Not knowing what it was. I grabbed the attention of my wife, mother-in-law and her friends, and my oldest son. I asked them what it was. There was no reply as everyone just starred at it. I would say about 30 sec. after I grabbed everyone’s attention, the light giving off the illuminating light started to rise, slow at first straight up. Then within a sec. the light and the light shining downward were gone!! You could actually see the ball of light and the illuminating light rise up.!!! THEN....There was no light anywhere!! It was gone within a sec. of moving up. We couldn’t even trace it. It was gone!  I then looked over at the star I was looking at earlier just trying to make sense of what I just witnessed. the original star was still there and didn&#39;t move.  We tried to reason with what we just saw. My Mother-in-law and wife who couldn&#39;t believe what we just saw, took the skeptic approach. Trying to reason by saying it could have been a jet since the Akron/Canton Airport is 10 miles from the house. However, We were able to compare a jet flying in the distance about 8 – 10 min. later. We all came to the same conclusion. What we saw was not a jet. The jet did not give off nearly as much light as the light we saw in the sky (actually, there is no comparison).  Plus the jet moved. The light we saw sat still for about 30sec. while we all were watching it, The jet was considerably smaller, and had flashing lights. The light we saw in the sky did not flash any lights. We had no answers to what we just witnessed. I would say the light location could have been I the area of Canto! n/Louisville/East Canton, Ohio. We still can&#39;t get over how the light was shining down, then just raised and disappeared with in a sec. The jet we saw later, we were able watch it’s path as it flew in the sky at night which appeared to be around the same distance and elevation., But the Light we all watched  just disappeared. I didn’t know who to contact in the area to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD))<n>

My husband, sons and I were returning home in our car, when I spotted something in the sky. At first glance, I thought it was a helicopter with a spotlight hovering over a house a few houses down from ours. The light made a cone shape with the widest part closer to the earth and the apex was very bright. We pulled into our driveway and got out of the car, and there was no sound coming from it, eliminating the possibility of a helicopter. Then, it appeared as if the “spotlight” retreated into a small cloud or a sort of a mist and faded out. The “mist” quickly dissipated. There is a cloudless sky here tonight, and so whatever the mist was came from the object that we couldn’t see. It was just a light and then it was gone. There was no smell. We have eliminated the possibility of a flare, firework, or aircraft. No lightening. I! t is a clear, starry, cool, late summer, early fall evening. I am at a loss.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope I have described this adequately enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you  J.G.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD))<n>

Not like it was coming from the earth but above it. We were like is that seriously happening? It just disappeared. But the light was so large, that it looked like a huge moon underneath light clouds.... i don&#39;t even know if i am explaining it well enough but it was really creepy, especially after the &#34;unidentified creature&#34; in panama.

Within seconds, it broadened to a conical shape and reached its maximum brightness. It then faded away over the course of the next minute. It never moved laterally. There was a slight vertical movement as it developed, but then it was stationary as it faded away. My imprssion was that it was very far away. My guess was that it was vapor in the stratosphere lighted by the twilight. I have no idea what caused it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD))<n>

That’s the brightest star in the sky!” After I glanced up and told her it wasn’t a star, it was Jupiter, I looked back down at the road; seconds later, she says “LOOK DAD THAT’S SOOO WEIRD!” I looked, and what I saw was an upside down funnel shape; white hazy in color, (like a flashlight pointing down inside a hazy white Smokey shade that extended downward; no movement, no clouds, and no noise). Before fading into the sky, the bottom center of the cone seemed to change position from 6 o’clock to 4 o’clock, the top still anchored in the same position. My daughter saw a dark cloud above the shape, I didn’t notice it. I can’t estimate the distance with any accuracy but was very far off in my opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was a little lower and to the right; a couple finger widths of Jupiter in the Capricornus Constellation; Jupiter’s elevation is about 20 degrees approximately. You could see an aircraft heading east very far up in atmosphere with marker lights blinking barely visible, just after incident; by comparison the cone was huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Launch of Black Brant sounding rocket from Wallops Island at 7:37 PM EDT on this date.

There was no evident body of any aircraft supporting this light. The spotlight with a specific cone shape began to grow from some stationary position (distance not determined) and suddenly disappeared with an illuminating misty smoke left behind. We continued to drive west and realized we were not driving past the mist or whatever it was. We continued to drive toward it which made me realize how enormous this thing had to be since it was obviously miles above the earth and many miles away from us. I would guess that this took place over Buzzards Bay or even further. I have never seen anything like it.

We were looking at the stars for about 15 minutes.  We were looking at the big dipper and trying to make shapes out of random star formations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my brother casually said “look there is a spaceship.”  We both thought that it was a spaceship because it was moving up and was much bigger than any plane or helicopter we had seen flying by.  It was circular in shape and what was really apparent was a large cone shaped light that it emitted downwards.  The light was huge, roughly about ¼ of the horizon and formed the shape of an upside down ice cream cone/pyramid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was the light of a plane shining through the clouds, but after the object disappeared we both noticed that there were no clouds in the sky at all.  Right before it disappeared, the light flickered off and then came on again for a brief moment and then the object and light both instantaneously were gone.  It was extremely startling how it disappeared because it was definitely not far enough away to make such an abrupt exit, as opposed to a plane fading in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Directly after this had transpired I took out my phone and took a picture of the empty night sky so that it would record what time this happened.  It was at exactly 7:53.<n>

Once they were in the yard, I turned around toward the driveway, for no apparent reason, and looked up at the sky.  That is when I saw a bright white circle with a cone-shaped light shining underneath it. It was hovering over one area.  The circle was brighter than the light underneath it.  At first I thought it was a star, because other stars were in the sky, but then I realized it was much too big to be a star.  I ran inside to get my husband, but by the time we got back outside (less than 10 seconds), the circle of light had disappeared.  There was, however, a very faint bit of light remaining that looked like a cloud. The remaining light was initially the cone-shape that was there when the circle of light was still visible, but once the circle disappeared, the cone-shape also dissipated.  I told my husband that it must’ve just been a plane passing through a! cloud, but then I realized there were no clouds in the sky and no plane ever reappeared, as it would after it passed through the cloud.  My husband said, “there’s a cloud right there,” but what he thought was a cloud was actually the fading light that remained after the circle disappeared. I waited for about 5 minutes by myself to see if it returned, but it did not.  The “cloud” completely disappeared after about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD))<n>

It was approximately 40 degrees above the horizon, and looked like a light shining down on the Earth -- that is, it was shaped like a cone, brightest at the top and fading out at the lower edge, which was about 5-10 degrees lower. Several things struck me about this event. First, it was very large, covering several degrees of the sky horizontally and vertically. Second, the apex of the cone was flattened, as you would see if someone were shining a flashlight down -- it wouldn&#39;t come to a perfect point, it would be flat at the rim of the flashlight. Third, it did not move at all -- at first it reminded me of a comet, but I knew that couldn&#39;t be, and then a meteor, but that would be true only if it were coming straight at me (which is possible). I turned to the screen door and called for my wife to come see. When I turned back, ther! e was only a luminescent cloud where the light had been shining. My wife, exiting another door, confirmed this. Could it have been a meteor coming head-on at us? That&#39;s the best explanation I can come up with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were commercial aircraft in the vicinity, what I believe was regular westbound traffic from Logan or Bradley airports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.

The sky was dark, after sunset. I had been watching the stars come out. The sky was clear, no cloud coverage at all. No moon in the sky. (The moon was in new phase, and rising and setting during the day, according to a moon phase website). The hammock is on a self-supporting frame, and there is nothing on my porch to block my view facing east or south. My house was to my right, or west. I was looking at my phone when a bright light above and slightly to the right of my perspective caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was an extremely bright and extremely large white light, shining down towards the ground. It was very high in the air, possibly higher than aircraft would generally fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light spread out like an upside down cone, but without a distinguishable tip.  For about 15 seconds, the outline or form of the light was very clear and distinguishable. The light was about the size of a normal full moon, or just slightly smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light rose vertically.  As it did, the clarity of the outline of the light dissipated and was replaced by a patch of “brightness” in the sky, which slowly became larger and larger, then faded slowly to black. This process lasted about 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At its largest, this patch of brightness against the night sky would have about filled the dipper portion of the big dipper before fading to black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The simplest way for me to describe it is it was as if someone had turned on the brightest spotlight I could imagine from the atmosphere, and as it ascended, I seemed to be viewing the light from underneath the source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According the compass on my iPhone, the light was approximately at 180 -189 degrees south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to run inside and grab my camera, but figured I would miss it. I attempted a picture with my iPhone, but by this point, I could only make out a bright patch against the night sky and the iPhone could not record anything in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was completely faded at 7:55 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.

No noise just a bright white light getting bigger. There are no clouds in the sky. The &#34;star&#34; appears to expel a gas-like, bluish, white cloud that falls downward. Maybe this is an explosion? The star remains in place and the &#34;cloud&#34; looks like it is starting to hang in a triangle shape (with the &#34;star&#34; at the apex). Bright light comes from the &#34;star&#34; and illuminates the triangle shaped cloud below. The &#34;star&#34; then appears to collapse into the glowing cloud.

I was looking into the night sky since it was unusually clear and starry.  I was facing south-west when suddenly, what I thought was a star, looking like all other stars, started to get progressively brighter.  From below a light started to emit down like a skirt, or a cone, very slowly.  It almost seemed like a comet coming from the earth, except that it wasn’t moving, it was sitting perfectly still. I ran in to get my girlfriend to see what was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as she was coming out, the object that was emitting this light seemed to have shot straight up, and the cone of light started to disperse.  My girl friend got to see the curtain of light disappearing.  I stayed outside looking for anything else strange; I did notice that there was increased air traffic after the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange fast flying air craft lights flying around the area. it was at about a 30 degrees elevation in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.

It seemed to leave a round &#34;cloud&#34; of vapor that lasted for perhaps a minute before disappearing and leaving a perfectly clear sky.  The light beam was very high in the sky and we never did see or hear a vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We don&#39;t know what caused this but speculated that it could have been landing lights on a jet plane showing up in a jet  trail or the clouds. Or could it be the exhaust from a military jet (or rocket) going supersonic?  The beam of light seemed somewhat unusual in that it seemed to spread out more, almost appearing like a jet trail. The light beams seemed to point downward to the earth and the direction of movement seemed to be upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We get a lot of jet traffic in the sky from New York (JFK, La Guardia) and and Newark airports.

It seemed to tilt downwards, lighting up the sky below it, sparks were coming down from it.  Then it started to dissapate, almost like a mist of fine light sparks which came down in an arc shape.  The sky darkened, and that was it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD))<n>

No sound at all, 6 witnesses<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family and I were sitting around a fire roasting marshmallows, all of a sudden my sister (age 27) started freaking out, My dad age (48) was asking what she was freaking out about she couldnt get the words out of her mouth fast enough so she was just pointing and screaming. I witnessed a neon blue SUPER bright light hovering appx a 1/2 mile away, It was about 300ft above the ground and slowly descending. It was hard to tell what shape the light was attached to but seemed like a disk shape, the light was so bright it made a huge beam all the way to the ground until it was within tree level and unable to be seen. At this time my whole family had seen it, a very unusal thing that also happened was all the neighborhood dogs began to bark continuously. There was no sound that came from the craft itself, The sky was completely clear, there was no wing markers or anything else on the ufo that lead us to believe it was a typical airplane or helocopter. Im now a fi! rm believer of UFO&#39;s<n>

I looked in the direction that my son was pointing and also clearly saw the object.  The object was an egg shaped light that emitted streams of light from the bottom which radiated out of the bottom in the shape of a cone.  Picture a egg shaped flood light shining down, that was the image we were watching going up.  My son and I had the object in our sights for about 5 to seconds and then it just kept going until we couldn’t see it any longer.  I immediately called the A Channel newsroom to report the sighting.  I reported the sighting and inquired whether they had any other reports of such a sighting over the city of Toronto to which I was advised that they received reports of an identical object being seen over the city of Barrie.  This is our accou! nt of the sighting of Saturday, September 19, 2009 at 1943 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Since there are no other stars that bright in that vicinity I assumed it was some type of aircraft.  There appeared to be a searchlight emanating from the object highlighting some clouds, which made little sense as there was little visible cloud cover and what there was was high-altitude cirrus clouds.  After approximately 2 minutes of observation the object ceased the searchlight and ascended rapidly until it vanished from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD))<n>

They all show the same object, something stationary in the sky from about 5:15-7:30 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, we thought it may be a balloon since it is NM.   We were walking into our hotel and saw this and decided to go back to the car and grab the binoculars.  Using them, we could see that it wasn&#39;t a hot air balloon.  It was silvery/pearly white, teardrop shape, but no basket on the bottom.  The inside was dark grey-black, like a small circle in the middle.  It wasn&#39;t moving.  There also wasn&#39;t a string or thing on the bottom showing that it was a weather balloon, either.  I took a few pictures from outside the hotel (you can see the billboard in the pics).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went up to our room and sat in the window seat to get a better look.  It still hadn&#39;t moved, but clouds started coming across it.  Then clouds settled in, so we stopped looking and ate dinner.   We decided to go for a sunset drive by our hotel and into the foothills.  Sure enough, when the clouds parted, it was still there.  At this time, the black area inside of it started to turn orange/red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time dusk turned to night, it started to fade and was gone completely.  All in all, for 2 hours, it didn&#39;t move left or right, up or down.  Considering this, its design, and strange behavior, we decided that it couldn&#39;t be a weather balloon.  If you zoom into the pics, you can get a better view.<n>

Urban area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Noticed, through South-facing window, 5/6 objects descending...looked a lot like people parachuting! I thought this was odd, because there is no where to land in Hatfield, so I watched it more closely. The dark objects reached approximately 1000-ft then maintained altitude and position while grouping together. The collective size got smaller, in to one object, dark in colour, irregular, ball-like shape but with angles...no lights, no sounds, no hard edges. Object then gained altitude slowly and steadily in the same way a helicopter or balloon would, but only vertically, no change in location. By now, I&#39;d gone outside to get a better view! Watched it keeping its height and position at approximately 3000-ft, it stayed where it was. I got a friend, to see this too (as another witness!)...and he also couldn&#39;t explain what it was. Conditions: mildly overcast stratus with very weak movement, good daylight visibility, unseasonably warm temperature for late Septembe! r. I couldn&#39;t take a picture as I don&#39;t have a camera. My basic camera-phone would have only shown an unrecognisable dot in the sky!<n>

I stepped out onto my front porch to have a cigarette.  It is very dark where I live because we are outside of the major KC area so I was enjoying a wonderful view of Orion&#39;s Belt.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw movement and focused in on it.  An object was moving at an extrememly fast rate from the west.  It was an oval shaped object which at first I thought just had some white coloring on the outside edges opposite each other but then realised I was seeing lights when the shape moved over some slight cloud cover to the west of my house.  I could see the faint glow of the edges through the clouds.  There was no sound whatsoever.  And it was moving so fast that the entire thing lasted about 5 seconds before it moved out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I watched it hover in mostly one spot (it did slowly drift to the west) it would get brighter and then fade slowly. It slowly pulsated this way the whole time I watched it for about twenty minutes. It finally just faded away altogether like it was moving away north at what would have to be a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I doubt any one else in Boise witnessed this because most would be watching the game on TV. BSU football is that big here. This object looked like no aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen or heard of. I couldn&#39;t tell how far or altitude but if I had to guess, I would say it was very high in the sky and fairly far, because it was pretty much just a spot of light. I wanted to get my wife and video camera but didn&#39;t want to miss what it might do. I will be watching your site to see if anyone else spotted this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the middle of the lights was a bright blue that traversed across the sky in a Southwestern course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange lights were constant glowing like a campfire although it did not flicker.  It was very primative looking with a very dull glow to it.  They were individually points in what appeared to be in the shape of a stretched out hexagon, or a holly leaf.  They all seemed to be traveling at the same speed and in the same pattern, and same direction.  I estimate that they were 4-6 ft tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation traveled between 75-100 ft off of the ground. I was traveling about 200 mph/322 kmh.  All together they would have stretched across 3 football fields.  I noticed I could see through it.  I was able to see things through the “UFO” as it crossed the sky I could watch a stars and a plane in the distance behind the object as it passed by.  As if it was not there at all except for the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The blue light was in the direct center.   This light was very precise and very &#34;high-tech&#34; looking like an LED light. This light would normally pass as a star, but it stayed in the same formation as the other lights, it traveled in the same direction, and stayed in the direct center.  It also seemed to be pulsating slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason that this struck me as a possible “UFO” is that when the lights disappeared, they all dimmed at the same time.  They did not disappear one at a time, like it was going into a cloud bank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They were bright orange and very solid.  I went in the house and called my wife.  She came outside and saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light moved around in very deliberate motions(dialoganly, up and down, left to right).  The movement was very precise as if moving into formations.  We observed the light for probably about four minutes total.  Then, one at a time, the lights went out. I don&#39;t really know how to judge an approximate distance as to how far away the lights were, but they were obviously much closer than the stars appeared, but also seemed to be quite high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen many helicopters, planes, shooting stars, etc, but this was much different.  This was something very strange that I have never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 minutes after the lights went out, I did observe what appeared to be some sort of conventional aircraft in the sky.

It was almost over-head, but quite high up, then seemed to move very slowly if at all.  It would pulse, not pulse, pulse a different rhythm, not pulse.  There were four of us, and on a side street we found three more people watching with binoculars.  I looked through the binoculars and could see the circle was made up of a circle of lights.  They&#39;d been watching longer, and said initially it was closer, and sparks were coming off and falling down (though it was still very high up).  The light was intense red, but seemed to be going higher up instead of moving on a northward path as we thought it was at first.  We joked about perhaps being the only sober people in the area as most people were glued to sports bars watching BSU football.  One of the people called her fiance and asked him to go outside his house, an! d he saw the same thing, though I do not know where he was viewing this from.  We watched this for over a half hour, and eventually walked back to our friends house, and them drove home to our house.  We live at the base of a mesa in foothills and the line of sight was not very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was unlike anything any of us had seen.  I took a picture with my phone, but it looks like a red dot in the middle of a black field.  I do not have the proper cord to download it to my computer, nor do I suscribe to any picture services to send via my phone contract.  Any suggestions?  I am fine with talking to someone, but make it day-time to return my call, please.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It almost looked like the flame from a hot air balloon but without the balloon.  A friend of mine was in the truck with me and had thought for a minute it might have been a meteor.  I followed under the flame down a street lined with houses and was so intrigued i had never seen anything like it before.  I grabbed the camera i had in my truck to try to take a picture but before i could take a picture the object picked up speed flying accross the highway, through the plaza parking lot area towards the highschool and increased altitude until it disappeared into the stars.  I went back to my work and 2 of the men i work with had also seen the object.  They were dumping garbage in the dumpster when they saw it fly above the building I work in heading over the back parking lot where I had pulled out and started to follo! w it.  The whole incident happened in a few minutes.  I have lived in this town 38 years and never wittnessed anything that compares to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/18/09 20:50|Preston|MO|Triangle|3 to 5 minutes|Ufo in Preston, Mo|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72452.html|281|ndxe200909| Ufo in Preston, Mo<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were driving towards Fristoe, Mo. We noticed an orange fire like streak cross the sky and break up into parts. It then seemed to fizz out. We thought it may have been fireworks or a meteor. About 10 to 20 seconds later we then noticed another one in the distance and we could make out many planes in the sky. As my wife drove I continued to watch the sky. My wife noticed a white light in the distance off the side of the road. As we approached it looked like a white box of sorts about the size of a small house in the sky (about 250 feet?) with square compartments. It flashed slowly on and off and wasn&#39;t very bright emmiting a white light. At first I thought it was a radio tower until I noticed it was at the center of a huge football field sized triangle. It seems strange that I wouldn&#39;t notice something that large in the sky but it was just a tad darker than the sky and honestly not very noticeable. At each point was a white &#34;star colored&#34; light. ! These lights were also about as bright as stars. They all flashed in unison. As we drove by it seemed as if we were almost under the object and its depth or height was impossible to determine as were features on the triangle. It just seemed like a large black mass that blocked out the stars. The white box also remained centered in the middle of the triangle so I am fairly confident it was all one object. Amazed and unable to look away I noticed more lights very similar to the ones at the points that seemed to crackle all of a sudden flashing on and off quickly at random points around the perimeter of the object. This lasted about 3 seconds and then stopped. The object just hovered motionless with no noise. We couldn&#39;t pull over because the shoulder was pretty short, and a vehicle was close to our bumper. My son was also a witness to this. We passed a bend in the road and lost sight of it after we passed. As we approached Preston we noticed 2 or 3 more of those fire streaks ! far in the distance.  We then pulled into a gas station in Pre! ston to calm ourselves and discuss what happened. All activity in the skies ceased at this point.(There are only about 2 gas stations in Preston.) I hope there were more witnesses it was amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One friend saw the light and said look at that star. I said that&#39;s not a star. We watched for about a minute and then it made a cloud and began to fade. It just vanished with no trail or anything. It was a very bright,white light almost like the light from a helicopter and shone down toward the ground.It looked like a beam trying to illuminate something. The sky was clear so it didn&#39;t get covered by a cloud and the brightest star in the sky was right beside it.It was perfectly still not like a helicopter. Amazing!!!!<n>

I was fishing at Glen Island with friends.  I walked to go get my pole. I noticed an unusual clear visibility of the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking South East, past Long Island and straight up towards the Sagittarius constellation when I noticed a dim star, start to slowly move. There were no noise or blinking lights. The dim moving star was as close to the other stars and I knew it was too far away to be a plane or satellite. I yelled to the other fishermen and pointed up and asked them if they saw what I was seeing. They saw it after I pointed toward the direction. The dim moving star-light passed between two stars and kept moving in a straight line for about 10 seconds and then vanished. I’m an astronomer and have scene satellites and rocket launches. This was no satellite. I was amazed and shocked that I witness the same similar thing that I had saw and reported several years ago on this forum.<n>

Looking out my bathroom window I saw what I originally thought was fireworks (at 0400?).  Two blue lights were in the west and went straight up then stopped.  Thinking again I thought it might be the HB Police helicopter but there was no sound.  Then it shot right, slowly went up and I was losing sight in the bathroom.  I went in the backyard and continued to watch.  The two blue lights were together and went from left to right, down then up at various speeds.  I called for my wife who woke up, came outside but it was gone.  First time EVER seeing anything like this.  It was in the western sky at about 0415 in the morning and someone else must have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I saw a bright red/orange object off the west cost of the island of Maui.  Oval shape.  It was in the west - between the islands of Lanai &amp; Molokai. The object was fairly high up in the sky. When I noticed it, it was heading slowly south. When I woke my husband up to see this, the object just stopped for about 5 seconds, then it started to move again but this time going north. Then it moved slowly upward and was gone. As it went upward it left behind a tail of dim light. The whole event (from the time I started seeing it) was about 30-60 seconds. I had seen a similar object exactly a year ago with two other friends. We still never found out what it was and can&#39;t seem to get any information. I&#39;ve even called the observatories here in the islands and no one seems to know. When I first saw this object a year ago around this same time period, I thought maybe it was a plane on fire, but the fact that it stoppe! d, then re-directed its course, then went straight up in the sky and disappeared, this was something other than a plane. What I saw on the morning of 9/18 had the same flight pattern of what I saw a year ago.<n>

I had a binocular and watched it for 15 minutes.  It had red, green yellow, and white lights. It stayed in mostly in the same spot only moving maybe 10 degrees to the east.  It also seemed to be spinning from the way the lights kept changing.  I would have thought many people would have seen it. It just floated in one spot for the whole time I wittnessed it.  Unfortunately I had to go to bed early that night so I didn&#39;t see what ever became of it.<n>

Also do this at property in Springville, New York which is approximately 35 miles south of Buffalo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On approximately this night, my daughter and I went outside at 20:50 hours to hopefully see a satellite that the local news stations had said was to pass over the Buffalo area around 21:00 hours and be visible with the naked eye. I have always read that a visible satellite was pretty much a constant moving white light that would move across the skies. If I remember correctly, I believe the news reported that this satellite was to move from the NE to the SW or vice versa. Not positive at this point, but I believe this is what they had indicated. It was to pass over at approximately 21:05 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my daughter and I waited and watched, we apparently missed seeing this or just were not looking in the correct direction. We continued to stay outside and enjoy the night sky above. At approximately 21:15 hours my daughter first noticed the following and then I did. We are not crazy and we both know what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw came across the night sky, curving from the NNW to the SSE. In the shape of a triangle were 3 hazy, dull, orange-yellowish colored lights moving/gliding in a quiet, peaceful motion slightly rotating on its own axis. It appeared to be only, say, a few hundred yards above us and well below the night stars in the sky. It was no aircraft, no helicopter, no weather balloon, no satellite, no military crafts, etc., etc. And funny thing is, its path of going to the SSE was basically going just west of the airport, over the Cheektowaga area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter and I looked at each other in excitement and somewhat disbelief with what we both saw. We know we saw something and we are convinced it was an UFO. I for one have always believed in UFO’s and been very much interested in them for years. We did not report this to the Town of Amherst Police or any other agency. There was nothing in the media outlets, papers or radio in the following days after that I am aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We walked over to the outlook, and looked across the river, and at the city. after about 10 minutes we started noticing points of light appearing from nowhere. they had 3 colors, green, blue/white and red. The red ones seemed to have the uncanny ability to warp miles at a time. We decided hey lets use the quarter costing binoculars, as soon as we did so they all disappeared. Once we stopped, there were a dozen. Splitting, moving at unrealistic speeds, warping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this point that we saw what looked like a triangle craft/stealth bomber cover 20 miles from behind us to the west towards nyc in the east in under a few seconds. We witnessed 2 or 3 more of the larger more terrestrial looking craft move to intercept the orb. We were forced to leave, there was an overwhelming amount of energy involved and my friend and i could both feel it.

It started off faily large, looked very high up, possibly in space and was gradually moving away but must have been going incredibly fast to move away that quickly. I know of someone else who has seen similar objects to myself, but he has seen 3 of them. It cannot have been a meteor or something, as it started large and then must have &#39;flown&#39; away to move away from Earth. I hope I have helped with something thanks<n>

So I immediately gave up in two minutes. I then turned on Comstock to head for lunch.At the lights of Warden on Comstock.I noticed now north up higher,,, a brilliant white UFO-north quarter mile away.I instantly again, took more pictures of this second UFO,along with a SHORT video clip.Remember,this is my third sighting happening here today.I will send you the third report shortly -added with more photographic evidence.Words can&#39;t tell you, when I reflect from the that time of witnessing the total bizarre in sequence of events.PS While viewing the video clip,you can hear a strange repetitive sound.I&#39;m  not sure of the source.Dog barking ??<n>

My daughter and her friend called for me from the backyard and I got there just in time to see a very large, very black triangular shape ship flying away.  It was perhaps 1000 ft above our house, flying well below the low cloud cover. The craft spanned about 75 feet wide. It was flying at a slow, and even pace.  It simply flew over our neighborhood and off into the distance.  There was absolutely NO sound.  The black color was an unusual matte, no shine whatsoever. The triangle shape seemed to be flying backwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was pretty dark outside in my neighborhood as we live on the end of a dead end road.  The Navel station in Everett is to the Northwest of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All at once, I saw 4 lights moving in unison very low about 250ft off the ground over me and moving rapidly to the southwest.  I could see no edges but it was dead black almost like a rippling void or a nothingness except for the perfectly spaced solid white lights that made up the triangle and what looked to be a center light.  I could see no reflection or there was no color just lights that were dim and not bright at all as I have would expected from a ufo craft.  The thing that just still is giving me chills is the total lack of sound.  It made no noise not even a little.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole sighting lasted about 10 seconds maybe.  I am still shaken up as it scared me and gave me a fight or flight response and I&#39;m a pretty cool character.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway I felt like I needed to tell someone that might understand and I hope this helps if others saw it in my area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  ((name deleted))<n>

What is this ??-morse code i thought ?  All flashes were in the same part of the sky.In shock,I stared looking for anything else-like running lights or other flashes.I witnessed nothing more after five minutes and went back in my home fully awake.In honesty,I don&#39;t even believe it ! Though,two more sightings did happen that were filmed.Again these sightings followed in the afternoon that day, Sept.17,2009 in Scarborough. I will submit the other two sightings to you-as there may be a connection happening here of contact.Those will have excellent pictures<n>

Discussed that it looked out of the ordinary but didn&#39;t give it much thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2:45AM - After driving further south towards Aptos decided to park and check out the view from nearby State Park.  We again noticed the bright small light but this time there was a plane that was clearly visible with flashing red and blue lights on opposite wings that appeared to be circling the general area of the object for about 20-30mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it appeared to be random but then it continued to circle the object in various patterns and about four different angles (above/under, near/away, and behind) then departed.  The small bright light continued to remain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3:20AM - Decided to get a closer look after being surprised by what we were seeing and drove up to a better viewing spot at the entrance to State Park. That is when we noticed a boat that also had red and blue lights was in the area and moving towards the object. At which point the &#34;light&#34; proceeded to take off towards the horizon and seemed to dim until it suddenly disappeared. After that the boat turned a spot light on and seemed to be patrolling the area until it fixed its spotlight directly on us and held. Not sure of the exact time but we decided it was time for us to leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of twinling star??  PD))<n>

As I was walking towards my front door I noticed something moving in the sky.  At first I thought it might have been a meteorite because my initial glance of the object was a fast streak of white light across the sky and then it faded out to black.  I then, noticed, that the object reappeared as bright as it was before.  It was like nothing I have ever seen.  The way it turned, the speed at which it accelerated, and the fact that it was completely soundless was all the proof I needed to assume it was not man-made!  I have been around military Aircraft my whole life, and this was NOT one of ours!  I stared at it for about ten minutes before it slowly disintegrated.  The entire time it just danced effortlessly across a patch of sky fading in and out of visibility directly above WPAFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

(more specifically Cypress)   It was about midnight and we were completely sober.  I say this because every time I recount the story people ask me if we were on anything, but I remember specifically we had JUST cracked out first beers when in the distance, I&#39;d say 300-500 yards away we saw a green light appear in the sky to the North of our position.  It seemingly appeared out of thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((deleted)) I said as I pointed it out to my two friends.  The green light moved diagonally down and to the right (getting closer to the ground), passing over a radio tower in the distance.  It suddenly came to an abrupt halt in mid-air.  It hovered in place for maybe 2 or 3 seconds before it zoomed off northwards.  It disappeared again BEFORE it went over the horizon line.<n>

The object appeared to be stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a pair of binoculars --not sure what the magnification is, with which we both looked at the object, and it was indeed blinking those colors. This &#39;star&#39; also appeared to change shape while watching through the binoculars, but maybe that was my imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were other stars near this object from our vantage point that were not behaving in a similar fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought maybe it was a twinkling star.

It simply appeared seemingly out of thin air, and was approximately 6 or 7 hundred feet directly above the apartment building.  I only saw it for about 20 seconds and then it just vanished the same way it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute or so later, I saw, in the same area, what looked like a large number of &#34;sparks&#34; like you would see when a transformer is arcing, but this was much too high in the sky to be anything terrestrial.  This too, only lasted a few seconds, and then it completely disappeared.<n>

I was out in the backyard with the dogs.  I happened to look up and saw a triangle of lights headed my way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three lights: two red and one white.  It seemed to be floating above the tree line.  I first thought it might be helicopters flying in formation, but there was no sound.  It seemed to be only one or possibly two football field lengths away.  When it turned, I saw a third red light that made it the shape of a diamond.  Only one light was blinking.  The other three stayed on constantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched in amazement until it went behind the trees.  I watched and waited for it to clear the trees.  When it did, I saw it turn around and head back the way it had come.  I was speechless.  What can turn around like that?<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it went behind the trees again, I ran into the house for my camera.  I was going to take a picture when it reappeared, but it never did.<n>

We had seen one possible UFO before this account, but it may have just been a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event in question though was a bright light that me and one of the other people had just happened to notice.  This location was approximately 25 miles south of Lewiston, ID, and Clarkston, WA.  It appeared shortly before we looked up, and just as we both saw it, it quickly faded from a bright light in the sky to what almost looked like a small star.  It also seemed to be moving southward as well. The location of this sighting in the sky was right above the Southern Cross northward, and just south between Orion, and the little dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This could have been a possible UFO, or maybe even a super nova or some other unexplainable event. But as to the fact that both the other person and I saw it, it may have been noticed by other people as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

The sun was still out and not a cloud in the sky.  As i walked to my jeep  the shape was moving , at first i thought it was an airplane but this shape was long and not that wide in size with a silver flashing look to it.  i stood out side my jeep but the object just disapperared.    This is the second time in 2 weeks that I have seen the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Last night, at around 6pm. mountain standard time, September 16th, 2009, we arrived at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument which is roughly 25 miles South of Ajo, Arizona, and roughly 5 miles North of the Mexican Border. We set up camp and cooked dinner, and at around 7:30 pm, I whitnessed a reddish/amber light blinking  twice in the sky just over the horizon in a Southeastrn direction.  It then disappeared, and then several white lights started blinking in the E/SE direction of the sky.  I would say Probably 3 different lights blinking randomly. Lisa did not see this with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few hours passed, we went into the tent to go to sleep.  The tent has a mesh top so that you can see the stars.  At around 9:00 pm, Lisa and I heard a very loud sound, kind of like a jet engine, that ended abruptly.  We decided to look in the sky at the area where the sound was coming fr! om, East.  I saw another red/amber light moving slowly from East to Southeast, it then disappeared and 3 or 4 more objects started blinking randomly, on no set pattern.  They then slowly dissapeared and we stopped watching.  About 15 minutes later, we decided to look East again and we saw the flashing lights again.  This time, there were 4 lights.  They all were flying different directions at first, but then then formed into two pairs in formation and flew from East to Southeast.  We heard brief sounds of engines.  Then, it looked liked 2 of them were about to crash, they then merged into one orb of white light.  Then, they all started blinking and some of them turned off completely while others stayed on, and others turned off completely.  Then, all four started blinking frequently but randomly, and all of a sudden, there were six lights blinking in the sky.  For the next few minutes, they all spread out then slowly disappeared at different times.  At times we could clearl! y see that they were flying over Mexico, as we could see Mexic! an citie s and border crossings South of us and the objects were definitely over these towns and farther away.  That particular sighting was about 9:15 - 9:30/9:45.  We saw no other activity that night.<n>

No clouds.  I was sitting in the kitchen have lunch. My sliding glass window faces my backyard.  My backyard backs up to a park. I live in a new development. The trees are young, not very big. At approximately 13:20 hours (or 1:20 ish) I saw a oblong/oval brillant object in the sky. It appeard like it was floating. There was no noise. It was the brightest and most unusual object I have ever seen. I live very close to Buckley Airforce base. I am very familar with the jets/planes that fly around as well as the very loud noise they make.  The object was not very big, although it was hard to gage the distance.  It probably was the size of an F14 - just oval and made of light. It was sun brillant.  I could make out by the shadows that it appared to have two decks. I watched as it moved behind a small tree.  I waited to it see appear on the other side, never looking away, but it never reappeared on the other side of the tree. I w! ent outside to look in all directions and it just vanished.  About 7 to 10 minutes later, I saw a jet (white and red not grey like all the other jets I&#39;ve seen) take off in a southeast direction. Just one jet, no others followed.  I know what I saw was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I grabbed my remote when I realized I was hearing what sounded like either a rolling thunder or and aircraft.  I live on the second floor and my window was open two away from me.  The volume on my tv returned but I was puzzled because I was unsure where the sound was coming from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned the volume on my tv down to mute to verify what I was hearing not from the tv. The sound continued. It had been a clear day so thunder I thought was unlikely. The sound still persist, by this time at least 2 minutes had passed since my tv volume had first been interrupted. Out of curiosity I walked over to the window and there it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was ascending into the air very very slowly. It was not very high in the air, I would say maybe the height of a police helicopter. But I know it wasn&#39;t a copter for at least two reasons; 1.  There was no helicopter sound which I am very familiar with having grew up in the inner city and currently living within a mile of a police station.   2.  The lights on the craft where not at all like the typical search light you see on police helicopters. I am pretty certain that it was circular shape/disk shape. Although it did not seem thin or flat disk, it was thick or tall but it was more wide than tall by far. It seemed black or dark and it&#39;s figure was more of a shadow or outline. It had three very dark lights on it. There were two red lights on each end and on the left side just near the red light there was a blinking yellow light. I must stress that the lights were very clear and very bright! I followed the craft rising in the sky with my eyes until it went out of my line of sight through my window pane. I wanted to run down stairs an continue watching but I was in my undergarments. The sound which was jet and thunder like continued to persist. I scrabbed to my bedroom to find something to pit on, but by the time I reached the stairs the sound had ended. What I thought was strange about the sound was that it was quite powerful and was clearly being generated from this vessel however the craft itself was moving very very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately sought out this web site because I am convinced that what I saw was an UFO. I live in the city I am used to seeing airplanes and helicopters, and even those small planes that advertise signs and blimps. This was certaintly not a craft I am familar with. It was round and disk like, it&#39;s light was unusually, clear and bright, and it flew straight up! Very very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope that someone else in this area saw it was I will not feel crazy.<n>

I always wondered if they were real.  Well tonight i saw it with my own eyes.  I believe I saw something very different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 11 pm monday night.  I was in Loleta California a friend and I sitting in the car. I was looking out towards the ocean.  I noticed a white light in the sky and it was flickering with red and green.  I noticed it was moving. I had to ask my friend if he saw,  what I saw.  He said, &#34;yes, I see it too&#34;.  We watched this light in the sky for about 20 minutes.  It was a distance away.  We feel it was quite a ways out in the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was racing back and forth, up and down. It did a figure 8&#39;s.  I know that no airplane could do what I saw this light do.  Sometimes it would go straight down down down, then shoot straight back up.  It went on for so long.  I hoped I would see it shoot off in the sky.  The light just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of twinkling star?  PD))<n>

My father looked up to the sky and pointed out a pair of strange lights. They were two very bright white lights. They traveled in an eerily straight line, one behind the other. They had no directional lights like a small plane, and they made no sound.  It looked to me like these lights were a part of one massive object, the way they moved together was out of this world, if it was one object it must have been at least a Km across, and the speed it was going was quicker than anything I have seen.  It moved from the west of the region to the east where both lights disappeared in the exact same spot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my father talk of UFOs all the time, but there was also 4 other people who never would have given them a second thought.  We all agreed we saw the same thing, and we were left with a strange feeling in our stomachs the rest of the night, just because of the extraordinary site we saw.  I will never forget that, and we all still talk of it to this day.<n>

The objects did not appear to be moving and were about 200-300 feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediatly asked my co worker if she was seeing the same thing.  She replied with a no.  I then turned down Hollywood Blvd, where the object was,  It then quickly darted over I-95 and then stopped over the highway and then again slowly began to move west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my co worker who was still on the phone with me now began to see one of the green lights above Emerson Drive, which is west of I-95 and 3 miles west of where I was. The other green light was not in sight for about 1 minute and then my co worker began to see the second light as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of the object and then my worker said the object was out of her sight as well after about 2 minutes.<n>

As the aircraft and the unkn object passed by, another aircraft that had just left the Spokane Washington Airport, was also in trail of the aircraft and object.  All three lights flew across the sky at a reasonable speed to the east, until out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 10 minuates an unkn object that is described as the first white light again flew accross the area. This time the object was going from the East to the West track. It is noted that all three aircraft were on a VECTOR of V448 that aircraft use as a major heading from the West coast to the East.<n>

Sometimes there were only one or two lights and other times there were three or four.  They would flash in the sky and then disappear.  It was obviously not a plane because airplane lights were constantly flashing, these were not.  We did not see any objects, only lights.

It was around 9:00 PM and as we headed east onto the Bay St. Louis Bridge, a bright orange light abruptly appeared in the sky to the southeast. As I tilted my head to look out the passenger-side window to get a better look at the light, it just slowly faded away. There was no movement. The object was stationary from the time it lit up until the light completely faded out after only a few seconds. I turned to my husband and he asked me if I had seen it. Since we had both seen this object, he started looking for a place to pull over on the beach. Before he could find a place to stop, I saw another orange light that did exactly the same thing as the first – light up and slowly fade with no movement. This object, however, was more to the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled over at a point where there were a couple of benches on the sea wall and decided to sit and watch the sky over the Gulf of Mexico for any more lights. Before we had time to get settled, another one appeared to the southeast. A short time later, there was another to the southwest. Then, three lights appeared almost simultaneously--one, two, and three. They faded out in the same order. We saw one or two more lights, and my husband remembered that we had our night vision monocular in the truck. He saw the last orange light with the night vision and saw that when the light went off, there was still something there that we could not see without the night vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For about 15 minutes, we watched a number of small spheres travel back and forth in the areas where we had seen the orange lights. One of the spheres appeared to pulsate, but the others were just faint solid objects. We saw no more orange lights during this time. As we watched the spheres, they suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no moon that night, but it was clear with lots of stars. The objects were very close to shore – between the shrimp boats on the horizon and the beach.  They were also not very high above the water. The entire event occurred over a period of 45 minutes to an hour. We plan to go back with our high-powered binoculars on my husband’s next nights off and see if we can find anything else.<n>

To the naked eye, I noted it was about 30 degrees above the horizon,flickering in three distinct colors, and moving very slowly to the East.  We went inside, but returned to the porch about 30 minutes later, to find it not visible.  As we continued to sit on the porch, my wife noticed it was again visible.  We saw that it had moved horizontally only about 5 degrees in maybe 38 to 40 minutes.  I retrieved my digital camera and zoomed in on it.  What I saw were 8 to 10 lights of various sizes, some round, some irregular in shape.  I snapped a picture and the resulting image showed 2 lights, one above the other, the top one being larger than the bottom one. By this time, it was 9:30, and the lights became obscured by trees.  That was the end of my sighting, but I think I&#39;ll go down to the beach to see what else I can see.  If so, I&#39;ll get back to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star?  PD))<n>

The sky was completely clear and many stars were visible. The object appeared to be a cigar-like shape. I could only make out the outline. It was as if the sun was shining directly on the surface of the object. The color was completely different than the colr of the stars (it was more gold like the sun). The object was not making any noise. It was difficult to estimate its altitude, but if I had to guess it may have been between 300 - 1000 feet. It appeared to be about 6 inches long from my viewpoint. Then after a few seconds, as if it had detected that it was being watched, it&#39;s outline shimmered and then disappeared just like a sci-fi cloaking device had been activated. I have a good idea what a civilian and military aircraft looks like in the night sky, because I see them all of the time, but this object was clearly not anything normal. It was also not ! a meteor in my opinion. It definitely made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We thought we might be able to see them at night, I believe we heard there’d been another flare-up even though it’d been about a week or more since the really intense ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we were outside about 11p.m., standing on their quiet residential street when the 3 of us, me (57 years old), my friend (about 54), and his mother (about 86) saw a jewel-like thing shining in the northern sky, somewhere above Montrose.  It didn’t move, it was very small, didn’t glow or change colors (kind of clear, actually) but very noticeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend went in to get binoculars to see if we could get a better look at it, and when he did, his mom and I looked away at stars and lost sight of it.  When he came out we could not find it, so they eventually went back in the house, but I decided to stay outside and just look at the beautiful California night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’d occasionally put the binoculars up to my eyes, and since I wear glasses I had to keep adjusting them, not knowing whether to adjust them to my regular eyes without glasses or with my glasses on. I finally just left my glasses off and began looking up, straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly I saw a V-shaped object moving slowly southward. It did have smaller V shaped designs or window or something greenish colored, but not lighted, more of a glowing, I just followed it for a few seconds, maybe 5-10, then tried to look without binoculars.  But I saw nothing, even with my glasses on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I put the binoculars back up to my eyes, I saw the same type of object except it wasn’t green, it was an ORANGE colored V-shaped object, also moving slowly southward.  I have no idea if it was the original object, or a second one, or what.  Again, no lights, more of a glowing of smaller V-shaped designs within the larger V-shaped object.  The point of the V led the object.  I could near nothing, nor see anything without the binoculars and have no idea how far up, or how big it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just guessed that it was some kind of military plane or something, I didn’t know UFO’s were ever reported to be V-shaped, until I saw something on TV last night (Oct 20, 2010) so I decided to report what I saw.<n>

The distance of the object was maybe less than a mile away and after 5 or 6 seconds of watching the object and bright lime green light she said part of it seem to explode and orange and red peices began to fall tothe ground with the large unilluminated part also falling to the ground. No noise or crash was heard at all. The incident was reported to Blount co. sheriff&#39;s office and an officer was dispatched to patrol the area. My wife stated she does not think it was a meteor because of the way it hovered and she was sure it had a bright lime green glow to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Well I decided to take a walk circling my house.  Every cloud I saw made a shape and a meant something important.   Well bye being in the middle of a  360 degree circle of beutifuly shapen clouds I attracted the attention of one alien.  It started with a holographic image of a sniper soldeir that I still don’t understand why I saw this it must mean they are working  with the government.  I walked past this and the next thing I saw was a green lazer beam flash me in the left eye just like the ones you can buy at the store.  Then a red light scaned my body from head to waist.  The next image and the only one that matters is of an ailen spider type being.  It had nearly twenty straight legs and it was as tall as hip leavel,.  It moved its legs up and down making  sucktion type sounds.  Its body after the legs was only a foot and a half tall but three feet wide.  What I did when I witnessed the creature was a little embarrassing but I fell to all fours bringin me eye level with the creature.  I did this partially for a better view, partially in awe and respect for seeing something so advanced, and because it was so disgusting at first to see too.  I think these certain aliens who must watch us closely are so advanced that you will NEVER SEE there SPACE SHIP but if you prove yourself interesting they may show up right in front of you or an image of them was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.

As I saw on my porch drinking coffee, my eye caught what I thought at the time was an airplane in the distance.  I sat watching, waiting for it to disappear from my sight, but it never did. I had observed some flashing lights, but dismissed it for airplane navigation lights.  As I looked closer, I noticed that the lights were not only blue and red, but yellow, green, and white as well.  Needless to say, I became quite intrigued.  It was around this time that I realized that in the 16+ minutes I had been observing the craft, it had not been moving away from me, but rather had stayed in the same spot moving in a circular motion.  After every two and a half or three rotations, the craft would then abruptly move diagonally to the opposite end of the previous circle.  This went on for another ten minuted until it quickly shot forward about fifty meters (rough guess), and repeated the circles.  The way the colors ke! pt changing assured me that it was not an airplane, and the way it moved was unlike anything I have ever seen before in any type of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At this point, we stopped recording and started to back track, in order to see what kind of car it was. As we watched and slowed down the footage we had seen a speeding light.  It clearly looked to be two ships swooping down our street. I have never seen anything like this before. This sighting was amazing in a scary sort of way.

We watched this stationary object just sit idle in free air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, it took me a long time to take the picture because I didn&#39;t believe my friends who were outside watching it for an hour.  I stayed inside the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object&#39;s Position They said that it was a lot closer to the earth before I decided to go outside and view.  So the image I took was basically its very, very slow ascent back up into the stars.  Even though we were in downtown Chicago, it was a pretty starry night with some stratus clouds high up, but the only thing you can see in this picture is the brilliant amber-red spherical object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You don&#39;t see the stars in the picture, just the red object.  I tried magnifying the view of the object, but of course it&#39;s blurry.  I really need to share this story with someone credible if this helps us understand the big picture of things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Objects Ruled Out I&#39;m not saying that what I saw was a UFO, but I can say that I have never seen any type of flying or floating vehicle, or weather condition, planet, satellite or lightning like the thing I saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m so glad I was able to capture it when I did, because I was shaking and tried to grasp some kind of reasonable explanation for what I saw, but nothing came to mind.  I want to share with you my experience and photo if you are interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a real image. You have to zoom to the red speck at the center.  This was taken at my friends place in the Lincoln Park subdivision of Chicago, the night of Sept. 13, 2009 during the Bears/Green Bay week 1 game at 9:00pm CST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object appeared right around halftime facing the northwest horizon and much lower in elevation.  It stayed stationary, never changing direction.  I finally took this picture at approximately 10:00 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object Hovers  What you see is something I and a few friends can&#39;t explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Outside the house my buddies were first to notice this thing around 9:00 PM.  They kept telling us to come out and watch this thing floating in the air and not moving.  We didn&#39;t believe him so we just kept watching the game inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally gave in and went out to their backyard and witnessed what they were watching.  I could not offer any explanation to what I saw.  The following are things I have ruled out that this wasn&#39;t: -No aircraft (blimp, balloon, helicopter, airplane) -No comet, star or planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -No low earth orbiting satellite Spherical in Appearance I could not decipher any shape of the object.  It looked spherical, and I couldn&#39;t tell if there were more than one.  It was definitely higher in elevation than the Sears Tower.  I&#39;d say approximately more than 5,000 to 10,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first reaction was to call someone miles away from our location just to verify the same unexplainable thing in the night sky.  Of course, nobody would answer their phone because they were probably watching the game.  I really wish I took video but I was actually shaking, because I was kind of excited to see this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was amazing and frightened to watch.  I still want to believe that it was man-made, but my gut tells me that it&#39;s not, nor a natural phenomena<n>
9/13/09 21:00|Raritan Township|NJ|Sphere|30 Seconds|Very Large Orange Fire Ball Traveling South Over Hunterdon County, NJ|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72280.html|355|ndxe200909| Very Large Orange Fire Ball Traveling South Over Hunterdon County, NJ<n> <n><n> <n><n> On September 13, 2009, my wife, my brother, my brother’s wife and I were sitting on my brother’s back patio in Raritan Township, New Jersey around a fire pit talking and spotting occasional satellites.  My sister-in-law had not seen a satellite at night before and it was fun for us to pick them out from the sky.  There were flashes of light in the southern skyline that had been going on for about twenty minutes and although we could not hear any sound produced from the flashes of light we commented there was probably an active fireworks display from a distant town event occurring.  One thought it was lightening, but it was a clear sky in our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:00PM to 9:15PM, only my wife was looking into the sky.  My brother had been adjusting the wood in the fire which drew the attention of the rest of us.  My wife called out, “What is that?”  The other three of us looked up in the southern direction she was pointing (about a 10 o’clock position from where we were sitting) and saw a very large object, which appeared to be a burning ball of orange fire traveling in a southern direction away from us.  We all stood up and began calling out our observations to each other as it continued in a southern direction.   We all commented about the unusual size and the orange flame.  I asked if it could be a military aircraft afterburner, but this was dismissed due to no sound produced by the object and it seemed larger than a known type aircraft and the burning appearance continued throughout our entire observation which, to my knowledge,  was inconsistent with an afterburner. We commented about the possibility of space debris! or a large meteor, but it did not appear to be descending. It continued in the direction of the suspected fireworks display which I suspect should produce more witnesses. It’s difficult to estimate how long in seconds we watched the object. I tracked it as long as possible and I would estimate we watched between twenty to thirty seconds which seemed too fast for a typical aircraft to cover that much area.  It was very strange to all of us. Its flight path would have taken it in the Trenton/ Philadelphia area.<n>

I’m guessing it may have traveled a sky distance of two to three degrees or about one seventh to one sixth of the sky immediately above me.  It had the same magnitude and appearance of Jupiter in the night sky, absolutely no difference.  I saw it for a split second or so and then it was gone, without fading in magnitude or changing in appearance.  Its brightness was consistent without any fluctuation.  It disappeared in the same form as it had appeared.  It displayed no streak, tail or any kind of trail or smoke.  It was a singular light and moved across the sky incredibly fast.  I observed it because I was watching the ISS moving from NW to NE that evening in my backyard.  The ISS had reached its zenith in the northern sky wh! en the ISS went behind a tall fir tree and while I waited for it to re-emerge (which it didn’t by the way) the unexplained light appeared about a degree away just to the south of the location of where I last saw the ISS.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When it did move, it moved extremely slowly and moved in a circular direction.  It then stopped temporarily, and then began to move very slowly again, but this time in a trajectory to the right or west, but each time it did this, it would stop, and start going in a circle toward the east once again as if to stay above the treetops.   After a few minutes, it would begin the trajectory to the west again, each time climbing higher into the sky.   With time, the object made its way high enough into the sky that it need not attempt to venture back toward the treetops.  At the beginning, the object appeared to look like a cylinder with one part divided into two parts, with antennas coming off the top and from the middle section.   When it began the trajectory portion of its journey the object took on an oval shape resembling an eye with multi-colored lights projectin! g from underneath its shape.   Another shape that the object took on resembled a ball with spikes on all sides instead of soft edges.  The spikes took on multi-colored lights, green, red, white, and yellow.  At its highest elevation, the object resembled a cross between a round shape and an oval.  It was bright white in color, and continued to move extremely slowly as it climbed higher and higher into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a star or planet??

They were bright orangish-red.  A light fog was rolling in off of Lake Michigan and as they headed over the lake and got behind the fog I could still see them slightly through the fog which indicated to me that they weren&#39;t ground generated.  They flew in a straight line.<n>

Looking to the east, I saw what appeared to be sort of a bow or boomerang shape (135 degree angle) about two or three inches from tip to tip &#34;visual size&#34;.  It was dim, perhaps transparent; I could barely make it out.  I just noticed the movement - it would have been easy to miss.  It did not have any details or color I could make out.  My impression was that it was anywhere from a few feet from tip to tip to maybe 10 feet.  It seemed to be around 50 to 100 ft. away, moving 10-20 mph.  The bow center or angle corner was the front.  It moved silently in a straight line towards the south or southeast.  It went behind the trees, and I didn&#39;t see it again after that.  The total duration of the sighting was about five seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will admit that what I saw could have very well been an owl or something (or even a trick of the eyes, e.g. a &#34;floater&#34;), but I cannot be certain, so I thought it would not hurt to report it, especially since I witnessed a very similar phenomena a year or two earlier.<n>

Its huge.” Then the passenger in the rear was overwhelmed by the size and said, “That’s a UFO”. At that time, I stuck my head out the sunroof to witness this. The UFO was hovering above the tree line. It had a disk like shape and a large circular light in the center of the spacecraft and smaller circles lights surrounding the one in the center. We were all absolutely amazed and excited. We asked each other what we had seen and each description was the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued driving and as the road curved the moon appeared out of nowhere to our right. It was a crescent shape but it was so low to the ground. It could have been hiding behind the trees during our commute but it was strange how after the sighting it appeared out of nowhere.<n>

I seen one last night flying around, and five other the following night.  One also during the following day.  During the day the object was silver eliptical shaped and was flying up and disipered. all the night opjects were flashing lights (red, blue, green and yellow and white, changing often.) as small as stars moving around in a unpredictable pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my mom about the sightings, and she said she has seen the same things up at her house too, only she said one of the craft came down and hovered above her barn for a few secends and took off.  They reported sightings on and off throughtout the last week. my mom and my sister said when it was over the barn the craft emitted no sound.<n>

I stepped outside, and spotted a blue and red triangle of lights in the sky, looking about 2 or 3 miles away. It was mostly blue, with a red tip, and it seemed to float down, like a leaf. It disappeared behind the treeline. Not ten minutes later, we spotted a second craft, a ring of red flickering lights, moving far too fast and in a far too erratic fashion to be a plane or helicopter. Both crafts made a distinct humming sound. That lasted for about another two minutes, then it too disappeared behind the treeline, in the same general area as the first, perhaps near Balboa Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched this for about 1 minute before mentioning this to my wife as being strange as I figured it must be a plane heading eastward, but had never seen this particular flight path before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light grew in size considerably until it appeared about twice as bright as the brightest star in the sky, just a steady white light,at no point could we hear any noise from the object. it then began a fast vertical accent very quickly in the sky until it vanished.  The entire event lasted about 1 ½ minutes. It only took about 5-10 seconds for the light to go from its brightest point to a pinpoint then vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They made no sound.  They appeared to drift slowly in a Southerly direction.  The lights were bright, somewhat yellow-orange and faded in brightness as they moved higher in the sky and then disappeared.  Both myself and my husband saw the event.  We saw some students near the building and we went to ask them if they had seen the lights.  They answered no; but as they were saying no, one pointed out that another group of three lights was coming up from the North at that very moment.  Again there were three bright lights yellow-orange. At first straight across. They then formed a triangle and slowly and silently moved in a delta form towards the Southwest. The lights dimmed and separated disappearing high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 6 objects in all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

No blinking aircraft lights or sound.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77901.html|375|ndxe200909| Three amber colored lights moving at various distances.  No blinking aircraft lights or sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I clean an accountants office in the Town of Brookfield at the corner of Capitol Drive and Lilly Road.  My son and I do the job together. I had to step outside and get some furniture polish from my van.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed some lights that appeared to be about 3 blocks south of me across the very busy Capitol Drive.  They were orange like the lights on a TV broadcast antenna.  The lights were stacked vertically exactly like the safety lights on a tall antenna.  I thought to myself , &#34;I don&#39;t recall seeing an antenna there before.&#34;  At that I turned to take another look and noticed they weren&#39;t in a vertical stack anymore, but were moving closer together and lower down toward the level of the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my son outside to get his opinion about what I was seeing.  Just when he came out he was able to get a glimpse of them dip below the tree tops and we figured they were gone.  He went into the van and grabbed his little hand held video camera just in case they appeared again.  We then noticed the lights were still visible through the trees.  The lights then started to rise again.  They moved in relation to each other in a sort of triangle.  After getting bright and dim a couple times they suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son&#39;s video is on YouTube.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od637rz2U00  I later looked up on google maps where we saw the lights descend below the tree tops to see what was over that way because they would have had to be practically on the ground.  On google earth we found a swampy area near Brookfield Highschool that would is about 80ft lower in altitude then our observation location.  So the lights could have still been above the ground but appear to us as being at ground level through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I originally posted a report on Mufon.  Unfortunately I&#39;m not a member so I can&#39;t seem to access that information which included a video.  They called me back and said they thought the video was interesting but they never investigated.  I thought about going from door to door in that area to see if anyone else saw the lights but I figured Mufon would do that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up that date on Nuforc I noticed a husband and wife reported seeing the lights in the same area on the same date - same time.  Their location was south of mine.  If Nuforc wants to give anyone my phone number they can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also someone recently reported a pizza truck driver at Capitol Drive and Lilly road that witnessed something similar on September 5 2010.<n>

So we pulled into a parking lot and watched it go upward. We then began to drive in the direction the object was moving and it steady went up into the sky and then the lights went out. There was no noise from this object it was very quiet and moved steady but quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning we found out we were not the only ones that saw this so that was a relief to know we were not just seeing things.

Three witnesses noticed a flashing object in the southern horizon.  All the witnesses saw the object at the same time. Most thought it was an airplane. Witness 1 thought it was a UFO on the first pass. The object was straight up in the air then moved lower before it disappeared. The object just disappeared before the witnesses including witness 1. The object moved in a straight path in a northerly direction. The object then vanished in the southeastern sky. The witnesses started stargazing and discussed the various constellations observed in the night sky. Witness 1 saw the craft reappear in the eastern sky, about 45 degrees or close to the horizon,  while stargazing and two two of the witnesses saw what it looked like. The third witness was on his cell phone and missed this. The craft was then golden metallic and triangular in shape. Kept moving normally, moving in a straight line, then disappeared again ! during pass two. The craft disappeared in the center of the sky during its second pass by the witnesses. Shortly after this they observed something twinkle over the El Paso Mountains. Then the object disappeared again. Shortly after this the witness heard a high pitched whistling type hum after the craft left the area in a south to southeast direction. The craft was seen flying over the local mountains when leaving the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness 1 reports a strong need to get out of there. Felt scared by the sighting.

The center light was off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Left side back light on. The center light was off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cycled through in a regular pattern while crossing the sky. The craft flew close to the horizon during most of the sighting(s).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lights:  Cycling lights were seen through the whole observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Craft color:  Craft structure looked metallic but color was not discernible. The craft was dark in color (couldn&#39;t describe color) with white lights that  were solid. The actual lights did not strobe but they exhibited a pattern of cycling light formations. The craft color did become &#34;orangish&#34; with white lights when it broke into three vertical 90 degree triangles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Windows: None Aliens/Humanoids sighted: None Sound:  Mixed howl or a &#34;like wind blowing through a mine&#34; and the sound kept moving with the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Experience details:  Arrived at the trail head of the college, past the BLM sign giving the trail name, and parked in a dirt area. College was directly to the north of the witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Got out of the car and Witness 2 looked to the east and saw three lights. The two lights disappeared which caught the witnesse&#39;s interest. The lights were observed on the horizon. The lights stuck close to the horizon throughout the flight. Two of the witnesses were talking while Witness 2 observed the object fly east when the object was seen again. The craft turned south and moved in a southeasterly direction skirting the horizon. It was low to the mountain tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object was directly south of the three witnesses, Witness 2 saw the object lights &#34;jump back&#34; before continuing in a southeasterly direction towards Trona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object flew east before disappearing behind an easterly mountain range. Before disappearing over the eastern mountain range the object broke vertically into three triangular shaped objects which flew separately in formation. When the object broke apart the witness reported the craft became the color orange of a street light while the lights became white.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a very clear night the skys were amazing you could see the stars and they seemed so close that you could just reach out and touch them. We live in the country, no tress or electrical wires or anything blocking the view. There is an empty field in the back of our house. At about 8:10 we decided to go into the house cause the fire was going out, so we turned to take our cushions out of our chairs to bring them, when we turned I saw a bight star like object moving in a straight line coming from the northwest, it was bight, moving at a fast speed about the size of a basket ball about 500ft in the sky. It was then passing the empty field and was heading southeast @ 160 degrees south and 96 degrees east, when it like exploded into a bright blinding light about the size or a trampoline and it was gone in a flash.

Just behind the leading edge there appeared to be two connected rectangular window pane shaped objects on the craft in the midst of the fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time it took to travel from the eastern to the western horizon was less than five seconds. The object was not ascending or descending, and appeared to be traveling parallel to the power lines which were also laid out east to west.

I noticed a very white sphere hovering just west of the freeway, northbound, at about 20 degrees above the freeway.  It was very bright and stationary.  In about 10 seconds it moved around the sky, but not streaking, it was just in one place, then another, all within about a 5 inch range of my vision.  I tapped my wife who was in the passenger seat sleeping, and i pointed to it.  Just as I pointed to it, it started to move around faster, from one place to another.  Then, quickly, it started to move from east to west at a very high speed, then went at a 45 degree angle to the ground.   At no time was there any other colors in the object, and there was no apparent streak as seen with a meteor.  My wife doesn&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s.  She said &#34;What was that&#34;  I said &#34;UFO&#34;. she said, no way, that had to have been a rocket or something, is there military bases in the area?...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after, I noticed two airplanes in the vicinity with police lighting on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very wild experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, the sun was set, but the area was getting thick with thunder storms.

The object started dissapearing from view behind a large tree in our garden.  My brother and I jumped up and went around the tree to keep looking at this UFO while our mother rushed inside the house to get a pair of binoculars.  I was able to have one last quick look at the object mooving very swiftly across the sky before it disappeared beyound a forested mountain in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was somewhat like a diamond with facets arrayed concentrically and displaying hues of blue red and white or silver.  It had no wings and was flying without making a sound.  There were winglike protrusions however but in such a bizarre angle that they would have been useless to help the object fly in terms of an airplane.  We have never seen anything like this not even in an science fiction movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thats why it is so hard to describe what it was like.  We were baffeled.  What on earth is that???  It was still broad daylight so there was no mistaking it for something else.  I hope this is helpful in some ways to your research.  Greetings from Germany<n>

The Boomerang was definetly flying in a easterly direction and therefore would have a tail section in front it and behind it.  It was not flying away from us or banking against the skyline.  There were no lights, no sound-and it was amazingly fast and low - my guess is that it was the size of a 737 aircraft - and flying at about 1000 feet, would love to know if anyone else saw this - please e-mail matchpoint19@yahoo.com.  I am a former Law Enforcement Officer, my wife is a former Flight Attendant and both feel that we are credible witnesses to this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up and I saw what I believed at the time to be a stealth aircraft. But something didn&#39;t look right so I asked my friend what the object was.  She is more tech savvy than myself however, she too was mystefied.  The craft was triangular with two bumps towards the bottom of the triangle. It was pitch black in color like someone had spray painted it.  The strange thing was, it was moving backwards so that the bumps were in the front.  It was moving somewhat slow for an airplane.It was very low as well, about 600 ft above my house.  Four suns in comparison could make up the craft.  I called my mother out when it was about half gone, when she arrived she could only see the outline. About 30 seconds after it had appeared it went behind the clowds.<n>

Myself 36 year old mother &amp; wife, my husband 38 year old Home Improvement business man, and our son 15 year old skater/student was on our way home driving down Soldiers Home Miamisburg Rd. South when we spotted a ufo hovering above a corn field seemingly still.  It was wide with 2 big head lights and was low enough that we couldn&#39;t see under it until we got under it and behind it.  We had the windows down and the sun roof open and it had no sound.  We then seen it was shaped as a triangle with white lights on each point.  It began to move as we got past it, I turned around down the street and it was still in our sights it began accelerating faster &amp; faster as if it was running away from us.  Once we hit a tree line and couldn’t see it for approximately 8 seconds, we seen the sky again, but it was GONE.  It was a clear night with many stars in the sky.  And it was hovering over a corn field close to the old Ga! tor alley ball field on Farmersville West Carrollton Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were in awe as they saw three red/orange objects in the clear sky.  I witnessed these three circular shaped objects in the sky, over eighty thousand feet above.  The objects seemed to be as high as the highest dimly lit star.  They were as small as the smallest farthest star.  I was standing  at 33degrees 52’13.03” N.  117 degrees 33’45.71”W.  looking 75 degrees to the south by south west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were in my sight for about 10 to 15 minutes.  They made no sound.  Two of the objects simultaneously moved at a 90 degree angle south with the third object shooting out at a 90digree angle North.  If the moon were to be in place directly behind the objects then the objects would be the width of two moons.  The objects then went so high that I could not longer keep them in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From a distance I thought it was an aircraft warning light on the top of a 10 story apartment building but the closer that I got to it I realized that it wasn&#39;t. After a few minutes of watching it the fire dissapated, flaring up a couple of times in this process lasting 1 minute or so.  What was left was a blood red colored, star sized circle which was significantly smaller than when it was aflame. It proceeded to move in a controlled fashion to the north and east at a level altitude beyond my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My 4 year old son and I went outside to play with his balsa wood airplanes when I noticed a star like object moving west to east directly over our heads.  It was very bright, brighter than any star in the sky and was moving at a rate faster than a jet, but too slow for a shooting star.  It had no blinking lights, just a bright single star like light.  No perimeter of the object was visible.  My angle of view was further west than the pilot that also witnessed it.  It appeared to slightly elevate in altitude before disappearing making me believe that it accelerated at a high rate of speed towards space giving it the appearance that it just went dim.  I was able to watch it for approximately 6 seconds... according to the other report it would have traveled approximately 30 miles during that period of time.  I would estimate that the object was flying under 3000 ft a! nd made absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was in the western sky from our perspective, it appeared that there were planes in the area trying to get a better look.  It move out of sight, we believe from the rotation of the earth by 10:30pm. Was wondering if there were any other reports filed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What for left on a balcony - I do not know.  Has looked at the sky.  There was a night. In the sky there were stars, the moon was not.  Suddenly I have noticed three bright orange points which quickly flied on the sky, one is strict over another. There was then the third.  They have formed an enormous triangle and continued to float on the sky from the northeast on the southwest an acute angle back, the basis forward.  At once to them as if catching up, the fourth has departed. Fires on shine and brightness were similar to bright stars in the sky, but is brighter also than the orange sated colour. Brightness pulsed, from a red dark point to a white star with an orange aura. When fires reddened, they decreased in sizes, as if &amp;#1075;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1089;&amp;#1083;&amp;#1080;. Fires did not change distances among themselves for all time of flight over our house in visibility limits. Their speed ! exceeded speed of the plane. They flied very highly, on sensations, much more above passenger planes.« The triangle », formed by them, was very big, approximately 30 metres at length. The object did not publish any sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I did not have a possibility to remove on a videocamera this object, but in Youtub I have found a roller with similar object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXEOi_Bvy38 These objects saw I, my mum and other inhabitants of Kiev. I have written about the supervision on a site of the Ukrainian ufologists with the request if there are still witnesses, to write. Two persons have answered. Here their messages.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.	The Observer lives near to me, objects saw in the same evening and in the same time range. «It was observed 8 &amp;#1096;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1087;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1076;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1073;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1099;&amp;#1093; objects of red-orange colour, the luminescence was like as to constants, without a blinking, height to define difficult.&amp;#1085;&amp;#1086; I think in an interval between 1000 - 3000 metres, moved slowly. A direction of movement from the northeast on the southwest. Sequence following: the first, three (located on tops of an equipotential triangle), three (an arrangement similar), last. It was observed except me by mum and the daddy».<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.	&#34;Similar&#34; balls &#34;for the first time observed over Troeshchinoj (area of Kiev), in May, 2009. Two blood-red balls in which centre the yellowish stain (as a flame of a candle from an easy breeze as though will die away flickered again will inflame) have flown by from the east on the West».<n>

As the plane carried on its journey behind it five oval  red lights seem to float up and stay their for a couple of minutes . This was enough time to think that this wasn’t fire works and to get my phone camera out of my bag and take a photo.  The plane carried on going and the oval lights stayed where they were. I panicked a little on taking the photos as this was something I had never witnessed before and the photo wasn’t great but what I have got is two of the lights and some distorted lighting. As I was taking the photos the oval lights just seemed to disappear into nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/11/09 21:30|Salem|OR|Sphere|5 minutes|Four large orange spherical objects with a diamond shape "halo"in long arc overhead.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72245.html|398|ndxe200909| Four large orange spherical objects with a diamond shape &#34;halo&#34; in long arc overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four objects were spotted overhead in sequence.  They faded as they moved from NW to SE and SW.  The objects were large and orange, larger than the space station appears.  They looked like large meteors, but did not follow typical trajectory.  One was followed by a small object that did look like a meteor.  The last object was particularly strange as we saw it through the tree line near the horizon and it then traveled overhead.  We have video of the fourth one, but it is shaky due to the zoom.  The entire event took about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event occurred during a back yard gathering.  The witnesses (about a dozen) were mostly college professors and school teachers.  The object appeared to be a sphere surrounded by diamond.  Oddly, the sphere is clearly brighter on the back edge of its directions, contrary to what one would expect from atmospheric entry.  This was also the north side of the sphere two hours after sunset and was clear even at the western horizon, ruling out solar reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not suggesting that this is extraterrestrial, we simply cannot determine what it is.<n>

They finally believed me about what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day my other sister who was asleep the night before when we saw the lights let the dog out at 21:23 and called us out to see some lights in the sky.  This time there were 4 crafts but they were flashing and changing colours and they kept fading away and flashing back again. This time myself, my mother, my two sisters, my brother and both my friends were there and we all saw them they were moving very quickly and again didn&#39;t make any sound. When we tried to get them on video it wouldn&#39;t turn up on screen and two of the lights seemed to be following each other. We are going to go out every night f! rom now on with more people so they&#39;ll see the UFO&#39;s too.<n>

It seemed to be generally over Seattle, directly to the east of the Bangor submarine base on the Kitsap Peninsula.  It hovered in roughly the same location for over an hour, however it drifted slightly to the east over the timeframe we observed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From our viewing location, the object was small and difficult to observe with the naked eye so we used a pair of 10X25 Binoculars for improved detail.  The colors alternated fairly quickly between red, green, purple, aqua blue, violet, dark blue, orange, yellow, and white and appeared like electrical arcs surrounding a sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a fair amount of air traffic that evening but it didn’t seem to draw much attention which I thought was strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnesses: Adult – Mechanical Engineer 3 Children (13, 10.5, 8.5) - Homeschooled<n>

The speed limit was 35 Mph and I was getting angry at the driver ahead of me as he slowed down, slower and slower. As he came to a near complete stop, I stopped as well and it caught me eye. It was a craft flying quite low. (Around 1,000 ft) It had two orange lights, one near the top and one near the bottom. It was not quite a teardrop shape. The best I can describe it, (without drawing a picture) is the top of the craft was rounded and it got wider towards the bottom where it appeared to have a more boxed form. One light was at the top and the other was at the bottom. I realized thats what the motorist before me was looking at. The object moved side to side slowely and then began to pick up great speed as it flew to the West. It then streaked off into the distance moving up and Westward. When I say &#34;streaked&#34;, thats what it really did. The light trail followed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a black orb that  was tumbling through the air at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing in my street playing football with my two sons, 13 and 10.  My 13 year old and I were standing next to each other talking and it was abnormally quiet outside.  As a matter of fact, it was so quiet, I could hear the high school band playing at the Friday night game which is over a mile away.  I need to preface this email and state that I am a professional at trade and without giving up my occupation, let&#39;s just say my credibility is very high.  Anyway, I was standing next to my older son and I happen to look up and coming from the east was an object.  What I couldn&#39;t understand is why this object was moving so fast.  As it drew closer, the process of elimination in my mind quickly narrowed it down to a UFO.  By no means am I a believer in the whole alien conspiracy thing but I have NEVER seen anything like this before.  I quickly yelled at my son and told him to look.  My son quickly looked up and said, &#34;dad, what its that.&#34;  At this point, I w! ent into defense mode because I could not explain away what I was seeing.  This object was sort of like an orb.  Based on the altitude, I was say it was about 8-10 thousand feet up.  It was black however it TUMBLED through the air.  I could see this thing rolling and the sun was going down and at one point, the object reflected light and it illuminated the object better.  I have NEVER seen anythings like this before.  What was even more strange was the object was not emitting ANY sound.  It was dead silent and at that point, you could hear anything.  We live within 15 miles of PDX airport in Portland, Oregon and I know the flight paths of airplanes that come and go.  This thing was moving at a VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED and in a flat east to west direction.  I have never believed in UFO&#39;s in the past but I will now argue with any skeptic till I&#39;m blue in the face.  We were able to watch the object as it maintained the same altitude and speed until it many miles away.  My son a! nd I are changed people.  We have not stopped talking about it! .  The o bject is scared in my mind and again the strangest thing besides its speed, and shape, was the fact it did not emit any sound whatsoever.  It literally tumbled through the air and was basically rotating around itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/11/09 12:23|Paysayten Wilderness|WA|Light|30 Minutes?|Daylight Large Bright Light in Paysayten Wilderness|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73028.html|414|ndxe200909| Daylight Large Bright Light in Paysayten Wilderness<n> <n><n> <n><n> On September 11, 2009 at 12:23pm I was hiking out of the Paysayten Wilderness on the Pacific Crest Trail north of Slate Peak / Harts Pass when I noticed an extremely bright large white light on the summit of a peak north of Jack Mt. The light was roughly 8 miles away, maybe closer. It drew my attention due to its intensity which remained constant for the time I observed it. The weather was clear, unlimited visibility, a blue sky, no clouds, about 50 Degrees F, a light wind at about 2 mph. I was at about 6,700ft elevation. At least 10 other people in that area saw it. The trail was busy that day and everybody I passed talked about the light. I would estimate the light was probably 100ft in diameter and appeared round in shape. To the eye it was blindingly bright, like an arc welder with a white color that appeared to have a blue tinge at the edges. When I reached the trail head a forest service worker asked if I saw the light. A ranger passed by in a truck. T! he forest service worker asked the ranger who summers at Harts Pass if he knew what it was and he did not. It was nothing they had seen before. I did not see the light in the air or see the light switch on or off. I took some images of the light with a Nikon D90 DSLR using a Nikon 18-200mm VR DX lens set at f/8.0 and 200mm. I was on a steep hillside with a heavy pack, very tired, shaky and did not stop to use a tripod or optimize the camera settings so the images are not as sharp as they could be. To the eye the light was blindingly bright; it appeared to overload the camera sensor when it was imaged. The effect was similar to taking a picture of the sun without a filter, but confined to a small well defined area without lens flare or burst pattern. At least 10 people talked to me about the light and it is likely that more than 10 people saw it because there were many people hiking in that area that day and at that time. The Pacific Crest Trail stays on top of ridges in tha! t area at 6500ft or higher. I would estimate I observed the li! ght over the period of about 30 minutes. I took the images and stopped observing the light, and then it was gone when I looked up again.  The peak the light was on is above Ross Lake and there are no roads or anything else in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

For perspective, I was looking diagonally in line with the Home Depot you can see off I-75 near the Tylersville Rd. exit.  I waited for the it to start blinking like airplane lights do, but it never did.  The light source definitely was emanating from the object and not the ground.  I watched it for about 20 seconds, then briefly turned my attention to the traffic, when I looked for it again it was gone.  I scanned the sky saw a speck of it miles away now on the other side of the highway.  Then gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

My youngest cousin noticed something in the sky and pointed it out to us. I looked up at what appeared to be a really bright white light. I thought it was a satellite at first, but noticed it was way to big to be a satellite. The object was approximately three or four time&#39;s bigger than the brightest star i could see in the sky and was traveling at a very high rate of speed. Almost like a shooting star.  The bright light slowed way down and almost came to a stand still. It didn&#39;t completely stop but it didn&#39;t move very fast either. By this time we were for yelling for my friend to come outside and witness what we were seeing. He came outside looked at it and couldn&#39;t figure out what it was either. He said the same thing i did, that it was to big to be a satellite. It stayed at this slow speed for about thirty to fourty seconds before it changed direction and took of at an even faster rate of speed fr! om when we first saw it.  The object vanished from our field of view behind of the tree line.  My younger cousin told me that he&#39;s seen three of these same bright light&#39;s the past week.  I&#39;ve only witnessed this one sighting.  I&#39;ve also checked the heaven&#39;s above website just in case it was the ISS. The ISS was nowhere near anybody of land. Even if it was, i don&#39;t think it could have maneuvered the same way this object did. The ISS Was also moving in the opposite direction.<n>

It was clearly a light, not a star, and looked to be the size of a large spotlight with one primary beam coming down.  However, it was partially obscured behind a house, so I did not at first see that, while there was only one “light”, there were in fact two beams coming down.  Also, this light was extremely high in the sky; this was clear by the fact that the length of the light beams, despite coming from an intensely bright light, ended far, far above the ground, what looked like miles from our perspective.  Nothing on the ground was therefore illuminated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I rounded the bend and saw these beams, they immediately began to disappear in a strange manner.  Rather than getting smaller and smaller as they ascended, the brightness diminished in a nanosecond; what was left was the “after light”.  It appeared that the light had perhaps disappeared behind a cloud; however, the night seemed to ! be cloudless, based on the fact that stars were visible (although, due to the density of ground light, there were not many of them).  The “after light” lasted several seconds as it got dimmer and dimmer; it was clear that the “lights” had not been turned off, rather, that whatever they were attached to was ascending rapidly in the sky.  The entire incident last approximately 20 seconds.  It was witnessed by myself and my friend, who saw essentially the same thing (though she did not have as good a view as I did, being more blocked by the house that had at first obscured my full view).<n>

It wasn&#39;t flying too fast for the altitude it was at, and made many tight turns quickly. When it first turned it tilted to one side which confirmed the triangle shape of the solid white lights with a flashing red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not knowing what it was i did an internet search by writing &#34;triangle lights in sky&#34; and the image results were exact to what i just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although on many sites it has been reported that black triangles are quiet, this made a low droning sound which made me look out in the first place, as i had never heard anything like it before.<n>

The object was stationary and continued to be observed from the corner shopping center, surrounding streets, neighborhood and from any point on the family property adjacent to the eleventh tee of the Painted Mountain Golf Course in far northeastern Mesa, Arizona.  The duration of the sighting was between four to eight minutes with a desert monsoon thunderstorm cell moving in from the north at approximately twenty-five miles per hour ended the sighting by piling in to mask in part, then wholly obscure the apparantly stationary object.  The angle of observation f! rom the mean horizon (Horizon is mountainous and a badlands region) of approximately forty degrees of angle.  The Azimuth from the driveway of the witnesses&#39; home was a north-northeast heading of approximately twelve degrees.  The size of the object was similar to that of a seseme seed when held at arm&#39;s length.  In binoculars, the object appeared to be flatter than an upside-down candy kiss, but disc-shaped, with a round top and a slightly cone-shaped extended belly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cell phone photo images appeared as nothing more than a faded point of light.  No detsil was descernible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun had already set minutes before but the waning afternoon had not quite reached the twilight stage.  No stars were visible in the northern or eastern sky above or between thundercells.  The quality of the light on the object precluded any possibility of it being illuminated by reflected or refracted light from the sun due to it being the wrong color and spectrum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SPECIAL NOTE: OBSERVER&#39;S OPINION:  If the object were in fact an intensely glowing helium weather balloon, the altitude would be above twenty thousand feet and the size of the expanded gas bag would be a quarter of the internal volume of a sports stadium.  The flourescent spectrum-appearing internal glow was of an intensity that battery power for such a structure would be the size of a Uhaul trailer and would be too heavy to lift. This thing appeared too brightly lit, and was possibly too big to be an air force of NASA balloon construction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location in the sky was north of and to the left of the northeastern approach corridor for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and aircraft inbound and on approach to the runways were lined up to the east at an azimuth of approximately 80 degrees and were sporting intense, halogen landing lights in a spectrum completely different from the object.  That approach corridor takes the aircraft over the northern crags and spurs of Superstition Mountain and the Tonto National Forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire flight pattern was at far lesser altitude than the object and was under the acumuated thunder cells inbound from both east and north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lightning was flashing at a rate of severa discharges per minute both east and north from an azimuth of 120 degrees to zero degrees.<n>

I was parked near my home to finish listening to the last part of a Coast to Coast show.  This show had nothing to do with UFOs by the way, so UFOs were not on my mind.  I reclined my driver&#39;s seat to gaze up at the sky while listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly a red/orange translucent sphere appeared in the sky.  It moved slowly for maybe 1 quarter mile (in my estimation) in a north-easterly direction before slowly disappearing back into the blue.  It was day light outside with no stars showing, nor were there any clouds near this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, there was a nearby plane (civilian Leer jet type of plane).  I have no idea if the pilot noticed the orange sphere.  This plane was useful only in that it gave me an indication of the altitude, whatever that typically is for Leer Jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a red blinking light with one white light at 9&#39;clock and another white light at 3&#39;clock. I started to realize it was strange when the white lights were not blinking (which would have been the wings of a plane). I called to my husband to come out and look at it. The lights around the object were actually illuminating the craft. &#39;If it were a plane that low, why aren&#39;t we hearing any sound?&#39; is what was going through my mind. As it was moving towards the east, towards the hill in front of our house, the white lights moved clock-wise so the object was now vertical. We both are saying out loud &#34;what the heck is that!!&#34;. At this time the white light that was now at 12&#39;clock separated moving up- further away from the other lights. It continued to follow the lights (i say &#39;lights&#39; now that the craft is not visible by illumination). We bot! h ran through the house to the front to watch it more. As it reached towards the horizon of the hill the white light that was at 12&#39;clock was gone and a quick flash of white light (as if the flash of a camera) was seen in the north. After this flash the lights were now beyond the hill&#39;s horizon and out of our sight. About 4-5min after this we returned to the back porch. My husband soon noticed a bright whitish light coming from the west (near where the border patrol is located in VT) towards the east moving slower than a &#39;shooting star&#39; but too fast to be a plane. I only noticed this light at about the half-way point of where my husband first noticed it. Just after that left our sight there was a plane moving towards the same direction. About 3m after this there was another plane heading in the same direction of the craft. There seems to be a lot of flight activity tonight and I&#39;m hoping these pilots noticed what we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;re having a hard time naming the shape of the craft. It was almost like a really fat cigar shaped or oval-like. We could only see what was facing us. I&#39;m not sure if there was another side of the craft that was not visible to us or not. It could have been saucer shaped but it&#39;s hard to say. I really hope there is someone else around that witnessed the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From the ground with the naked eye I thought it was the lights of an airplane, but it stopped and stood still in one spot for at least a half hour. When I went back in the house after taking the photos, it was still hovering so I don&#39;t know exactly how long it was there. After about 10 minutes I grabbed my Fuij digital camera and took a series of 8 photos a few seconds apart. I could not make out any shapes, only flickering lights, with the naked eye and the screen on the camera. It wasn&#39;t until I zoomed in on the object in photoshop that I could see the shapes of the object. The UFO was changing shapes as I took the photos. I would have taken more photos if I knew that this was what I would find when I zoomed in on it. I think that the colorization of the UFO is very similar to the those in some of the recent Kumburgaz UFO Videos. I hav! e the original unzoomed photos, they are about 1 mb each, taken at about 3 megapixel resolution. Unfortunately my camera was not set at full resolution or the photos would have been much better.

The stars were very visible.  My sister was with me at the time when we first spotted a blinking light very high in the sky.  This could’ve been a high altitude plane but it seemed to have a high velocity as well as a fierce strobe light.  It was traveling north to south as it appeared to have reached a height too far to see.  We watched this first object for about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three minutes later I couldn’t help but notice a very, very bright glowing object moving about the same rate from the West to the East.  It was silent as was the first object.  It passed directly over us as we tried to stay quiet to listen.  The glow was brighter than any star in the sky and seemed to be just within our atmosphere.   The object started to dim and turn a slight reddish color.  It dimmed completely and seemed to blank out.  The object never fell from its altitude nor did it change direction..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately told a third witness to get out of the car.  I told her she missed a U.F.O only to scan the sky once more and see an exact replica of the glow again.   The third object appeared to be in exact flight coordinates of the second object and repeated the dimming process in the same spot in the sky.  Afterwards I noticed a large plane coming from the East a few minutes later.  Important because its lights were much dimmer and it appeared to me much closer to earth.  It looked to be a large Passenger Jet and gave me assurance that the objects were much higher than regular aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation?

Im sure the aircraft in the area had to see them!

At first, I thought it was a large bird, but there was no wing movement.  No sound, no jet trail, no lights, very black.  It stayed on a steady course from the southwest to the northwest. moving very slowly.  I saw a similar object last July 3, 2008, but the sky was slightly darker, and the object was lower.  It moved very slowly, as I was able to watch it for at least ten minutes, both times. This year, there were clouds, and they appeared high and thin.  The object was black and showed up against the sky and clouds as did the object last year.  I did file a report with the National UFO Reporting Center last year as well.  The object last year, appeared to have some indentation at the top and was very black.  This time it looked more round, but the movement was exactly the same.  There is an air base (joint command) off a! bout three miles from where I live in Fort Worth, TX. in the direction the object was moving.  Last year, when I described what I had seen with a coworker he had seen the same object. He lives close to where I live.  He described the object exactly as I did, moving from the southwest to the northwest.  Interestingly, he said one of his neighbors had their cell phone and it began to make noises and light up as the object passed.  I think possibly it might be a government experiment, but it was very strange.  No triangular shape.  Just a rounder shape.  I did take a photo of the object with my cell phone, but I am not sure I captured it as it was high.  I would be glad to foreward the photo to be analyzed.  It would appear as just a black spot, small.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Something shiny reflecting the sunlight caught my eye above the trees. There were three, boomerang shaped objects hovering right above the tree tops making no sound. They were larger than the size of a motorcycle but smaller than the size of an SUV. They were chrome silver in color, very shiny - unlike anything I have ever seen. I lost them over the tree tops. The traffic light changed and I had to turn onto the parkway to keep traffic moving. There were a lot of other cars on the road, this was during rush hour in broad daylight. There was not a cloud in the sky, it was beautiful weather conditions. I dismissed it thinking I may have been hallucinating since I couldn&#39;t make sense of it and they had disappeared...<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Cell phone rang as I was driving and it was my mother.  I told her what I saw and she started asking me questions.  By this time I had pulled up to the light to get onto the very busy HWY 280.  I was in the turn lane to go NW onto HWY 280.  I was facing North and still on the phone with my mother looking up in the sky trying to see if I could find the objects again.  Sure enough they had made a circle from where I had originally spotted them and were flying over HWY 280 going in the same circular direction I had spotted them going in the first time only this time they were at a much higher altitude.  I told my mom I had to go b/c I was going to report this to 911 since this sighting was close to the eighth anniversary of September 11th and I didn&#39;t want to take the chance of it being some kind of terrorist surveillance or something of the sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light changed and I started to move away from the objects.  I pulled over into a parking lot and had my digital camera in my purse.  I pulled it out and got out of the car and waited for them to circle again.  They did return in the same flight path that I had seen them twice before but they were flying at an even higher altitude than they were the second time.  I tried to snap a picture but they were too far away from me at this point. I waited for them to circle around again but they disappeared.  I called 911 and the operator said she was getting similar reports and she was sending a sheriff&#39;s deputy to check it out.  I gave the operator my information and got back into my car and waited for them to fly over again.  Every single time i saw them they were flying in a V formation.  They were all the same size and color, hovering with no sound and could take off at speeds so fast that they seemed to disappear.  I watched them fly over the same restaurant but this time instead of continuing the circular flight path I had watched them make before they turned and flew NW over HWY 280 following the Westbound traffic.  They were flying lower than airplanes but higher than the tree line.  This time they disappeared but it wasn&#39;t like they took off it was as if they were invisible, they were there one minute and then the next they were not.  I didn&#39;t see them take off at a higher speed I just watched them disappear into thin air, it was as if they could make themselves invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my younger brother since he had a sighting near this area a few years before on a fishing trip to see if the shapes of the object were the same.  Mine were different in that they weren&#39;t completed triangles, they were shaped like boomerangs and were smaller in size than the object he saw.  He saw his at night and mine were in broad daylight and made no sound.  I didn&#39;t know who to report them to so I wrote down my experience and I found this website and I&#39;m reporting it for the first time in writing.  I still don&#39;t have an explanation for what I saw that day and I wonder if I ever will.

What appeared to be just North of Dillon Rd., was a flying object going Westward. Although I was not close enough to see great detail (I was about 3/4 of a mile away), it did not look like anything I have seen before; it was flying slowly at a constant altitude (approximately 100-150 ft. off of the ground).  It was going slower than an airplane and appeared far too big and rectangular to be a helicopter.  Because of it&#39;s rectangular shape, I first thought it was a banner trailing behind an airplane (like the type you see at sporting events).  There was definitely no plane ahead of it though.  It was broad daylight and many cars were on the road...surely someone else saw this today?  Also, perhaps coincidentally, my car&#39;s engine timing seemed &#34;off&#34; for a minute...the engine reved up and down while at a stop light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE:  there was a reported UFO sighting in the area (on Dillon Rd.) about two weeks ago; it was reported in The Broomfield Enterprise.

The object made a 180 turn and returned from clouds at same altitude. the object then made several rapid zig-zag manouvers and then pitched down abruptly increasing velocity rapidly. object then made several abrupt turns while climbing up to original altitude. the object then turned to south heading away from my position on ground. I spotted the two t-38&#39;s in formation and moving above me at an altitude slightly higher than object which now was not visible to me.The jets appeared oblivious to the object and continued to manouver.I am a pilot and aerospace employee.This object did not manouver like any conventional aircraft that! i have ever observed. No lights were visible. object appeared to be close to the same size as the T-38 aircraft. max observed speed seem to be 800kts. object was silent, and did not cause a sonic boom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed like it was chasing something smaller that i could not see. Distance at begining was estimated to be 2 miles final sighting appeared to be 4 miles as i lost visual contact. I have witnessed a similar object manouvering like this but at a much greater estimated distance. Wow I&#39;d love to fly something as manouverable!<n>

As I walked up to them I asked, &#34;What are you looking at, a UFO?&#34;   To my surprise, the gentleman said, &#34;I don&#39;t know, maybe!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then proceeded to look up in the western sky and noticed what looked to be a bright star.  The &#34;star&#34; then started &#34;blinking/flashing&#34; different colors like red, blue and silver/white.  The thing that was weird was it was flashing these colors all at once like red on top, blue on bottom but flashing very fast sometimes in a steady pattern.  It would flash and strobe red, blue, red, blue, then blue on top, then red on bottom and all of a sudden it would be a solid silver/white light for like 3 seconds, then go back to the red, blue flashing!  At first I thought it maybe could be a satellite but I thought they could reflect the sunlight in such a pattern.  I have NEVER seen anything like this in my life!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside and grabbed my digital camera to snap a few pictures and by the time I got back outside, two more of my neighbors were also out looking at the &#34;star&#34;.  What I thought was weird was that every picture I took the &#34;star&#34; showed up in the LCD screen on the camera but not in the actual photos! (Just my luck!) We continued to watch the weird object for another 25 minutes or so and I noticed that it had been moving away ever so slightly WNW in the sky until it finally was out of our view from the apartment complex stoop.  I started to tell my friends about it over the next few days and I think they thought I was crazy or something.  A few days later, on of those friends came over to visit and told me that they had seen the exact same &#34;star&#34; that I had described to them earlier that week!!!<n>

The orange ball was about double the size of a regular star. The ball was motionless for about 25 seconds and then it moved very fast and squiggeled, left a faint trail of orange and was gone. When it &#34;squiggeled&#34; out of view it looked like it left a wiggely trail or tracer of orange behind it, which quickly disappeard. The night was fairly clear.

The aircraft was much higher and faster than either.  I could not hear any engine noise after it passed overhead.  (Generally, I can hear engine noise a few seconds after airliners pass overhead due to the speed of sound (1,100’/min.), and can guess their distance accordingly.)  I heard the engines of the airliners after they’d passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are near the Indianapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZID).  This did not resemble any airliner I’ve seen passing at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suspect that the orange &#34;light&#34; was due to sunlight reflecting off the fuselage, but sunset was at 20:05.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.

Lights shot up at tremendous speed distorting the lights into red streaks and disappearing.   Red streaks were not like a meteors or shooting stars.

PD))|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72176.html|461|ndxe200909| Two lights flying in loose formation disappear in sudden vertical climb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2125 Pacific Daylight Time, September 8, 2009, I was leaving a friends home walking to my truck.  I noticed two bright, -2 to -4 star-like objects in the western sky.  At first I thought they were stars but their obvious motion eliminated that possibility.  The second thought was that they were aircraft, possibly jetliners at high altitude.  But their apparent path, traveling from west to east eliminated that possibility as well.  (Commercial aircraft at altitude DO NOT normally travel from east to west over this area.  The normal path for commercial air traffic is north-south, generally traveling between the major west coast airports of Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Los Angeles.  Aircraft heading east from this area do so at lower altitudes taking off from the local airport the turning east.) 	Viewing conditions were clear, with no clouds.  The two lights were the brightest objects in the sky while they were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my friend over to view these objects and she was startled at their apparent motion across the night sky.  We thought they might be satellites but that was dispelled when the lead light changed course from a west-east direction to a north by northeast course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having had years of observing satellites, (I’m old enough to have seen Sputnik’s first crossing of the Pacific Northwest sky) the speed of these two lights was much faster than a normal satellite.  Their apparent altitude was within the atmosphere but very high up.  I say this because there was no “twinkle” as with the other star objects visible at the time of this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two lights were traveling at identical speeds.  The lead light was ahead and north of the second as viewed from the ground.  The first light passed in front of the Big Dipper.  The second light, from our viewing location passed below the Big Dipper and farther south than the first.  I would guess the observed separation to be between 40 to 60 degrees north to south and about the same west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the first light changed course it went vertical.  In less than ten seconds it disappeared from sight.  From our viewing point (I’ll send the actual Latitude and Longitude if you like) the first light disappeared just a little west of the constellation Cassiopeia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after the first one disappeared the second light changed course the same as the first.  Then it too went vertical and in less than ten seconds disappeared.  The second light followed the same vertical course as the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound accompanying these two lights.  We listened long and hard to try to hear the faintest of sounds but heard none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights might have been military aircraft but the vertical acceleration argues against that idea.  Also, for two military jets to go vertical at such velocity would have required a considerable burn from their engines.  No engine noise or glow was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the two lights went vertical they faded from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.

This was located near but not in the Big Dipper Constellation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the light for approximately 15 minutes and it appeared to be moving at a very slow pace.  It seemed to twinkle and emit a faint glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to use telephone wires to gauge how far it had moved. A jetliner was passing in the area and it was moving much faster that this object.  I don&#39;t believe it was the space station,  as it had already been by around 7:21 at 11 degrees and was not scheduled to make another pass in my area that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and about an hour later I came out, the light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not notice the light last night when I went out to try to find it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was it?<n>

I thought I was seeing things. But after watching enough ufo shows they told you what to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped dead in my tracks listend for sounds, other likes around the three bright ones and nothing out of the ordinary.  Until one of the lights broke formation behind the trees, but I didn&#39;t want to lose sight of the other two over my head.  One was following the other then started to go dark.  As for the other dark as well, then gone no sight.  I tried to find them.  This was my first light show and loved it.<n>

It seemed to be at a lower altitude and followed at a consistent distance to a smaller light the whole time.  My wife and I didn’t hear a sound. We watched planes at all altitudes all night and could even hear those at a very high altitude as I am in the outskirts of metro. It is dark and quiet. There were absolutely no other lights to these objects. No port starboard or marker lights of any kind. The brighter light was brighter than Mars and Jupiter and did not change in any way from the time we saw it till it disappeared. At first we thought a headlight on a plane however it went over and past us. It is not possible to see a light from behind a plane especially without a change in intensity and I am not an idiot. How could it be a three dimensional light and the object invisible? How could the light intensity not change in any way from horizon to horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD))<n>

When I first saw it I thought it was Venus but then I noticed it was following a dimmer light.  I watched as they flew north then gradually changed direction and started west to North Branch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The unusual part was the lack of blinking lights and It was bright as it was going away from me.

Became brighter.  &#34;Winked out&#34;,<n> <n><n> <n><n> While relaxing and sitting on the outside rear deck of our home, the sun was setting due west, I was looking towards the eastern horizon.  The sky was clear and I was enjoying the perfect evening and talking with my wife and at that moment I noticed a bright star or I thought was a star, moving very slowly up the eastern horizon.  As I continued to track its rise to a viewing angle of just about over our heads, tracking east to west, I tried to fix its position with the top of our table umbrella support to make sure it was not my head movement that was causing me to think it was a false sighting.  I wanted to confirm what I was seeing.   At that very moment the very bright yellow glow, stopped moving completely and remained very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I confirmed its position again and at the same time it moved from a stopped, motionless position and then moved left of its east to west track by 5 degrees, stopped again, and then moved 5 degrees to the right.  Tracking its rise from east to west, stopped over our heads, glowing, then moving north and then south and then moving back to where it’s original stopped position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point the glowing object, very round, got brighter and then it started to dim.  At that moment it produced 8 bright lights at its edges, aimed right at us and then &#34;winked out.&#34;   Absolutely no sound or noise of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very, very high altitude.  It disappeared completely.

The flight path for commercial jets heading east from Los Angeles International Airport is the same.  However, these objects made no sound, and shined with a steady white light.

Triangle was approx the size of 1 foot ball field and the craft was completely scilent hovering from east to west about 500 feet over our heads/camp. From the direction it was traveling it would not have gone over any major town. Speed of the Triangle was very slow. Our camp was about 4,817 feet elevation, Very flat land at this elevation.

Of course I advised that he report it to help support UFO investigations. He is not so good at typing so I had him tell his own words and I typed them out for him and continued to help him with this online report. As part of my own personal investigation I ask that you get in contact with me and let me know of any other sightings that may be related to my fathers Triangle sighting.

We observed it as a solid red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s motion was far slower than the aircraft flying in the area.  It appeared to change its velocity and direction.  It’s magnitude was approximately 1.5 and faded to a yellowish orange before disappearing.  Even while it was fading, it would brighten up at times to about 1.0 magnitude (as compared to the surrounding stars in the southern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possible night balloon?  Satellite would not have altered course and would not have reflected such a brilliant red.  Could be some sort of space junk or object recently sent up.<n>

Altitude approx 8800ft. GPS Coordinates are 37’ 10.216N and 106’ 26.579W.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were camped out in the national forest campground.  We were walking in the campground at approx 8:30PM.  Due the the canyon depth the sun is gone quite early.  However the stars were out and you could easily see the Milky Way and Venus just south of overhead.  The area is quite forested but I looked straight up and saw a bright white light approx 2x the brightness of Venus.  It was traveling west to east at high rate of speed but jerkily veering slightly north and south with each jerk.  It was gone over eastern canyon wall in approx. 20 seconds.  It dimmed slightly as it moved east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assumed that is was quite high and still reflecting sunlight.  But that is only an assumption.  We asked a gentleman also in the campground the next morning and he had seen it too.  But he saw as it came over the west canyon wall and till about straight up when he lost it due to the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound following as you would expect.  It was not a satellite, as we had watched one from north to south only a few minutes before.  Its as also silent (of course) but moved at about half the speed and much dimmer.  It’s path was smooth and steady as opposed the jerky slightly side to side movements of the light we are reporting. It did not move as fast as a meteor and it’s movement was erratic rather than steady.<n>

The light was longer than it was tall, had no tail and seemed to have a triangle shape or box shape with a point to the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to my husband and our guests.  No one could say what it was exactly.  It was not flashing or twinkling.  I only saw the white light, my husband saw a small red light on the top, I did not see a red light but the object seemed to have a glow about it almost as if it had a spotlight that it was using.  If it had a spotlight it was not a tight focused beam it was more of a broad subtle beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved across the sky from west to east.  There was no sound to it.  An airplane caught our attention from the north flying in a southwestern direction.  It had a flashing red light and a whitish, yellowish light and I can’t remember if it flashed.  It was obviously an airplane, you could hear the engine and see the typical flashing red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time you could see this other object, it was very different from the airplane, it was lower in the sky and we couldn’t hear it.  Any explanations?<n>

We found it strange that they emitted no noise.  Other cars stopped to observe this as well.  No one knew what these were.  They went out of site after a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was visible for perhaps a minute at most.  Magnitude was about the brilliance of Jupiter on clear night.  No navigation or strobe lights were visible when viewed through binoculars.  If the object were high enough to reflect sunlight, it would have to been at an extreme altitude as it was well past sunset.<n>

It didn&#39;t look like a helicopter or plane and it seemed to be traveling west at a decently fast speed. I pointed it out to my father who was in the front passenger seat(I was in the back seat) and he said that he saw it too and that it did not seem to take on the appearance of an airplane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we crossed over Rooster River (the border between Bridgeport and Fairfield) between exit 25 southbound and exit 24 southbound, we noticed that the object got larger and we could see it in more detail. It appeared to be over the general area of the CVS drug store on tunxis hill in fairfield from our point of view on I-95. We passed some trees just before exiting I-95 via exit 24 southbound and taking a right into the northern direction. When we got off I-95 just after our view being blocked by some trees to the left (north), we could not see the object anymore over tunxis hill, or in any direction for that matter. It seemed to have just disappeared, it was slightly cloudy so that could have been why we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the entire experience, at one point the object looked like it was moving at a high rate of speed, and at another point it looked like it was just hovering for a decently long period of time. Before out view got blocked near exit 24 southbound, the object was close enough to us where we could see it in enough detail to tell for sure that it was not an airplane and was not a helicopter. The object was just a small to medium sized circular light. The light was very bright just to say. and it looked almost as if the light was glossy or glistening in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was just before it got dark enough out to see stars, but not dark enough where we could see stars yet. It was still bright outside. This object also got larger as we neared it.<n>
9/7/09 18:45|Wausau|WI|Unknown|20 min.|object in sky over Wausau wisconsin, not a plane.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72126.html|501|ndxe200909| object in sky over Wausau wisconsin, not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a description of what I saw in the sky at around 6:30 to 7:00 p.m. on sept. 06 2009. I had walked outside to smoke a ciggeriate after dinner as I always do every night. The sky was totally clear of clouds, and as I looked up into the sky towards the northwest direction I noticed that in the distance was what looked like a very small wisp of a cloud. I looked at this for about 3 to 4 minutes and realized that this wasn’t a cloud and that this was a small con-trail and that the object was moving towards my direction. I grew up in SanAntonio Texas around a lot of different kinds of air traffic so I can pretty much determine what I am looking at when I see something in the sky. Whatever was in the sky on this day was no plane because planes leave a lingering con-trail. This trail did not linger, also this object was extremely high. I would estimate from my experience of watching aircraft in the sky that this object was above 75,000 ft. I know what planes! look like at a cursing altitude between 33,000 and 37,000 ft. this object was much higher and going very fast. As I watched the object it flew directly over my location, I heard no noise and could not determine the shape of the object because it was either too high or it was too small, but it was reflective and I could see a small object in front of the con-trail. This is where my story becomes interesting. As I tracked the object in the sky I thought it would just keep flying in the same direction but as the con-trail started to finally fade the object re-appeared moving in exactly the opposite direction within about 5 seconds. That is impossible to do with the type of technology that we have now. The object did not slow down and it did not make a wide sweeping turn as a jet would do. This object just did a 180 degree maneuver and proceed in another direction, and the whole time the con-trail stayed the same and did not linger in the sky as all other trails do. This trail! was completely gone and was very small in length. I ran into ! the apar tment and told my wife and she laughed at me for about 20 min. I then went back outside and looked in the same direction that I first looked in and the object was back almost exactly in the same position that it was in when I first saw it. I then went and got my wife and she saw it to, but this time the object was moving away from us and I could see it for a very long time. I don’t know what I saw but I do know that it was very high, going very fast and it was not an airplane, helicopter, weather balloon, or anything else I can think of. I have left my name and ph. # on your answering machine, please contact me about this matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THANK YOU<n>

I took a picture of a sailboat that was about 1/4 mile off shore.  The 1st picture I took on my digital camera had a Jet Ski in the front running in front, so I waited about 5 seconds and took another picture of this sailboat.  There were no other boats out that day around there.  I used the photo as &#34;wallpaper&#34; on my PC.  Then I happened to notice something creepy coming out of the water behind the sailboat.  There is even am upward spray of water.  It look like a UFO that is tilted on a slight upward direction.  Its oblong, darker on the bottom, lighter on top.  I dont know what I have caught on camera, but it was NOT a blimp or plane.  I didnt NOT make changes tothe picture.  I have made copies on a 8X10 and CD.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I usually chop these things up to a aircraft from the Westoveer base, but I seen it as clear as day and there is no way we can reach those speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling on 391 towards Springfield. I looked up in the sky and noticed a very bright light, it was blinking at first, I didn&#39;t think nothing of it because thats common to see here.  But when it stopped blinking then took off and in a split second it was gone. It was so fast my eyes could not keep up with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I seen was it just take off. It took off so fast I could no longer see it anywhere, and the sky&#39;s were clear, no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am scratching my head trying to think of a logical explanation and for the first time I don&#39;t have one.  I seen it so clearly it freaks me out.<n>

There was in overcast at the time So this object was under the clouds. After about 30 seconds The object turned and started moving SW away from the lake, as it was heading SW the object picked up speed and elevated in the clouds until it was out of sight.  Where I live I see planes and helicopters everyday due to my location being so close to an air base and a city airport and what i saw was definitely NOT a plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watch the sky at night a lot when outside and am a firm believer in Extraterrestrial life.<n>

I&#39;m not going to go into some long detailed story. This is what I saw. I was talking on the phone to a buddy of mine in DC. There was a little lighting going on so I decided to grab a lawn chair and sit in the entrance to my house.  As the clouds passed, I walked (as I usually do when I talk on the phone) around my drive-way.  As I was looking up at the sky I thought I saw one of those spot lights that business&#39;s use for grand openings and stuff.  As I continued to watch I didn&#39;t notice the beam of light going into the air.  I also noticed four objects about the size of quarter in the sky.  They circled around the part of the sky I was watching, and then collided together and spread apart again.  Almost looked like a game of pong or something.  Now granted there was a bit of lighting in the clouds...but this was not lightning.  I truly wish I could explain it better; it&#39;s something that I&#39;ve never seen. It had a certain tempo and pattern.  It lasted! maybe 15 minutes; four orbs of light circling around, coming together and splitting off; then starting the pattern all over.  Of course I continued to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How it ended:  All that happened was the three other &#34;strobes&#34; stopped. One other  light circled the sky for another couple of minutes.  And then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Folks, truly the weirdest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.  Since I ain&#39;t that smart this description of events doesn&#39;t do it justice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was looking at the stars because where I was there is not too much light pollution as to where I live at my moms.  So when I was looking at the stars I noticed 3 strobe like lights heading in a pattern.  3 were flying together and kept going around the sky twice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> after that they disappeared and they no longer were there the rest of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea where they went either, I didn&#39;t see them fly off or nothing and it was a cloudless night too.  It&#39;s a shame I did not have my camera, I also might add that 9/4/09 I saw an object in the daytime on a cloudless day it looked like a saucer and it was metallic looking but it was far away and I could not see it fully.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in the car at the time when we just pulled in the drive way but when I tried to get a better view of it and show my Dad and my brother it was gone.<n>

At times the changing color light stopped or was left behind and the blue light flashed a bright blue light kind of communicating with the changing colored light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then both moved up until disappearing into the sky. This is not the first time we see the lights but sometimes it&#39;s only one. They usually tend to appear after 10pm at night and come up from the same spot.<n>

I was going to run in and grab my camera but thought by the time I got back it would be gone…so I continued to watch as it started getting closer.  It seemed like it was right over my house.  I ran in to get my camera and came back out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still close enough to get a &#34;good&#34; picture but when I turned my camera on, the battery light was flashing. After about a minute, the red &#34;strobe&#34; had ascended to a barely visible sight, and, I&#39;d say, within a minute, the red “strobe” had ascended to a barely visible sight, and, I’d say, within a minute, the red strobe was gone.  I did manage to get my dying camera to snap a shot but all you can see is a red dot.  My friend snapped one on a camera phone, however, all you can see is a blob and a bright white line at the bottom of the frame. What is the bright light? We tried to reproduce it to no avail. It appeared to have a bottom, winged or firey top, and appeared closer than maybe it was (??).  Bright red, as if it were on fire or moving…like maybe there was a red firey gas in there.  OMG!<n>

When he got out front he told me to come out and see the lights moving around in the sky in the distance.  We watched them for about 10 minutes and got in the golf cart and tried to follow to see if there was an event or something in the area that would be shining spotlights in the sky...however there was no point of origin to the lights.  They were above the cloud cover so it seemed like we were seeing the reflection of the lights off the clouds.  There were 4 lights circling around, one seemed to be larger than the other three.  They would intersect at times but were going in a circular motion.  We watched for about an hour and then went home, keeping our eye on the lights.  When we got back to the house, they were still there.  We went inside and I kept checking now and then.  Finally when I checked at! around 11:30pm they were gone.  We wished we had seen how they left.  They stayed above the cloud cover, even though there were some clear spots in the sky, they would come just to the outside of the clouds.  My son tried to get some video of it, but we&#39;re not sure how good it came out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were amazed and stared at it as it came close to us, went over the top of us and moved to the northwest until we could no longer see it.  These are college-educated people with common sense and would like to know what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all agree on what it looked like with different ways to describe it.  First, it was orange in color with a fire or fire-like source of energy on the inside of this translucent object.  We all agree that it could be described as a small hot air balloon, jellyfish or Chinese lantern.  It was not a total sphere.  You could also describe it as a dome with a rounded top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no sound and traveled in a direct line from SE to NW at a swifter speed than the wind that came out of the east.  We were concerned that if there was fire inside, the hills could be burned if it floated down.  It did not come down, however, and continued at a constant altitude and speed until we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us have ever seen anything like it and are very interested to know what we saw.  We ruled out weather balloon because of the constant altitude and speed, or a hot air balloon because it didn’t appear to float with the air current and it moved too fast.  We thought of a drone but we heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My family and I (in all 12 people, 9 adults &amp; 3 children) were sitting out by the fireside no one drinking ...(yet).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were watching the fire and talking about all the things that a family talks about; when abruptly my brother says &#34;hay what is that &#34;? (being the prankster he has always been)  I thought I was going to turn and see something comical... when I turned I saw an object that was a red / Orange color, oscillating light moving across the crystal clear, calm, Moon lit night (winds aloft were out of the west as would become evident about 45 min. later when some Alto Cyrus clouds rolled in).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting looking to the North, He was to my right and looking West when he sighted the object which was tracking South to North, sort&#39;a following the lake shore. It came up from behind me and moved across the sky slightly west of our over head vantage-point. We all re-in-acted the event right away to get the length of time, we agreed that it took between 90-120 seconds to traverse the portion of the sky,  keeping in mind the trees behind and in front of us (his property is in a clearing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said right away &#34;this is not an asteroid or meteor because it was not moving east to west, but South to North&#34;.  Every one was taken &#34;a-back&#34; it appeared to have a constant oscillation, there was no erratic behavior about it as it moved silently across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is so hard to tell the altitude it was at, you know, is it slow small and low? or is it large fast and high? my guess is large, moderately fast and high it seemed to move slower than the Space Station... my daughter said she thought it was tumbling and that she could make out a dark shadowy &#34;organic shape&#34; to it, and the red orange light looked like the light from Tungsten lights she works with (I know that I focused on the direction and the light not looking at the whole object so much). My Brothers daughter took 4 pic&#39;s of the light on her camera phone, and I am going to forward them to whom ever I need to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light from the object sorta faded out kind of like it passed our field of view because as it faded I could see a gray shape that was still visible as it moved along.  I would say that it would be analogise to driving by a traffic light for parallel street with a crossing (only much larger, Much Larger!) with the Sun Screen (bonnet or hood... what ever you call it?) this would allow you to see a faint amount of light to an ever increasing amount then to it&#39;s zenith followed by an ever decreasing amount till it was no longer visible but you can still see the traffic light, all while oscillating.<n>

A sound file was there and produced a high pitched noise that someone edited to play at a lower pitch. Some say it was alien speech, and I decided to record it to my phone for a ringtone. At about 4 am we were about to go to sleep and I decided to play the sound. I then turned my phone off, only to see it display a white screen with red lettering on it saying &#34;Fatal Error&#34; and a strange code. It wouldn&#39;t respond to any buttons so I removed the battery and restarted the phone. It worked. Around 5:50 am I was trying to get some sleep when i noticed a bright white glow outside of the window, at around aprox. 5000 ft. I pointed it out to my friend who also saw it. The light seemed to fade and then get brighter for a minute or two, then it dimmed until it almost wasnt visible and plumeted to earth at an extremely high speed. ! After about 5 min, it was back and about 1000-2000 ft higher than it was the first time. The light on it seemed to be making a sweeping motion and lingered in the same spot for a few seconds before moving on to something else. The craft then seemed to get closer and we were able to see it had a saucer-like shape to it. Around 6:15 am we saw a faint beam coming down from the craft that didn&#39;t last for very long, and seemed to stop right above the treeline. I decided to play the sound I had recored to see if that did anything, and it appeared that it drew the craft a bit closer to where we were, before returning to it&#39;s original location. The object&#39;s lights faded until it wasnt visible for about 10 min, then it appeared about another 2000 ft higher than it&#39;s previous location. Then it started to slowly rise for about 20 minutes before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a very clear night, few clouds in the sky.  I was looking Southwest when I noticed a sudden burst of green light accompanied by movement coming down quickly in an arc motion, leaving a brief fluorescent green trail in its wake, then after dropping to its lowest point it suddenly leveled off, taking a direct western path and quickly was gone out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The “trail” was very brief and was similar to that of someone using a laser in a dark room, where the trails “linger” behind the motion to the human eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend was not looking in the same direction, however he caught the “burst” out of the corner of his eye and turned around wondering what it was as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have watched the skies over Miami for several years in the same location and this is the first time I have seen anything which appeared as reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was too far away to visually identify in any other way.<n>

With the help of my binoculars I saw what seemed to be round with my naked eye was actually triangle, although I couldn’t make out the shape, the lights on the spacecraft made it appear to be triangular. It had 4 or maybe 5 lights on it of which 1 kept blinking, it had a big light in the centre, 1 at the top &amp; two or three lights at the bottom ( of which 1 kept blinking as I mentioned ).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although it hovered in the far sky it kept moving randomly in the same area. To support my sighting I made a couple of video`s from my video camera which show clear proof of my sighting<n>

At first I thought I saw cold stars, as they apparently appear red in our night sky.  As I was driving, I would stare at them for as long and as often as I could.  I pulled over and noticed that 2 of the red lights had disappeared and one of which was moving around in a small circle.  I don&#39;t know what happened thereafter as I had to carry on driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I looked out my window (drivers side) I saw approximately five lights in the sky.  They seemed to be moving very slowly to the south.  From our perspective they seemed to be over LCI.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled over on the side of the road and rolled the window down.  The various lights would fade out and then fade back in.  The whole thing was very similar to the “Phoenix Lights”, except the lights were not in a straight line.  The light on the bottom of the group seemed to have sparks or something being ejected from the rear (side opposite the direction of travel), although it was not dramatically so and didn’t seem to show on any of the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the lights eventually faded out and the event was over.  The entire thing lasted about a minute, but I don’t know how long the lights were visible before we saw them.  The car in front of us has pulled over earlier, but I didn’t know why.  He must have seen them before me.  A lot of cars leaving the Cincinnati Outlet Mall should have been in a great position to see the event as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved through the sky in a pretty straight path though it did deviate from it&#39;s path slight at times. Twice, it quickly skipped forward at 45 degree angles. I will say that I saw the light three separate times so I have no way of knowing if it was the same light three times or individual lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a two separate airplanes in the sky during my sighting which gave a good point of reference. The planes had flashing lights and were much closer as the lights were much larger than the tiny points of moving lights that I saw. While the planes were clearly much closer, the light moved across the sky several times faster than the planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time I saw the light it was flying to the North through the sky and as it flew over my house, it slowed gradually as the light grew smaller until I could no longer see it. It gave the impression that it quickly angled upwards to an altitude at which the light could no longer be seen but I can&#39;t be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed, watching the sky, and 10 minutes later it reappeared in much the same way that it had disappeared, horizontally, further to the right going the opposite direction it had been going initially. It traveled across the sky going to the South in the same way as before and disappeared again exactly as it had the first time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5 minutes later, it reappeared the same way a third time further to the North, having changed directions to the North yet again. It traveled and disappeared in the same way again. I waited for 10 more minutes to see if it would return and I did not see it again. Each of the three sightings lasted approximately 15-25 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did see a small meteor though which was CLEARLY different; it was very bright and only visible for a fraction of a second.<n>

By the time they got to where we were, it was nearly out of sight, but a couple of them seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later (about 10pm) we were all sitting on the front porch of the camp talking, when my husband suddenly seen the SAME bright orange ball flying past again--same spot, same speed, same direction.  This time all 5 of us seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all ran out into the yard, one of the men ran out onto the dirt road to get a better look.  Every single one of us got a very clear view of it this time.  It was incredible!  We have NO CLUE what it could have been.  It was definitely not an airplane!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every time we all get together since then we all speculate as to what it could have been.  It makes for some very interesting discussions...<n> <n><n> <n><n> We weren&#39;t ever going to report this, because all of us are very normal, intelligent, everyday kind of people who tend to scoff at the wackos who report sightings, but then when we found this site today, trying to see if anyone else reported anything during that time-period, we were shocked to see that many people reported seeing the same object, around the same time-period, around the same general area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So here we are, for the first and maybe only time in our lives, reporting a sighting.<n>

In the sky to the north I noticed what looked like a small orange to red fireball.  This object moved toward the west at the rate of any normal passing airplane.  I ran after the orange glowing object for about one city block, as it would pass behind trees and houses.  Eventually it passed out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I had returned to my house and sat back down for about five to seven minutes, I saw a second, identical object moving along the same course.  I ran after this one as well, anticipating its course to get a better view.  As it moved into view I thought that it looked almost like it could have been a balloon that was somehow on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I reached the top of the hill, the highest elevation in town, my view could only be obstructed by trees and the nearby church steeple.  Two local acquaintances happened to be passing by on the sidewalk.  I told them to look at the object.  They could not identify it.  The three of us watched the object as it flew away toward the west.  Eventually, without altering course, the light of the object vanished and we could see nothing but stars in the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was calm.  There was absolutely no wind.  The sky was completely clear.  The moon was low in the eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved at the rate most any airplane would cross the sky, but the light from this aircraft was much larger than any of the small lights on normal planes.  Also, the object made absolutely no engine noise.  There was no sound at all.<n>

I got out of the vehicle and immediately got my family members out to watch this phenomenon with me.  When we got outside again, we looked over to the South and noted another one of these light orbs in the sky along with the previous.  They were now moving in a direction towards the west.  My guess of altitude would be below 1,000 feet.  The light was constant, non fluctuating, and almost looked like a source of light on the bottom of the object radiating upwards to the top.  There was no noise associated with it, and the movement was steady.  No trails were noted.  The first object moved to the west of the sky, and turned direction upwards, and slowly faded away, the second object then followed to the same area and disappeared slowly.  I then looked back at the origin poi! nt and noted a third light of the same exact description follow the same path and again disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in the approach path of the International airport, so I have been seeing and dealing with planes in the sky for all of my life, however this was not a plane and there were no identifier strobes seen.  This was not a flare either, as it had a more orange hue than a flare.  There were no sounds of fireworks in the area as well.  When I attempted to look through the binoculars, the objects were fuzzy and could not be focused on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed outside for a duration of ten more minutes after this event, and nothing else was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The path of these objects must have been a mile to three miles in length.<n>

Later confirmed by Terri XXXXXXX and Terry XXXXXXX after they had walked home up the adjacent street to our apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location: 36000 Jefferson, Harrison Township, MI   Weather conditions: Mostly clear sky with very lightly scattered clouds, not yet completely dark, full moon, about a 5 mph breeze, temperature about 65 F.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flight path: Based on the Google Earth grid line overlay, the object most like ly was moving in a East – Northeast direction. Approximate sighting start and end points are N42.5565/W82.840 and N42.5560/W82.8510, respectively. Observation point was N42.5610/W82.8470. The objects height was about 1500 ft., plus or minus 500 ft.  See the Google map below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object first appeared low on the horizon, over Lake St. Clair, coming towards me. It appeared to be a helicopter based on its speed and height. I could not see an aircraft, only a bright light which attracted my attention. The light emitted from the object was not bright enough to be a search light, such as those frequently seen in this area due the boaters on the lake and the nearby international border. Yet, the light was much brighter than an aircraft’s navigation lights, and not red or green, but orange-white, similar to a flare. See graphic representation no. 1.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object became closer, I expected to hear the sound of an aircraft, but there was none. The light became more orange, larger, and less bright. Sam, standing about 20 ft apart from me on his balcony said this was the second such object he had seen this night, the first going in the same direction, but much higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped just inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars that I use daily to observe happenings on the lake. Looking through these at the object, I could see the center of the object was bright orange, surrounded by a dark ring, which in turn was surrounded by a dimmer orange haze. These binoculars were in good condition and fairly clean, they never before produced a haze around a light source. The binoculars may not have been properly focused, which could have made the object appear to have a haze around it, but that would not explain the clearly defined dark ring around the bright center of the object. See graphic representation no. 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object with these binoculars as it moved over us for about 30 seconds. It began to slowly fade out. The object did not appear to ascend, nor change size. The objects speed did not change. The object did not approach any cloud, as I checked for this condition as I was losing sight of it. It just grew dimmer until it could not be seen, first by Sam, who didn’t have binoculars, then about 10 seconds later, by me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total observation time was about 90 seconds<n>

It made no noise that we could hear. None of us had ever seen anything like it and cannot come up with an explanation.   We have neighbors on the lake that we started to tell this too and they interjected with their own similar story from about 3 weekends ago.

He noticed other people looking up in the sky so it caught his attention.  The object was in the south eastern sky. It was not a plane or helicopter. The people I talked to who saw the object all agreed to that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was red in color and appeared to be bright, almost glowing on and off. It looked like it was fairly far up in the sky because a visible star or planet was just to the north of the object, so I kind of used that as a reference.  Another friend of mine who has his own local cable TV show was at my stand and he had his video camera with him because he tapes all of the street fairs in the area and shows the footage on his show.  He filmed about 30-60 seconds of the object and he zoomed in and out on the object and after watching the video replay on his camera, when he zoomed in on the object, it appeared to be white in color.  He has promised to give me a DVD copy of the footage which I will gladly mail you if you’d like. I should be getting the DVD over the weekend. Please let me know if you would like a mailed copy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe it was a weather balloon or flare or prank by someone but I’ve been an advent sky watcher for UFO’s and this is the first time I can actually say that I saw a UFO. I’m not saying that it was a space ship, but no way was it a plane. The object eventually seemed to fade away and get smaller and then a cloud moved in front of it and it was gone.  The reason why I say it could have been a flare is because about six months ago, reports were all over the Star Ledger (Major New jersey newspaper) about red lights in the Morris County sky (I live in Morris County) and the sightings occurred on multiple nights and were compared to flares. If you Google “red lights over Morris County NJ”, you may see the articles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a grown man and would never waste my time with a bull shit story and as previously mentioned, I’ve always been fascinated with UFO’s ever since I bought a book in the 1970’s titled “Is something up there”  I would very much like to hear what you have to say about my sighting.  Right after the event, I called a New York radio station to see if they had any reports of flying saucers in the area and they said no.  Since the object was over the south east sky, it probably could be seen over New York City.<n>

We had just gotten off the River Boat Dinner Cruise headed back to our Hotel room at the Radisson.  As we were walking in Riverside Park along the Mississippi River I was taking pictures. The sun was just setting for the evening.  I had snapped a few pictures of the sunset and some of my family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came upon this beautiful bronze sculpture of a playful young boy &amp; girl.  I took a picture with my Canon Power Shot digital camera.  I was not using the view finder, instead I was using the digital screen.  My boyfriends sister was standing right next to me at the time.  An extremely bright light just above the trees in the eastern night sky appeared on the screen along with the bronze sculpture.  We immediately took our eyes off the camera screen to see what was in the sky, but nothing was there.  My boyfriend thought that it was the flash from the camera.  Within seconds I took another picture, using the same camera and setting. Absolutely no light or flash in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s appeared at first to be a six pointed star shape, but after some thought I believe it could have been a horizontal oval shape.  The shutter could have stayed open for a second or two and I maybe caught on camera it changing from horizontal to vertical and then disappearing before our eyes.<n>

9/5/09 04:30|Spokane (near)|WA|Other|30 minutes|My wife, son and myself were going to Spokane Washington to look at some houses that we were going to buy during the first week of this|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72664.html|539|ndxe200909| My wife, son and myself were going to Spokane Washington to look at some houses that we were going to buy during the first week of this Sept. 2009. We decided to drive all night because we have a disabled son that has a late schedule. Twenty miles out from Spokane on HWY 90 east around 4:30am we encountered several sparklers like things hovering over our car just off the right side of the windshield. I noticed that they were pacing our car as we drove. I felt like I was being hypnotized by the sparklers like objects. I noticed my wife and son staring at it and not saying a word about what was happening. I thought this was some kind of warning and felt very scared that something was going to happen to us. I was afraid to stop so I lowered my speed and shielded my eyes so I could not see them. By doing so I felt like I was not being affected by the attempt by them to hypnotized me. I was scared at this point and yelled out to my wife, &#34;Is it trying to hypnotiz! ed you, is it a warning of some kind.&#34; Cathy finally said something like &#34;I don&#39;t know what do they want?&#34; I kept looking down at the time and it didn&#39;t seem like it was changing even after a very long time and miles had past. I was thinking they wanted to hurt us or do something to the road ahead to hurt us. Each time I took my hand down from shielding my eyes I felt again they were trying to hypnotize me, like I was blacking out and not in control. I remember cars and trucks passing in the other direction and honking there horns at us as if they were seeing these things over our car. We begin praying and saying the lords prayer, it seem as if I could not think as if my mind went blank and I could not remember even what was happening to us and even what these things looked like. I had to put a memory into my head what they looked like or I think I wouldn&#39;t remember what they looked like. I remember saying to Cathy they look like giant sparklers at the same time she said it! . I thought they had gone away but they must have just moved a! way for a short time because I noticed they were back and I remember saying to Cathy no they are still here, don&#39;t look at them. She noticed my speed had dropped to 40 miles an hour in a 70 miles an hour zone and she told me to speed up or we were going to be hit from behind. Soon after that they left. I think that they tried to abduct us but were not able to because of the medication I take for depression. (Zoloft) I feel if I had not taken this medication that night we would of for sure been abducted by these strange devices that hovered over our car for such a long time that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 500 Lights On Object0: Yes<n>

Saw huge array of orange lights over I-95, and another bright white light to the west.  The white &#34;object&#34; seemed to twinkle like a star but zooming in with a 20x camera I could see it had multiple parts so this was not a star. There was a large part with 2 smaller parts separated but close to it, these smaller parts seemed to move away from the large part, then return (I think that is the reason for the twinkle effect).  The orange looking &#34;array&#34; kept moving to the North but slowly, and always kept it&#39;s same configuration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were visible from 4:30am to 5:15 am.  Video was taken at high zoom and some clear images were obtained for a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects seemed to be just moving North very slowly and made no sudden moves or speed changes.  I would estimate people from northern MD to NY could have seen this, but I have seen no reports on the news as of today (9/6/09).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were some clouds in the sky and a full moon was behind me as I traveled north.  I wish I had thought to get my camera out sooner as the orange object(s) were huge when first seen.  When I did manage to snap pics distance became a factor. I the orange array was the Goodyear Blimp, I&#39;d say it was 2 miles in front of me when first seen, maybe 10 miles out when filmed. The white array, which I thought at first was Venus or a star, always &#34;seemed&#34; to be 20 miles or maybe thousands of miles away, and never seemed to get closer or farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the naked eye, I would have to conclude the white thingy was a star, but after looking at the video I have to rule that out.  Naked eye on the orange &#34;array&#34; was never thought to be anything other than an array of dim, orange-ish lights grouped together.<n>

We looked out to the north when the other person noticed a glowing red object moving across the sky from the north to the south.  The object can best be described as the size and brightness of Jupiter but red.  The light also seemed to fade in and out at times slowly, not like the strobe light on a airplane.  We stood there for between 30 seconds to a minute while the object continued on its southerly path, until it turned towards the west and within a few seconds was gone.  I can say that from seeing numerous airplanes at night, it looked nothing like what a airplane does at night(with the lights, etc).<n>

There must have been aproximately 6 orange lights in the top series and at least 10 orange lights in the bottom series. The lights either merged or one got behind the other and the lights began moving eastward and appeared to rise and disappeared in the eastern sky. I can best describe the orange lights as if one was observing a cruise ship out at sea and could just see the port holes on the side of the ship in the darkness. I noted in a web search that similar lights were observed - among other locations - in Rockford, Illinois - about 65 miles east of Apple River, Illinos. It felt good to get a confirmation of my sighting as this never happened to me prior to this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the dusk tonight we observed and captured on video initially one then rapidly a number of bright sparkling lights appeared from nowhere in the sky that moved randomly across the sky and against the prevailing wind direction.  You could describe these as fireworks they were so close to the ground but fireworks certainly dont go up, then down then sideways then float then up again or left, followed by hiding behind a tree then back out again.  They went from being visible to invisible and back again.  Never seen anything like it.  We captured them on video.

The sky was very clear, no clouds and no fog.  My friend and I were talking face to face and a bright light lit up in the sky behind him.  I glanced over to see what it was and I saw an object in the sky about 2-3 inches wide from where I was standing... not too sure how far it actually was though.  If I had to guess I would say possibly 20 miles north and lower then an airplane flying in the sky.  It had a few VERY intense lights underneath it that I seemed to have felt the heat from... it was very faint, not enough for my friend to feel it, but I completely felt it get slightly warmer.  The same warm feeling as if someone were to turn an intense spotlight on you.  The UFO was traveling extremely smoothly at a very slight angle (maybe 15 degrees or so) up toward the sky for about 3 or 4 seconds, then all of the lights turned off, my eyes adjusted from the intense lights going off, and the ob! ject was completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend saw my expression change in my face and turned around to see what I was looking at, but when he turned around he only turned enough to see into the apartment next to us.  He thought I was looking at something in the apartment so he didn&#39;t turn around all the way enough to see the craft.

The same &#34;star&#34; that shines brightest, near the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seriously, I live in Tampa Florida. Please walk outside and see if you see this for yourself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have captured it on digital film, without a flash and you can clearly see erratic movement patterns.

Also,included are contrast shots including stationary buildings and the moon for a point of reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHAT ARE YALL&#39;S THOUGHTS ON THIS? The bright star, near the moon, ... it&#39;s moving! (though mostly stationary) but absolutely moving unlike anything of OUR technology!!!  And no, it is not a satellite, or space probe. We lack the jet propulsionary capabilities for maneuvers like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> View these photographs on photobucket @ www.photobucket.com/UFOTAMPA<n>

I leaned back in my chair and as I looked up and North a meteor shot down from high above and then to my surprise stopped dead above the Rupp Arena it had several lights but immediately turned them off and began to move in a straight line over the city towards Leestown Rd../ Georgetown Rd. area.  Could still see it from the city lights for just a few moments as it moved off but couldn&#39;t make out a clear shape.  Seen the same entry style with a triangular craft with orange lights on the bottom in Seattle a couple years ago.  I want to know what they are.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One of the persons in the party asked me if a light in the sky was a meteor; I looked up and saw a bright light and said no, because a meteor would have been streaking across the sky and this was stationary.  I then went back to digging out my MRE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later someone else in the part said it might be a satellite because it was moving.  I looked again and verified that it was moving and likely was a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes later the second person pointed out the same light again at which point I looked up and it was still in the same area of the sky but was no longer moving, and could not be a satellite as far as I could tell.  I then began watching the light, which remained stationary for several seconds and then started moving in a corkscrew fashion.  To be sure that I wasn&#39;t seeing things, I asked the rest of the party to look at it at which point the person who originally observed the light said it has been moving on and off since he asked about it the first time and validated that it was currently moving in the corkscrew fashion that I was observing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we all laid down on the hillside and watched the light, which was moving in alternate corkscrew and fishook patterns, and also randomly moved quickly across the sky in straight lines, while making 90-degree direction changes as well as reversing instantly.  All four of us observed identical behavior, and we soon found a second light to the west performing similar behavior.  As it was still just past dusk and there was a full moon, the only other objects visible in the sky were the moon and Jupiter(?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch these lights as other stars appeared in the sky for the next hour or so, and validated that they were moving in relation to each other and the stars.  Given that we could not determine how high or how big these objects were, it was not possible to tell how fast they were moving, but the instantaneous changes in direction were strong indicators that they were not satellites or the ISS.  To the naked eye they appeared to move at about the same speed as a satellite for 3-5 seconds before changing direction.  Both objects never left the general areas of the sky (almost straight above us and East of us towards the rising moon respectively) and eventually we got cold and hungry and went on about getting dinner and going to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sept. 6th from my home in Wasilla I again looked the general area of the sky at around 10:00pm just after dusk and did not see either object present, nor any other objects moving around in odd patterns although I did see several meteors and satellites over the next hour, again confirming what we saw did not resemble either in the least.<n>

I was facing north east when over the top of the building I was sitting in front of one craft passed over and then a second at under 1000 ft, judging from their size.  There was no discernible afterburner glow despite the sound.  Then on the underside of the craft there were three distinguishable round lights on each of the three corners of them!  Those lights were yellow, blue, green and unlike anything I have observed on any aircraft I have ever seen.  They appeared to be about the size of fighters, but flowed very smoothly in a modified V formation with the first craft on point and the second one on its left wing or side.  I could not see any wings and they sped out of sight doing a slow roll to the left!  A few minutes later sitting there wondering about what happened so fast a conventional pro! p driven craft could be heard going east at a much higher altitude which made me wonder is there an airshow going on in Columbus for the Labor Day weekend?   But, the two craft were not like anything I have ever seen.  I would compare them to the picture taken in Waubena, Wisconsin several years ago of a similar craft photoed through the trees by someone with the same three lights on the underside, which seemed to ba about the same size and shape!<n>

I observed a fast moving flying object moving diagonally actross the sky upward from southwesterly direction to the northwestern going into the cloud layer which then blocked its sight. I was only able to see it for maybe 15 seconds as it was moving extremely fast. i live near the coast but the object was flying over land not the ocean while in view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The oject was a glowing cigar shape a bright yellow in the middle portion and glowing green at tapered ends. The glow did not blink or change direction or leave any trails, going into the clouds and behind them. There was no sound wjile the object was in my view. The time is approximate as i did not go inside to check the time but sat out quite awhile in case there was more to see or some indication of its source. I am more of a skeptic than a believer, curious if anyone else saw the object, or knows of any logical explanation<n>

As a mechanical engineer, and a long-term skeptic, I promptly rushed to her aide, understanding that she was entranced by satellites or mesmerized by underlit bats.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Much to my surprise, at my arrival at SunTrust plaza, located at Peachtree &amp; Baker, I watched as what appeared to be stars swirled and danced, diving into one another, playing in my indigo southern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights that differed from stars only in their locomotion and lack of twinkling, were clearly above the cloud level, as they frequently would dim or disappear behind the occasional lazily passing cumulus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can find no rational explanation for these playful sources of lumination.  From aircraft to projections, from critters to carefully-mounted LEDs, my scientific mind boggles at the concept.  They would rush from one end of the sky to the other in seconds, turn back, swirl curved paths, and even hover on the spot.<n>

It disappeared 1 1/2 hours later. Completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all, at the time of this sighting I was not under the effects of drugs or alcohol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:07 PM (21:07) at the Ford Forestry Center in Alberta (L&#39;Anse), MI, I was standing outside talking on a cell phone when I looked up to see what I suspected was a satellite.  Seeing satellites was extremely common place in Alberta, as the light pollution is very low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the satellite, it drifted across the sky at what seemed like a much slower pace then any satellite I&#39;d ever see had.  The object traveled roughly 1/4 of the visible sky.  As I watched, it came to a dead stop at a heading of southeast (I had a suunto compass readily available).  It then split into two separate white lights, much like stars and then re-merged together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not believing what I was seeing, I ran to one of my friends dorm room window and knocked on the window of one of my dorm mates.  I told her and every one else to come out and look at the star.  Her and 5 other of our class men came out and begin looking at the object, which swayed slowly back and forth, much like a pendulum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for a while until the object settled on a southeast heading and remained perfectly stationary.  We all wrote it off to our mind playing tricks on us, and it must be a normal star just flickering or giving the appearance of moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all went back inside, but at this point I&#39;d become suspicious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Roughly an hour and a half after we first saw the object, I went back looking for it in the sky.  It had completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my friend out of her room again and she too confirmed the object where we&#39;d been looking earlier was gone.  I did not get any pictures or videos of this happening since it was so slow in happening and I couldn&#39;t decide if I was seeing something noteworthy or average.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking back, there may have not been aliens, but there was something extremely unusual.<n>

The sun was setting so I was staring at the horizon enjoying the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what appeared to be a very large star on the southwest horizon.  I pointed it out to my boyfriend who said it seemed too large to be a star.  We considered it might be a plane, though the light was consistently a glaring white and it appeared to be stationary.  We also discussed the possibility that it was Venus, though it was still light enough outside  I didn&#39;t believe Venus could shine that brightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object for almost 10 minutes, the light never varied in intensity, it didn&#39;t appear to move, and slowly my boyfriend lost interest.  He turned away from the edge of his deck to face me.  As he turned around, the object made a swift and increadibly unexpexted swoop to the north.  Flying faster than any commercial aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen, the object vanished behind trees to the north within seconds.  There appeared to be solid red lights on the object from this angle.  I caught my boyfriend&#39;s attention just in time for him to catch the object&#39;s departure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both amazed and shocked by what we had witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

We were running late, so I kept checking the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:55, my son shouted, &#34;Mama, a UFO!&#34;   I looked to my left and saw what appeared to be a small passenger plane coming in for a landing.  I asked &#34;Are you sure?  It looks like a plane.&#34;   He said &#34;No, it was turning in circles.&#34;   I looked again and was about to tell him that I thought it was a plane, when it halted in mid-air and moved in the opposite direction.   We were stopped at a red light on an overpass, and we both watched it as it moved from a northerly direction to a southerly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a closer look at it and realized that my initial impression of the craft was wrong, there were no wings, windows or tail like a small plane.  It was bright silver and it gleamed in the sunlight.  It was a very clear day with a bright blue sky, and the craft was shaped like a cigar.  From my perspective, it moved over Route 22, and! it seemed to be very maneuverable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son was excited, and when traffic began to move again, he gave me updates as to what the craft was doing.  Unfortunately, there was no good place for me to pull over, and I had no camera on me, so I just continued driving him to school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He yelled &#34;It&#39;s getting bigger,&#34; &#34;It&#39;s changing shape,&#34;  and &#34;It cloaked!  It cloaked!&#34; but I cannot confirm this, since I would have had to turn around in the drivers seat in order to observe it again.<n>

The object if you could call it one had a trail behind it roughly a few hundred feet.  The thing I saw is kind of hard to describe.  The front of the object, (assuming the front was pointing to the direction it was traveling), had a copper like glow emitting from it and the trail behind it had the same glow just less intense.  I tracked the object as it went from east to west until I lost view of it.  I do not believe what I saw is extraterrestial but a military cloaking plane on a test run.  This is the second time I have seen this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first was a few months back but in Stockton, CA.  Same description.<n>

I looked above me in the direction of NW and witnessed a brilliant flash of light in the sky.  The thing that struck me odd about it was that there was nothing overhead in that area (no hill, building, lights, ect), and the flash seemed somewhat concentrated in that it didn&#39;t seem to spread out far across the sky to my sides or behind to my knowledge.  I will note that no alcohol had been consumed that night, and I do not ever partake of any drugs.  There was some rattling of metal type noises in the distance directly after this flash, but I think that would more likely be attributed to nearby apts or college students out late at night in my opinion.  I didn&#39;t think too much of this until I got a text from my girlfriend who was in bed and was worried when her window facing NW got bright and she thought someone might be out! side or something.  Her apartment was a good 100 meters to the East of where I was standing when I saw the flash from the NW. I figured I should at least look into it by filling out a report.  I will note that I didn&#39;t see anything I would describe as a &#34;craft&#34; or &#34;object&#34;.  All I witnessed was a brilliant flash of light in the sky that reason couldn&#39;t explain.  I was wondering if there were any types of solar events or something else natural that could explain this sight.<n>

I say &#34;strange&#34; because neither of us had ever seen anything like it before.  It was significantly bigger than a typical airplane or helicopter light; it was amber orange in color; it was very bright in the cloudless sky, even with the full moon; it did not have a well-defined outline &amp;#8211; more like a flaring ball of plasma than a solid circle; it was a steady light, with no flashing or strobing.  The speed seemed to be about the speed of an airplane. When we first looked up, we were afraid because we thought a plane was on fire.  But it was traveling in a deliberate, straight line, going in a SW direction, approximately 45 degrees up from the ground.  We could not discern how high up it was but the size made us think it must not have been at a high altitude.  We heard no noise from the object.  It never veered from its course but c! ontinued on in the same direction the whole time.  At some point, our vision was obscured by trees in the distance, but the object did not reappear from out of the line of distant trees.  It seemed to have disappeared.  We looked for it for a long time afterward but saw nothing.  At the point where it had been obscured by the trees, it was still visibly large to us, so we doubt that it simply got too small to see in that short a time.  The entire sighting took several minutes as it went from the NE sky (where we first spotted it) to the SW where it seemed to have disappeared after our vision was blocked by the tall, distant trees.  We saw airplanes flying over the same general area both before and after we saw the amber light.  Seeing them right after the amber light confirmed to us how different they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

There were actually clouds/smoke and you could see the lights go through the clouds/smoke, meandering back and forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a kite going back and forth with 5 lights shining and then 3 as it turned (hiding the other 2).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it was over LAX, but it really went straight up into the air getting smaller and smaller, so it could not have been a plane.

At first I thought it was a falling star but I noticed it was way to bright to be on, when my eyes caught up to it I noticed it was probably only a few thousand feet in the air and it was not traveling in a straight line but a real faint swerving motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not descending nor elevating but traveling straight across the sky south to southeast , the object was traveling at such a tremedous speed I had never seen anything move that fast other than maybe a shooting star across the sky.  I caught the ball of light for only 3 to 5 seconds as it faded in and out then disappeared in thin air the closer it got to the moon.  The moon was very bright , almost a full moon with no clouds in the sky .<n>

It was around 9:30 pm, a little later than our usual time.  The moon was almost full and very bright, the skies were perfectly clear and very low humidity for us here in Louisiana. Jupiter was bright and almost parallel at the time we were looking up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were about to give up and go inside when I caught a glimpse of something that I first thought was a shooting star. I quickly pointed at it and told the wife to look before it faded away. But, it did not fade away.  I then though it was one of the plentiful White Cranes we have here in Louisiana, but I quickly realized it was not flapping any wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I started asking each other what is that?  The object appeared to be a large wing shape and white, and had sort of a faint glow as if light was reflecting off of it. It was moving at a very fast speed, coming from the east headed directly west. It did not very the speed, or waiver off of its direct course. We were able to view it until it just faded in the west sky. We were both stunned at what we just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We love to star gaze and watch for meteors and satellites, and I&#39;m an avid NASA site watcher and I always know when the ISS or Shuttle are in viewing range, and we watch it every chance we have. But this was so different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stood there reflecting on what just happened, we started re-playing it out loud to each other, trying to make a logical explanation of what it could have been, either a plan, a bird, whatever, but we were completely puzzled and amazed..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here are some details that we recalled and discussed that really made this sighting even more mysterious to us. When it first appeared over the house it was already visible. The moon was very bright so if it was a low flying object it would not have been reflecting the moon light from the bottom, which made it appear to be glowing from within itself. It was not a bird because the wings never moved, it was moving very fast (faster moving than the ISS sightings) and it never fluttered or altered from its direct line of flight. It made absolutely no sound. There were no white, red, green, or blinking lights on it. We live in the flight pattern to the airport just 10 miles away, so we are very familiar with what aircraft looks like on its approach. When it faded from view, it was some where around 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon in the west sky, and I know from my many years of keeping up with the ISS, it would never be moving from east to west. Also, if it would have been a ! low flying object, it would have disappeared due to obstructions such as houses in the neighbor hood or the trees in the woods just west of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, since after nearly 50 years of looking at the skies, and since this was the first time I ever saw anything I could not apply logic to, I felt I needed to write this down, share it, and hope to find out if anyone else saw it, or anything similar to it. I would love it if someone could explain what it was.<n>

My eyes scanned for where it was coming from and I found something in the Southern sky approximately 20 degrees from the plain of the horizon.  The object appeared to be moving West at a high rate of speed, in an instant it was moving East at a similar speed. It was a red dot bluish-purple hue emanating from the back of it.  The object then jutted back in a Western direction for a moment followed yet another direction change which appeared to be straight up for about 5 seconds, then West again. After this the rumble disappeared and it circled South-East and I lost it behind some trees.<n>

It was just sitting in the sky and was not moving for over two hours and now at 10:24 pm it banked to the left and flew towards the South at a very fast speed.<n>

I pointed it out to my family, and told them, let&#39;s go, get me home, I need to get my camera! It only took us less than 3 min to get home. My daughter ran in and got the camera as I stood with my younger daughter out front the house watching these things moving along the same path rather slowly, there was low lying small puffy clouds, we could watch them move.  At one point after the flash of the camera went off all of a sudden there was one that got really bright, then faded completely,they were heading south directly over head, down what is considered the I-5corridor.  Higher than I see planes travel lower than the stars yet the stars where just starting to appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched  these numerous lights flowing through the sky, none however seemed to be in the part of the sky with out the clouds.  I was able to capture a few with my digital camera. When zoomed in on two different frames I shot, there was two object that had numerous lights around what looked like the mid section, the lights appear to look greenish in color with a red light directly center on the top, where the top light was in relation the the green lights gave it the appearance of the classic saucer shape,  the larger of the two object I also was able to pick up lights in the center directly below the center lights, in this same frame I also captured another object flying below the larger object.  It appeared to be smaller and more triangular with the point heading south and what looked like bright lights coming off the back like after burners.  There was no sound that we could hear, I have never seen this many planes in the same space of sky flying in the same direction a! s these where.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also took a shot toward the moon where the sky was clear without clouds, when I zoomed in on the photo frame I brought up a number of objects some looking like orbs, yet one was brighter and as I zoomed in further it was like none of the others I captured, it had roundness to it at first due to the glow of its lights that went all the way around, yet as I zoomed in further it had a number of points 3 to the back and a square outline to the sides that came around to the front with a few more points 2 to the front and a long point in the middle of those 2 points, the direction it was moving, seemed to be northwest from the southeast sky, the lights on it appeared to be white and the middle underside was dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to get my camera to try and capture what was passing over head after seeing some photos a friend had captured, here in the area over the past few months.<n>

We did not see this thing, we have no memory of it, our stomachs hurt real bad the next morning. We went back out, this time taking a tape recorder with us, lost the time again, again had strange pictures, and this time on the tape player were two other male voices saying &#34;recon&#34; &#34; their ready now&#34; and a few other choice things. A few minutes later we start the car and pick up our conversation where it ended. We went down some other country roads, and Lori has the memory of seeing a robot behind a fence. There was a rod that came down to the car with a blue light on the end. We have lost time, have felt ill and have no memory of seeing the images on these pictures. We found sev! eral other pictures on another highway that could indicate some kind of craft down the road moving toward us.<n>

When I proceeded to see 4 lights close to each other.  After further observation it would drop to 1 light or 2 lights then back to 4.  They were in a parallel up and down shape which is very hard to explain and they were very very close together.  They were at a stand still for about 30 minutes and i looked away for a split second and they had disappeared.  After they disappeared they were not spotted again.<n>
9/2/09 12:05|Charlotte|NC|Sphere|5 minutes|Bright, spherical object flying over Charlotte, NC|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72025.html|581|ndxe200909| Bright, spherical object flying over Charlotte, NC<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside in a small park called The Green, located at 400 South Tryon Street in the middle of downtown Charlotte, NC, when I witnessed a single sphere flying in the sky approximately three miles south of my location, and approximately 2000 feet high.  The object was round and either white or silver in color.  It was quite far away, and very small, but definitely visible as the sun was positioned in the northeast sky and so was reflecting very well off the object.  The sky was filled with lots of clouds, but with much blue sky in between.  The day was bright and quite windy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed the orb moving in a straight horizontal line across the sky from northwest to southeast.  Given the proximity to Charlotte Douglas International Airport we see airplanes in the sky all the time, and initially I assumed that was the case here.  But the object did not look like a plane, even from a distance.  It was definitely round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within one minute of my first noticing the object, it slowed, then came to a complete stop. It hovered for a moment, then slowly descended.  I can only guess at the distance of the descent, but it must have been at least a couple hundred feet.  It was a smooth, seemingly controlled, descent that took less than one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object hovered again for a couple of minutes.  It was not entirely stationary, rather it moved around a little bit, perhaps just moving with the wind.  It was very windy on the ground, so it was probably even more so up in the sky where the object was.  Even so, all of the movement I saw seemed very controlled and stable, not as though it were just a balloon being blown around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this, the object started rising.  It rose back to its original height, in a mostly straight line, but now it was also moving south - away from me.  The object continued to rise while moving south for about 2 more minutes until I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The obvious conclusion is that this was just a balloon being driven by strong winds. And it may have been.  But the object was very visible even though it was very small and far away.   Perhaps a mylar balloon would have this effect, especially with the sun being opposite in the sky.  But given the distance it was from me, I really think the object was much larger than a balloon otherwise I would never have been able to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the movements seemed very controlled; it was not being whipped about.  It&#39;s path may have been affected by the wind, but given that it initially was going in a straight line, slowed, stopped, descended, stopped then ascended in a uniform manner it just did not at all appear to be a balloon.<n>

He got out of his car and told me to fallow him down to the street corner. We walked down to the corner and there it was a bluish white ball of light moving around slowly by the moon. My family member went to get another family member as I stood there watching the u.f.o.   They got back to where I was.  I called my bubby to tell him to come outside and look at the sky. He saw the craft moving as well. We then went back inside.  About an hour later my family member decided to go back out to look at it some more I fallowed him out and this time we saw two.  One was flying over head at a tremendous speed.  The other was moving in the opposite direction at a much slower speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I continued to watch the light for several more minutes while I finished my cigarette and after I was done smoking I went inside. A few minutes later, no more than 5 minutes, I remembered that I had left my Mountain Dew out on the balcony so I went out to get it. When I was outside I looked back up in the sky to see if I could find the light again and it had disappeared. I did not think anything of it until the next day and I began to wonder if I had seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Ball State student from South Bend and I have seen thousands of planes come in for landings at the South Bend airport because my house is only a few miles away but this was bigger and did not look like any plane I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have some fear in writing this, why, I don’t know.  I seen something very strange years ago when I was about 18 years old. I was already married and had taken our dog for a walk around our neighborhood.  I was rounding the last curve on our road before our house when I happened to glance back over my shoulder ( because my German Shepherd was lagging behind a little) and I seen something in the sky.  What I seen I am still not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed what seemed to be a white cloud forming very low in the sky not far from me. It was expanding at such a fast rate I knew it couldn’t be a normal cloud. I became fearful and starting looking around to see if anybody was outside and seeing this as well. Of course like all good stories no one was to be found. I then began to notice what seemed to be lights inside the cloud moving around, almost like big spot lights on a helicopter. I was so scared, but I couldn’t move , I was frozen with fear and wonderment. I just could not figure it out. The thing that scared me the most….no sound! No sound at all! How could a helicopter spray expanding foam clouds in the air to hide in and suddenly appear out of no where without any warning sound of it’s approach or the propellers disturbing the sprayed foam clouds? This was my thinking while this was taking place…How? Just as quickly as it appeared, the lights stopped and the expanding cloud began to do the opposite and rol! l back into nothing at all. What I seen that day I truly don’t know, but I think about it all the time. When I got back home and told my husband, I got that you must be crazy look from him…. that scared me too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now in my thirties and have children. I am no longer married to my former husband but I don’t think that my “experience” had anything to do with it. I have tried to put what happened on that day behind me over the years. I have told the story a few times. But for the most part I have dismissed it as explainable some how, until about two years ago when I could no longer deny “things”. I just want to say that I am a normal person with a normal family. I don’t understand what has happened and I’m tired of being scared to talk about things. I feel like I am going to go crazy if I have to keep denying  that it happened. That’s why I have decided to “open up” about whatever this is or was…I’m not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My thirteen year old daughter and I went to our local Walmart one evening. My second husband was fixing the kitchen sink when we left. When we returned home about 9:00pm we pulled in the driveway which is long ( I now live in a more rural location) and we both immediately seen something over our house. As we got closer I couldn’t believe my eyes, I wasn’t sure what I was looking at. It was three big bright lights almost like big headlights right over the roofline of my house. They were stationary at first and I remember asking my daughter if she was seeing what I was seeing. To my horror she said…yes. We were frozen for a moment, all of a sudden what I thought was one big thing turned out to be three smaller things because they started to hover away in different directions. I got out of the car real quick with my daughter  on my heels. I wanted my husband to see this too. I ran in and hurried him outside only to find them gone except one light between the neighbors house an! d our’s which was hard to make out for sure because of all the trees. In any case that light has not been seen there since he will tell you. My daughter joined us in the yard with a aluminum foil hat she quickly fashioned (so they could not read her thoughts) and once again I was left with this “baggage”. I was angry. Why I got in the car and tried to find it again I don’t know. I just needed some answers. I was unable to find the mysterious lights that haunt my life, and of course the neighbors couldn’t see the lights in their yard. It is now a joke that they love to throw out there every chance they get, and I laugh of course, what else can I do?  	But the fact that my daughter was involved in the second “experience” leads me down the road I find myself on. She talks about it all the time desperate to let it not be forgotten. It has awakened a curiosity in her that I cannot deny her. “It was real, we did see something didn’t we mom?” The sad thing is her father my first husband does not believe her. So she is doomed to the same fate as me “crazy” . The difference is that I was there to, so she will always have somebody to talk to that believes her. I wish someone could give me lie detector test or something. I am desperate for someone to believe us. I could easily deny one time, but not two. Most people go their whole lives and never seen anything like this. Why me twice, coincidence maybe, but not likely! Thank you for reading this.<n>

The object appeared to be under 8 thousand feet in altitude and moving in a steady motion from west to east and eventually dissapearing off in the distance. The object was about 2 times the brightness as venus and had a warm orange glow to it. I watched the object for about 20-25 secs before it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/1/09 04:45|Mineral Wells|TX|Rectangle|1 minute|About 25mph and silent tablet shaped bottom covered in small dimley lit light blue lights.  About 50 ft long and 150 ft off the ground|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72009.html|599|ndxe200909| About 25 mph and silent tablet shaped bottom covered in small dimley lit light blue lights.   About 50 ft long and 150 ft off the ground<n> <n><n> <n><n> As someone who has spent a life time staring at the sky I have seen some unexplainable things.  But in the last two years I have lived in Mineral Wells Tx  I have seen four unexplainable things in the sky.  In the first case about two years ago I saw something that I can only to explain as the aurora borealis.  Two color changing orbs moving at phenomenal speeds and erratic directions moved from the east to west horizon in seconds.  They were in the same place about three hours apart about march 2007.  I wonder what I missed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But my newest sighting has me on edge.  On 8-27-2009 at about 3:30am I saw what appeared to be a flock of birds come out of a light cloud covering to the east moving to the west at about 100 feet in altitude.  I stepped under a tree to pick up a puppy when I realized that the dots I believed to be birds were stationary to each other.   At this point the completely silent object turned to the north directly above me and then back to the east in almost a u turn.  At this point I stepped out from under the oak tree as it continued to travel in a circle back to the west.  This is when it hit me that I was looking up at a tablet shaped craft about fifty feet in length about a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet above me.  It was difficult to see because the bottom was covered in about thirty to fifty very dimly lit light blue lights less then an inch in diameter.  The lights made it very hard to see because it looked like I was looking through the clouds into a  dense cluster of s! tars.  I think the body was black because I could see a definite outline.  Coming out of its second u turn it was pointing west as it continued to circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes I think this thing was looking back; that is when fear over came my curiosity and I hauled ass inside.  Only to have my fear replaced by intense anxiety as I thought about the fact I just saw a UFO looking back at me from about a hundred feet.  As a habit I second guess myself, it’s the scientific process, and I have seen a lot of strange things in the sky.  But this is the first time I have seen anything  that was more then a strange light moving erratically in the sky.  This is the first time I have ever seen something so close to that really spooked me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is where it get really spooky; I saw it again last night at about 4:45am on 9-1-2009.  I stepped outside to smoke a cigarettes which is one of a dozen or so ten minute brakes I take a night outside to stargaze.  This time it was moving north to south in a perfectly straight line.  Again it was as silent as ever  and moved in a straight line at about 25mph between one and one hundred and fifty feet above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just spent the day reading a hundred other experiences with  only occasional vague similarities to mine.  Did I just experience the rarest two minutes of my life or am I loosing my mind?  Why so many different types of sightings; is it the many different ways we can describe the same thing, are we an extraterg,restrial highway, or are we all just nuts and haven’t realized it yet?  How could I have been the only one to look up at the rite time?<n>

He said, &#34;Honey, look out the window, do you see what I see?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked, a little blurry eyed at first, but I saw a rectangular shape, over the mountains, behind our house.  It was colored like fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds it started to dim, and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw some light flashes and then a round globe, smoke colored object sort of bounced through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We discussed the fact that no one would believe us.<n>
