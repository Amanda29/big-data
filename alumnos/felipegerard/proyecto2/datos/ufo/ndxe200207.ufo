7/31/02 23:30|Shropham Norfolk (UK/England)||Light|15 minutes|Bright yellow/orange light hovering low in the sky that then re-appeared in another area of the sky at rapid speed.|8/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24673.html|1|ndxe200207| Bright yellow/orange light hovering low in the sky that then re-appeared in another area of the sky at rapid speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been out for the evening with a business colleague. We were picked up at 23:20pm by the taxi we had booked earlier. About 1/4 mile from arriving home i spotted a bright orange/yellow light hovering low in front of us, just above tree height and rooftop height. The bright light disappeared and reappeared in another section of the sky at rapid speed. The speed at which the object travelled was unatural.No engine noise was heard even though the object was reasonably close The taxi driver then indicated that he was glad we had spotted this as he had seen the same object when coming to pick us up.  My business coleague was equally bewildered by the light and its rapid motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The taxi driver decided to follow the light, this we did wiith no success as the light dissapeared rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We finally arrived at home to see the glowing light re-appear and move off rapidly one more time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not long after this the sound of a helicopter was heard nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has only been reported now, following a second sighting on 23-08-02 where photographic evidence was obtained  (see seperate report). After this second sighting i felt i should make the effort to report both sightings.<n>
7/31/02 23:10|Severn|MD|Light|30 minutes|2 Blinking lights circle and hover over Maryland|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24089.html|2|ndxe200207| 2 Blinking lights circle and hover over Maryland<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after 11 p.m - My wife and I walked out to the mailbox and decided to sit outside for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She immediately saw a flash and what looked like a moving star.  It took me a minute to notice it- because it was still when she was trying to point it out to me and I thought it was just a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute, I saw it blink a blue light and begin to move in circles.  She ran in and got a blanket and we lay down on the ground and watched it.  It would move North slowly for awhile and then stop and hover in circles for minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every so often it looked like a small patch of heat lightning flashed behind it - but nowhere else in the sky.  Several times we both thought we could make out a moving light on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 minutes we noticed another light coming at a moderate speed from the west that just stopped when it got in the vicinity of the first light.  If I hadn&#39;t seen it moving, I&#39;m sure I would have thought it was a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I focused on it I could see an aura of white around this second light and what looked like a white shape of some size.  Both lights circled around and hovered for about 20 more minutes and then were just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live right near B.W.I airport and planes land non stop.  From my front door the planes look like they are right over the tree line going by my house.  These lights were very high up, started and stopped and changed direction, and made no noise that I could hear.  Planes were landing beneath them the whole sighting.<n>

Underside apparently illuminated by Norfolk/Hampton ground lights. Object size and distance from ground unknown, speed unknown. Looked round or oval in shape. No brights lights were seen on object. Only took about 4 seconds to travel accross clear night sky and out of sight. Was standing on Hampton shore looking at base and the object caught my eye as well as four others standing on the same strech of shoreline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the witness implies a nighttime sighting.  We have amended the time to 22:30 hrs..  PD))<n>
7/31/02 22:30|Cazenovia|NY|Flash|30 seconds|2 bright lights that faded and had the same pattern of flight|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24096.html|4|ndxe200207| 2 bright lights that faded and had the same pattern of flight<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting outside last night facing east looking directly up at the sky when something caught my eye to the east. It was a very bright light that at first looked like a comet, coming directly toward me. But as I watched it get brighter for a very short period of time, maybe 4 seconds it then got dimmer, and traveled in a southerly direction and got so dim that it eventually disappeared. However, the odd thing is, there was another that followed and did the exact same thing after this one disappeared, coming out of what I would say was the exact same location, following the exact same path the first one did, and faded in the same location.<n>
7/31/02 22:23|Manhattan (Near)|KS|Sphere|2 -3 minutes|Sphereical object, reddish, low in the western sky 10:23 pm|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24163.html|5|ndxe200207| Sphereical object, reddish, low in the western sky 10:23 pm<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving south out of Manhattan, KS and noticed a bright object just above western horizon and stopped at Konza prairie lookout close to I-70 to observe.  The object had a reddish color and was quite bright; it did not appear to move in the sky.  However, I looked away to another part of the sky and when I turned back it was not there.  I have little to no knowledge about stars, planets, satellites, etc., so there may be a simple explanation for this object.  I did look at several websites that indicate objects visible in the night sky, but did not find anything visible at that time and at that location in the sky that night.<n>
7/31/02 22:00|Troy|IL|Rectangle|5 sec|Rectangular object traveling at a high rate of speed, south to north, dimly illuminated, visible for approx. 5 seconds|3/11/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26829.html|6|ndxe200207| Rectangular object traveling at a high rate of speed, south to north, dimly illuminated, visible for approx. 5 seconds<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being an amateur astronomer I try to be outside as much as possible during the summer months. On this star lit night I just happened to be looking straight up. This object was traveling at a high rate of speed in a south to north direction. It was dimly illuminated and emitted no sound. It happened so quickly I didn&#39;t have a chance to use my binoculars. Due to the size of the object I would guess its altitude would be approximately 4 to 5 thousand feet. My location is in the northeast corridor for commercial aircraft coming into Lambert International Airport in St. Louis. So I am familiar with aircraft. I am also located appromimately 10 miles north of Scott Air Force Base, IL.<n>

It looked awefully low to be a star and seemed rather close. It was not an airplane because i could see other airplanes around it and they looked nothing like this bright object that was twinkling.<n>
7/31/02 21:00|Fairlawn|OH|Triangle|3 minutes|Triangular pattern witnessed on summer night in backyard|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60985.html|8|ndxe200207| Triangular pattern witnessed on summer night in backyard<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened when I was about 10 years old and I am now 16, so I will try to relate everything that I can remember. I recently watched a Larry King Live episode on UFOs and decided to write here. I never realized that something like this site existed, and had forgotten about the incident up until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside sitting on our swing out in my backyard with my friend from school when we saw a huge triangular shape approaching very low. I don&#39;t remember exactly when we noticed it, but it was very large and very low. It was about the size of 2 or 3 large houses put together and probably about 5 or 6 stories above the ground. It made little or no noise, and was moving very slowly. It had a triangular pattern of small white lights spaced fairly far apart. Each light was about the size of a regular bulb from that distance away. There were about three on each side. In between the lights it was blacked out so I think it was only one entity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember my friend staying outside while I ran inside to get my dad. When we came back out it was passing over our house. It was probably moving about 10-15 mph depending on how low it was, but it was moving very slowly. It reminded me of the shape of a Stealth Bomber, but it made no noise at all. We also do not have any nearby military airport bases near our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back inside to get the video camera and when I came back outside it was almost gone. If I did get it on tape, we either didn&#39;t see anything afterwards and threw it away, or I simply didn&#39;t tape it at all. As I said, it was a while ago so I don&#39;t remember too much. I still don&#39;t know if anyone else saw it that night besides myself, my friend, and my dad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not leave a trail. There were no other aircraft following it. It was moving almost directly east to west and very slightly north to south. I hope this report helps, even though I couldn&#39;t give much exact detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The object appeared to be stationary or moving very slowly around the 1-2,000 foot range.  The object was located at 2:00 o&#39;clock in the sky from my path across the bridge onto the island.  I blinked and blinked and blinked again, and the object was visible to me for approximately 5-6 seconds.  The object was initally solid and blocky in appearance but in the final seconds, it seemed to turn on end and then the object reflected the sunlight like a shield. The object then seemed to change shape as it shimmered like a flag in the breeze and disappeared from view.<n>

Not plane, planet or star<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the way to work this morning with my husband I noticed a very bright light just below the moon.  The light was stationary and we were traveling east at about 30mph.  At first I thought that it was a star or planet, but it was just too large and very bright. I also thought that perhaps it was a plane, there is an airport about 5 miles from where we were, but it was too high to be in the flight pattern,on an inbound, or just after takeoff. There where no beacon lights so I honestly didn&#39;t believe it to be a plane,  I looked at it for moment and thought to look and see if the sun was coming up and possibly causing some sorta reflection.  The sun was still low in the horizon.  This took took perhaps a split second, when I looked back at the moon again the light was gone.  My husband pulled over to the side of the road to see if it had traveled over the top of the jeep we were riding in.  It was gone.  If it was  a plane, there is no way that it could of landed that quickly from such a high altitude.  I have looked around the internet to try to find an explaination to this, but the closest that I can come up with is the star Sirius, but from what I can tell, it is not near the moon at this time.  I have never seen a ufo (not saying this was one)and am not a person that sits around looking for them.  I just thought that this was just a very strange occurance. Any thoughts?<n>

When i went back to bed i looked out of the sliding doors up into a southeast sky. There apeared to only be one star. But as i stared longer i noticed it was blinking like a plane only not so fast. It was hovering. so i watched longer as a plane crossed its path and blocked it from my sight. It was still there and keeping me awake , so i got annoyed at it. Then it seemed to jerk up then back down then it jerked to the left in weird circular motion.But it never left so i fell back asleep. Earlier that evening i saw a shooting star type thing to the northwest. It didnt have a trail like other shooting stars do. And it  didnt just disapear like shooting stars do. it crossed the sky a distance before it disapeared. i thought nothing of it until my sighting.<n>

I was traveling North on 82 which turned into 11 north heading toward Liberty when I noticed a flash of light and I thought it was just a passing car. I noticed that there was a semi-truck in front of me and headlights of a car behind me. I looked up again at the flash of light and intially I thought nothing of it and I thought it might just be a star but no sooner did I think that it shot out at the speed of lightning about 100 ft. and then it just came to a dead stop. I immediately pulled over to the side of the road and when I looked up the semi-truck and car were gone as though they had vanished into thin air. There was no place the truck could have turned and the car which should have went pass me when I pulled over never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where the truck and car went was beyond me. By now I was really wondering what that object in the sky could be. It had a long shape and looked like beams of lights with gaps in-between and a white light underneath it. I started driving off and I grabbed my cell phone to call the Liberty Police and I was talking to the sprint operator when my cell phone cut off. The object followed me and there was not another car in sight. When I turned off the by-pass into Liberty I could still see it then it just sped out of sight very fast in a NE direction. My cell phone was now working fine. When I got home I didn&#39;t feel like myself and my body didn&#39;t feel right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken at length with this witness, and he seemed to be exceptionally sincere and credible to us.  The case was forwarded to Kenny Young, experienced UFO investigator from Youngstown, OH.  PD))<n>

It was about small, and you could see it flying over the houses. We ran out of the house and watched it from my backyard. It&#39;s glittering lights lit up our yard. After a few minutes, it seemed to dissapear.<n>

I first observed it directly overhead, and then faced west to watch its flight path.  It was moving in a straight line at a constant speed.  It seemed to be very high altitude and it was moving at a moderate speed.  It was a point of white light, and had it been motionless, I would have mistaken it for a star.  I observed it on one side of my house for about 30 seconds until the trees in my yard blocked my view.  I moved quickly to the back of my house, but I was unable to locate the object again.  The sky was very clear except for a few clouds here and there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded to be an excellent witness.

I knew that it was not anything that was usually there.  I watched it for about 5 minutes and it did not move.  I went inside and got my binoculars and looked at it for a minute, but could not distinguish anything but a very, very bright light.  I could observe airplanes and they usually blink.  This was not like an airplane.  I went inside to call my sister and as I was speaking, the brilliant light slowly, very slowly, went behind the mountain.  I would not have reported this if not for the fact that my husband, who works at the airport, saw something very strange in the sky tonight.  We are about 20 miles away and I could not see what he was looking at.  He said it was cigar shaped and changed.  I will have him add his report later.<n>

Kind of secluded with bunches of trees all around.  It was about 9:30-10:00 pm and I had stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and decided to look up and I saw a small star(?) moving along slowly across the sky. A few minutes later I saw 2 very bright lights that looked like huge stars stream across the sky...almost like they were chasing each other. They were moving so fast I saw them about a split second each maybe? Now I watch x-files and unsolved mysteries and all that is going through my mind is abduction so I turn and run in the house. I sit there and decide it was 2 shooting stars that I saw. I went back outside and ever so often I would see these lights darting through the trees and across the sky. I say I was out there about an hour and I saw these lights maybe 7 or 8 times through out that period of time. Each time these &#34;sighting&#34; lasted between 10 seconds to maybe a minute. I thought maybe they were fireflies but the lights were white not yellow. And they moved so quickly with no sound at all...they usually started out in almost a straight path, then they would change direction instantly and just zig zag a little bit. They blinked every...2 seconds maybe? Not blink like an airplane but like someone turning on a light every 2 seconds and turning it back off after a split second. Its hard to explain...darkenss for 2 seconds and then light for a split second. I could usually only see them through the trees but a few times they came out in open sky and they were moving so fast that there was almost a small streak behind them that made them look oval shaped...either that or they were already oval shaped i dont know. I could not really see them for too long. The only way I could really have a chance to really inspect their shape was to guess where the next light would show and sometimes they would change direction and be so quick that I would just see it out of the corner of my eye. This is so hard to explain. It moved cross the entire sky i! n about 5 or 6 blinks. Then it would be gone and come back in a couple of minutes. Sometimes it would make an entire spuratic circle around the yard through the trees. Then I saw a 3rd shooting star zip across the sky in a split second. I guess it could have been fireflies...i dont really know their behavior. I know for a fact it was not any kind of aircraft known to man yet. Can fireflies move in a straight line almost, skip around very quickly at will, are they that fast and bright, do they blink as systematically as an airplane would...as on-point as a computer cursor is when it blinks? These things could move so fast sometimes I couldnt keep up. If anything...it was quite a light show. A few airplanes came through the area while I was out there also.  After about an hour the lights were gone.  I am going back out there tonight to see what I can find.  Maybe get a picture.  I had seen something like this before in the same spot but I was inside looking outside and only saw it for a brief moment a few months ago.  I have read the other messages posted here and there are a few that sound similar to what I saw.  If it wasnt fireflies...it was incredible...I have never seen anything like it.  PLease email me at ((e-address deleted)) if you know what I saw.<n>

T. Butler Boulevard when I saw a bright light flash through the night sky beyond the traffic light. An object appeared to enter the atmosphere at an angle of about 60 to 70 degrees off perpendicular from the east falling down and to the west. The object made 3 or 4 bright streaks in a straight line similar to a dashed line. I counted 1,2,3 then the streaks of light stopped then looked at the time on the car radio. It read 9:39 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I held my hand at arms length each streak was as long as the width of a fingernail and as thick (At least 4 to five times thicker than any meteor I saw during the Leonid meteor showers) as a 9mm lead for a mechanical pencil. The length of the streak and the length of the blackness between the streaks appeared to be approximately equal. The light was very bright with a round shape leading each streak. What is prompting me to report this was the color. There seemed to be a glow of a blue or blue-green color the surrounded the leading ball shape. I am a 54-year-old manager in a major corporation and studied business, engineering and art. (BA, MBA).<n>

I thought this was odd considering that it was in the middle of the concert.  This caused me to look up and directly at it for futher investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I and two other concert goers (sitting in the row in front of me) witnessed was a very bright, intense, circular white light.  It did not emit a beam.  It was restricted to the source.  It was stationary.  There was no sound and no other visible structure.  2 seconds after my full gaze was upon it, it completely vanished.  I searched the sky for an explanation (i.e. other lights, planes, helicopters, etc.) but the sky was completely empty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clouds were clearly behind the object, much higher above.<n>

My family are a bunch of pilots and I have been taught by them how to identify aircraft in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 8:40pm looking out I noticed a group of birds flying just above the horzion and above a tall tree, so I can imagine the birds were about 80 to 200 feet above.  As soon as I watched the birds fluttering up and down heading from left to right across my window I noticed another object about the same size as the birds from my distance, but it didn&#39;t flutter.  It went really fast, faster than any bird and it kept very straight and steady.  And it seemed to be just above the birds, but as quick as it was I really couln&#39;t tell the distance from the object to the ground.  I would say it lasted between 10 seconds to 20 seconds that I saw it.  By that time the object has disappeared out of my sight and the birds were still just making it barely to the half way point of my vision from my window.  The object passed the whole window, so I can use that as a measuring tool.  The speed astounded me, because it was unreal.  When airplanes approach or fly over, you hear them from inside my house.  There was no noise from the craft. No sonic boom, nothing!  Note airplanes you can make out a shape because they are not that fast to the point that you can&#39;t tell its an airplane.  Everyone knows this.  Of course it could be the airforce, but then there would of been some sonic boom or some noise.  I wonder if anyone else noticed this object.  Lastly, there were planes in the sky above, and they definitly could not compare to the unidentified object that I saw, meaning there was clearly something unusual about what i saw compared to a cesna, 747, 737, 777, or any other commericial and non commerical aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness implies a date of July 30th, 2002.

It was round but had rough or cut out edges (I don&#39;t know how to discribe this without drawing a picture). It looked kind of dark grey. I told my friend to look and at first he looked quickley and said it was a balloon and looked away. I kept looking at it and it turned side-ways and it was like thin or flatish. I told him it couldn&#39;t be because of that and to hurry up and look again! The longer we looked at it the more we were saying, &#34;what the heck is that!!!&#34; It was flying in a strange manner turning and twisting so we could see all aspects of it. Right before we lost sight of it, it turned in a way that we could see it had reddish-orange lights on it. It didn&#39;t make any noise. I keep thinking there must be an explanation for it but I don&#39;t know what it could be. It wasn&#39;t as high as a regular airplane would be, but it wasn&#39;t low enough to be some kind of remote control toy. I didn&#39;t report it right away because I tried to just dismiss it, but the more I think about what I saw, the more I know I saw something significant.<n>

This sighting took place while driving on interstate 8, around Gila Bend, Arizona, also this sighting is not related closely to the sighting that I have recently reported...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my father were on a road trip to Sherman Oaks, California.  We were driving through Arizona on Interstate 8 at about 7:14 in the afternoon (about the time of sunset).  I was concentrating on the road when my father asked me to look into the horizon around the northwest direction.  What I saw didn&#39;t amaze me at first, There was a black dot below the clouds.  I watched it a little longer before my father mentioned that he had been viewing it for about fifteen minutes, and it hadn&#39;t moved.  I pulled off at a rest area and we both got out.  We sat and watched it, throwing out ideas of what it might be.  My father suggested a helicopter, but it sat so still for so long that I wasn&#39;t convinced.  He then suggested a weather balloon, but I quickly threw that theory out because I knew that weather balloons were metallic and were moved by the wind.  As the sun set his last theory was that it was a blimp.  But by that time it was dark and at least an hour went by and it still had not moved, there were also no lights surrounding the object.  As night fell onto the land the object slowly disappeared.  Which left me to wonder what it was.... possibly a ufo, possibly a secret government project.<n>

I estimate about 1/2 an hour later when I tilted my head back to take a drink of my beverage I noticed this object parked (floating) about 200-300 yards out and about 3 stories high. I placed my drink down and looked at it and wondered, what is that?  As soon as I looked at it I would estimate about 20 seconds it then began to move forward very slowly.  The aircraft did not fly over me, it went on a 45 degree angle and passed over about 50 yards from my left.  While it was approaching my position where I was sitting at I noticed there was no sound, no panels with nuts or bolts, no windows at all and most of all the leaves on the trees did not move and the dirt did not kick up.  I also noticed it had a white light underneath it located on the left side of the aircraft and it was moving back and forth in a slow motion like a scanner or copy machine would do. Im very familiar with aircrafts since I worked around them and I assumed it was an AF stealth stationed at Holloman AFB. Our Stealths are &#34;NOT&#34; built with the larger side on front and the smaller end at the back.  This aircrat (object) is triangular and the size of a stealth bomber and it had a very sleek and shiny black color close to charcoal.  When it flew over I heard a whoooo sound such as the wind hitting a telephone line.  I estimate its speed must have been about 25-35 mph. I know it was not a military plane, this one floated with no sound and no pulsion.  I dont know why I did not get up and look to see where it went, I know I sat there in dismay and maybe a little shocked at what I saw.  Once in awhile at night time I see streaks through the sky, I can tell what is a commercial airline, and I have seen falling stars but this is unique, it disappears into the night. To this day I carry my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I noticed a large shape that seemed to be changing colors, and as I glanced at it it began zig-zagging and darting around like it was on a string or being blown in a breeze.  It was probably 5 miles or so away in the night sky, and I watched it for 15 minutes or so  before waking up my wife.  I compared it to stars, and even to a plane that flew by during that time (in a different part of the sky)and it was like nothing I had ever seen.  It would hover or sit still for a few minutes at a time, then begin the darting and pinwheeling again.  I awakened my wife after about 15 minutes of trying to believe my eyes, and after deciding I had not gone mad, she dug out her binoculars.  We saw that the object had 3 different lights (that we could make out) in a triangular patern. orange on bottom, and blue and green up top.  They seemed to kind of pulse and alternate.  We stayed outside and monitored this phenomenon until about 2 am that night (Roughly 1.5-2 hours).  It never completely left our view, but seemed to be travelling further and higher over the course of the night, until it began to be hard to make out, even with the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report is not inconsistent with sighting of a celestial body.

At about 22.40 I went out side to look at the sky. It was filled with stars. I was looking in a easterly direction at a group of bright starts.I saw the lights of a airplane going in a general direction of north east to south east.Stand still and raising you ary in line with the airplane I wouls say it was about a thirty degree elevation from the horizontal. It was moving at the speed you would normaly see from a airplane. I looked back to the large group of stars when I saw what looked like a bright star moving,I thought it was just my eyes , that it was not moving. As I kept watching I could tell it was moving and very fast. It was twice as high as the airplane,moving in the same direction.Holdinf my army straight and putting my thumb under thi light it was about half of the size of my thumb nail.As I watched i could see that this light was not white like to stars, by more of a yellow.I dont know how to judge speed, but I can tell you that it must have been traveling about 6 times faster that the airplane. It only took about nine seconds to travel across the sky and move over the horizon. I watched this light move across the sky using stars to try to gage it speed I dont know the distance between the stars but it went across the path of three stars an about a second and a half.I never see anything like it before. I saw the space station go over heard one night about 4 years ago,and thought that moved very fast.

Basicly I turned my head, and when I looked back toward the planet/star, it was gone. This gave me a creepy feeling at first but was soon replaced by more wonder. Right there where the planet/star was a minute ago, there were 2 lights, not as bright as the other stars at first and they were moving. They flashed and blinked blue , red and white. They moved very slowly and finaly disappeared behind a mountain. This was to the north of me. I thought that this was extemely odd, then I saw another two lights , possibly the same ones , so I went and got my camcorder. They floated out of sight just like the first two, and as soon as they were gone there would be two more. They seemed to travel in pairs or threes. This pattern repeated. I had probably seen ten or twelve of these lights when I looked over to the east and what looked like a helicopter shining a spotlight was coming right at me. It came within 100 yards and then turned and moved into some trees , I could still see it betwwen the trees and finaly it disappeard. This object made no sound at all. The other lights came and went for about 2 hours and then finaly stopped at about 12:30 AM. None of these objects made any noise and moved very slowly. To the naked eye there seemed to be something coming off of these objects, not like smoke but more like an aura or a haze.  I haven&#39;t been given an explanation for these sightings. I have about an hour of video where you can plainly see how slow they move and that they made no noise. I have the strange spotlight on video as well, the images are shaky because it is a cheap 8mm camera and i couldnt see the lights through the viewfinder so I wasnt sure I was getting them on film. I just got lucky. And when I went to study the tapes , I came to a conclusion that these pairs and threes of lights were most likely not seperate crafts but one larger craft. I foun! d this a fter examining the video and saw how the lights blinked in a rotating sequence. My mother witnessed these events as well. All I can come up with is that they were some sort of balloons. Thats the only aircraft that I can imagine would move so slowly and so close together and in such numbers. The helicopter like light is what confuses me. The only thing that could have manuveured the way this thing did would be a helicopter. Actualy I dont think that a helicopter could have flown through the trees the way this thing did. It seemed to shine a light right down at me the way a helicopter would. And it was probably less than 100 yard away. The odd thing is that it was silent,not even a hum, so I have no clue what it was. At about midnight or just after , a jet flew through the sky right through were these other objects were, but it came from a different direction, the south.It was obviously a jet because it moved fast and made a jetlike noise. After this I only saw 1 more set of lights. My mother and I both concluded that these were not airplanes or helicopters because of the speed and the lack of sound. I am 31 years old, I have no obsession with the parnormal, I did like X Files I will admit , but that was mostly because of how hot Scully was. lol. So I am not claiming to have seen alien craft or martians. But I realy can&#39;t explain these lights and maybe someone else out there saw them too and will read this.<n>
7/29/02 22:15|New York Mills|NY|Flash|10 minutes|A dome-shaped object with green and red flashing lights was observed by 3 family members in suburban Utica,NY|7/30/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24020.html|44|ndxe200207| A dome-shaped object with green and red flashing lights was observed by 3 family members in suburban Utica,NY<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 42 year old nursing student with a previous B.S. in Home Economics who is also a cub scout leader. I was driving at about 20 miles per hour in a heavily populated suburb of Utica, N.Y. at about 10:15 pm. My 36 year old husband who is a printer with an associates degree in advertising and a U.S. Army veteran of Operation Just Cause in Panama, and my 8 year old son who is a bear in Cub Scouts and a third grader this year, were with me as we were coming home from a family reunion. It was quite humid and there were lighting strikes which lit up the sky. As I was driving along , I winessed two flashing lights on an object which was hovering above the patch of road ahead of us. I slowed down even more, and asked my husband and my son if they could see what I was witnessing. They immediately saw the object. My husband said that the green flashing light on the left, and the red flashing light on the right appeared to be about 20 feet apart. The object simply hovered, and was absolutely silent. We had our windows down and our Dodge van is in good repair and is very quiet. We could not hear the soar of a plane or the whirring, buzzing sound of a helicopter.We immediately reported this sighting to the Marcy substation of the New York State police. The dispatcher called our house later to report that upon reporting the sighting to the local police, she was told that there were no other sightings. She agreed with me that the object was unlikely to have been a military maneuver since it was operating over a very densely populated area, and had it been a private craft of some sort , it would have been very foolish to be operating a private plane of some sort, given the lightning strikes we were experiencing. Moreover, had a private craft of some sort been simply been remaining still and silent, it would have in a very short period of time, crashed.My son saw a domed shape above the lights that was illuminated by the lightning behind it to the west.The area in question was in an area to the west of Utica New Yo! rk and s outh of the New York State Thruway. I felt that it was important to report this since all three of us saw this and my son has better than 20/20 vision as reported by our optometrist and the school eye testing, and is always a very keen observer who always pays close attention to details. He has drawn several pen and crayon drawings of what he saw and would like to send them in to your official reporting organization.We will send one of his drawings to the address below. Thank You!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and found her to be an exceptionally credible witness.  We telephoned the New York State Police, and they reported that they had not received any other reports, save for the one from this witness.  PD))<n>

Its main body was around five times the sizes of the brightest star. I watched its full manouvre, my friend caught sight of it as it passed over her head from behind her. We both then witnessed it disappear, apparently burning up into two/three pieces.

It was at an angle of about 45 degrees in the sky and some distance away.  It appeared stationary for a few seconds and then descended quickly at a slight angle to vertical.  My view was then obscured by trees and large hedgerows, so I could see it no more.  I arrived at a more open area of countryside, a few moments later, but there was nothing to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a yellowy moon out.

The camp fire had died down and you could really see the milky way and all the stars in the sky.  It was around 11:30pm when three of us pointed out what we thought was a satelite and then realized we were seeing three seperate objects in a trianglar formation moving aross the sky.  They appeared to be satelites because of the altitude they were at, but what made us think they were not satelites beyond the fact satelites are not orbiting the earth in formation. was that the far right object would change speed as the triangle formation moved across the sky. They appeared as bright objects and there were no running lights that we could distingush.  We continue to watch them as the disappeared out over the horizon of the Pacific Ocean.  We kept looking every night til we left for our homes, but never saw the same formation of objects in the sky.  The group that saw this are all full time working parents with childern and have been camping at this location for over a decade and have never seen anything like this before.  If there is a explanation for what we saw, I would like to hear it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We would have conjectured that the objects were part of the U. S.

We do not know what it was they witnessed.  PD))<n>

Nearly directly overhead was a brilliant light about as bright as an aircraft landing light but with a bluish cast to it similar to the newer driving lights on autos.  It was obvious the light was not a stellar object because of the size and color. The size was larger than Venus at its brightest but no more than 1/8th inch in diameter at arms length.  The light remained absolutely stationary for about 25 seconds.  There was no sound or other identifying marker lights or markings discernable.  Suddenly the object rotated in a circular path and appeared to rise rapidly.  The circular path would have been approximately the size of a dime at arm&#39;s length.  The path was only 180 degrees in rotation.  At about the 180 degree point of rotation the craft had already vanished down to a pin point and vanished.  The rotation maneuver lasted only about 1 to 1.5 seconds.  During this maneuver the portion of the light that was originally facing downward was angled as if the craft were banking while rotating and it became apparent that a light shaft was being emitted from that portion of the craft now assumed to be the bottom.  The light shaft was approximately 1/4 inch in length at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The instant the light vanished I grabbed a pair of 7x50 binoculars that were 10 feet away and looked at the area where the light last appeared.  Nothing was observed in the area where it was last seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting took place at approximately 10:30 PM mountain time.  The sky at that time was clear with numerous stars visible.  No cloud cover was present and visibility could be classesd as unlimited.  The only obstruction to view was the ambiant light of the neighborhood (street llights and entry lights on homes).  Commercial aircraft were in the air with the closest craft at least 10 miles away.  There was no interaction between the aircraft and this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observer is a college graduate, former law enforcement officer of 18 years and a licensed general aviation pilot familiar with aircraft and their appearance.

What looked light a medium to small sized star, bright white, appeared from the east, which would have been the ocean. It was travelling in a perfectly straight line across the sky, and seemed very high up - appearing to be up with the stars. What got my attention was the rate of speed - it was moving faster than any kind of plane or jet that I&#39;ve ever seen. It crossed the sky in a south west direction until it disappeared from my site. We live on the edge of Otis AFB so I am used to jets. This was far higher than any jet, and far faster. I didn&#39;t make note of the date but it was either the 27th or 28th.

We recalled that it was getting close to time for the Perseids. We saw a few meteors, and continued to look for others. The observers were an adult couple, their teenaged daughter, and two adult females, ranging in age from 14 - 53. All adults are college educated, but not scientists. No alcohol or any other potentially conscious-altering substances had been consumed by any of us, the entire day. We pointed out to each other several moving points of light, at different times, that appeared to be satellites (we see quite a few of those out here). Then one of us spotted what he thought was another satellite. We all looked, and at first it appeared similar to the previous satellites we had seen, ie. a small point of light moving at a constant rate of speed, similar to that of a satellite. But then it began to move erratically instead of following a smooth, straight orb. It zigzaged and curved back on its path, and seemed to slow down and speed up, following the type of non-pattern you might walk if you were looking for something you had dropped in the grass, if you weren&#39;t sure where you had dropped it exactly. We discussed it, trying to think of anything that might produce such movement. After meandering about in this fashion for several minutes, the point of light just winked out. Not a gradual trailing off into the distance, but *poof* it was gone, completely. We all saw it... and none of us have never seen anything like it. I would guess the time to have been sometime between 9:45 - 10:15 pm, on July 28, 2002. I would estimate that the temperature was in the mid-to-upper 60s and it was a clear night, with little or no wind, at about 4,000&#39; altitude, outside of Rapid City in a rural area near Spring Canyon, in the Black Hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The International Space Station passed over Rapid City, SD, on two occasions on July 28.

I jumped up to get a closer look without taking my eyes away. The object changed shapes from circular to disclike (from my perspective)alternating every 2-3 seconds. It moved in one direction, did not change course, and seemed to be moving at a constant velocity ... slower than the planes I see taking off from a nearby airport. The object came near one airplane but neither seemed to change course (again, from my perspective). I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before. I&#39;m not inferring that this was an alien UFO, but it was certainly not like anything I&#39;ve witnessed before.<n>

Possibly satellites, don&#39; t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the southern sky at sundown, there was a bright white light in the sky.  It was very clear and the on shore flow of clouds had not started.  There were vapor trials from passing aircraft and very few white swirly clouds.  The object was stationary for the most part, but it moved ever so slight in the sky.  I went indoors and figured it would be gone by the time I returned.  I assumed it to be a satellite.  I returned 10-15 minutes later and noticed two this time. They were in the in the same area, but east of the first one.  They changed positions as them moved to the northwest sky.  I ran inside to get a telescope and the video camera.  When I returned I noticed that there were many visible.  I even saw a cluster of about 8 in the same area, but appeared to be smaller or further away.  They were not easy to find in the clear sky without really concentrating.  Once found, you have to use passing clouds or other objects to remember where they were.  At one time, there were two areas of them at the same time.  One was blinking for whatever reason.  the clouds moving make the object look like it is moving, but it is the clouds moving.  From my vantage point in the back yard, I strained to look almost straight up with my camera.  My neck was almost cramping, etc.  I have about 20 minutes of footage.  I would like to know if these were in fact satellites.  I believe they were I never realized that there were so many satellites in the sky.  I don&#39;t expect the military to reveal all of their information about how many or where they are positioned.  It was a spectacular show of satellites (I assume).  I only wish that I had better equipment to record what I saw.<n>

The object moved from light to left and would flicker green, blue and orange to the nakad eye. With my binoculars we could see that the top was blue, the center was orange and the bottom was green. As we observed it slowly moved westward. It was visible for about an hour before it left our sight heading west at around 230 am in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object may have been a celestial body, probably a twinkling star.

I was starring up at the sky looking at the stars when to my left a triangular shape appeared. I first thought it was a plane and then realized that I never seen a plane like that before. I was able to point out three corners of the craft which did indeed look like a triangle. The front had two green lights at two points and what looked like a red flame in between them. It was moving a bit slow for a few seconds and then picked up speed. We stood up and ran to the front of the house because the house next door was in the way of our view. When we made our way there it had disappeared. It wasn&#39;t a cloudy night so us not being able to see it anymore was a bit strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain anonymous.  PD))<n>

We also like to look for satellites and shooting stars.  The evening was about 70 degrees with humidity around 65%.  We were approximately five miles from the nearest village, so light interference was minimal.  The sky was clear.  My wife and friend had gone into an open field ahead of me.  As they were looking into the sky nearly directly overhead, they observed a greenish colored light, slightly bigger than most stars, but at quite a distance.  No sooner had both of them spotted this when three white lights came out of the one green light and headed in different directions moving faster than satellites would and then all four quickly disappeared.  They informed me of this observation upon my arrival only a minute or less later, but I gave it little thought.  We continued watching the stars and saw a few shooting stars when we all turned to look at the north-east sky, not far from directly overhead when we saw a light which I initially labeled landing lights.  Very shortly after saying that, I realized the light was not moving in any direction, but was coming closer and getting brighter.  It had the appearance of a bright car headlight coming at us from a distance.  Just about the time I thought the light was getting close enough and bright enough to almost cast a shadow, it immediately started moving away, but still not moving in any linear fashion.  It became so dull in appearance that it resembled the satellites we&#39;ve observed on numerous occasions.  At that time, it began moving in a south-easterly direction much faster than any satellite until it disappeared.  All three of us stood in awe of this site, not knowing what to think at that time.  This particular event lasted about one minute from the time the light was first observed.<n>

Hot summer night, clear sky, some 15 minutes after sundown. Walking back from the deer stand (where me and my son of 15 had been observing game) to the car, we saw a fast-moving light in the sky traveling along a straight line from SE to NW. It looked like a bright satellite, it appeared to be very high. Our observation started when it was at around 40 degrees above the horizon, and we took it for a satellite. But at about 80 degrees elevation it suddenly changed its direction by some 45 degrees, and after a view seconds started to move eratically: sudden stops, accelerations, 90-180 degrees turns. After some further 10 seconds doing so it disappeared abruptly. I don&#39;t believe it could have been a meteorite or returning spacecraft debris bouncing into the atmosphere.<n>

It was a very bright circular light that basically hovered in the same area, but moved in zig zag and circular motions and would generate a pale pink purple or a pale green haze around it. Planes were going by and they were very much below the object. It went higher at one point and almost looked like a shooting star going backwards and then it returned to the original hovering place.  It then moved up again and disappeared.  The sky was cloudy and there were no stars visible.<n>

All that changed two weeks ago.  On Saturday July 13, 2002 my friend and I was talking to one of our neighbors outside at his trailer park in Davison.  The sky was clear and we could see something moving across the sky.  I thought it was a satellite but then it stopped moving and did a sharp U-turn.  It was so small because it was so far away.  Then it disappeared.  I then noticed another one moving across a star from another angle in the sky.  We sighted a total of 12 UFO&#39;s that night and all of them disappeared.  Sometimes, one would disapper then reappear for a second.  I decided to email you this letter because I want to know if you have noticed any other sitings that are similar around this area.  I believe I have seen another one last night on my way home from work.  I was driving North bound on the expressway I-75 between 3:15-3:30AM.  I was heading towards Troy area when I flipped my visor up to look at the sky and there it was!  The low hovering aircraft was square shaped like a reversed minivan.  It looked blimp sized, but it also looked like a cut out shape in the sky like it shouldn&#39;t even be there!  How am I supposed so to see this object so clearly when the sky is misty!??  The whaleish-gray colored UFO had a light blue glow around it.  When I focused my attention on the sparks of light coming from behind the object,  it disappeared.  It couldn&#39;t have been in the sky for more than 4 seconds.  It was moving eastbound at an extremely fast speed!  I know what a meteor looks like because I witnessed the meteor shower we had over a month ago.  At first, I was trying to convince myself that it was a reflection in my mirror and I just saw a shooting star.  When I read the Flint Journal the next day, I discovered that a similar sighting was seen in Washington.  I am now convinced that I must have seen it too.  This wasn&#39;t a meteor or a shooting star.  It was something else.  The article in the Flint Journal stated that two F-16 jets from Andrews Air Force Base were scrambled early Friday after radar detected a unknown aircraft in the Washington area. The time was 1:00AM when the Air force jet was chasing it but it just left them in the dust at speeding over 6000 miles an hour.  I realized that their is a 3 hour time difference between Michigan (ahead) and Washington. Sounds incredible doesn&#39;t it?  Today, CNN claims the government is allowing some aircraft to float around the USA and some people might mistake it for a UFO.  Of course, they gave no details.  Sounds like a cover up to me.<n>

I was walking on my driveway/sidewalk. I just happened to look up, and I saw an orange sphere over the treeline. I didn&#39;t know what to think, at first I thought it was the moon. Then I realized harvest moon is only once a year, and that would be in November and not in July. I sat down on the driveway, and notice the object was rising upwards. Then the object started shrinking down to a smaller sphere. Then a black line cut back through it and it looked like the bottom piece &#34;fell&#34; off. The bottom piece disappeared and the top piece formed into a triangle. I was trying to explain it to my friend over the phone, and he went outside to see it, but he couldn&#39;t. Probably being because we live quite a distance away from each other. So I went inside to tell someone and my brother wouldn&#39;t believe me. I went back outside and the object was shrinking off into a line. Finally it just went away, and never came back.<n>

I decided to turn back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before going off the mountain I was amazed by how beautiful the sky looked. I got out of my Chevy Blazer and climbed on the roof to lay back for a few and check out the sky. The stars were beautiful. I stoped on a certin star to look at it. There were all kinds of stars in the sky but I stoped at this certin one. The star had a few stars about the same size around it. All at once the stars around the one I was looking at started to move. They moveed to gether but not perfect. They moved down away from the one I stoped on. They continued to move for about a minute and one of them broke away from the others and flew into another sorounding star. It looked like they were flying in a triangle pattern. They looked like they were far into space with the stars that didnt move. Eventualy the other 2 went deeper into space and vanished. I know they had to go deeper because thier light slowly dimmed until they were not visible to the eye. I now no there is life in space.. or angels...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I say angels is because I prayed to God that he would show me somthing in the sky that night and 1 min later, I saw those stars move if they are stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today is the 28th its 230 in the morning. Yesterday or last night. I saw it agian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time I saw one of them it lasted for about 30 sec. It vanished also. I am trying to conceve what I saw. Its hard to accept but I have to. I seen it with my own eyes. I am a smart sain person and Believe in GOD and Jesus. I have no reason to lie and cant profit from this in anyway. There is no record of what I saw. nobody will be able to say that what ever I saw that night and the night after wasn&#39;t real. It was so amazing! I am so happy now. It confuses me because I didnt belive that there was life other than whats on earth. If anybody was looking in the same spot I was, with or without a telescope they must have said something or seen something. Take it from me and believe that we are not alone in some shape or fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Those thing were alive and bright as a star. Thank you...…((name deleted))<n>

The object then flashed for a second and third time but the distance inbetween these flashes were in my view vast and i couln&#39;t think of any aircraft that could travel that fast.

This hum caused the several K-9 dogs to bark and howl uncontrollably from their pens. Holding my hand up to the sky, the beam/glow of deep green light would have been relative to the size of my thumb. After viewing in amazement, for about two minutes, the &#34;deep green&#34; light vanished, the hum stopped and the dogs became silent. With two airports in the area, I&#39;m sure something had to be picked up on radar screens.<n>

We had crossed Ellicott Highway a few miles back when a bright yellow flash ahead and to my left caught my eye - the best I can describe this is a round disc, maybe 6&#34; in diameter, 50 - 100&#39; south of the road, 8 - 10&#39; in the air, travelling east (parallel to the road) at a rapid speed and flashing with strobe intensity perhaps three times per second. I looked over and saw maybe 5 or six flashes as it passed us, then saw a few more in my driver&#39;s side mirror. It was very dark and overcast (it had rained lightly earlier) and no stars were visible. We heard no sound and could discern no shape, but my girlfriend, her son and I all saw the flashing disc. We all turned to each other and said, &#34;What the heck was THAT?&#34; Strange, we&#39;ve only discussed it once since then, and we can&#39;t come up with a plausible explanation; I&#39;m familiar with that stretch of road, and there is no parallel road or railroad track there, NOTHING. There IS a small airfield 10 miles west of there, but would a plane travel 10&#39; off the ground with no other lights, hugging a county road and be completely silent?<n>

It was moving very fast, so two of us ran inside to get a camera while the other stayed and watched it .  By the time we came outside with the camera the other person told us it disappeared into the sky!!  We started heading in when it came back and this time even closer!!!!!! we were soooooo scared we could tell that it was a ufo now because it came close enough that we could see it.  I was about  to flash off the camera when it flew over the house without a trace of it left!!!!!!!<n>

It appeared suddenly in front of my eyes, high up on the sky but not as high as a star. It travelled very fast but not totally straight or with uniform speed. It sort of wobled a little for at least three times. As it travelled, it left behind a long stripe or sort of tail behind in such a way that the main point was like a ball but its trail was a thinner line as blue as the ball itself. It flew over me high upon the sky and seconds after I turn backwards to see it going further it dissappeared among the clouds. It travelled N-S. It was too big, too bright, too blue, the tail too long a line to be a star or a plain or anything I ever saw before.<n>

It was shaped like a jet but with NO wings or lights.  It was extremely shiny, unlike an airplane.  It appeared to &#34;float&#34; in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed other people were seeing it too.  It was DEFINATELY NOT an airplane or a blimp or anything else.

About 5 minutes later the jets were in over my area, sounding as if they were flying at low altitude.

It went right over my house making absolutley no noise whatsoever,  at this point a f-16 has come on to the flight path of the object on a S.E. heading about 1000 to 2000 feet behind it clearly in a pursuit mode and unable to vector the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed the pursuit as long as I could until I lost sight of the crafts.

(about 1:15 am this morning).  We had gone outside to get our cat, who was on a ledge outside the second floor window and wouldn&#39;t come in or climb down, just kept meowing.  We were both looking up at the side of the house wondering how long we would have to wait for her to come down, when two circular white lights flew over the house, going more or less west to east or northeast.  they were about the size of a baseball held at arms length.  we both saw it.  about two minutes later they came back (or two others like it came by) again, from west to east/northeast.  this time they both stopped -- don&#39;t know how far away -- they seemed close, although the (?) spheres were small.  they both stopped for a second or two...as my son and i watched, one of the objects/lights &#34;flew&#34; away at a right angle to its previous path of flight ... not up in the sky, but back to the northwest at what seemed to be the same altitude as before.  the other object remained motionless for a few moments (5 seconds maybe) then continued to the northeast on pretty much its original direction.  they were definitely two different objects that were flying in tandem at first, then split up.  my son and i ran out to the front yard with the video camera, but didn&#39;t see anything more.  they made no noise.  they seemed small but close.  if they weren&#39;t close they must have been huge.  we read in the news that similar sightings were made last night in Waldorf Maryland, about 10 miles from our house. we always thought these things were crazy, but now we know better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

First off I want to emphasize that the date of the encounter is of to my best recolection, i do not want anyone to downplay my sighting due to the fact that it is similar to the one in washington on the same date and time.As in the second sighting The first sighting occured when i was in the hot tub at my appartment complex. I was not facing directly east but more of a north east direction. Then a intense aqua blue ball came out of no where, traveling at speeds that i have never witnessed. I called into the hotline and the person there suggested that it was a meteor.... I find it impossible to belive This was not a meteor for several reasons. The first reason is that it was traveling on the horizon in a straight trajectory, also it was moving rapidly up and down, similar to a hearbeat on a computer screen only FAST!. Secondly it was a color that simply put does not exist, it was like that of a blue jet flame, only pulsating and mesmorizing,deep and rich yet light at the same time. Another reason i find it hard to belive that it was a meteor or for that matter a shooting star is that it was obviously inside the earths atmosphere, i mean it was like right there, I looked at the stars shortly after the encounter and they seemed extremly far away, compared to the object(s) which was clearly inside our atmosphere. Also one very very very important detail, both of these sightings occured in one peice of the night sky, there are two trees that block out some of the sky to the north and west and there is a strip of sky directly east that you can look out into from the hottub. Both of these objects seemed to only appear in this strech of eastearn sky, they both would ethier shoot across the strip of sky and disapear, or they where moving so fast that by the time my eyes set on the part of visible sky (to the north) the objects where gone. Sorry for reporting this so late, i was scared to death....and still am about what i saw, i was! nt suppo sed to see it, i didnt want to say anything to anyone about it for fear that it was something highly secretive, but since others have seen similar things i thought i would share my experiance.…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date apparently is approximate.

It was what he thinks he saw when he headed outside to look early yesterday that floored him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;It was this object, this light-blue object, traveling at a phenomenal rate of speed,&#34; Rogers said. &#34;This Air Force jet was right behind it, chasing it, but the object was just leaving him in the dust. I told my neighbor, &#39;I think those jets are chasing a UFO.&#39; &#34; Military officials confirm that two F-16 jets from Andrews Air Force Base were scrambled early yesterday after radar detected an unknown aircraft in area airspace. But they scoff at the idea that the jets were chasing a strange and speedy, blue unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;We had a track of interest, so we sent up some aircraft,&#34; said Maj. Douglas Martin, a spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado, which has responsibility for defending U.S. airspace. &#34;Everything was fine in the sky, so they returned home.&#34; At the same time, military officials say they do not know just what the jets were chasing, because whatever it was disappeared. &#34;There are any number of scenarios, but we don&#39;t know what it was,&#34; said Maj. Barry Venable, another spokesman for NORAD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Radar detected a low, slow-flying aircraft about 1 a.m. yesterday, according to a military official. Controllers were unable to establish radio communication with the unidentified aircraft, and NORAD was notified. When the F-16s carrying air-to-air missiles were launched from Andrews, the unidentified aircraft&#39;s track faded from the radar, the military official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pilots with the D.C. Air National Guard&#39;s 113th Air Wing, which flew the F-16s from Andrews, reported nothing out of the ordinary, NORAD officials said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;It was a routine launch,&#34; said Lt. Col. ********, a senior officer with the wing, which keeps pilots and armed jets on 24-hour alert at Andrews to respond to incidents as part of an air defense system protecting Washington after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> R***** remains convinced that what he saw was not routine. &#34;It looked like a shooting star with no trailing mist,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.&#34; © 2002 The Washington Post Company<n>

At first i thought it was the afterburn from a millitary fast jet going away from me then i realised the object was coming towards me very fast, and that the &#34;light&#34; was now reducing in size and that it was going stright up into the night sky. I must add at this point that it was a perfecly clear night sky and that the moon was very bright but not quit a full moon, and was of to my left as  i was facing noth. I just seamed to disapper into the massive aray of stars. Also i had not been drinking  and there was no noise whatsoever. This is the first time i have ever seen anything like this and have always had an open mind about such things, but since witnesing this sitting i have not been abel to stop thinking about it and have had trouble sleeping. a friend told me to report this to someone and i just happened to find your site on the web tonight .

7/25/02 21:30|Shirley|NY|Formation|3 Minutes|I sighted 6 fiery lights in formation of the southern coast of Long Island while I was flying an airplane in the vicinity.|7/26/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23921.html|109|ndxe200207| I sighted 6 fiery lights in formation of the southern coast of Long Island while I was flying an airplane in the vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a flight instructor at Brookhaven Airport in Shirley, NY...21 years old. At about 9:30 i was taking off for a night flight with a student, when I looked and suddenly there were 6 bright yellow lights about 5/10 miles off-shore southern Long Island, directly south of smith point park in the vicinity that flight 800 came down. These lights were in a line formation, with 2 closer on the left and the other 4 on the right staggered. I contacted other pilots on the UNICOM frquency, 122.80 MHZ, and it was confirmed. One pilot in particular was one of my co-worker instructors in another company aircraft. After i started heading north-east bound on course to Rhode Island, i saw the lights disappear and fade out IN SEQUENTIAL ORDER from left to right, 6-5...then 4-3-2-1. I contacted the local air traffic controller to see if it could be confirmed on radar. They said yes, and that they did not know at first what it was either, but that it was now off the radar screen and they suspected it was military activity. Now, i am very aware that the area i am describing is known for military firings and that it is the likely answer, but what i do not understand is how these objects were able to hover. Because it was a near full moon, a harvest moon nonetheless, i could clearly tell that they were not boats, and they did not have aircraft lighting. Also, there were no boats in the area that they, if they were some kind of flare,could have been launched from. And they dimmed out in sequence almost perfectly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  News agencies are reporting on July 26 that objects were witnessed over the state of Maryland, and apparently F-16 fighter aircraft pursued the objects.  These are unconfirmed reports, as far as we know.  PD))<n>

I thought there may be something after the chickens because that is where the back window looks out to and I could not understand why he did not grab the flashlight and the rifle because we have been having critter problems. I grabbed the stuff and ran outside and insted of him going out back he was looking into the sky. He said there were three white circles, then they merged and turned a yellowish color and then they were out of sight of the window. There is some thunder way over towards lake county but he is an outdoors person and he insists that it was not ball lightning, he said that if you held your thumb out it would not cover the circles, he said they were very close. I did not witness this, though I wish I had.<n>

I obserbed three flashing lights in the sky so i stopped my car and turned the engine off.  I took a better look and seen three silience objects hovering in a line.  Could not see exact shape because it was dark and i was looking at the large single light on each.  Each craft was flashing in sequences like they where communicating or something.  In the distance i heard a noise which got closer and later seen, was two maybe three jets.  I live only three houses away from where i stopped so i turned my car back on quickly and drove home jumped out of the car went into my back yard and seen the jets go over and the three objects also moving faster and seemed to be still silient into the distance away from the jets.  As the noise of the jets got closer the three objects started to move slowly away from the direction of the jets.  They moved faster as the jets got closer.  I watched and the three objects move faster away, still flashing in sequences. It was then i seen a fleckle of silver on one of the objects.  It was like the jets where proceeding them.  Both objects and jets went over Allora mountain and i could not see or hear anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can e mail me on ((e-address deleted)) if you want anymore details or want to speak to me.  I was yelling for my husbane to come see but he was in the bath so i am upset to say i had no witnesses unless someone else in town seen it.  My husbane only heard the jets as they went over.  He said that he heard the jets coming in from a distance then the sound proceeded over the top of our house then left.<n>

The date is approximate.  But it was before the Mt Comfort Air Show at the Mt Comfort airport which is about 3 miles from my house.  I heard the sound of planes coming over the house. Since some pretty old WWII planes come over I wanted to get a closer look. I was on the screen porch, so I went out in the yard to watch the formation of planes go over.  There were 3 planes lined up going overhead.  They were going southeast.  I noticed a silver object keeping up with the last plane.  Then that plane did a turnaround heading back to the object.  When it got near the silver cirle or round dot the object just disapeared. As the planes were going southeast it seemed to keep up to them at the rear.  But when that plane turned around, it held back and went up and disapeared.  I immediately went in and told my husband that I saw something I couldn&#39;t explain.  It has intrigued me ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Partly cloudy skies.  Object was the length of my thumbnail at arms length.  Object moved north behind trees in the distance in apparent level flight.  No fins, tail, wings or markings visable at this distance, which may have been over a mile.  Lost sight as I traveled down into a small vally, and could not find it when at the crossroads of Cedar and Brainard a few minutes later, where the area is very open to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At home, heard a sputtering, puttering sound all afternoon from the north, but saw no craft of any kind.  My wife heard this sound also.  Assumed it could have been a blimmmb, but no mention on the news of blimp activity, which they always show.  It was very cloudy during the hours when the sound was active.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the witness implies a daytime sighting.   We have entered the time here as 11:55 hrs..

The object at first, I assumed may be an airliner catching the morning sun was coming in fast from the southern sky.  As it got closer I could very well tell it was no aircraft that I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started pointing at it and asking him to look at it to.  At that point the other witness was interested in what I was pointing at and looked to.  It appeared to be a perfectly shaped sphere: Blue in color, but like shiny metal at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no sound and went from horizon to horizon in seconds making no noise.  At the speed it was going you would think that even a sonic boom or something would have been heard.  We talked about it all day that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Sat, July 27th, 2002, in the afternoon my friend that witnessed it with me brought me a news clip from the ledger stating that 2 Jets chased mystery object over Washington on Friday July 26th 2002 describing what we&#39;d seen to the T.  It freaked me out something serious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Believe it or not, I still have the news clip as to never forget what I saw that early morning.<n>

I had to go out at 2:00 a.m. to check equipment.  I noticed a very bright light where Venus had risen earlier in the evening.  I thought perhaps it was a binary star, since it looked like a double star as bright or brighter than Venus with my naked eye,  and went back and consulted the Heavens-Above website, which I look at on a regular basis since I work at night a lot and like to observe different satellites, shuttle, space station, etc. flying overhead. The sky chart for 2 a.m. showed no bright stars at that time in that location.  I know that I had never seen a satellite after approximately 10:00 p.m. local time and sure enough there were none on the list.  Also, this object did not move.  I got my binoculars out and then I observed the object having 3 distinct lights, green, white and red, which makes me think it was probably some unnamed stationary satellite.  It was in the same area for 2 hours.  At approximately 4 a.m. it was no longer visible.  I WAS a skeptic about UFOs until then.  I did observe the space station flying over the next evening, however, it crosses the sky in about 4 -5 minutes and is gone.  Venus sets about 9 p.m. local time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a celestial body may, in fact, be the cause of the sighting, although the witness appears to have experience in viewing the night sky.  The colors described are indicative of a &#34;twinkling&#34; star.  Also, given the length of time the object was visible, we strongly suspect it was not a bona fide UFO.  Satellites do not appear to hover in the night sky.  PD))<n>

These stars/lights were very similar to the shape of a constalation.  I noticed, however, that these lights were very close to one another not spaced out at all.  The lights were white and slightly dim, like dimmer stars, and could see about 8-10 of them.  I kept staring at the object(s). It was static and did not move for a moment.  I looked at the clock and noted that it was 12:37.  Then the object(s) started to glide slowly to the ground.  I told the driver to start driving faster because the ojects view was lost behind some trees.  As we followed it, it looked as if though either the oject was rotating from left to right or as if the light formations were moving.  I noticed at this point that it seemed a little darker than the sky. I call it an object because the lights seemed to be in sync with each other. as it slowly descended, it quickly disappeared.  And then as soon as I couldn&#39;t see it anymore, I thought to myself &#34; I want to see it again&#34;  instantly, there was a line of light overhead that was white and very thin.  similar to a shooting star, but instead just a line not a streak.  we had pulled off of the road at this point.. we waited but it didn&#39;t return.  I did not hear any sounds or feel any strange sensations.. we both dismissed this as some sort of military base test.  I have never seen anything like this before in real life.<n>

The object which moved in a slow straight line down the center of the road, was only about 6 feet off the ground and appeared silent. THe object appeared to be powered as it moved down towards the end of the complex. At one point it zig-zagged to the right, then to the left, and soon went out of sight.

As I got nearer to the Highlines I noticed it was a craft of some kind just hovering in the sky. I pointed this out to my daughter and we both observed the craft as it hovered there. It was a diamond shape and was of a Silver metalic color. I rolled the window down to see if there was any sound and could hear none. After observing the craft for about 5 Minutes It sped off to the NE at a high rate of speed. The best way to describe the speed is to say it was there and then it was gone in the blink of an eye. I have been searching the net to see if anyone else has seen anything like this in our area.<n>

The noise resembled the rough sounds of a very large grinding engine, but was overlayed with a rythmic &#34;swishing&#34; sound reminiscent of our dishwasher.  It was loud enough and sudden enough to immediately alarm us into instant wakefulness and we looked out the window to see the sky illuminated by rapid flashes of red, blue, and green lights (not isolated in any specific area, just covering the 15-degrees of arc or so we can see between the eves of our house and the trees surrounding our home).  The sounds and lights abruptly stopped after fix seconds or so.  There was a pause of perhaps ten seconds while we tried to figure out what it could have been, and then the lights and sounds resumed and lasted for another five seconds.  The power died sometime during these two events.  We ran outside at this point, but the sky was completely clear (no cloud cover to reflect light effects from ground-level).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five to ten minutes later we noticed the contrail of a high-altitude military jet coming from the direction of the Whidbey Island Naval Station and heading due east perhaps a dozen miles south of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best hypothesis is that perhaps the lights and sounds were an electrical effect, such as a transformer blowing.  The only problem with this theory is that all the local power lines are buried -- the nearest transformer is perhaps a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hopped in the car to drive around on the chance that the lights and sounds had come somehow from an aircraft in trouble, since the Abbotsford B.C. airport is only a few miles away.  During my drive through the cornfields I noticed that the power outage seemed restricted to an area of a square mile with our home near the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to post this based on another post here from Surrey B.C. on July 20th.  Surrey is only ten miles northwest of our home, and the sighting there was only a few days prior to our experience, and at approximately the same time of morning.<n>

We were able to see the object for about 2 minutes. It made like a humming noise but nothing like an airplane. Other campers saw this aircraft too.<n>

I said to my husband what is that, he looked out and tlod our family menbers to look at the sky. It was a V- shape formation. My husband took out the video carmera and started to recording. There was no other aircraft flying around. We normally have planes flying over our house in a eastern direction, this was going at a north to south direction. The center light was bright and the other lights began to dimer out as if they were separating from the formation. It flew over our heads not moving very fast, we could hear a motor type noise, but it was not a noise that an airplane makes, it kept flying south, but it disappeared once it passed the moon. I was on the phone with my sister and the aircraft flew over the phone went dead and the video camera stopped. It was really weird.<n>

It was about 10:30p.m when one of our  kids in our group were out on our deck of our  vacation condo in the back part of Avalon, on Catalina Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was inside my bedroom when I hear one on the 3 girls on the deck yell, &#34;look a UFO&#34; as I walked out onto our deck I look  to the south and see a very, very, large slow moving V and the outside of each of the two wings are flasing red lights, just to the inside of that edge of lights I see white lights all very close together and again flashing. It seemed to have afew circles of lights that were in the center that were rotating in white. We were on the side of very step set of hills that reachs 1600 to the south west of us, so inside of 30 sec. we lost sight of this flying Triangle with the hills blocking our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I went to the loacl police station in Avalon and they had no reports of this object seen on 7-23-02 at about 10:30.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being told that they had no reports the members of my running club had fun the next day on the becah and run making all the jokes about what I reported seeing.

What would it look like in the day light? It take my breath away thinking what we all saw that night must be parked some place in the daylight. What a thought for all of you who saw it, Thanks to all of you for you&#39;re reports, they helped me get through this.<n>

I was walking away from the beach at night in a crowd of maybe 40 people.  Above us we saw a triangle formation of lights, kind of like how geese fly in formation. There was a very bright white light in front with red lights trailing it.  There were many witnesses, but i could not take a picture.  The entire formation was several times larger than the moon (which was full or close to full) and it was moving very slowly across the sky.  The lights did not flash.  As the formation got about halfway across the sky, a very, very low, quiet engine sound became audible.  It was like a very very far away jet, but the sound was flat.  It really freaked me out.  I thought it could be a stealth bomber or a high up formation of military jets, but the lights did not blink or flash and they stayed in perfect formation.  I have no idea what it was.  It was flying from the northwest, towards Avalon.<n>

When ((name deleted)) called me by phone with alarm in his voice, I was surprised to find him reporting a UFO to me (I voiced my doubt as to his sincerity because ((name deleted)) is a comedian who constantly uses my interest in UFO&#39;s as material for routine comedic &#34;assassinations&#34; of my character).  He reiterated that he was not kidding and that I should come topside immediately for a look. I popped the hatch over my head and moved upward on deck to see something which made absolutely no sense whatsoever: Above me nearly 90 degrees but slightly north and heading directly overhead to the south-southwest was a brightly lit array of lights which looked like they were configured to an &#39;&#34;invisible&#34; structure which all connected to what appeared to be a central jet aircraft. Flying at about 15 to 18 thousand feet, the atmospheric bounce seemed to illuminate the bottom of what looked like a typical jet, but that is where typical ended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is always jet noise from being very close to LAX.. this was the case as this object went over.  There were other jets in the area. What sound I might have attributed to this object would not be accurate based on our proximity to Los Angeles airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the right and left side of this central craft was a &#34;formation&#34; of what looked like rotating red navigational beacons.  To the right were a series of three outboard beacons, the first one being the only one that was not rotating, constant, and red. Each beacon was equally spaced on either side of this craft. The distance from each beacon to one another was at least three full wingspans of the &#34;central&#34; craft?s main wingspan. That wingspan was approximately my thumbnail width at arm&#39;s length. Relative to the central craft, none of these rotating red lights moved independently of one another as if to be fixed to some &#34;superstructure&#34; and connected somehow to the central craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the left of this craft and starting outboard at the same distance as the right side were approximately six of these beacons making the left &#34;wing&#34; appear much longer.  At the farthest outboard &#34;end&#34; of the left side formation was a smaller white light trailing behind its respective leader as if it were being dragged by this leading edge beacon.  This gave the impression that this &#34;wing&#34; was squared off at the left end.  The distance from these two lights which formed this termination was about four fuselage lengths of the central craft.  There did not appear to be any visible structure to the larger wing formed by these outer beacons, though, there was absolutely no variation in spacing visible which might have been caused by independent buffeting from wind turbulence or speed differences. These beacons and lights seemed &#34;fixed&#34; to a rigid but invisible framework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each red rotating beacon seemed larger than what it should have appeared to have been for its distance and did not seem to be &#34;attached&#34; to the bottom of anything like individual fighter aircraft or the like.  They looked like they were just oversized flying red beacons, clear and bright.  I don&#39;t remember anything significant about what should have been &#34;normal&#34; sized navigational lighting on the central craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If there was a &#34;superstructure&#34; to this formation, the sweep angle of the main wing from the central craft&#39;s leading edge was the source for any &#34;attachment.&#34;  This formation&#39;s angle might have been pitched slightly forward of the angle of the central craft wing&#39;s leading edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reasoning for such a configuration made no sense.  Any superstructure necessary to keep such a formation fully fixed in place as it appeared, would have been ripped apart by air turbulence from the speed this craft traveled at.  On the other hand, if there was a much larger main craft partially &#34;cloaked,&#34; then this would explain such an odd sighting.  This was my first unexplainable sighting so it is significant for me The duration of our sighting was approximately 2 minutes until this &#34;configuration&#34; of lights and craft moved out of sight to our south southwest.  That path would have taken it directly across the western end of the LAX active runways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched these lights from our different positions in the marina about 30 yards from each other. Scotto was watching through binoculars with another attending witness, and mutual friend Larry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that night MUFONLA has received at least two additional reports from different cities within LA County. These are Hawthorne and Silverlake. The witness in Silverlake took several seconds of Videotape. Our Director of Investigations will assign an independent investigator to these reports and I&#39;m an artist so I will also illustrate what I witnessed as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mark Hunziker State Section Director, MUFONLA &lt;wizseeker@earthlink.net&gt;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mark Hunziker for taking the time to share the information with NUFORC.

Out unit is way in the back on the side of a big hill, it is much darker than most parts of town due to very little light..<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tues.

The wing size was big, very big, Being a runner I think in terms of how far to go, This was how big, Maybe 300 yrd. to 1/4 mile each part of the two wings that made up the V or Triangle. In the center was a bright white circle. It made no sound, it looked to move  very slow passing to the very dark side of the Island and into open ocean area for the next 2000 miles or more. I went to the local police dept. the next day but there was no reports of wha we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the members of my group told a frined who told him that in Arizona in 1998, this same shape was seen in the skys.<n>

These may have been seven spotter or escort planes accompanying a much larger craft in a modified, yet very structured V formation.  The five smaller objects, with one red light each, fanned out evenly spaced to the side and behind the larger craft left wing. The larger craft appeared to have only white light(s).  On the right side of the larger craft were only two other objects (also with one red light each) replicated the same pattern and spacial distance as noticed on the other side of the craft.  The five objects on the larger craft&#39;s leftside (as well as the other two on the right side), each had one bright red light which flashed once (for approximately one second -- much like an airport runway strobe but slower)) in a sequential fashion from the lead object back to the last and then repeated this same sequence as it continued across the night&#39;s sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It began in the northen sky and seemed to cruise at what would be a normal commercial aircraft speed for that altitude taking appoximately 1min/30sec to cross from the norhern most horizon to the southern most horizon. The sound was a gentle whisper and appeared to defy what might have seemed a normal audible sound for so many aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend began watching almost immediately after I spoted this unusual formation.  She did not distinguish 8 separate objects, but felt that it was one composite.  My engineering background and practical mind convinces me it must be eight craft in total, although I could not see eight separate craft.  Is there some practical explanation or answer for this type of formation?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time was corrected by witness to 22:10 hrs.; we have amended the time here.  We spoke at length with the witness, and found her to be exceptionally credible.  She is quite familiar with all types of aircraft, and she stated that what she had observed was no type of a/c with which she is familiar.  PD))<n>
7/23/02 22:05|West Hills|CA|Formation|2 minutes|Uneven "V" formation of white and red lights, trailing ones flashing red, with trail extending over time of a minute or two.|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23985.html|138|ndxe200207| Uneven &#34;V&#34; formation of white and red lights, trailing ones flashing red, with trail extending over time of a minute or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 degrees elevation, starting in north east, ending in south east, travelling slowly (about same speed as small prop plane). Observed from back yard (regular family venue on summer evenings). Almost full moon rising to the south east. Vehicle started as single white-ish ball of light; I thought it was a satelite (almost same speed as a normal 90-120 minute orbit satellite of which we see several a night). But mentioned to wife &#34;can&#39;t be a satellite, too low&#34; (would have been in umbra as eastern aspect).  No other navigation lights seen (we see many small planes and I know their signature well).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, as we watched it travel southward over the San Fernando Valley, it started to develop a long &#34;tail&#34; of red flashing lights, which grew ever loger, such that by the time it stoped extending, there were about 4 or 5 high intensity flashing lights , like ultra-bright plane red navigation lights, extending at about 45 degrees backwards from the parent white-ish ball.   By the time it disappeared from view (buildings), it was underneath the Moon&#39;s location. Overall shape by then was a chevron of lights, with one or two dimmer red lights above and back from the (now) two diffuse constant white-ish lead lights , then back wards for the 4 or 5 trailing lower red flashing lights. As the Moon subtends an angle of about 0.5 degrees diametrically, the extent of the object would have been about three Moon diamters, or about 2 degrees from upper tip, through the middle white, back through the extended red light trail.  There was no sound whatsoever while this was hapening, whereas several minutes later, a small plane in the same region (by elevation angle and navigation light brightness) was easily heard by its engine sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About half way through the event, I called to my son, who was inside, to join my wife and I on the patio, and he brought his binoculars which he had nearby (just returned from a touring vacation).  Binoculars are 8x23mm.  I played them on the object(s), but could discern no solid connection betweenthe lights, nor any additional &#34;navigation&#34; lights, even though by then the object was close to the full Moon, and any wing structure would easily have been visible. (Confirmed later by observing a few small planes to demonstrate what should have been visible).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am perplexed, with many years of aeronautical and astronomical observation behind me, this is the first time I cannot even start to explain what I saw. The only things that come to mind to mimic the phenomenon are: 1) A &#34;V&#34; formation of Canada geese with red flashing nav lights and flashlights on the head birds.   (ridiculous of course, but would match the &#34;no connecting structure&#34; item) 2) A large silent low-flying air-refuelling tanker with its refuelling probe slowly extending as it flew, whose probe was illuminated with red flashing nav lights, and said tanker was making no engine noise, and having its wings directly in line with my line of sight all the time, and having no wing-tip nav lights.  (very unlikely).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no real idea how big the thing was, but by its low elevation and light brightness, it could not have been more than (guess) 5 miles away, or the evening haze and bright Moonlight would have washed it out. Also, its silence indicates it was probably more than a mile away (?). This would make the overall &#34;structure&#34; very large, much larger than a long-winged plane, for example.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP TO ORIGINAL REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is  a follow-up to my report sent in today 28 July 02:     After I finished my report, of a triangular formation of lights, I went back to your web-site, then called my family to the screen. There, with a drawing from the observation in Iowa, was almost exactly what we had seen on the 23rd !  The hair on the back of my neck started crawling !   The only difference was that the reporter from Iowa said he saw a triangular dark shape conecting the lights.  This was not the case for me, as I could not discern , even with binoculars, any connecting structure between the lights, but the shape, elevation above ground, and general features were identical !<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP #2))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Chevron/triangle formation of lights (central white, trailing red flashing) travelling north-south over San Fernando Valley; silent<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is an addendum report to the one filed over the weekend by this resident of West Hills, Ca. re: chevron/triangle formation of lights at 10 pm local on 23 July 2002.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having filed my report, two things happened which casue me to add this addendum: 1) Today 29 July, you updated your files of reports from last week, and I have noticed that there were many other reports identical to my sighting, all at the samr time on the same day,all dscribing a large formation of lights travelling slowly north to south, with the first report from Tehachapi, and the last from Santa Monica.  All these reports (including those between these two extremes) were indicating a straight north-south passage.  This is significant (i.e.I&#39;m not apparently crazy!) 2) On answering your questions and on reflection with other witnesses in my family, we DID see two fast military planes travelling the same path about 15 minutes behind (single-engine jet noise from high altitude, clear view of wings and nav light in bimoculars, my guess F-16&#39;s.

(I am reporting this over one year following the sighting.) However, I have been very careful about reliving the actual event in my mind, just the way it happened, and I&#39;ve taken great care to not allow the reports of others to influence or haze my experience. In fact, what I view as the most fascinating component of my story has not been described in anyone else&#39;s reports about this supposed same craft my friend and I viewed on the night of July 23, 2002.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout this written account, I denote the significant differences in my report to the reports from other Angelinos who viewed a similar object on the same date and near the same time I did with ** surrounding those facts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this night, I was helping my friend move his tools into my house, where he was to stay before flying to New York the next day. As we carried items toward my house from the curb, he asked, &#34;How&#39;s it going around here lately?&#34; Almost jokingly, I responded, &#34;Well...a lot of sky activity tonight, it&#39;s strange.&#34; (I had noticed many planes in the L.A. skies that particular evening, for some reason.)  Just as I made this comment, at 22:05 on this night, I looked up to an object that had caught my sight. It was positioned almost directly above my house, located in the heart of Los Angeles. At first, it seemed to me to possibly be a large blimp - with what I guessed to be ** white and bluish ** or ** white and greenish ** blinking lights along its **oblong shape** - traveling very slowly above my home. As I stood watching it (mouth agape), my friend came out of the house and joked at my expression. He said, &#34;Yeah, right,&#34; in reference to his knowing how I have always wanted to be witness to a UFO...he believed I was still passing a joke, attached to my previous comment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told him to look at what I was looking at. He turned to see what I was seeing. My friend (who is in no way intrigued by the idea of alien spacecrafts exploring our planet) said, &#34;You&#39;re right. Oh my God, you&#39;re right.&#34;  I was in awe of the size of the object. By this time, I comprehended that the object was moving much too slowly to be even a blimp. I yelled excitedly for him to fetch any camera from inside my house. As I watched the object, I slowly and consciously concentrated on what I was seeing. I held my arm out to the coasting object. The best I could judge was that it would have been two feet in length if it were truly located at the edge of my fingertips. I concentrated on the lights I was seeing emitting from the object. As much as I tried, I simply could not decide for certain if the faint lights I saw around this thing were ** white, or if they were blue...I couldn&#39;t even detect if I was seeing green or red lights for sure **. It was strange to look directly at these lights and very consciously not understand what color they were. I finally decided that they cast themselves as a faint &#34;white and bluish&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I answered my friend who yelled from inside, &#34;Where is there a camera?&#34; I saw something else that challenged my concentration. Plainly, the object was beginning to alter its shape as I watched it. ** Slowly, the shape ebbed from an oblong form into a definite triangular figure. ** I watched this occur. I occupied my mind and thoughts on staying focused on these happenings that I had no time to be disbelieving of them. Yet, I was more than mildly curious to how this could be actually happening - to be watching something that was seemingly a structure change forms before my very eyes like this. At this time, it seemed the lights were becoming a little more clear in their emission. ** I was becoming more decided on white and green blinking lights now, with a steady red one located toward the anterior position of this thing, although I am not certain that this &#34;steady&#34; red light was &#34;on&#34; the entire rest of the time I watched the object. The blinking white and green lights seemed to also have some red in it as well during its slow trip over my neighborhood. **  My friend came out of the house with one of my cameras. To my dismay, it was a Polariod instant camera. He handed it to me and looked back up to the sky in the direction where I was looking. I realized then that I was still standing in my own front yard, and the object was still somewhere over my house. In about one minute and thirty seconds, the thing had not moved enough to even take the distance of my rooftop in the sky. My friend&#39;s question to me then verified that I had indeed watched this strange thing change shapes: &#34;Is that still the same thing?&#34;  I very kindly asked him to see if he could locate another one of my cameras (reminding him that this could very well have been an event I had longed for most of my life). He obliged and went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I aimed at the shape with the camera and had trouble spotting it in the night sky any time I tried to view it from the viewfinder. Maybe the lights were too faint, and possibly the camera&#39;s little square viewfinder was caked with dust. Instead of losing viewing time for myself, I simply aimed the camera a number of times toward the slow-moving object and clicked, hoping for the best. I was in my neighbor&#39;s yard by the time I heard my friend clicking with another (disposable) camera from my yard. He said to me, frustrated, &#34;Anytime I look through the camera lens, I can&#39;t see it!&#34;  We both slowly walked southward on our street and through people&#39;s yards, trying to get a good shot of the thing. We did this for roughly ten minutes. I watched the thing continue to move southward, over Los Angeles (seemingly at a fairly close proximity to where LAX - the airport of Los Angeles - is). I remember my friend tiring of the event while I stood near the end of my street, then backing up, to still watch it until the last possible moment. I can not recall what I was viewing at that point in time - nor can I recall at all what it looked like from behind. I just remember being saddened that the sight of it was gone as it finally disappeared behind some tall trees, far in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Summary:  Shape: Oblong, changed to traingular  Noise: None whatsoever  Speed: Incredibly slow (I&#39;m terrible at judging this to mph)  Size: If touching my fingertips, the object would have been two feet in diameter, and almost twelve inches in width, I believe  Lights: Blinking, faint at one point, difficult to discern color (best guess is white and bluish or white and greenish); when shape was altered, I recall seeing a red light at the front end of the object (a steady light, at least for a while) and the other colors were a blinking white and green, sprinkled with more red  Odd feelings during sighting: None whatsoever  Odd occurrences during sighting: None whatsoever  Other witnesses: Friend  Evidence: Photographs (see below)  Of course, we got to see the instantaneous developing pictures right away - they rendered nothing. I scanned those and tried using all sorts of filters and utilities from different computer imaging applications to no avail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somehow, I lost the disposable camera with the photographs of the objects. That camera was not recovered until last week. It now sits in a desk drawer in my office, awaiting film processing. I work at a major motion picture studio in Hollywood, where there is a Camera Department (in my group), so I am hopeful of finally developing the images of this object we saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will update.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were red in color and appeared similar to those found on rescue vehicles.  The object appeared to be a single structure.  The body of this aircraft looked as though it was a very dark color.  What really caught my eye was how massive this object was and how preportionally slow it was moving in the sky.  I have never seen anything like this before. but I feel extremely confident that this was not a conventional aircraft.  It was like nothing I have ever seen before.  However, I have heard of sighting of this type of aircraft by climbers around the Mt. Whitney area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many other reports.  PD))<n>

The exact shape of the oject is best described as a wide arc. Not a &#34;V&#34; or a &#34;U&#34;. It is possible that it was a formation of smaller aircraft, but with the naked eye it appeared to be solid, as the lights stayed within the same proximity of eachother throughout the entire sighting. I noticed it at 10 PM, Daylight Savings Time, moving slowly from the north to the south above our home in Tehachapi, CA. From its northerly position the leading edge was lit with blinking lights, white and redish. My husband and I were not aware of sound until it was directly overhead, then it sounded like one very high altitude jet. There was one amber light to the rear left side that did not blink. Two other aircraft were in the sky at the same time. One, which appeared to be a &#34;normal&#34; smaller aircraft behind and possibly lower but traveling in the same direction, and another to the left of the object traveling in the opposite direction. I tried to measure the size of the object with my fingers to give me some idea of its size, but with no idea of the altitude any accuracy was impossible. None-the-less, I will include that information. As it continued southward, no longer directly overhead but still close, it was approximately the length of my index finger, about 3 inches long, in a wide arc shape. The unblinking amber light to it&#39;s left rear, mentioned above was approximately an inch and 1/2 behind it. We watched it until it was obscured by the small hill in front of our house. My husband and I are both in our 50s with grown children. Neither one of us have ever seen anything like this before.<n>

I was talking to my neighbor when I noticed a large chevron shape of red twinkling lights slowly moving across the sky. I pointed it out to my neighbor and we watched this shape of lights move slowly across the sky. We could not make out a mass, only the lights lighting in a pattern back and forth across the chevron shape. My Dad&#39;s house is in the flight pattern of LA International Airport, however the planes fly in an East to West or West to East flight pattern. This object was moving in a North to South pattern. An airplane flew over the object and was much smaller in comparison. It couldn&#39;t have been an airplane, it was just too big and moving too slowly and it didn&#39;t make a sound.<n>

My dad was with me at the time and we thought it was just a weather balloon.  But then 3 more of the same shape and sized objects appeared.  They all gathered in a group and just hovered really close to each other.  I told my dad to go inside and get a pair of bonoculars so that I could get a closer view of the objects.  I kept them in my sight until he returned, but by the time I looked through the bonoculars the had vanished.  ***The size of the objects were about the size of a toothpick if you were looking directly down at the point end (so the circumfrance of a toothpick, which is very small).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I quickened pace to the end of the houses to watch it further, but it had gone. PLease note i tought it was a 747 by the chape of the array, however, a smaller passenger liner an airbus flew into view and seemed much lower, and dissapeared into the cloud cover, this means what ever the aircraft, it could not have been the size of a 747 at that altitude.  For reference the craft/s were traveling ENE&#39;wards over WHETSTONE TOWARDS ENFIELD (north london suburbs )<n>

I was looking to the sky, it was mostly clear, some sparse clouds. I noticed this &#34;star&#34; that was quite bright I was looking at it for a moment and at that moment I had the impression it moved but since the Bus moved (it was a double decker bus I was sitting on the top floor by the window), I thought that was the bus moving, so I took my eyes of for a while. The bus then stops once again and I was getting quite irritated because I was going to Victoria Station to pick up my mother who were coming from the airport via train and I was a bit late. I wanted to be there before 21:30, so in my irritation I looked up (my eyes were turned to the window of the bus) while the bus was stopped and I actually see the start moving in a random fashion and it moves towards this cloud. As I look at it a bit amazed my outmost amazement only came when I notice this cigar shaped object near a cloud. At first I didn&#39;t want to believe what I was seeing, so I thought it was maybe a zeppelin, but then the shape was too slim to be one. The bus moved a few feet but I could still see it.The bus stooped again for a while and still in disbelief I look at it and I notice this strange myst around it, with some sort of faint glow and furthermore I could see the craft slowly disappearing in front of my eyes. I wanted to tell people in the bus &#34;Look!!!!&#34;, but then to tell them to look at what??? A UFO??? People would have took me for a kook.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its shape cylindrical and quite dark. I could see a slight seam running through the middle of it. It had two blinking lights, one red and one blue at each end. In my judgement it was a fairly big craft for the height of the clouds, maybe 30m-50m (I am European living in London).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is my second sighting of strange craft in the sky. My first one was not so amazing, it was a lopsided triangular dark craft with four static lights(red in the middle, blue, yellow, white) when I was young (about twelve). I havn&#39;t paid anymore attention to the subject since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now if the these craft don&#39;t belong to any government in this planet to whom do they belong?  I have reported this before but I never seen it anywhere not even on the site I have reported it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was 2.00am last night a storm had rolled through Mississauga and then on over Toronto. My sons called me to their bedroom to see what they said were weird lights in the sky over the lake. What I witnessed at first was a series of lights on the clouds which at first I took to be spot lights from the ground illuminating the clouds a not uncommon experience. My opinion of this changed when one of the twisting rotating lights in the clouds suddenly got to the edge of the cloud, when it did it was brighter than the sun to look at. This went on for over an hour with the lights wiggling and constantly appearing at the edge of the cloud as these immensely bright spots of light. A second storm was rolling in from the west behind us, there were some huge flashes of lightning inside the clouds which of course illuminated the entire sky as these took place it was obvious that there was a very large triangular object in the clouds, the repeated flashes and the blocking of light (shadow) that this thing caused made it obvious that it was indeed solid. From one flash to the next it had moved horizontally and had got smaller indicating that it was higher. After about 6 or 7 lightning flashes it was no longer visible. I went back to looking at the lights spinning through the sky above the lake. They started to slow down and remain in one place but always glowing, there was a sort of illuminated grid pattern (hard to explain) but like a rectangle with square dull lights in a grid pattern like a an old fashioned multipaned window is as best as I can describe it. This was evident for only a matter of seconds, when it disappeared the lights started squiggling in a sinuous manner, this they would do as they darted across the top of the clouds, constantly they would appear at the edge of the cloud and sparkle from blue white to an intense amber colour. I left to answer the call of nature, when I came back only one light remained, constantly lit and very bri! ght. The others had (this according to my two adult sons) moved in a wobbling and sinusoidal way out of sight to the south west. The last light remained in place very bright for over ten minutes, it then moved up into the clouds getting fainter until it completely disappeared. I am aware that alot of folks will think that we observed a simple thunderstorm, what we saw has nothing to do with any storm. It was remote from it, intelligent and from what we saw obviously solid in nature. I have seen some of these things many times now, and I am becoming convinced that there is some form of intelligent control of this phenomena. Our vantage point to see this event is a 15th floor apartment very near the lake, our view goes from the WSW all the way to ESE plus a little bit.<n>

I think the people who &#34;SEE&#34; them are quacks... but... I am definately not a quack. We were on our way up a dirt road when I noticed above a hill about 15 miiles out of town, there was a huge HUGE brilliant light source. I thought nothing of it and started to &#34;Wish upon a star&#34; for fun when I noticed it move very fast up then across to the right. I got the drivers attention and we pulled the car to an abrupt stop. At first we assumed it was a satellite, but it was too close to the earth... actually in the atmosphere. We watched it for a few minutes and noticed it change position constantly. Not very far, but enough to see a streak of light. It was cigar shaped in theory, but seemed to assume different positions so that it seemed almost elliptical or circular. This object seemed only a few thousand miles above or less. After a while we decided if it was still there the next evening it would have been nothing and relaxed in our seats and watched the clouds by the moon. (The position of the craft was NE of the moons position that evening.) We checked on it a few rapid times in the next minutes... paranoid as he was... but when we looked back at exactly 11:07. It was gone!!! I was unfortunate to have any camera, but i will keep mine attatched to my hip from now on. I know how important fact is to science. (I want to be a meteorologist.) Good luck in any investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the sighting occurred during the evening.  We have amended the time here.  PD))<n>

We dismissed it as a helicopter and continued on with the job at hand when we noticed the object was hovering above us, but did not make a sound at all.  As we stared at the green oval of light, it began to move a very fast rate of speed.  In no time it was off in the distance, leaving a vapar trail of green light behind it.  There it stayed for what seemed like five minutes, then it began moving again.  This time it flew behind a cloud, at which time the cloud threw off a brilliant green light.  The object never came from behind the cloud, and within the hour the cloud had disapated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  We presume the witness meant a year of 2002, not 1902, and we have amended the date above.  PD))<n>

If someone can read French you&#39;ll see that I&#39;ve put more info, well it&#39;s not really info about the sighting, but my personal experience with flying &#34;objects&#34; as I&#39;ve worked for several years at Brussels Intl. AP. Thanks Bonjour Mr. Bougard, Ceci est un mail que j&#39;ai envoié à la NASA à propos de qqchose que j&#39;ai vu en ardennes (Barvaux). Il n&#39;y a pas grand chôse d&#39;explications, parce-que il n&#39;y avait pas grand chôse à voir. Mais ce que j&#39;ai vu était quand même bizarre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Je vous envoie le mail tant que je l&#39;ai envoié à la NASA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Sir, Sorry to bother you with this question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On sunday, July 21th at about 02am, I saw above the ardennes in Belgium 02 lights moving in different directions (cannot tell you if north to south or ...). They both were high in the sky, moving at tremendous speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve worked for more than 04 years at Brussels Int. Airport, night and day, so I know for sure that they were not airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On airplanes, even at 30.000 feet, you can see lights blinking, what was not the case that day. At that moment I saw an airplane crossing the sky, at (I think) about maximum height : I saw the blinking lights and it didn&#39;t move by far as fast as the 02 lights I saw that night. The light was pretty clear, a bit of a yellow-orange colour and moved both in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I don&#39;t believe in ufo&#39;s, so I think I saw (a friend of mine saw it aswell) 02 satelites passing by who were reflecting sunlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is this possible? Can you see from earth with the bare eye a satelite flying by? If not, what could it be? Sorry to have taken some of your precious time, but you guys are the only ones I can think off who could give me a clear answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much, Jo DEBUSSCHER 1500 HALLE Mail : Info@abibat.be or MacRasta@hotmail.com ps : I really would appreciate an answer, even if it&#39;s only 01 sentence. Thanks Comme j&#39;ai écrit ici, je suis a 100% sur que ce n&#39;etait pas des avions, les lumières étaient tres claires, mais impossible de définir une forme.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Concernant autres articles : les &#34;triangles&#34; durant la nuit : il est tres facile de confondre une forme &#34;trainglulaire&#34; quand en réalité il s&#39;agit d&#39;un avion : comme à l&#39;arrière de l&#39;avion il n&#39;y a pas (ou tres faible) de feux, on peut assumer de voir un triangle. Mais il faut en tenir compte qu&#39;on a presque toujours une source de lumière en proximité de soi-même, donc en regardant vers le ciel, les lumières les plus faibles sont en première temps &#34;invisible&#34; parce-que l&#39;oeuil human doit se aclimatiser au noir. Si on continue a regarder ces &#34;triangles&#34;, apres un certain temps d&#39;aclimatisation, on commence a distinguer la forme d&#39;un avion...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mais je vous le jure, ce que j&#39;ai vu ce jour la, ce n&#39;etait pas des avions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Et autre chôse commun avec les &#34;sightings&#34;; tout le monde à qui on a essayé d&#39;expliquer le fénomène nous à pris pour des imbéciles&#34; Si vous avez plus de questions, ou le texte n&#39;est pas claire, ou autres, toujours le bienvenue de me contacter au numéro suivant : 0486/43.22.60.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS : je m&#39;excuse pour les erreurs en français, je ne suis qu&#39;un pauvre flamand.<n>
7/21/02 14:00|Kitimat (Canada)|BC|Disk|seconds|There is allot of detail on this saucer shaped object.|7/30/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23977.html|161|ndxe200207| There is allot of detail on this saucer shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was recently on holidays in the Kitimat, B.C. area. We popped in from Terrace just for a short visit, and when we were leaving, we pulled up at the view point by the fire hall. I said to the kids, I wanted a picture of them (Kitimat 1). I took the picture, but they were goofing off, so I said I wanted to take one more. I took it (Kitimat 2), and as soon as I took it, they ran off to play. I walked up to the red flower, and zoomed in a little to get a shot of the scenery (Kitimat 3). I snapped the picture, but did not notice anything unusual in the shot. When I downloaded the camera that night in Burns Lake, I saw the disk shaped object in the middle. The next day after looking closer I saw the second object to the left of it. And after allot of further review, you can see two other spots, but they are very faint. All these photo&#39;s are only about 20 to 30 seconds apart. The thing that amazes me is that nothing is there in the second photo, but there they are in the third. They had to have been travelling at a great speed to get there. I don&#39;t think I noticed anything in the camera because of the speed in which they are travelling. I phoned the Terrace airport the next day (Monday), and the only traffic they had around 2:00 pm was a Hawker (Lear Jet type), and a Dash Eight. Other that that a couple of small planes. No one had reported anything unusual as well. I did phone again on Thursday to see if anyone had reported anything, and still nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The photo&#39;s were taken with a pretty good camera (Olympus D-40), 4 mega pixel digital camera. But I have since found out that jpegs are not very good for blowing up images. The more you save an image, the more it gets distorted. I have had the photo&#39;s copyrighted, because originally I thought there maybe some equipment that would be able to blow it up better than I can. With my computer I can make out , what looks to be windows, and another some type of port on the lower left side. It is definitely disk shaped, but with all the light reflecting on it, it looks like a bunch of knuckles around it. I am sending you the copyrighted version, and I am also sending you the original version. I don&#39;t know how clear the original version will be for you, I know when I blow it up with a different program, it is more blurry than blowing it up with my camera software. The problem is I can&#39;t print the blown up image with my camera software, I have to open it in a different program that lets me print the blown up image, resulting in a more distorted view. I do have an email to Olympus, hoping they can help me. If this thing can be blown up with very good results, it will be the best picture caught on camera, because of al the detail the picture can offer. I have since seen allot of other photo&#39;s, and most of them look so plain (like putting two saucers together) they are just all metal, no details at all. The way the light hits it at the of the craft, you can tell the top half is curved up and the bottom half curves down, forming a saucer. the light reflecting on the craft shows allot of detail. I just have to have a clearer image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, it is just total fluke that I got this thing on camera. I think that these things are travelling so fast, nobody gets a chance to see these, unless they stop, or if it&#39;s at night (if they have lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have examined the photos sent by the witness.  They are high quality photos, but the image of an anomalous object appears to us to be ambiguous.  Our guess would be that the object is a large bird, possibly an eagle, flying away from the camera.  However, the photographer responds that in the original digital photo, it clearly is not a bird.  The witness has been directed to Dr. Jeff Sainio, and Dr. Bruce Maccabee to have them look at the photo.  We will seek permission to post the photo to our homepage.  PD<n>

The sky was overcast and there were a few lighting strikes to the west, but there were cleaer skies to the north and east. As I began to take a bite into a sandwich, a bright orange/white light rose up over the northern horizon.The lights were about half the size of my thumb at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A total of five lights appeared and manuevered into a formation. They all began dirtectly north of us and floated (without any sound) into a formation north east of us out over Long Lake. Two or three time, one light made numerous flashes. After a few minutes, one by one, the lights blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About fifteen minutes later, 3 smaller lights silently floated over our heads from south to north in a span of about 1-3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 2 green lights with a red light in the middle. As the lights passed over head, they also made no sound and were moving back and forth in relation to one another. I have video of the first formation of lights.<n>

The object cast a shadow on the moon that was only about 10% larger than the object itself. The duration from north to south pole was only about 2.5 to 3 seconds. The object itself was ink black with no detail other than this visible. The previously mentioned shadow cast by the object was semi transparent and surface detail of the moon was clearly visible though it. The object itself was jet black.<n>

First , one object in the form of 7 - 8  ligths of various colors placed in one horizontal line moved across the night sky. The speed of it was faster than that of a plane and no sound was heard. Then after about ten minutes two identical objects were observed flying side by side. Suddenly, one of the objects drifted sharply to the left and separated from another. After a moment, it  returned to its previous path. In a few seconds, both objects disappeared. Again, no sound was heard although the objects were flying right over my head. It is difficult to estimate the objects&#39; size but they they took about an inch of space in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a high school teacher and this is my first clear UFO experience.<n>

Anything that looked unusual I was quite sceptical about and always looked for an earthly explanation. One occurrence although I was not able to explain away so easily. It happened while some friends and I were camping at Restoule Provincial Park in July of 2002. The time would have been about 11:00P.M or so. Five of us were at the waters edge shooting the breeze when one of us noticed something near the moon. As we all glanced up we noticed a black rectangular shaped object in close proximity to the moon. It moved from the top left down and seemed to be in an orbit around the moon. As it descended in a circular motion around the moon it slowly reached the bottom portion and than drifted further off to the left and gradually disappeared. Strangely enough, this object actually appeared to be the same distance as the moon which would mean it had to be of incredible proportion. I cannot obviously confirm this though. The whole incident took place over a matter of 5  minutes or so as we were all able to comment on it several times. The size of the object in proportion to the moon would have been about 1/5 its radius. What it was I have no idea but we all have talked about it since. It never unnerved us at the time, it was simply a curiosity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnesses personal information deleted by HBCC UFO)  Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Brian Vike for sharing this report with NUFORC.

Observed light with naked eye for approx 5 secs, then with pair of small 8x power field binoculars for approx 10 more secs.  Observed light for approx 5 more secs with naked eye and then light simply vanished as it neared the constellation Cassiopeia.  No flashing lights, such as strobe or navigation lights were observed at any time, nor any high altitude contrails associated with engine exhaust.  No sound emitted from the light nor were any aircraft observed in the area.  After light vanished, monitored sky for approx. 10 minutes for light to reappear with negative results.  Conditions were clear sky with almost full moon.  Monitored sky the following night (07/21) from 2200 - 2230 hours to see if light would reappear.  Effort resulted in negative results.  Have 26 years experience with military (Air Force) and very familiar with aircraft operations.  Also have amateur experience skywatching satellites in orbit.  This object was far too bright to be a satellite.  My vision has been tested at 20/20.

Your credentials with the USAF appear to speak for themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the tests as to whether the object might have been a satellite is the amount of the sky the object traversed in the time you were looking at it.  Can you estimate the angle it covered, measured in degrees, it covered during the 20 seconds you watched it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you again for sharing the information with our Center!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,  Peter Davenport<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((RESPONSE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes, I would estimate the light travelled approx 55 degrees.  I base this estimate by using my arms as a reference; by facing due east and stretching out my arms to point due north and south, the distance  between my outstretched arms would be equal to approx 180 degrees.  I first viewed the object about 20 degrees to the right of my head and then tracked it to a point about 35 degrees to the left of my head when the light vanished.

My neice (32 years old) went out at approximately 9:45 p.m. not knowing that the asteroid showers were not to take place until 5:00 am or so in the morning.  She came rushing in the house and said she had seen &#34;the comet&#34; come down through the atmosphere with a very large tail.  Not knowing what she was talking about..I explained that we were not suppose to see a comet and that what we were to see was just an asteroid shower that was to take place in the early morn. She was really frighten so I went outside with my binoculars and telescope.  In the west, approximately at 10.40 p.m.  I seen on the horizon which look to be a very bright light.  I assumed it was a planet and set my scope on it. Because of atmospheric conditions I seen this very bright light jump all over in my scope.  I realized then that it was not a planet and told my niece and my 2 children (ages 12 and 13) to look in that direction.  It sounds really stupid but it had a very bright light in the middle and a red light on one side and a green light on the other.  I hate saying that because it seems like I am making it up.  I watched it through my scope for about 5 minutes trying to get my husband to come out when it started to ascend slowly straight up.  About 40 seconds later, it just shot up in the sky to where it seemed to be a bright star.  It hovered there for a minute and proceeded to travel north.  I looked at it until I could see it no more.  This all was in the vicinity of where my niece seen the &#34;comet&#34;. I could not tell the shape of the craft due to it&#39;s position and light.<n>
7/20/02 21:40|San Jose|CA|Other|1 minute|Amber wedge shaped object with a companion object.|7/26/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23836.html|170|ndxe200207| Amber wedge shaped object with a companion object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live three miles East of Reed-Hilview Airport in San Jose, CA.  I was observing a South bound single engine aircraft climbing in altitude following takeoff and the normal 90 degree turn normally performed to avoid entering the traffic path of aircraft departing from SJC.  I noticed an unusual reflection which at first appeared to me to be a very light colored balloon reflecting what I believed to be the amber color of the city lights below.  The object appeared straight West of me at about 70 degrees, well above the aircraft I was observing.  At first I beleived the object was only two hundred or so meters from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object continued on what appeared to be a South East direction, I watched it and noticed that the shape was more of a wedge shape.  I became aware that the winds were calm and that the object was moving at a rate of speed far beyond wind velocity.  There were no distinct lights or sound produced by the object and because of this, the altitude is difficult to estimate beyond my belief of at least 1 mile or better above the ground.  I reside in the Eastern Foothills of the city at around 300 Feet above sea level in comparison to the valley floor at 80 feet above sea level.  The object&#39;s altitude appeared to remain consistent and I was hoping to get a better view of the object as it&#39;s direction of travel was bringing it towards the full moon.  Unfortunately, the object, slightly larger than half the size of the moon, did not pass into the moonlight but the moon did briefly display a companion object to the right and slightly behind the object that was not previously visable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued a consistent direction of travel, disappearing around a minute after the initial observation.  What seemed unusual about this is the object speed, the shape and that as it passed into an area where city lights would have dissapated the reflection but the consistent coloration and shape did not reflect that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen weather ballons lanched from near the San Jose international airport during the day and I&#39;m sure that San Jose State University also launches them at night.  The prevaling winds are such that when they are launched, they do pass over the area were I live.  I&#39;ve seen these ballons before during the day and they are usually visable only when winds are fast enough to carry them over before they are too high to see.  Those types of winds were not present tonight.  I would readily dismiss any observation day or night as one of these balloons.  If for some reason it was a weather ballon, it was huge and it was moving a lot faster than I have observed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Object was fairly slow moving, appearing from behind the treeline and disappearing behind the treeline, moving from right to left in the southwest sky.  There are significant hills in area, between 1000 and 1200 feet above sea level in our township.  While moving, the lights maintained their distance from each other, appearing to be on one object.  OBJECT MADE NO SOUND.  Approximate distance from our vantagepoint was 1.5 to 2.5 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While on phone with local law enforcement, two single engine aircraft were observed in the air, VERY high, and their engines could be heard clearly.<n>

I did video tape the object for several minutes. The object then appeared to go straight up into space, and was still visable for sevaral minutes but the color changed to a bluish color and it apeared as two stars.<n>

We all watched the formation float down the coast past the Kure Beach pier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What eludes me is the absence of any sound and the strict line of flashing red lights that must have stretched for a half mile.  All lights were flashing in sync. In my opinion, helicopters and/or planes could not have flown in a strict line especially without noise and the number of planes or helicopters it would have taken to make a formation that long would be huge.    I asked a few people standing near me for an explanation, but noone had a clue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was cylinder in shape, it was a charcol gray, with pale blue/gray ouline, that seemed to glow. Other than the shape, and the ouline glow, it moved fast and silent thru the sky. There was no sound as it moved. On two opposite sides of of the object, there were two curved points that went towards the inside of the object. It seemed to tumble as it moved thru the sky. It moved in a smooth and swift manner and then disappeared thru the trees in a north easterly direction.<n>

It was about 2am and I decided to sit out in a large park overlooking a large part of east vancouver. Looking above stargazing/finishing a can of sprite i noticed 4 stars moving in formation. After a closer look I noticed the outline of a triagle shaped craft. It had 3 brighter lights on the points of the triangle and one dull blue light in the centre. I did believe this to be an airplane or I was just plain going nuts. It lasted for nearly half an hour until i saw the lights spin in an almost 180 degree turn. I nearly had a heart attack and got up about to run while looking at the object. But as soon as I got up there was a quick blur and there wasn&#39;t anythinge left to see. And last but not least my cell phone no longer works after that night.<n>

It was a lovely night to be outside. The sky was full of stars and it was nice and warm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me, My sister and our friend wanted to go inside to get some marshmallows and hot dogs but we did not bring out a flashlight and I like to have a flashlight in the dark so we were going to the shed to get a flashlight the shed is only about 10 feet or so from the fire pit.  So we walked in got the flash light and walked out with me in front then our friend then my sister as i stepped out I saw two bright lights directly over us we could have reached up and touched it the shed is not that tall and it was probably at the same height as the top of the shed or a little below the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I was the only one who saw it but I found out different.  We were astounded at it.  It could not have been a plane or anything of that sort it made no sound it was completely silent and no plane is that small and no plane makes no sound and no plane could get that close. more mysterious is the lights were there for so short yet there was no sight of anything coming or leaving. just the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We wondered if my dad had seen this or anything he might have been able to tell us so we knew what it was.  He had seen nothing.  We all saw it. my dad didn&#39;t, yet he was only 10 feet or so away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It bugged me what it could have been I have no answer but I know it probably was nothing known to our society.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Then I started looking around and noticed that it was a starlit cloudless night. Well then I surmised that may be because it was low in the sky that it was the moon partially hidden by a hill in the distance. That was when I begin looking around to make sure it was even the moon. I glanced over my left shoulder and saw the moon. So then I got excited and went home (approx. a mile away) and got my video camera. I went to the parking lot of this church I attend because it was on a hill with a much better view, in my rush however, I did not get my tripod, but I did manage to get the object on video and took still pictures from the video. The sighting lasted about a minute or two before the object disappeared like someone turning off the light. I have never seen anything like it and would like some rational input on the subject.

I observed a bright, and what seemed to be very high-altitude object overhead.  The sky was still too light for stars or planets, but it was similar to the size and intensity of Venus. I knew it wasn&#39;t Venus since it was directly overhead.  I ran into my house to grab my 8x25 power binoculars.  When I returned, the object had drifted slightly but was roughly in the same place.  I got on my back and observed the object through the binoculars.  I have very good eyesight and focused on the shiny object that seemed to be ovoid.  I then observed a small point of light revolving around the ovoid at a 7:00 to 1:00 attitude/orbit in a clock-wise direction with a frequency of about three seconds.  I ran back in the house to grab my cell phone and call a friend to describe what I was seeing.  When I returned, the object had drifted slightly to the southwest.  As I was describing my observations to my friend on the phone, the object suddenly and almost instantly separated into a group of approximately 20 to 30 small points.  There were no flames, colors or smoke to indicate any explosion.  It just seemed to separate.  Approximately three of the smaller objects were brighter and easier to see than the others, but it was now a distinguishable group of drifting objects.  I observed that the one piece that had been revolving around the ovoid was still in somewhat the same motion, but no longer around any object.  At first I thought it was falling, but then realized it was just drifting.  A few moments later, an object entered my field of vision approaching the group from the west and stopped.  It was about the same brightness as the original object but seemed to be triangular.  I thought it was a fighter jet, but it stopped.  Immediately, another triangular object of the same size and brightness approached the group from the north and stopped opposite the other object so as to surround the group from the east and west.  Just then, the group of objects d! isappear ed, and then the western triangular object disappeared.  The sky became hazy, and completely obscured the one remaining eastern triangular object.  The clouds remained for approximately 20 minutes and then dissipated. By that time the stars had begun to appear, and there was no sign of the objects.  Looking through your sighting reports, I saw a similar (but brief) description from someone in Hogansville, GA.  Any ideas what this could have been?<n>

At this point, coincidentally, a Passenger jet was also entering south Florida Airspace from the South East, high enough to create a vapor trail. At this time, the &#34;Unidentified Object&#34; appeared to be standing still, directly in the path where the jetliner would soon pass. As the jetliner approached the object, suddenly, the object maneuvered its way down from the path of the jetliner, which from my &#34;Viewing Vantage point,&#34; avoided the collision. After the jet passed the high noon position, the object returned directly on the path of the jet where the vapor trail was left, &amp; hovered there until it began to ascend until it disappeared from eyesight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2nd Sighting - At this point, about 2 minutes after the 1st sighting, another similar object appeared from the very same position &amp; angle in the south, &amp; began the same trajectory of flight towards the high noon sky, while the sun&#39;s light revealed a colorful spectrum of light flash, as the object hurdled across the horizon. Unlike the 1st object, this object did not appear to stop moving, as it also disappeared in the high noon sky. At this point, I placed a call to my local authorities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3rd Sighting - A third object began an identical trajectory across the South Horizon. By this time, I grabbed my &#34;Camcorder,&#34; &amp; began filming its unusual flight patterns. When my local authorities arrived at my home, the provided the officer with a copy of my videotape. The officer told me that she was going to confirm the sightings, with local &#34;FAA Authorities.&#34; Strangely enough, about an hour later, the officer decided to return to my house in person to confirm that local FAA Authorities &#34;DID NOT&#34; report any Unidentified Flying Objects over South Florida airspace.<n>

No trail, sound, blinking lights, just a point of light. I thought it was a satellite or the space station and went inside to tell the wife to hurry outside. I then went back outside looking for it but did not see anything. I knew it was moving so fast it would already be past the trees. Then from the same point in the sky I saw a point of light take off in the same direction. This time I watched it till is vanished overhead. It got very dim and disappeared. From my experience it was nothing like a meteor. I did not think it was strange at the first time, but when I went back outside and saw the same thing again that was weird. I just wished I had watched it the first time to see if it slowly disappeared.<n>

Tamalpais. Suddenly, into the field of view from upper right came a rapidly descending wedge-shaped or V-shaped formation of about half a dozen amber orbs or balls of light. They dispersed instantly and then I could see several of them individually darting about in rapid straight-line moves, changing direction radically and instantly by 90 degrees or so. One of them appeared to move upward to where the aircraft was moving along slowly, then zipped away again, though these lights could have been much further away. After a few seconds of these highly unusual movements they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe them to have either been some US military test of antigravity vehicles or something like that, or they were UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi, Peter,<n> <n><n> Yes, I am sure that the evening of July 18 was when I saw the bizarre phenomena over Mt. Tamalpais here in Marin County, California. I wrote down the basic information the next morning, but the press of other things caused the delay in reporting it to you. (I enjoy hearing you on the Jeff Rense program, and I am really appreciative of the work both of you are doing.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some additional background information:  The aircraft (assuming it WAS an a/c) that I had cause to look at through binoculars had a (to me) unusual appearance, though possibly explainable. Rather than<n> <n><n> the usual landing lights of airliners approaching the Bay Area from the west or northwest, this a/c had one very large, very bright light in front, and a single flashing light on the tail. It seemed to be moving<n> <n><n> very slowly. It might have been a helicopter, but night had fallen and it wasn&#39;t possible to see its<n> <n><n> configuration. I could not determine how close it was or how close were the multiple ufo&#39;s that then entered the picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I was ready with binoculars when the aircraft appeared was because I had seen another<n> <n><n> bizarre-looking phenomenon four nights prior to that, on the 14th. The 18th was the first time I had a<n> <n><n> chance to keep my eye on that view of the mountain, since I had had to work late elsewhere the nights of the 15th, 16th, and 17th. On the evening of the 18th I had an intuitive flash to keep an eye on that view, a not unpleasant task, as there was a bright sunset and the mountain was spectacular silhouetted against the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here are my notes about the July 14th phenomenon, written on the 16th:  I did record on tape my immediate impressions of a bizarre phenomenon with a (probable) military aircraft night before last. To try to remember from this distance, as I sit looking out and up at Mount Tamalpais and the western/southwestern sky, the images I saw. There had been an earlier inundation of chemically induced clouds, well-mixed off the coast with available moisture, thus more filled out, less sinewy or webby. It provided for a particularly colorful sunset which in its late stages I was studying through the field glasses for any more tell-tale signs of manmade origin. Just then a silhouetted a/c came into view, seemingly above the eastern flank of the mountain. As it flew over the summit it started emitting illuminations, very flame-like at times [the bluish color of natural gas flame], the likes of which I have never seen nor heard. One of the projections of this luminous material appeared beneath the fuselage. It was very large and had a definite circular shape but it looked three-dimensional, that is, the luminous mass sagged or stretched downward like a huge bubble of light.  Then, after various smaller &#34;flickerings,&#34; perhaps near the engines, a plume of the luminous material emitted from the tail of the plane, starting small and billowing out into a parachute-shaped light. the plane stopped doing any more of this and seemingly at about the same time altered its course (to port) and left the area. It had a small tail boom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone else reported phenomena around here during that period? I am told that there is a MOA (Military Operations Area) off the coast, but I haven&#39;t had access to an aeronautical chart to see if the orbs I saw on the 18th could have been in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your interest.

I had my windows down and heard no sound coming from the direction of the flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember looking down at my clock reading 10:55pm. The object then began making a slow but level left turn. At this point I could see the underside of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a long triangled shape with bright round lights at each corner aswell as on each side of the craft with a rotating blue light in the center of the craft. From the ground lights reflecting off the craft I could tell the ship was a solid black color. A thin strip of dim lights went around the side of the ship. As it made a complet 180 degree turn it slowly droped just feet above the tree line. I hovered over a thick pach of trees just behind a small car dealership. I then quickly pulled into the dealership lot. Odly enough as i looked down at my clock it still read 10:55pm. I then stepped out of my car and procceded to walk twards the object. At this point I was approx 150-200 ft away from the object. I could clearly make out the shape of the craft yet it made no sound. I estimated the length of the object at about 4-5 car lenghts long and about 15-20 ft tall. As I got closer it suddenly started to move farther back behind the trees while maintaining a perfectly level flight. At this point I had remembered that I had a camera in my car. As i ran back to my car I could see other motorist slowing down to look at the object but no one stopped. As i reached down to grab my camera out of the side pocket of my car door i looked back up twards where i last saw the object and to my suprise the craft had vanished!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

I turned and looked in the direction he pointed which was about dead south.  There were two lights at a distance about 15 degrees off the horizon moving in a general northeast direction over Lake Huron.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to be playing a game of tag with one leading and the other following but gaining ground then overtakeing the lead light and the roles reversing.  The lights changed back and forth from about a violet color to yellow.  Distance and size were hard to judge but they appeared about the size of a penny held at arms length.  Their speed and course were erratic but the general direction of travel was northeast.  There was no sound that I could hear but it seemed these objects were at quite a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for about 5 minutes until they were almost dead east of us then they shot straight up at incredable speed and vanished from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been a sceptic about this type of thing and still am to some degree but I cant imagine what &#34;normal&#34; thing these lights could have been.<n>

This repeated two times an then off to the left of the five lights there was just a single flash of light but it wasn&#39;t anywhere near the other five.  We then went around a turn that the trees blocked the sky an when we got around the turn it was know where to be seen.  I know there are metor showers going on but metor&#39;s don&#39;t fall in a stright line an not like what i saw.

Behind that aircraft we observed what looked like another aircraft making what appeared to be an &#34;S&#34; turn for spacing on final.  Immeidately I knew it wasn&#39;t another aircraft as it had no real distinct shape other than a mass.  I thought for a moment that it might be a bird, but I watched it for another minute and that is when it really got my attention.  Not knowing the &#34;shape&#34; or size of the object I couldn&#39;t tell how far away it was but after a left to right movement, it just stopped.  It was a dark mass with no real edges.  It almost seemed like an extremely large piece of ash.  We watched it for another minute and it did not move again.  It just sat stationary out there on the final for the runway.  I was very intriqued but work called.  About 5 minutes later I returned to see if it was still there, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate.  PD))<n>

7/17/02 04:45|Cleveland|TX|Flash|6 min|My daughter and I were traveling on Hwy 105W between Moss Hill and Cleveland TX about 4:30 am.  There was not much traffic on the road|7/30/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23925.html|202|ndxe200207| My daughter and I were traveling on Hwy 105W between Moss Hill and Cleveland TX about 4:30 am.  There was not much traffic on the road and we were late so I was ttravelling at 70+ mph.  We had passed Moss Hill and were traveling toward Cleveland.  I noticed a white &#39;strobe&#39; light through the tops of the trees North of the Hwy.  I just thought it was a radio tower strobe, and didn&#39;t pay much attention to it.  Then I noticed that with one of the &#39;strobe&#39; flashes there were about 6-8 bright lights &#39;attached&#39; to the main &#39;strobe&#39; part extending in an arched pattern (like 1/2 of a parabola: from 0,0 to 3,6).  I thought it was strange, but continued to think it was a radio tower.  I didn&#39;t even wake my daughter up.  The next time the &#39;strobe&#39; lit, I didn&#39;t see the &#39;tentacle&#39; lights.  Then on the 3rd or 4th strobe, the tentacle lights were there again, but this time they were vertical to the main &#39;strobe&#39; light.  I thought this was odd, so I kept watching it.  Also, the &#39;strobe&#39; was directly in front of the road, not behind the trees.  I could see it without any interference from the trees.  I still thought it was a tower.  A few more &#39;strobes&#39; and then the &#39;tentacle&#39; lights were visible again- this time arched to the left of the main &#39;strobe&#39;(again, 1/2 of a parabola: -3,6 to 0,0).  The main strobe was now located to the left (SW) of the Hwy.  I began to think this was odd because (1) I was driving at 70 + mph and the tower lights stasyed in front of me and (2)it was a fairly straight road and now the &#39;strobe&#39; was on the other side of the road from where I had first noticed it.  I slowed down, woke my daughter and told her to look at this.  By this time I had reduced my speed to about 40 mph.  The &#39;strobe&#39; could be seen through the very left of the drivers windshield and the drivers window.  My daughter saw the &#39;strobe&#39; too.  Although we didn&#39;t stop, we seemed to have &#39;passed it up&#39; because we quit seeing the &#39;strobe.&#39;  It was strange but we decided that it must have been a tower.  We were running late and t! here was still not much traffic, so I increased my speed back up to 70 mph.  A few minutes later, we saw the &#39;strobe&#39; light again.  It was still on the left side (SW) of the Hwy but just out in front of the vehicle.  It continued to &#39;strobe&#39; with the tentacle lights showing up about every 3rd strobe ( it may have been every 4th or 5th strobe - I didn&#39;t think to count, but it seemed to be at regular intervals).  In the main part of the &#39;strobe&#39; the light was not all the same intensity.  It was bright when it &#39;strobed&#39; but there were duller sppots in it.  Unlike the main &#39;strobe&#39; part, the tentacle lights were all the same intensity - very bright.  We continued to watch it as we drove until we &#39;passed&#39; it up again.  We wondered if the other drivers saw what we were seeing?!  We kept driving on 105W and began to look for the &#39;strobe.&#39;  We didn&#39;t see it for a few more minutes.  Then we picked it up - this time to the right (NW)side of the Hwy.  It seemed to be closer than before.  My daughter said that the bottom of the main &#39;strobe&#39; had small yellow &#39;lights&#39; around it.  Actually, she had a better view because it was outside her window and I had to devote some time to driving.  She was beginning to get frightened, because it continued to &#39;strobe&#39; along side the car and we were traveling pretty fast.  We were approaching Cleveland,it was getting to be daylight, and traffic was increasing (we were meeting 4 or 5 cars at a time instead of 1 or 2).  Then the &#39;strobe&#39; light went out and we never saw it again.  We had the radio on (not loud) and never heard any static.  Also, we did not hear any noise, even when my daughter rolled down her window.  Because there was traffic at the time (albeit light traffic), I was hoping that someone else saw this &#39;strobe&#39; light and can give us an explanation.  Thanks.<n>
7/17/02 03:30|Port Liberte|NJ|Disk|2hours|At 3:20 am I noticed a few lights flashing and as it got closer it was like a rapid flashing of the light starting with dim lights then|7/26/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23810.html|203|ndxe200207| At 3:20 am I noticed a few lights flashing and as it got closer it was like a rapid flashing of the light starting with dim lights then getting brighter (red, blue and white).  As the craft got closer it would stop and hover and then it would just begin to sound as if it shut itself down because the noise went away, then as it would start to move again it would sound like about ten planes when they fly low. So for about a half hour it would seem to get further away but disappear totally but you could still see the lights flashing.  After seeing this for 1 hour there appeared a second one of the same kind! They looked almost like the depiction of the ships in the movie Independence day.....the way the ship would hover was like on a tilt and then it would go back to being straight.  At times the ship would get bright and then the lights would fade away the two of them continued to hover over the same spots  each one of them taking turns going back and forth from one end to the other.  Drifting over the Hudson iRiver and they were lower than a plane would normally be but it would get brighter ocassionaly as it got lower to the ground...it never landed though but I stayed up for the whole thing and as it got later and closer to sunrise it just disappeared. Nobody in the house would wake up though as if they couldn&#39;t hear me banging on the door to try and wake them up.<n>

As I saw my cat walking toward me, I could see that the grass started to glow an orange color, like there was a fire nearby.  I looked up to see that there were orange lights, which I first thought to be fireworks, but there was no sound.  I was standing under a large tree, so I walked out into the open grass and saw that there were hundreds of lights turning on and off, filling up a huge circle.  They kept turning on and off over and over as I just stared at them.  Then within five minutes, all of the lights faded away until there were just two left, near the center of the circle, then they too went out.  A few moments later, I went inside the house.  I came out again within a minute, as I heard what sounded like several jets flying over my house.  Looking up at the sky, I could see no jets.  The sound went away, but came back again in a few minutes, still with no visible planes.  This sound of planes flying over repeated about three more times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We all started watching the object moving across the night sky.  Suddenly the object stopped and when backwards in the same path that it had just traveled, then it stopped.

Until last night when he came to the house around 21:00 and said come outside and look because i am not crzy. So me and six other people that were at the house went onto the front porch and there it was, it was a triangular very bright light hovering in the sky there was blue lights coming out of each side in a downward shape, and a red light coming out of the top. You could tell it was moving in a circular motion because the red and blue lights would change position. The object stayed in the same place for 30-45 minutes, we all went inside to get a soda by the time we come back outside which was maybe 5-6 minutes later, the object was nowhere in sight, there was no sound of any sort. This object was not a plane or hellicopter, or weather balloon, and I was not a believer of the whole UFO thing but I promise you this was nothing that was from this world and if it was I would like to know how they can get something to hover for that amount of time and then just dissapear with no sound or anything..Well I am gonna look for it again tonight, i will report any more sightings online. thanks<n>

I am an American visiting the UK for a few weeks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have borrowed my father-in-laws computer to make this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My email address is ((e-address deleted)) I was the passenger in a car on July 16, 2002 at 10:30am traveling along hiway B936 near Fruechie, Fife, Scotland.  The sky was mostly clear with unlimited visibility.  I spotted a silver spherical object in the sky approximately 2/3rds of a mile north of the road over a farmers field.  It was approximately 200-300 feet above ground level.  At first it was stationary with no apparent movement in any direction.  I thought it might be a ballon, although it was perfectly round with no protruding parts of any kind, such as a gondola.  After a few seconds it began to move towards the east at a speed of perhaps 70-100 MPH.  It passed over the village of Kettlebridge moving below the line of hills east of that village and I lost sight of it.  It was clearly not a conventional aircraft and clearly not a ballon.  The grid reference on your UK Ordnance Survey map for the initial sighting is NO 2907.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 47 years old.  I am a pilot and familiar with estimating distances and altitude.  I am a former US Army Captain and a retired California Peace Officer.  I am excited and wanted to pass this on.  There were three others in the car with me and they all saw the silver object in the sky too.   So there you have it.  Please pass it on to whoever in the UK keeps track of such things.

This is a report of an event me and my friend witnessed about a year ago. I cant remember the exact date but it was July, I believe. The reason of this delay is that I´ve just found your site and I´d like to give a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was late in the evening, almost midnight. Me and my friend were kicking football on a nearby field when I noticed something strange in the southern horizon. I saw a formation of star- or satellite- like dots moving from south to southeast. I know that there are satellites moving in formations but there were far too many objects here, over ten. The formation of these objects was irregular, but they were moving with a visible speed like satellites. Time to time these objects vanished slowly and then came back into vision. When noticing the phenomenon I told my friend to take a look of the objects too. (His face was heading north while I was the goalkeeper with my face heading south) He saw the objects and said only:&#34;Those are definitely UFO:s.&#34; Then we kept on kicking the ball and paid no longer attention to the phenomenon. However, this sighting has bothered me ever since. Do you have any idea, what this strange formation could have been. I can only tell that in July the nights here in Finland are quite light so this phenomenon could have possibly been something reflecting the light of the sun. Birds of course are out of the option. The sun had already set.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((CLARIFICATION FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whoops! Made a little error there.

I had been staring at them for so long that I had gotten a neck ache. I suddenly saw one of the stars start to move. I thought this was interesting because we had a bad ass metior shower about a week before this happened and I just couldnt understand how it would still be going on after. Then I noticed something odd. The star never disappeared, like you would expect it to in a metior shower. It traveled across the sky at a fairly quick pace. I thought well, it must be a sattellite. But then it started to move all over in the sky, and in quick and rapid motions, it would make sharp turns. obviosly this was not a sattellite. As I continued to look at it, the light ( it must have been as artifial one, made to disguise it like a star) would get very big, and then fade away. A short while later (5 seconds at the most) it would appear in another section of the sky, darting from place to place to place, so easily that I could definetly tell that this was something straight out of a videogame or something. And it would always fade out, then reappear. i called my mom out, but she said that she couldnt see it. I guess I couldnt blame her, as the sky was full of stars that night. this continued for about an hour, as I sat and watched this machine continue to do this same thing, until i finally called my friend who lives in the woods on the outskirts of town to get his ass out side and look at the sky, but he didnt see it either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We all watched it over the next 90 minutes as it moved slowly to the north and closer to the horizon. We could tell it was moving because it changed position in the sky relative to a stand of trees.  There were no blinking lights, just a steady, large, bright yellow/white light.<n>

I was driving with my wife and daughter through this wooded area at night, and I noticed something resembling a helicopter hovering and bobbing just above the trees, at the very tips of them.  (These were not tall trees – about 30 feet tall.)  It had lights of different colors sparsely placed all over it, and it really did not look like anything otherworldly at all.  In fact, it appeared so mundane that I simply thought, “It’s odd that they would use helicopters to repair the telephone lines or whatever they’re doing up there.”  Then, realizing how unlikely that was, I stopped the car, and my wife, my daughter and I all saw the same thing: a craft that resembled a helicopter against the night sky.  We were close to this thing!  It was literally right over our heads.  And it made no wind and no sound!  It just bobbed up there.  We must have looked up at it for 15 seconds or so until it drifted farther away, over the forest, so that we couldn’t follow it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only recently heard about your website on COAST TO COAST AM, and that’s why I’m only reporting this now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The most resent sighting was when my girlfriend and I were fishing,the sky had a few clouds and the craft drifted out along the edge of the cloud,it was roundish with silver on top and when it hovered it made no nosie and the color of gray &amp; silver blended as it shifted to go back in a straight line,the way it came ,all with in 30 seconds or so.

The heavy rain and thunder and lightening lasted about 15 minutes. At 19:55 hours the weather eased, and my wife resumed doing the laundry, at the laundry room across the parking lot from our apartment building. When she stepped outside, she looked to the east, and saw a double rainbow spanning Mount Sentinel, which is almost directly behind our building. She quickly ran inside, and grabbed her Sony Mavica digital camera. She then returned to the parking lot to photograph the double rainbow. She took approximately 24 pictures. On 4 of the 24 photos, we noticed what appear to be several fireball looking objects in the sky. My wife did not notice the objects in the sky while she was taking the photos. The objects were all very similar in shape, although sizes of the objects varied (due to distance?). Photos are available upon request.<n>

It was going at an incredible speed west, then slowed down immediately and stopped.The object took off southwest at high speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> thanks  &#34;Addition Information&#34;  Well the object was moving around and stopping it did that for about two times.

When I seen it I looked around if any one was looking and there were two kids walking the opposite direction. I started to jog (i dunno why) after the object. I remember saying something like hey check out that UFO!! But the kids didn&#39;t look.

I was wondering if it is a new shaped plane at that time, or something wrong in my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my wife, she told me the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And the flying objects went though a cloud and drew a tail out of the cloud and disappeared, so I was sure something was flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The matter was kept in my mind some days, because personally I did not believe in UFO and just waiting for some news about new-developed shapes of planes or something like oval weather-ballons....<n> <n><n> <n><n> But until now, I didn&#39;t hear anything similar except UFO!?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.

7/15/02 10:00|Franklin County|MO|Disk|seconds|Disc sighting, my odd reaction, visiting my father's grave|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90735.html|239|ndxe200207| disc sighting, my odd reaction, visiting my father&#39;s grave<n> <n><n> <n><n> Primary Testimony  I am a St. Louis-born professor who has lived in Japan since 1989.  During my summer vacation in 2002, I was driving from my mother’s home in Washington, MO, along Interstate 44, towards St. Louis at around noon.  My mother was in the front, passenger seat and my wife was in the back seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove along Interstate 44 just past where it connects with Highway 100 from Washington, I spotted a hazy silver disk above a hill to the left before me.  I was viewing it from quite a distance – perhaps a kilometer.  But it had the classic form of a shiny, silver disc, although its appearance was somewhat HAZY, perhaps due to the humidity of that summer day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind quickly went through the obvious list of possible explanations – aircraft, balloon, water tower … However it was apparent that what I was seeing was none of these.  It was hovering just above the crest of a hill in an area that is (or at least was) undeveloped and possibly part of the Missouri State Park system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother, sitting to the opposite side, was intently talking about something unrelated and did not see what I saw.  I considered directing her attention to the UFO, but there didn’t seem to be a chance as our car had entered a part of the Interstate surrounded by rock on both sides where highway construction had blasted through a hill. The UFO had been visible to me for around 5 or 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From here begins the most surprising aspects of this story.  In retrospect, I should have stopped the car, backing up along the shoulder if necessary, to continue to view the UFO.  Even if that didn’t seem prudent, I should have exited the Interstate ahead and circled back to see this once-in-a-lifetime spectacle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But my overwhelming feeling was not shock or curiosity but satisfaction – “Yep, it’s true. They exist. Now I know.” Also on my mind was a lunch date with my cousins, and the prospect of being late for that. But neither of these should have deterred me from returning to that site for further observation, or the chance to produce another witness.  Especially because of the presence of my mother, we must have had a camera in the car, and possibly even a video camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nowadays, I seriously wonder if somehow I had been made to feel ‘satisfied’ and disinclined to further observation.  My actions were out of character, rather illogical, and highly regrettable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the second bizarre element.  Years on, after listening to a particular Coast to Coast AM show that suggested a connection between UFOs and ghosts, it occurred to me that on the day of my UFO sighting, I was going to visit my father’s grave for the first time.  I had been in Japan when he died and had not attended his funeral.  It’s an odd juxtaposition of events.   I tend to think this was not a coincidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a final, puzzling note, my wife claims that she was in the back seat on that day and saw the UFO as well.  And she certainly was there, considering when it happened.  But for whatever reason, I don’t remember her being in the car and I especially don’t remember her having shared my sighting.  Quite the opposite, my memory is that only I saw the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We experienced no loss of time.  There have been no subsequent sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Collaborating Testimony   It was a nice summer day when I saw a UFO in Missouri.  I was in the back of the car my husband was driving and my mother-in-law was sitting next to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember clearly but my husband and my mother in law started talking about a UFO floating in the sky.  I had no interest in UFOs so I didn&#39;t give the conversation much attention but I saw a UFO floating in the blue sky.  It was a tiny, shining thing and the movement was it went up and down a little.  I also remember lots of green around us, so I think we were driving between woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since UFOs are such a superstitious thing, my seeing it is hard for myself to believe.  My husband strongly doubts that I saw it, too.  Therefore, I started doubting my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

7/15/02 04:00|Lexington|KY|Cylinder|2 Minutes|Plane disappears into belly of hovering craft over Man O'War Blvd. In Lexington KY, and witnesses forgot about it temporarily.|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26797.html|245|ndxe200207| Plane disappears into belly of hovering craft over Man O&#39;War Blvd. In Lexington KY, and witnesses forgot about it temporarily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event ranks as THE single strangest thing that has ever happened to me in my life and there are two others that witnessed this as well.  I am fuzzy on the date of this event, as somehow, all three of our memories were temporarily wiped clean.  As awesome as this spectacle was, we forgot about it, which to me lends more questions than it does answers; Our memories of this event had just gone away -- that was until last night Dec 29, 2002, when my wife made a comment about a strange looking star, and then she said, &#34;was that like the UFO you all saw that night?&#34;  Then the forgotten memory hit me like a ton of bricks.  We must have told her about it before our memories lapsed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was sometime in the summer around July or August when this occurred, we are not for sure the date.  But, ((female name deleted)), my sister-in-law, ((male name deleted)), my best friend and I were in my back yard.  They were smokers and my wife Stacie and I did not allow smoking in doors.  It was very late; I run an e-commerce site and at the time was keeping some peculiar hours due to some temporary bouts of insomnia.  I would guess it to be between 3-5am EST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lay in a hammock looking up into the clear night appreciating nature.  The only noises to be heard were the whispers of us when we spoke infrequently and the whir of a happenstance car going by on the usually crowded Man O’ War boulevard, a major road running through Lexington, KY, which my backyard borders.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A jet in a normal traffic pattern began to fly from east to west.  I heard it above us, the unmistakable whining of the jet engines.  However, this time, the plane sounded distressed, in retrospect, I believe that the tremendous noise, the strain on the engines were the pilots trying to pull-away from the object in front of it.  Although, with some of my memories still being clouded, I believe that the plane may have been distressed and the object in front of it was saving it from disaster, either way, I doubt that I will ever know the whole truth.  Whatever it was, we all now saw it.  We were in awe looking into the sky, we saw an object, which was masterfully crafted, and expertly engineered open it’s hull to accept the whining passenger jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The massive hovering object sat in the sky above Man O’ War Boulevard, just to our west and allowed the plane to fly seemingly safely into it.  It then closed it’s cargo door and with a strange whining/buzzing/electrical noise took of in a streak leaving behind a tremendous explosion which I assumed was a sonic boom.  It ripped into the night sky creating a huge, beautifully galactic light in it’s wake, reminiscent of the Aurora Borealis mixed with the most fantastic lighting storm that you have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there now in the wake of a booming explosion, and then quiet, nothing happened.  No neighbors came to their windows or doors to inspect the calamity.  No sirens, which was surprising as Lexington’s Fire Engine Station 16 sat nearly directly below where this occurrence happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all looked at each other with many mixed emotions &#34; fear, dumbfounded ness, shock, amazement.  I said, &#34;What in the hell just happened here?&#34;  No one answered.  They stared into the sky trying to figure out the grand, celestial event that had just displayed itself in front of our very eyes.  If there hadn’t have been other witnesses to this fact, I would never have mentioned it to a soul for fear of being called crazy.  In the silence, I said, &#34;You don’t just see something like that everyday &#34; now do you?&#34; Tom replied in a dumb struck tone, &#34;Nope, no you sure don’t &#34; what just happened?&#34; I replied, &#34;That plane was just taken by that UFO.&#34; He then said, &#34;Yep. Yep it sure did.&#34; Michele laughed and said, &#34;It sure did. Oh my God.! We were all shaken and a bit frightened, and decided to go back inside to see if ((female name #2 deleted)) heard the commotion.  She was asleep and I awoke her, telling her that we saw a UFO.  We all remember going to sleep at that time.  It was so funny because in the backs of our minds we new that we should do something, call someone, report this news worthy event, but then we forgot, we all forgot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called ((deleted--female #1)), who is now in Florida last night after remembering.  I asked her if she remembered the UFO, she was greeted with a ton of bricks, her memories somewhat returned.  We talked awestruck for about 15 minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I also find funny about the event is that all of the witnesses just after that incident seemed to keep separate from each other.  ((deleted--female #1)) went back to Florida and I haven’t seen ((male)) in a number of months now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only thank God that I had some people there with me or I would question my own sanity concerning this matter.<n>

I was outside on a hill with two other friends of mine. We were all just relaxing and looking at the stars when all of the sudden a fairly large bright star looking object that was above us for sometime started to move. It went unnoticed before because when it was still it looked like just another star in the sky. When the object started to move it was CLEARLY not an airplane or a satelitte. It started off moving a signifigant distance acorss the sky, from a our view of the sky I would say a few feet, which I&#39;m sure in terms of space is millions of miles.  After doing that a few times it came to a stand still. When it was at this stand still, I&#39;m sure that it was directly above us, and when i say directly I mean as in if they dropped a pin it would have hit us. After repeating this process a few times, it went it to a frenzy of figure 8&#39;s. When the figure 8&#39;s occured we all noticed three other birght &#34;star figures&#34; which in turn were UFO&#39;s as well. They did not do as much moving as the one above us did. It seemed as though the one above myself and my compainions was the leader and the other three were followers. After doing the figure 8&#39;s and unexplainable patterns for about 10-30 min, it stoped abruptly. Right as it stopped, a car drove by us, this was probablly about 3:30 AM in a suburban area, thats not very typical for our neighborhood. The creepy thing about the car was that it stared directly at us when it drove by, which at 3 in the morning, and in very dark night on a hill, is strange. They should not have known we were up there because we made no noise and blended in with the hill. After the car drove by we became very frightened and ran back to my friends house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in July 2002 is approximate.  PD))<n>

This camp is right on the Straight of Juan de Fuca. I went to the bathroom before going to sleep and on my way back I was following a trail through a wooded area using a small maglite when suddenly there was an extremely bright halogen-like light shining on me, which I thought was some other camper&#39;s obnoxiously bright flashlight. I stopped sort of blinded and surprised by how lit up the area around me was(like a spotlight or spaceship landing on TV! very bright)  and looked up to see what could be described as a &#39;close-up&#39; shooting star, as far as what the speed/motion of the object was(very fast, like when you see a shooting star the moment is so short that you barely experience it!). I didnt hear any sounds. This lasted a very short period of time, ten seconds at the most, I&#39;m guessing. Noone was there afterward with a flashlight as I suspected, we were probably the only people still awake. I walked out to the water to check out the sky, it was a very clear starry night but I didnt see anything else(shooting stars, planes, etc.) There was alot of off shore boat activity earlier, fishing?? I asked my girlriend if she saw anything and she said she thought someone flashed a flashlight on our tent when I was gone. The dog didn&#39;t act weird. There is a naval airbase on nearby Whidbey Island, so it would make sense if this was some sort of plane, one of  &#34;us&#34; ???<n>

Standing out in the summer evening he looked strait up and noticed a slightly glowing pink object about the size of a baseball but could see no form to it. He then stepped out back to see if his dogs were fed and when he returned he looked up again. The object had now began to move from a hover exactly straight overhead to more of a southern position. He reports that the object moved in a &#34;fluttery manner without sound&#34;. He then ran in and grabbed his son to view the object as it moved slowly to the south out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness writes...&#34;Another object way higher and about the size of a pee went over head in exactly the same direction...this one had a white look to it and a small red light. It wasn&#39;t an airplane. I have seen too many airplanes now to know this wasn&#39;t it. It flew in the same odd manner as the first object&#34;.<n>

It wasn&#39;t overhead or anything but it was the brightest thing next to the moon.  I went inside to get my Dad and Mom to look at it and neither of them could explain it.  My sister came out and she had no idea what it was.  My Dad has this Celestron telescope so we went into the house to get it so that we could look closely at it.  Before we went in it had appeared to be stationary in the sky and not moving.  When we came back out it was still there but it seemed a little closer to the treeline.  Over the next 30-45 min. we watched it and it looked like a circle with a hole in the middle like a compact disk.  The disk kind of looked like a single cell bacteria under a microscope with a bunch of things swimming in it.  There were also two aircraft flying in a Northeasterly direction.  Since we were watching it more closely we noticed that it was moving in an western direction and out of sight because of the trees.<n>

Turned the TV on cause I was still wide awake. Got just about all nestled in when I big flash of light came throught the window and weird noisies began and the whole house shook. My cat started acting very weird, this is not normal for him he&#39;s very old and I never saw him act like that before. The lights kept turning on and off the TV kept turning on and off also. It would get very dark and then bright flashing lights would appear. I couldnot move. It was like I was frozen. Finally it went away. I called my son on the phone to tell him what happened. He works at the alnight conveinant store. He saw nothing. The store is about one mile away. I&#39;m still shaking. I cannot get it out of my mind. I was not dreaming this I swear to GOD it really happened. Then when I looked at the clock it was 4:10. This all took place in 10 minutes.<n>

Just after midnight a bright white light appeared in the sky, travelling steadily east to west. It was circular in shape and about as big as a dime held at arms length. It appeared to wobble slightly in its&#39; path, but this may have been an optical illusion because of the flaring effect of the light. It was difficult to judge the altitude because it was all out of proportion to the normal things you see in the sky. There was no sound and it just disappeared beyond the trees. None of us had ever seen anything like this before and I have spent many an hour with my telescope &#39;star gazing&#39; and consider myself fairly knowledgeable about astronomy. However, I had never heard of iridium flares before- might this explain what we saw? It did not appear to be as high in the sky as satellites are though. Are iridium flares that big? There is a  small airport nearby, but it is a daytime only operation.<n>

I have a hard time discussing the topic with friends and family. I have had numerous sighting and experiences since I was a child. Last year on the same day on July,07/13/02, I went to sleep in my bed room around 12 A.M. I was laying in my bed watching the television for around a half an hour. Nothing much was on the t.v, so I turned it off and started to close my eyes. The lights were off and the room was pitch black. I was still awake. I want to make it very clear that I was awake and not drifting off to sleep. I&#39;ve had a real problem falling asleap in the past two years, I&#39;ve seen a doctor about this. On a usual night I will just lay in bed thinking about the day and things going on in my life. This is what I was doing that night. I all of a sudden felt strange and heard a faint sound, almost like that of a pool filter being on. It was a kind of humming, but not loud at all. I felt nervous and looked out of the window by my bed. Above my roof was a blue light. It changed colors and sizes, yet did not seem to be moving. Still in bed, I tried to get up, but found my body frozen. I could not move. Then suddenly I felt my legs being pulled and my body being moved from my bed. I tried to scream, but I could not talk. I became worried that I would stop breathing. I have never been so scared in my life. The strange thing is that this is all I remember. I regained control over my body and got out of bed and looked out of the window. The light was gone. I glanced over at my alarm clock, andit read 2:30 A.M. Over two hours had passed, but the whole experience felt like only minutes; I am positive that I did not dream this, and know that I was awake the entire time of the occurance. This was not the last time this kind of episode has happended. Only a month ago I had two similar things happen. One was scary as all hell! I was laying in bed ready to fall asleap when a small light, almost like a lighting bug flew by my dresser. ! Then I was frozen and could not move, but I could move my eyes. My head was facing my couch and there I saw &#34; Myself &#34; sitting on the couch. I was so stricken with fear, it was so real. I was watching myself from a behind the scenes point of view. I then fell asleep. I&#39;ve had missing time episodes all of my life, and numerous times I&#39;ve seen strange moving lights in the sky. One time I watched an unidentified object flying in circles and changing color, I saw it from the raod and followed it to scudder Beach on Long Island. I saw a suffolk county police car parked near by and asked if the officer would take a look. The two of us watched in awe this strange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway I thought I would write what has happened in my life. Do what you want with it, draw a conclusion. But the fact is these things happened and scare me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The atmospheric conditions were clear with vsibility unlimited.  The two objects appeared high up, and were very bright.

This third object then changed direction to the north and faded completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects flying in formation then faded completely, and could not be seen.  Several moments later one of these objects pulsed brightly,( a brilliant white light) then faded.

None of the objects was seen again, though the first two must have been drectly overhead the observer&#39;s position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time could any type of structure be observed, as all three objects appeared to be points of white light, like stars.

It was pretty warm that day and it was not subsiding, so my grandmother opened up the front door so it would cool off in the house. The door had been open for a little bit while I watched T.V. so I didn’t pay much attention to it until I was getting the urge to look outside. So I turned around in my chair and looked outside, at first I didn’t see anything well, different, then I looked upward and I saw what I thought was a plane (there so frequent). Then after a few seconds I realized, it was just staying right in that one spot. I was so drawn to this object it was bizarre. The object started to move after about 30 seconds of just chilling in one spot, it shot left to right a few time at speeds I had never seen before. Then the object was doing circles and weird jolting patterns, it then stopped dead in the middle, shot back (well got smaller so I assumed it was going back from where I was.), shot down, shot back again, shot up a little ways, stayed there, then shot up and I have never seen anything like it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The total footage time is about 20 secs, but I shortened the film so it could be sent via e-mail.  The important parts are included, though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was spotted when I was filming dust particles near the sun from my third floor balcony - the sun light reflects off and amplifies flying particles in the atmosphere, when looked from a certain vantage point.  However, this object behaved unusual in the sense that it didn’t follow the air currents. All particles in the air fly either in the same direction of the wind, or erratically when there are gusty winds.  This one seemed to have a mind of its own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling northeast, then it stopped and came back again, disappearing overhead on top of the building.  It was difficult to determine its altitude, but I estimate it to have been at least 6000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Short after I began filming, I used 20X zoom, which unfortunately made the footage very shaky.  However, the object was actually traveling in a straight line, even though it doesn’t look so in the film.  I had my other eye opened and could see it traveling in a straight line.<n>

The site was being prepped for demolition and we had the task of removing air conditioning units.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a warm summer day, partly cloudy, with no rain in the forecast.  We had decided to take a break and I decided to lay back on the hood of the truck to relax, looking up into the sky.  While looking at the clouds and daydreaming, that&#39;s when I saw a disk-shaped object move laterally from behind a cloud.  It was a metallic disk and appeared dark on the bottom, with no sound, no lights, no trails.  It seemed to hover in place for a few seconds, then it moved back behind the cloud.  It then began to reappear and disappear behind a cloud several times within a span of 15 seconds.  It appeared that it was playing a cat-in-mouse game with any observers below, using the cloud as cover.  Not b! elieving what I was seeing, I decided to sit up and rub my eyes, and try to come to terms with what I was witnessing in broad daylight, and in plain sight.  After taking about 15 seconds to collect myself, I decided to lay back down and look for the object again.  It took about 10 seconds since the clouds were drifting fairly quickly that day, but I found it again, still moving in and out from behind the cloud.  As I continued to watch, it finally did not reappear from behind the cloud after viewing it for approximately 20-30 seconds.<n>

I viewed it from my back patio as it passed over.  The time was right about midnight. My best guess would be that it was atleast two or three hundred feet in elevation.  It&#39;s shape, as near as I can explain it, was a three dimensional horizontal triangular shape which ended in vertical cylinders in a wide U shape.  The entire object glowed a dull greenish/yellow with no flashing lights, and moved rather slowly.  I didn&#39;t see any &#34;exhaust trail&#34; or anything indicating an engine exhaust at all.  I discounted it&#39;s being a blimp, since I never heard any noise from the object.  The object maintained it&#39;s speed, elevation, and direction for as long as I was able to view it.<n>

I then noticed that it had one red light either side I pulled up to look more it passed over head at about 100 feet I then noticed a red light behind, also the lights were all very bright which stopped me from actually seeing the shape or colour of it. also it made no noise whatsoever. seeing it from behind I would estimate that it was a good 75 feet wide possibly the same length. the only thing visible from behind were the three red lights.<n>

Most of them were descending towards the water behind a mountain, some fairly quickly, but some extremely slowly. One moved in a zig-zag pattern. All of these fireballs left behind trails of smoke, but the 3 of us cannot agree whether it was dark or light smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of the object appeared fairly high in the sky and descended, however, a few were seen moving upwards from ground level, and one moved up from the ground, then descended again, towards solid ground, and then shot up bright sparks and a plume of white smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects may have been shaped like discs seen edge-on, or possibly like shooting stars, only moving very slowly. They may also have been spherical, we were quite far away, and using binoculars, so we didn&#39;t see them very well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were quite bright, and when they fell behind the mountain, some of them produced enough orange glow to light up the sky in the area where they fell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects may have been flickering or flashing, but this may also have been a dust effect due to our distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the beginning, one of us suggested that they might be forest fires, but we soon disproved that - forest fires do not start so high in the air, and do not land in the water.<n>

As it came directly overhead, the light became extremely bright as if it was shining down to us.  The object was moving from south to north and was silent.  After shining on us for about a minute, it stopped shining as bright.  It continued moving north until it zigzagged and disappeared, disproving any theory that it was a satilite.  We were so psyched that we began flashing a flashlight at the sky and turning it on and off.  Another one appeared at approx. 1:15 zig zagged aroung the flashlight and disappeared. Few minutes after the encounter, a helicopter was heard to the northeast.<n>

There was also a smaller, less bright light on the back between the two bright ones, and one red in the middle.  I called the attention on everyone in the car, I screamed &#34;stop the car&#34;  we all saw the object as it was hovering then sped off SW then disappearing, it was then 10:10 PM.  It was about 100 ft. or higher in the sky.The sky was clear, no clouds, and no visible stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a ammature ufo researcher, I read about them in my spare time,  This is the first absolute clear image i have ever seen. My friend, Jennifer, is not a real believer in any paranormal.  One cousin, Courtney, WAS a straight skeptic until last night.  and my other cousin, Kristin, was neither believer nor skeptic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10:45-10:50, we were at my house, when we decided we had better draw what we had seen while it was fresh on our mind.  Kristin was in my room, she screamed she heard something above the house we ran outside just in time to see it take off from over our house heading straight SW again.  I am positive it was the same object, I live less than one mile from where the first sighting was spotted.<n>

After a few minutes at this intesity, it again grew dimmer until it was lost from sight.  And like before, it &#34;returned&#34;, growing both brighter and bigger once again.  it repeated this for about ten minutes before finally growing dim and disappearing for good.  my whole family saw it.  it wasn&#39;t a plane.  nor anything else i&#39;ve ever seen.  it wasn&#39;t a surprise to me that seconds after it had vanished, a single jet flew directly over where it had been, turned around, and flew away.  hmm....<n>

For some reason I was compelled to look up in the sky. Supprised and happy I finally saw a UFO. The craft did not move or make any sound that I heard in the 3 seconds I saw It. I looked away to tell some of my friends to look and they asked me where it was. It was gone, it disapeared in the 2 seconds I looked away. In the Sky, it was about 2 inches long. It was an oval on its side. The highth was about half an inch. There was no lights flashing, the whole craft was glowing metalic orange, perhaps the &#39;Stealth&#39; of it was reflected from the setting sun.  Amazing!<n>

I made jestures in an attempt to scare them off when a light/for silver/white object caught my eye as it passed the roofline moving across the clear blue sky at an usually high rate of speed with no vapor trail and not any sound being emitted. At first I thought it might be a high flying bird like a seagull using the thermals, but when i saw the straight line and the distance it covered i just watched it go straight west to east until out of sight from a tree. I have never seen an object traveling at that speed and cover the distance in my life and i have no idea what it was, but if I had not been looking at the roofline of the house i would never have dectected it otherwise on such a clear and bright day.<n>

Today. It was a bright, and sunny day. The skies were blue, and beautiful. I was staring out the window, because I was bored. Like always.  As I stared out the window, I started to concentrate really, really hard on the sky. The more I concentrated on the blue skies, the clearer they became. I don&#39;t know if I was imagining it, but I saw hundreds, maybe thousands of these cirlular...well...dots. I don&#39;t know how else to explain what they looked like. But they were teeny, tiny, little white dots. They were wizzing around and going everywhere. I told my dad, and he gave me the link to this site to write to you.<n>

Saw flash of light, then object appeared, it moved about erraticly then sat/hid on the edge of a cloud.  Could be seen in cloud very clearly but only once located.  Very clever of object to hide in dense white cloud. You had to know where it was to distinguish it.  Colour was such a pure white that it looked almost silver.  It had a perfectly circular shape.  It sat still in cloud for a few minutes and then disappeared in flash of light.  Moments later 2 jets flew right past the same location, it seemed too coincidental, almost like they were hunting for it.  Sighting was witnessed by one adult 32 yrs, 2 boys ages 11 and 8.  Hey, I need no further proof to be convinced, and hint of advice; keep an eye out for discs hidding in clouds!!!<n>

It maintained this position during my 25 seconds of observation and it never appeared to move. It&#39;s length was about 1/4 inch at arm&#39;s length and the chemtrail&#39;s width was only slightly wider than this hovering, luminous white line, itself. The diagonal tilt of this luminous white line was about 50 degrees, upwards towards the right. I lost sight of it while driving.<n>

We had only a couple of drinks over a period of hours, so intoxication was very minimal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the bar closed, we proceeded to walk home, living only a block from one another.  We decided to cut through a park down the street from our homes, and being a very beautiful, warm evening, lied on the grass and BSed for a few minutes.  We were staring up at the night sky, which was completely cloud free, when, at an incredible speed, 3 bright objects in triangle formation flew over head without making a sound.  We were stunned.  We began discussing the possibilities of what it could have been.  I also recall that, do to the speed it was going, we estimated that if it wanted it could travel around the world in about half an hour.  Then, about 20 to 30 minutes later, the object returned, not from the horizon it was traveling towards, but from the horizon it came from the first time.  This time there were two more object in the same triangle formation, making up 5, and behind the object was another single object that seemed to be tailing it, at the same speed, with a visibly bright orange object pulsating around it.  The following month me and a lot of friends were at a barbeque.  The sky was clear, and it was dusk, the sun had not yet set and there were no stars visible.  Traveling in an East/West direction a friend and I (different friend this time) witnessed a bright orange object shoot across the sky at incredible speed.  About 30 seconds to a minute later it was followed by, again, 3 bright, star like objects in triangle formation.  I live 10 miles from a small airport and am very familiar with the look, speed and behavior of private and commercial planes, and have even flown a plane on one occasion with a pilot I knew.  These objects were not planes, not weather balloons, and certainly not the reflection of light off the stomachs of ducks, which have all been given to us as possible explanations.  They say seeing is believing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a believer!<n>

A green light reflected off the dome and what,seemed, like the moon&#39;s light reflecting off of the craft.  After following it for ten minutes, it vanished without a trace.  It wasn&#39;t a helicopter, because we would have heard the chopping sound.  It wasn&#39;t a plane, it was too low and very quiet, like it was scanning the sleeping neighborhood below.<n>

At around 9:30pm I looked up in the sky and noticed a really bright ball of light, it was a craft I was sure of that but it was too large to be any type of aircraft or helicopter. It had two flashing lights one on the top and one on the bottom of the craft. The brightness of the craft could have been mistaken for a plane as the main direction of the light was facing west to east, (the way you would see the headlines of a plane.) but the craft was heading north to south at a really slow speed. The size of the craft even though high in the sky seemed to change shape, when I first saw it, it was shaped like an oval, but after a few minutes in turned into a cigar and then back into a on oval. I was able to watch it for almost ten minutes because of its slow speed, but then it went behind a tall building and a group of trees, I waited patiently for it to appear on the other side of the building but it never happened, after about 2 minutes I realized the occupants of the craft must have detected a &#34;believer&#34; had spotted them and took off...<n>

I noticed a light out of my window hovering. The sky was bareley getting dark and I just wondered why this really bright star was out so early. I mean this this thing was brighter than a star but far a enough away to appear to look like one. I said what the hey, it&#39;s only a star. Then it blinked a few times. I grabbed my binoculars. First there was only one object. A Plane flew by as I was looking thru binoculars, and Object 1 was joined by another object. Both immeadiately went dim. So dim I couldn&#39;t see them with my naked eyes, only with binnoculars or maybe with a video cam which I don&#39;t have. The only other way to see them was if you caught their occasional blink. They were positioned diagonal from each other, like if they were dots on a square one would be on the top left corner and the other on the bottom right. Then Object 1 moved very slowly to the top right corner of this invisible box, while Object 2 moved at the same speed to the bottom left. They moved so slow it was like they weren&#39;t moving. By now it was 21:30. I called my mother to look while I was still keeping an eye on these things. I asked her to get her notebook to write all of this down as it happened, but somehow the notebook was never retrieved.(I later drew everything on paper.) Still in the same slow manner they switched positions. So Object 1 is now in the bottom left. Then Object 2 slowly kept going in the right direction in a straight line until it disappeared into the trees. Object 1 started to blink and was joined by another which was also blinking(maybe Object 2 again I don&#39;t know). I don&#39;t know why I did it, but things got extrodinary when I grabbed a flashlight and started turning it on and off trying to mimic their blinking. They (Object 1 and Object 3) started to move slowly over top of m! y house still far away as a star. I was Looking up towards the roof, hanging out the window. At this point my mother couldn&#39;t see what I saw. Then my mother shouted look! And directly in a straight line parallel to my window as I looked straight out there were about 13 blinking lights. At this time 21:45 several planes have already passed by in which we compared the blinking lights to, but none matched. I kept on blinking my flashlight. I don&#39;t even know why. In the back of my mind I really thought they couldn&#39;t see it because it was too high up. But still more appeared. Too many to count because of the annoying blinking. Two of the blinking objects moved left in which I followed with my naked eyes only to see them meet up with a really bright one, about as bright as the very first one I saw. It was there up until 22:45 but I stopped looking at 22:15 because I got board. It was just hovering there with the other 2. The rest had gone. My mother checked on it twice, up until 22:45 til she couldn&#39;t see the bright one anymore. The first two objects had a yellow/reddish color. The bright ones were the same only brighter. The others were dim as stars but blinking enough to get your attention. Probably 1 blink every 2 seconds.<n>
7/11/02 08:46|Vaughan (North of Toronto) (Canada)|ON|Rectangle|5m30s|2 odd-shaped objects hovered for 5 minutes, vanished, then immediately re-appeared about 15 kilometres away, then vanished again.|7/26/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23808.html|302|ndxe200207| 2 odd-shaped objects hovered for 5 minutes, vanished, then immediately re-appeared about 15 kilometres away, then vanished again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving to work, west along the 407 expressway, North of Toronto with my father in the front passenger seat.  About 8:46 am I noticed a pure black object in the sky 10 kilometres away to the west hovering about 300 feet above the ground.  I pointed it out to my father and he confirmed visuals.  However, because we were in the north-western end of the city he believed it was a helicopter from Pearson International Airport and dismissed the issue, returning to his newspaper.  As we were traveling at freeway speed, we got closer and I could see some detail that made me think otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object&#39;s shape reminded me of the torso of the constellation Orion with a narrow bottom, wide middle and narrow top.  It was not curved and the shape was not symetrical.  There were no extensions of wings or rotors and there was no smoke, exhaust, or flame coming from any side of it.  As well, there was no &#34;basket&#34; attachment like a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my eye on the object and it continued to hover as we got closer.  I alerted my father and he took a better look.  He said it reminded him of a large garbage bag with no reflective surface, though- and he agreed it was not a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned my concentration to my driving as there were many other cars on the road and stopped watching the object.  This is when my father discovered the second object, two white discs attached to each other side-to-side.  It was much smaller and stayed about 40 feet away from the black object, higher up and to the north. The 2 seperate objects stayed close together and continued to hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They made no movement, did not drift, and we saw no wires attaching them to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:51 am, 5 minutes into the sighting, the objects vanished.  We exited the expressway at Pine Valley Drive and headed south on this local road.  This put me on the east side of the car and my father&#39;s window facing the objects.  The objects  were now about 3 kilometres away and we could see them very clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments after we made that exit the objects vanished, which alarmed by father and he looked franitcally across the sky for signs of them.  I slowed the car to about 30 km/h and looked directly out his window in the direction we saw them last.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I re-aquired visual contact about 10 seconds after they vanished and saw only the black object, now 15-20 kilometres away, hovering again.  There was no way it could have traveled that distance and slowed to a hover again.  My father got one last look at the object to confirm the new distance and then the city landscape and buildings prevented our vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additonal facts: -Visibility that morning was perfect and the sun was shining -No sound determination because car windows were closed -A 767 was traveling west towards Pearson Airport, about 15 kilometres to the south -The carft were intially hovering near a massive North-South powerline grid before they moved -Other cars did not take notice of the object -the event lasted 5.5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Both objects were dull in colour and did not shine light (non-metallic) -They would definitely be on Airport radar at their location (even tower visibility) What intrigued me about this sighting is the lack of wings or rotors on the object, the ability to hover without ANY movement, and the speed at which the object moved from 3 to at about 15 kilometres away to another hover.<n>

Then we saw 3 flashes and then about 5 to 10 minutes later we saw 7 dim (they almost looked brownish) lights flying in a perfect &#34;V&#34; shape. It flew right between my neighbor&#39;s (behind us)houses and then between mine and my next door neighbors. It was flying pretty low and there was no sound at all. We couldnt see between the lights so it must have been one object. It flew above us for only about one minute then disapeared. It moved to slow to be a B-2 bomber (which is what we thought it was.)It was bigger then a 747.<n>

It appeared like any falling star but there was no streaking, the light was more substantial (like an unblinking airplane light) and though it was moving fast it was not as fast and fleeting as falling stars seem to be.  Also, it didn&#39;t vanish in the middle of the sky.  Instead, the light stayed consistant and seemed to &#34;fall&#34; behind the Wasatch Mountains in the east. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else saw this and if it was a meteor or whatever.<n>

When it moved it had no tail, like meteors are known to have ruling that out.  Besides that, after the initial descent it stopped and moved back up just as fast. after that it moved back down again and then at a medium rate, faded away into nothing. this could not have been anything natural and our government definetly  could not produce something of this speed and manuverability.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The sky was mostly clear with very few clouds and there were many stars visable.Within a few seconds of going outside, our eyes caught something very light in the sky, facing East. This light was small, but bigger then any of the other stars or planets in our area. As well as it being extremely bright it was moving VERY slowly. As it was moving across the sky the light started to fade and fade until it completely dissapeared. Just for clarifacation, the object or whatever it was made no sound. It also didnt have any type of color or flashing lights.<n>

I live at the top of what is claimed the highest hill in Monroe CO.  I keep a watch with me when I ride so I know what time it was.  We were having high pressure so there was not a cloud in the sky all day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I came to the top of the hill I saw what looked like Venus in the day sky (1hr+ before sunset).  The sun was defininately the cause of the glow.  It was moving what would seem as commercial aircraft speed heading directly away from me (I&#39;m facing due west).  I would have id&#39;ed it as aircraft except for two problems.  First, the craft left no vapor trail.  Second, as the craft slowly became less reflectant by the sun as it moved away , I should have been able to see it better without the sun glarring off it.  Before it stopped reflecting sun light back at me it vanished.  If it was aircraft it would have been only on the other side of the city and I should have been able to see it.  I feel the craft must have been very large and outside of the atmospher.<n>

WE WERE ALL INSIDE A TOYOTA CAMRY parked outside of boxwood townhome, FACING OPPISITE DIRECTION OF CRAFT, WHEN I got out of vehicle I saw a light in sky that was like a magnetic feeling almost as if i knew it was there before I got out of vehicle. I kept on starring at light that apeared to be over randhurst mall or maybe further it was hard to tell distance due to how to compare and contrast,well anyway my friends also exited vehicle shortly and asked what I was starring at? I showed them they said it&#39;s just a light pole from mall.I told them to look closer and use the mall light poles as a way to tell if unidentified light would move, shortly it did. When we first saw it it was on right of mall light pole then on left. At this point this had our complete attention,would not see it move but port,it appeared to be over home depot but probably further but from our view it appeared over it. All four of us were talking asking what is it?who is it? out loud then when we realized it was directly over us,we never saw it move only when it stopped motion or hoverd over something, What we saw changed our lives, it was shaped like frisbee  metallic black and the light&#39;s we saw earlier where light all around ship except they all light up at differnt times but it was not lights it seemed to be synergy produced be craft, also craft was differnt then any material we had ever seen cause it kind  of had a liquid material surface or some sort of feild maybe that made it apear this way. The craft hovered and it did have a outer circuler part of craft that move counter clockwise but slowly almost seemed so slow it might have been really fast, the underneath looked still except the kind electric feild it had going, It made no noise at all. We were unable to move we were looking straight up in complete silence no one talked if was almost like they took control of our senses left us motionless, for what felt like five minutes. When we were! able ma ke motion we all reacted at same time,we all turned around and ran in mark house to his room when we lookoutside window ufo was gone.At this point we all new what we saw we started talking about it and we looked at the time a 1 hour had passed. We could not make sense of time span. One thing we all agreed on was that when we where looking up standing motionless many seens played very fast through our minds. Like when you fast forward something on video similar but faster and many differnt taste smells sounds colors. We were going to report this insident at time but people usually don&#39;t believe it until they see it and we knew it was going to be hard to convince people of what we had encounterd. The irony is we felt settled with what we had experienced that we felt that why bother trying to make people believe us we all knew what we saw and told each other we would always remember and cherish this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ever since we all have developed ESP and we can do extrodinery thing&#39;s with our brains it almost as if they unlocked a part of our brain we did&#39;t know how to use before this,we all write and produce music.We also read prophecies of edgar casey and got our own &lt;prophecies&gt; and &lt;visions&gt; very frequent and stated we all play music together on occasion so we still keep contact.

I got in my car and as I was about to back up....for some reason I had an urge to stop the car and look up in the sky. So I did and I saw a shiny metallic disc shaped ufo.  It was moving slowly but after when I  began starring at it, it stopped moving, it hovered there for a while and it appeared to wobble and it wobble quite severely. After a couple of minutes of just hovering, it began moving again and slowly ascended until it could no longer be seen.  The craft was roughly 1000 feet in the air, it appeared very large. The skies were sunny clear, no clouds. It happened just south of highway 9, so I&#39;m sure other people saw it as well.  There have been rumors in this area that things like this have been seen in the past 2 years, and that they are seeming to increase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m currently a university student, whose studies are in the science area.

I became aware of a hummung sound that dipped and grew louder, it sounded like a helecopter, but different, it seemed to be moving around te area. After 30 minutes, i grew curous that it had not stopped, and went outside in the garden to look for this mystery &#39;helecopter&#39; type sound. I stepped through the garden on to the street and looked.. what i saw i will not forget. There was a dark triangle drifting around the sky at fairly fast speeds and acceleraton, seemingly scanning the area i live in.  It was triangular with lights on the tips and was spinning slowly, and was turning at speeds that were impossible. It seemed that i had only just got to the end of my garden pat when the thing turned and converged over where i was. I ran inside and after about 15 minutes, the sound stopped. I asked my mother about it the next day, and she said the sound had awoken her and that she had seen it from her window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was looking at the cluster of stars because I saw what I thought was a planet except it was yellowish-orange and was located were no planets should have been. As I was looking at them one of the dimmer stars started to move away from the cluster horizontally at a rapid speed. It looked like a dim star. Within a minute the orange shape moved away in a different direction went into some clouds and never came out. I went inside to answer the phone was out within five minutes and resumed watching. After just a couple of minutes one of the dim looking stars started to move in the same direction as the first one did. The difference was it was not moving as fast. This may be nothing at all. It may be that the military has a new plane of some kind that can fly so high that it looks like the stars, stay stationary for a period of time and speed away very fast.

It was about 9:50 when me and my friends first saw them.  I assumed they were just stars so i went back to talking but when i looked back the top one moved next to the bottom tight one and then moved away.  I kept my eye on them and at about 9:55 the two bottom ones started moving in different directions.  The 3 things were in the south direction, right behind a house.  THey looked like they were out in space.  THis happened 7/06/02, 7/08/02, 7/09/02 and i believe will happen tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I looked west of my location and saw a very bright light that looked as though it was either changing shape or mabey spinning. there were light clouds in the area and the object seemed to go throught the clouds as if it were just sitting there. I went inside to look in the phonebook to see were i could report what i saw, but could not find anything. I went back outside about 25 minutes after and the object had moved west and got dimmer.It seemed to travel in a west direction very slowly. On my way home traveling north on the highway, it seemed to be clearer to see as i got home. someone mentioned it might be the space station or shuttle, but i dont think so. there were no blinking lights or flashing lights of any kind just a white light that seemed to either change shape or spin. I thought it was very unusual.<n>

We looked away for a split second and it was gone. We both agreed, if it had continued on a straight line we would have still seen it. There were very few clouds so it could not have entered one.

Klamath Falls , OR 03:55, object travelling from SSE towards NNW accelerates at high speed and does 180 still accelerating<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was reporting to work at the Klamath Falls Post Office when I noticed two of my co-werkers at the SW corner of the postal property. I came  up to them and asked why they were looking up in the night sky. They told me that they had heard that there would be a passing of the ISS at 03:55 that AM. I was to clock on at 04:00 so I thought I would whatch the event myself. My understanding was that the ISS would be passing from the SW. We whatched awile and then one of my co-workers said &#34;There it is!&#34; It was passing from the SE. It was slightly orange. My friend said that he had seen the ISS pass before and it had been &#34;a bright white light&#34; and &#34;slowly moving&#34;. We watched it move from the SSE towards the NNW we saw that it started to accelerate, maintained its accelaration and shortly after it passed over us it made a radical 180 degree turn of very tight trajectory; almost back on its previous course and continued to accelerate back to the SSE and speed out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not change color coming or going. I was a Naval aircraft mechanic from 1968-1971 and do not believe that this was an aircraft presently in our inventory nor do I believe that we have vehicles that could demonstrate the technology necessary to achieve the air display that I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound. The object did not leave any sort of trail. I had the impression that the object was at a great altitude. There were no blinking lights on the object and it looked the same as it advanced, turned and then spead away.<n>

I notice a strange noise and looked around to see where it was. Then I saw it, it was one triangular shaped, white light, it seemed large, although it was pretty high up, I could still hear the terrible high-pitched noise it was making. It hovered there for only a few seconds and then it took off, and I mean &#39;&#39;Took Off !!&#39;&#39; It went straight up until it disappeared out of site.<n>

I was looking at the sky and right above the treeline across the street, I saw a black shaped image triangular in shape.  I automatically pointed it out to my husband.  There was no noise, no nothing.  First thinking it was imagination, I blinked my eyes and it was still there.  In a matter of seconds, it disappeared. Approximately three weeks later, at approximately 9:30 p.m., while watching t.v., it sounded like a jet had just flown right above our house.  The house and windows shook.  Running outside, thinking we would have seen something, there was nothing.  The funny thing was, only our next door neighbor heard it and ran outside.  When we asked the other surrounding neighbors the next day, noone saw or heard it. It was just us, and our neighbor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Airplanes pass over frequently, so at first we ignored the dull humming coming from the distace. After about 15 minutes we realized that the humming was still quite audible, now slightly louder than before. We started talking about it, trying to find the source, when out from the trees at the edge of the field hovered some type of craft about the size of an olympic size swimming pool, but triangular in shape, followed by an identical but smaller craft. They hovered only about 80-100 feet off the ground, though the sound emitted was quieter than that of a household vaccuum cleaner, and no wind or anything accompanied the low flying vehicals. They were lined with several lights, varying in size and coulour, some of which blinked liked a strobe light. After several minutes, the two vehicals were accompanied by yet another craft, the size of the smaller one mentioned before and identical to the other two. The material of the crafts was a metallic looking navy blue which faded into a green as it reached the two end points of the vehicals. They continued to hover for quite some time, never getting any louder, and they were only intimidating in their size. Finally, we heard a commercial plane nearing, and the craft flew straight up in the air, and then took off north/east in direction so fast we barely had time to blink before it was out of site.<n>

JULY 7th, Sunday afternoon approx. 2:00 pm esds time while working in my back yard, I heard a distant &#34;popping&#34; sound coming from over my head.  This caused me to look up.  At first I had a difficult time finding the source of the sound.  I looked ahead of the sound - as one does for a jet at altitude - the object was approx. 10 degrees ahead of the returned sound - using 180 degrees from horizon to horizon as the parameter.  The entire event lasted slightly less than 5 minutes.  The object&#39;s heading was WNW to ESE.  It also appeared to roll once - outside loop type - not barrel roll.  No vapor trail was present.  My guess at it&#39;s altitude was well over 30,000 feet AGL.  It was very large and moving at a constant rate.  You should be able to estimate size and height of the object between the zero magnification photo and the leaves on the oak trees in the various photos.  I have the photos saved to cd in tiff. format should you need them.  You may contact me via my E-Mail address which follows.          ((e-address deleted))          This was no hot air balloon.                       Sincerely, Dr. ((deleted))    I am e-mailing photos to   director@ufocenter.com as requested today.<n>

But my brother, his wife, her little brother, and myself were all sitting in a broken down car while every one else was in an inipi (sweat ceremony).  My brother, his wife, and myself were smoking a cigarrette, and her little brother was staring at the horizon in a northwest direction.  And he spotted 1 dim light off in the distance that seemed real low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It begin to move and disappear behind hills as if it were traveling over the prairie close to the ground.  As it came closer I say still around 3 miles away it split into 2 dim lights, and they both seemed as if they were slowly zigzaging back and forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got out of the car by then and stood at the top of the dirt road leading to the sweat ceremony.  The lights got 1/4 miles away and came down into the valley we were in, and approached the island which is accross the creek from where we were.!  The island itself is about 1/2 mile in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both lights then turned into 2 separate colors-one Red, one blue.  The blue light came to the closer end of the island by us.  By then that would be about 300 yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They both intensified the color by getting VERY bright, so bright it lit up the valley as if it were day. I remember focusing on the blue light, but it was so bright, and we all became scared and turned and ran...<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never went back to see what it had done.  But thats the story. Also there was no sound…<n>

At 4:37 a.m., I looked in the southwestern portion of the sky (approximately 11 o&#39;clock high) and observed a triangle formation of white lights moving in a downward arc direction from west to east. They looked exactly like a constellation of stars but were moving through the sky, comparable in size to the Big Dipper, and could not be detected with the naked eye.  During the first few seconds of my observation, another white light passed just behind the formation&#39;s path moving northwest to southeast.  This single light moved faster than the triangle formation and continued passed it at a steady speed and direction. My first impression was that the single light was a satelite. I kept my attention on the triangle formation, noting that the lights moved in precise syncrinicity with each other, until disappearing behind the horizen at 4:40 a.m.  I should also point out that I was standing less than 1/4 mile from four television/radio transmission towers.<n>

It is a remote area with no houses or lights. I was traveling west. I saw a big bright white flash that lit up the whole area to the south then something flew by from south to north across in front of me on a 45 degree up angle. It was traveling  at about a 15 degree downward angle. It was shaped like a missile with a cockpit and the whole thing was shimmering a blue green color. I was in a canyon that was fairly steep. It was very dark. It all happened within about five seconds or less. I had no way of judging size or distance or speed. Later I thought that it may have been a transformer blowing and shooting a charge of electricity through an overhead power line. I called the power company and they had no record of trouble out that way. Neither did the Sheriffs office.<n>

It was slightly moving back and forth. I got my binoculars and when I looked at the star I noticed there was a triangular object above it. The object had a red light on it&#39;s tip that seemed to be moving around. Both objects moved at the same time and in the same direction. The objects were probably 20-30,000 feet in the air at least. I watched it for about an hour moving erratically and at one point seemed to shoot a streak of light from it&#39;s tail end.That was when I noticed what I thought was a reddish star move at the same time these objects were moving. This 3rd object was straight across from the bright white light below the triangle object and a great distance from them. This is when I realized this was an unexplainable object. As a little time went on they were getting closer. And then all of the sudden it descended at a rapid pace. It got to what looked about 2 miles away and the red light stopped and it was a very large black triangle with the lights below it. It then dissapeared from view behind some trees. When it dissapeared I thought it was crashing but there was no noise. I called the local police but they reported no other reports.<n>

The witness got home from work late Saturday night at about 10:30. After showering and eating a bite he decided to go out on the back deck of his house and watch the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He writes...&#34;I was watching for falling stars when I noticed a star that was fluctuating in brightness. All of a sudden I saw the star move slightly. That really got my attention. I kept watching and the star move, side to side and then up. I got my binoculars out to get a better look and when I found the star, I noticed a hazy object above the star that had a blinking red light above it (it was 12:15 a.m. by this time). These two objects moved together with the lower object seeming to sway almost like they were connected, but they were clearly separate. I then called the police to see if anyone else had seen this and they said there were no reports. I then woke up my son and made him look since I was having a hard time believing what I was seeing. I watched these objects move around for a while (it&#39;s now 12:45 a.m.) parallel to the first star I saw. It was moving at the same time and in the same direction that the other two objects were moving. About a half hour later they appeared to get closer. I could make out the shape of the object that had a red light on it. It was a triangle shape. And the movements of these objects were getting more erratic and moving further distances from side to side, then up, then down, etc. About 1:30 a.m. I thought it was time to get to bed. On my way through the house I decided to step out front to see if it was still there. The objects were still there and after watching for about 10 minutes the objects descended rapidly... So fast that I was alarmed and ran for the door to the house. The two lower lights that were some distance from the triangle disappeared first behind the tree. Then the triangle continued down and I could see it was black. The red light on it wasn&#39;t lit. Then it disappeared and I was waiting to hear a crash but it never happened. They had to have either landed or crashed. When the black triangle went down it looked to be about a mile or two away. At this point I was in a state of shock and sat in my front room for about 10 minutes and went to bed.&#34; OUFOR contacted the Bend police department and confirmed that this witness had called. No other sightings have been reported to them within the 24 hours since the sighting. A preliminary investigation has been opened and OUFOR investigator John LaBossiere of Bend has taken on the investigation. He has talked with the witness and is attempting to better verify where this craft appeared to have come down. We will post any future information that comes out of this investigation.<n>

My friend ((deleted name)) and I were walking my dog.  When we got just outside of Middleton,  about 500 meters from the wilmot sign, we were crossing the little hallow that spans from middleton and enters wilmot and when we got into the middle of the hallow where there are less trees, we could both see three very bright orange lights with a little blue appear from over the north mountain. they were so bright that the light reflected from the river that passes below the bridge.  ((name deleted))&#39;s first thought was that it was probably a few stars but stars are not as bright as these were.  they were so bright in fact, that you could see the house and barn in the distance pretty clearly, where as normally at this time of night you couldn&#39;t. my first thought, maybe airplanes.   but there was no sound.  my dog (2 year old pomeranian) began to whine a little, i didn&#39;t know if she was scared, or what.  maybe she just wanted to get moving on.  The 3 lights began to blink one at a time and out of unison, twinkling like a christmas tree for about 10 seconds.   ((name deleted)) let out a little chuckle and the said &#34;i&#39;m getting ((deleted)) scared man!&#34; i was nervous and i got out my cell phone and called my cousin who lives about a 5 minute walk away from where we were and told him to get into his FAST and come to the hollow.    then lights seemed to back away and fly behind the mountain again leaving light shining from behind the mountain and shining up through the sky simular to the Aurora Borealis effect.  5 seconds passed as the light became dimmer and dimmer and then brighter again and brighter until the three lights came back to the same exact position as they were before, accompanied by 3 more lights. Six bright orange lights flew around each other in the firefly fashion for about 30 seconds and then stopped on a dime. Then they oraganized themselves as three lights remained on the bottom and to more were over the 3 lights and one light on top - all close together , forming a small triangle.  my cousin! arrived with his car, got out,  and said out loud &#34;what the hell?&#34;  my dog began barking out loud and much with a few whines in between each bark.   the triangle of lights raise up in the sky over the north mountain.  up, up, up, up, til they were like about 5 kilometers up in the sky and proceded to fly pretty quickly across the valley from the north mountain to the south mountain.   Except for the dog, we were all very silent as the small triangle of lights flew over us.  i had to cover my dog&#39;s mouth for a few seconds to hear the faint high pitched hovering or humming sounds coming from up above.  you could only hear them if you listened carefully because they were so far away but they sort of sounded like a swarm of Bees.  my cousin said in a nervous voice &#34;lets get out of here!&#34; after the lights passed over us and continued flying south, they disappeared completely. me, ((name deleted)), and my cousin were silent for a moment but the dog continued barking.   i asked my cousin what the heck that could have been.  and he didn&#39;t know, neither did i, nor billy. No one of us slept for a few nights becare it was really a hard to forget, scary experience.  we have told a few people about this but no one believes us. We don&#39;t do drugs, and as neither of us had any money for liquor that night, no one of were drinking and we were totally sober.  it&#39;s something none of us will every forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request corroborative reports from the other two witnesses (excluding the dog).  We presume the location of the sighting was Nova Scotia, Canada.  PD))<n>

My family and I were all inside. My father was asleep, but my Aunt, brother, his friend, and myself were playing a game in the kitchen. My aunt walked outside to smoke ( there is no smoking allowed insinde the house.) A few minutes later she called for me. She said she needed a second opinion about something. I remember her pointing to the sky and asking me if i saw the &#34;star&#34; ...i looked and saw what appeared to be a star. Then she told me to look closer because she didnt think it was a star. As i looked closer I noticed it was flashing blue and red lights on both sides. After about 3 minutes the object shot up rather quickly...and stop very suddenly. It continues to do this in different directions for several minutes. By this time I had woken my father up and got my brother and his friend outside. A couple of minutes later the object &#34;flew&#34; away very quickly out of site.<n>

At first glance it seemed like an airplane but the more I looked at it, the more I kept thinking that it was something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was EXTREMELY high in altitude and was moving at a great rate of speed.  Much different then an airplane would move in the sky, and much higher then I had even seen any aircraft.  There was no noise, no jet sounds, no sonic booms, just this object traveling in a straight line.  It had 3 colored lights, red white and green.  These lights from left to right would alternate flashes.  They were appx 2 seconds between each flash.<n>

Above the hill that borders the town to the west I saw an extrememly bright spherical object travel very rapidly across the sky in a gentle arc, and disappear behind that hill.  The object appeared to be about half the size of my fist when held out at arms length, and was surrounded by a larger haze, making the exact determination of the shape difficult.  Shortly after seeing this, I yelled to two of my friends who were about 10 yards away.  They had not seen the object, but as I was telling them to look to the west, the three of us saw the event repeat itself, nearly exactly the same as before.  The dual nature of this event makes me suspicious of what I would have otherwise regarded as a rather spectacular meteorite...<n>

They were moving from north to south at an inclination of about 35 degrees from the horizontal.  There was no sound heard, they stayed in the same relative position to one another as they traveled across the sky.  Their size was hard to determine, if a star were 1/8 inch, these were about an inch and a 1/4.  Their color was a bluish white with a brighter halo about 1/16 inch (using the same relative sizing) of a brighter and bluer color.  They moved southerly and then seemed to go further east and upward until they were lost to sight.  A glance to the north found two more identical objects which followed the same trajectory as the first three.<n>

They formed a triangle, but changed their position relative to one another continually and very quickly. About one minute after the initial sighting, the objects grew smaller in diameter and finally disappeared. Two similar (same?) objects reappeared in about the same position and then also blinked out. Observation with binoculars gave no detail other than circles or vertical disks lit from within.<n>

I was sitting all the way at the top and was behind the homeplate. I look over to the new stadium being built and see 3 lights in a triangular pattern. I see it first quickly and then see it clearly as it appeared again. It then moved down past the new stadium and at that point I tell my brother what I saw. It was 3 green lights in a triangular pattern and I could not see the shape of the craft. It moved toward the ground and I did not see it go back up.<n>

The camcorder was on, but not recording,(it was on locked mode)and I turned around to look out over the hill, and there was a bright, but small light out at about 45 degrees up from the ground at the horizon, there was no type of sound that I remember hearing.  I looked back around and yelled to my friend, &#34;Is the camera on?  Are you filming this?&#34; Both of my friends were already looking at it and the one with the camera replied, &#34;I just hit the record button.&#34;  That model of camcorder has a mechanism that automaticaly rewinds a few seconds and then starts to record.  When the object slowly faded to nothing, and then I shouted &#34;Did you get that?  What was that?!&#34;  He said, &#34;I think I got it, I&#39;m not sure.&#34;  Afterwards we stayed on the hill for around another hour just to make sure that it wasn&#39;t a plane that would pass over us, and there was nothing.  There were no clouds that night, and we didn&#39;t know how to explain it&#39;s eerie disappearance.  We decided to keep all of the facts to ourselves after no one believed us, and now we are reporting to you in hopes of finding any information we can about what we saw.  We do have a few seconds of footage when the camera finally recorded, but, unfortunately, it only shows the object fading away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We took the usual route, which is right alongside an army base which is surrounded by a thick border of trees. We were on the right side of the street and the army base and trees were to my right. I was looking up at the sky through my (passengers) window as we drove along and out of nowhere, I spot a huge disc-shaped object. It was hovering, motionless in the field of the army base at just the right angle and height above the trees for me to get a good look at it. The top portion was dome shaped and appeared slightly lighter in colour than the bottom and did not have any lights on it&#39;s surface. The lower portion of the object was shaped like a saucer but had some thickness to it. It was dark in colour and the flat bottom was encircled with red and pale yellow lights at it&#39;s edge. There was a long, rectangular ramp extended from the bottom part and I could see a cable or something cable-like, holding this ramp in place. The ramp was not in contact with anything else in the sky, it was just there and the light inside the object was light grey, almost misty. I started to yell &#34;what the f*ck is that?!!!&#34; and kept telling him to look and asking him if he seen it too. I kept repeating &#34;it&#39;s in the sky, above the trees!&#34; and he tried to lean over to see it, but the roof of the car was obstructing his line of sight. I was too excited to think of getting him to pull over, even though the streets were almost empty and we probably could have done so safely. For the next few seconds, I just watched this huge, silent object hover in the sky, and as we kept driving, I lost sight of it. I told ((name deleted)) to turn pull a u-turn and go back, so that he could see it. But by the time we got to the other side of the road and retraced our path, it was gone.<n>

Like from the ground it was moving in about a 10ft. patern around the sky. It had a red light on it and apeared to have 3 white light&#39;s on each corner. it was really to dark to see anything else on it. but we sat there and watched it for about 30min.or so and i mentioned that there was a ufo site.

The moon was bright, I believe it was not quite full, and there was a ridge of clouds straight above.  I noticed a triangular shape near the south horizon flying due north.  At first I thought it may be a flock of Geese, but then realized it was solid black against the sky, with dark grey or brown leading edges, there were no distinguishable lights.  I yelled and pointed to my two friends, but they could not locate it before it flew over the ridge of clouds.  It took approximately 15 seconds to fly from horizon to clouds, making absolutely no sound.  I considered that it may be a Stealth aircraft(such as F-117 nighthawk), travelling extremely slow, until I realized that the ceiling was at least 1000 ft. high, and the craft must have been considerably larger than I first estimated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event has perplexed me.  I am not an avid follower of military aircraft, nor do I believe extra-terrestrial involvement.  Since this event I have heard several similar stories, but have kept this description exactly as I told it to my friends the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It is very odd.  It moves very fast from the south to the north (maybe a little west)...  It reminds me of the way a flashlight can be seen in the fog except that there is no length to the beam that reaches the ground.  It is hard to describe.  It moved silently and quickly... No flashing lights at all, just this almost smoky, ghostlike chevron/wing that cruises across the sky.  The last 2 nights here have been clear and tonight it is completely clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure why I have seen this but prior to both times the thought occurred to me that I should go and look at the stars (something that I almost never do).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had some passed experiences that were much more intense than this and they were wittnessed by others but this has left me with a really wierd feeling.<n>

I looked up, i dont know why,and saw a v shaped object about 500ft above tree line with very bright lights. It was moveing very slow and with out no sound what so ever! I  watched it slowly move out of sight! I walked back in the house telling myself it was a airplane, but airplanes make noise and have to move about 200mph to fly! ones as big as i saw anyway. I hope someone else saw it to so i want thank im crazy! It was V shaped with a bright light in front it made no sound because i tryed to hear something as it passed,i heard nothing! I would say about 50 yards across the widest part and about 100yards long!<n>

My husband pointed out an object in the sky. It was traveling from the North west towards South east. It looked like a shooting star but it had three distinct white lights at equall distance from each other. The three lights seemed to fade into one another making the craft seem as if it was a single craft that was sigar shaped. The craft sped accross the sky at a very fast speed and was soon out of sight. It was not travelling in the regular flight path of our regular Jumbo jet flights and was much higher in the clear sky. We regularly sit at this site but have never before wittnessed anything like this. We are curious as to what it was.<n>

However I lost sight of object as it traveled back into tree line.  Object was only visable by flashing light.

7/5/02|Forest Grove|OR|Unknown|unknown|Oregon UFO Review Case:  Crop Formation appears in Forest Grove wheat field.|7/26/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23856.html|380|ndxe200207| Crop Formation appears in Forest Grove wheat field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday July 13th, Assistant Director Eric Byler and investigator Phil Simmons returned to Forest Grove to talk with the owner of the field and get permission to go in and take a look. At that time the owner commented that he had heard the formation may have been discovered by others as early as Friday July 5th but that he did not personally know of its presence until it hit the news on Tuesday July 9th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Investigator Carol Pedersen from The Center for Crop Circle Studies has been out to the site to collect samples for Michigan biophysicist, Wm. C. Levengood. Levengood has been examining crop circle plants and soils since 1989. To-date, three papers presenting the research findings have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, as well as more than 100 lab reports on individual crop formations in the U.S., Canada, England, The Netherlands, Germany, Australia and Israel. These scientific papers and laboratory reports outline the physical abnormalities discovered so far in the plants and soils, clearly indicating a causative agency other than human-directed mechanical flattening of the plants, suggesting instead an energy system which emits microwaves and associated unusual electrical and magnetic field. Although some instances of the phenomenon known as “crop circles” are apparently created by people, scientific analysis of the affected plants and soils indicates that slightly more than 90% of formations tested have a more interesting—and more complex—causation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tuesday July 16th update...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oregon UFO Research has received a preliminary report from the main investigator in this case, OUFOR consultant Carol Pederson of The Center for Crop Circle Studies. The findings she observed while in that formation along with new witness testimony strongly suggests this formation may in fact be authentic and casts serious doubts on the sole testimony of 17 year old Logan Richardson who claimed that teens he was acquainted with made it. Not one of the teens has come forward to identify themselves and the day they were supposed to have done the formation is later than the actual discovery date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few items of interest that should be noted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1) A witness provides testimony that the formation appeared as early as Friday July 5th...this pre-dates when the teens were supposed to have created the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) No one has personally admitted to making the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) Another witness reports seeing the formation on Sunday the 7th of July. This witness had some knowledge of the phenomenon and looked for a trail leading in...none were present. Monday morning, July 8th she noticed a path leading into the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4) Wheat heads were intact during the investigation and spilled out when walked on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5) Stalks were bent but not broken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6) Elongated nodes were observed but no blown or bent nodes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7) Lay pattern indicates the swirls were made from the outside in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8) The formation was aligned exactly N-S by compass reading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9) It should also be noted that this formation is very similar to one that appeared in Washington State in 1993.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the exception of the Hillsboro Argus newspaper, most of the media reported that this formation was a hoax based on one teens testimony minus anyone admitting to it. The press also attempted to make a connection to the upcoming Mel Gibson film &#34;SIGNS&#34; as a possible reason for it&#39;s appearance without any evidence to prove the Forest Grove circle was a hoax. While a hoax is always a possibility, some of the information gathered during the investigation points away from this and we should all wait until the samples come back from the Laboratory of Michigan Bio-physicist W.C. Levengood before making any final conclusions. Past analysis have shown that 90% of formations tested gave positive results of being authentic. We are also grateful for the hard work and dedication by Carol Pedersen of The Center for Crop Circle Studies. Carol has worked for many years investigating formations in the state of Oregon and is the best in her field. We at OUFOR have our hats off to her detailed investigative talents and are fortunate to have her as a consultant for Oregon UFO Research.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We will post more information when the tests are complete regarding the authenticity of this formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To view three photos from KATU channel 2&#39;s Jet ranger 2, go here... http://www.oregonuforeview.com/recent.html ... and scroll down to 7-05-02<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Eric Byler and Skip Schultz, of Oregon UFO Research, for following up on the case, and sharing the information with NUFORC.

It was approx 11:10pm.  We were chatting for a few minutes, when all of a sudden a very bright white light appeared in the sky across the street.  It was to the east of us and about 1/2 way up in the sky.  It looked like a large bright headlight.  I could see no structure behind the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the space of between 5 and 10 seconds the light moved out of a cloud, then did a sharp left and upward turn and went back into the cloud.  I was waiting for the light to reappear but it didn&#39;t.  We waited several minutes.  No light.  I said to my neighbour pointing &#34;What is that&#34;.  He saw the same light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason I put this out of mind.  I knew it was unusual, but I couldn&#39;t account for what I had seen.  I never thought about it again, even while at Mufon.  It just seemed not too significant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was an airplane, there were no running lights on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then on July 15 I received an email from someone who lives the other side of Toronto from me.  I live in the west end, and the woman lives in the east end.  The woman said she, her husband and their son saw a brightly lit object to the west of them, on Thurs July 4 at approx 10:30pm.  She wanted to know if anyone else saw something strange that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m trying to contact someone at Pearson International Airport, but so far haven&#39;t got through to the control tower.  There&#39;s a good chance they won&#39;t confirm my sighting.  I also want to see if I can find out how low the clouds were that night, because this thing just popped below the ceiling, and then retreated right back in.  My guess would be 5000 ft.<n>

I never really gave them much credence figuring there are too many people to lend witness to such sightings, UFO&#39;s would be a little more inconspicuous I would imagine. Tonight I saw something though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were coming back from the Macy&#39;s fireworks and passing the Statue of Liberty or a little past that vacinity. I was looking out towards the east side, where it was pretty dark and saw a blurring accelerating from the water towards the sky at a 15-20 degree angle. It went by so fast that it left a light trail blur. So fast that it went by in under a second. And there was no point of destination that you could site and say, &#34;There it goes, or is, or etc.&#34; It wasn&#39;t the reflection of another boat, nor my eyes playing tricks on me, nor a reflection on the water as I was looking out that side of the ship for several minutes just enjoying the ride. I looked around the top deck and no one else seemed to be witness to it. I am excited by it as it was unique, but equally disappointed as the short duration puts it in the catagory of metaphysical, esoteric or mind affected experience and therefore somewhat invalidates the experience for me, even though I witnessed it. I look forward to the day when something is CLEARLY captured on film and released to the public.<n>

I didn&#39;t really have time to make out the exact shape of the object because it moved so fast.  I have never in my life seen something move that fast and it was bright too.  It left a bright streak in my vision, so that when I closed my eyes I could still see it.  The other two witnesses saw something similiar, though there is some disagreement on the color of the light.  I felt that it was a white light, and one of the other witnesses claims it was more yellowish.  But we are all agreed on the fact that it flew from one end of the sky to another in half a second or even just a flash.  It was like a bolt of lightning was shot horizontally across the sky.  One other thing is that it made no sound.  It is hard to say how far away it was from us, but it was definitely close enough to where if it was an airplane, we would have been able to hear the engine, but this thing made no sound whatsoever.  Both of my witnesses are  credible, reliable people with good jobs and nice families.  This is<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the witness implies an evening sighting.

I noticed he was looking up.  As I looked up he said, &#34;Do you see that light, or am I not seeing right?&#34; I looked in the direction he was peering and noticed a star-like light in the sky.  It had the luminosity of Mercury or Mars (certainly not as bright as Venus or Jupiter).  If it had been still it could have easily been mistaken for a star.  However, it was its type of motion that distinguished it from a star, a terrestrial aerial vehicle or a satellite.  It was heading from north to south and traveling quite erratically.  It wobbled on an irregular basis from left to right, sometimes speeding up and sometimes slowing down.  Sometimes the wobble was a long slow move to the right; sometimes it was a quick, short burst.  Sometimes it went a short distance backwards, but mostly it moved forward.  If it had been someone driving a car I would have said they were drunk as a skunk, weaving all over the road.  It did not move in a straight line with a consistent speed as a satellite; we heard no sound and there were no other lights (i.e. wing or landing lights) as an airplane.  Its average rate of speed, although erratic, was generally consistent and not very fast.  It traversed 40% of the sky in 3 minutes, and if one held his or her fist out at arm&#39;s length, it would have traversed the width of the fist in 10-12 seconds.  The object was too high up to ascertain any detail other than it was a point of moving light.  We watched the object for approximately three minutes until it could not longer be seen because of the haze of light pollution.<n>

The vertical bar of the object was solid, the horizontal bars were 2 separate bars which looked disconnected on either side of the vertical bar.  Sighting took place in a night sky over the ocean.  I was watching from Coney Island beach.  The object was over open ocean, not land, and too high in the sky to be an airplane, helicopter or fireworks, and it rested motionless in the sky.  I watched it for about two minutes.  Then I looked down at the beach for a second.  When I looked back up for the object it was gone.<n>

I had with me (on loan courtesy of my friend) a Sony Hi-8 72x zoom with tripod to validate what I have been seeing. It was a beautiful night, moderately cloudy to clear At 20:48, before the East River fireworks, I was filming towards (west) a triangular starlike object. The Triangular Starlike Object came to watch the East River fireworks. I guess who wouldn&#39;t miss this one in a new york minute I zoomed in at 72x west at the starlike object. A triangular object/craft emerged from my viewfinder. It is a glowing red triangular body with green on the edges. In normal eyesight, It is luminous white (like a star) but seems so near to the earth&#39;s atmosphere (size) to be a star. I started video recording a triangular object (like an inverted top) with white lights rotating at the base. I also noticed portholes rotating just above the rotating white lights and a smaller portholes underneath it. I have approximately 15 minutes video footage of this triangular object/craft.  It hid behind the clouds before the fireworks began.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have submitted choice video stills at jpg format to Mr. Peter Davenport. I also have the video footages of the event plus the fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report and the images, which have been forwarded to our Center.  The object is triangular in nature, with several lights at the bottom.  We do not know what it is.  PD))<n>

The sky was not completely dark yet.  Fireworks were just starting to be set.  The light we saw appeared like an instantaneous flash of halogen light. It skipped over an area and flashed again.  We saw it flash four times before is left the valley.  It started in the west end of the valley and covered an area headed east of about 30-40 miles in just 10 seconds or less.  At first, we thought it was an airplane, but it moved too quickly, and covered a long distance.  It was NOT fireworks, because of the distance it covered, and the light was consistant with each flash.<n>

I live right by North Perry Airport, so there are lots of small planes.  I looked up and saw a jet climbing and behind/below it a black ball.  They were both traveling northwest but the &#34;ball&#34; was much lower.  I would guess it was roughly  the size of a very small airplane compressed and traveling steadily at about the same speed as a small plane.  I was stunned and thought it had something to do with being the 4th of July and at first thought it looked like it was following the airplane.  We were also to be on high alert for terrorism this day.  I watched it for about a minute with nobody else to yell to come see.  I thought about calling 911 but thought they&#39;d think i was nuts.  I can&#39;t stop thinking about it so have been online and decided to post it.  Maybe someone else saw it - had to have but maybe they&#39;ll read this.<n>

The next day we read in the paper that a meteor had hit somewhere in New York and so we left it at that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It maneuvered straight up slightly, then down,  hovered in one place for a few seconds, then moved straight ahead behind a hill so we could no longer see it. This occurred in the day time, the sighting absolutely did not resemble fireworks of any kind, it was way too long and thin to be a helicopter, and could not have been an airplane because of how it stopped and again was far too long.<n>

It was the Fouth of July 2002 and we where having a picnic with family friends, a lot of family. We were in Henryetta, Oklahoma in the country shooting off fireworks. We all looked up and the sky was full of stars moving in circles, and shooting from side to side, darting across the sky. Crazy! They would change direction in a moment. There where lots of them (don&#39;t know how many) everywhere. All of us just stood there watching. It was as thought they were giving us a 4 of July show. I really believe they where.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s funny that this happened, because my husband didn&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;S and use to laugh at me because I told him I had seen one before. Well he believes now!  The first time was about 3 years before.   Both sightings were so high they just looked like stars. My old boy friend and I decide we were going to go watch for UFO&#39;s one night. We we saw them! The first one I ever saw they were flying paralell to eachother going East. They were doing barrel rolls in the sky.... It was fantastic looking. Then both stopped. One left a star then they both went opposite directions, one North and one South.......fast!! Well that was my first time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway just always wanted to tell my story to someone. Are there groups that just go out looking for UFO&#34;S to see at night? Just curious..((name deleted))..in .oklahoma<n>

It was moving the opposite direction we were.  There were no lights and no sound.   We only saw it because it was cloudy out and we could see it move across the clouds.  That&#39;s all we could talk about the rest of the time we were there.

My first thought is that it was a sattelite until it began to slow down until it eventually came to a stop. Seconds there after, another circular white light, much brighter, started to move towards the first light that had stopped. The first white light then began to move away from the second white light as if it were being chased when suddenly it shot off in a 90 degree angle, unlike any manuver that an aircraft could make. The second white light then stopped again, and began to glow brighter, and then just dissappeared. The event of the two lights took place directly above us around the constellation of the big dipper. Excited and amazed as to what my girlfriend and I witnessed, we decided to stay longer and look for more unusual activity. Approximately 3 minutes after witnessing the first event, I happed to notice another white light, much brighter than the first two on the horizion above hill tops, behind thunder clouds begin to move eastward. It illuminated the clouds it was behind. It to came to a stop behind the clouds, when sunddenly seconds after it stopped, shot out of the clouds vertically towards the direction of the other two lights and dissappeared into the night sky and stars. No further activity was seen in the half our we remained outside after the events.<n>

Was actually pretty mellow. Kids were all in the house,asleep or watching a movie. About 7 of us adults were sitting in lawnchairs in the back yard, enjoying the quiet.Midnight or a few minutes after, not music or outside lights. A warm night and the stars were VERY bright. I was scooted down in my chair, so I could rest my head back so I could observe the sky. (I have had anouther experience in Drain a few years ago, so I always keep my eyes peeled for further &#34;activity&#34;. At one point I was staring at the area directly overhead, when a few of the &#34;stars&#34; started to move! In a triangle formation- one white light that was just like a star at all 3 corners. Inside of the &#39;triangle&#39; was very dark. I got everyone&#39;s attention and said,&#34; Did I drink more than I thought? Or are those stars moving?&#34; Everyone pretty much freaked out and said yes, they were moving! I was facing toward the north. They moved as one and kept the same formation- moved from overhead at an arch toward the east. Than one by one they just vanished. When it pass over a star, it would not show in the middle.Made no sound, at all. If I hold my hand up, the &#39;triangle&#39;would of at least been as big as my palm.

Then out of nowhere there were two oval shaped lights,they looked like they were coming straight down towards me.Then they stopped desending and  they started to move south-west at the same time they were turning around eachother.When they stopped turning they flew straight and then up and they were gone at an incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what it was,but it was nothing I have ever seen before.<n>

I saw five bursts of light in total running approximately north to south.  The duration of the sighting is not exactly known, but I&#39;m guessing that the whole series lasted less than 60 seconds.  The spacing between the flashes covered approximately 10 degrees of sky (one fist width = 10 degrees)the flashes approximately 10 degrees.  The first four bursts of light were in a straight line.  When I saw the second one I thought that something was &#34;bouncing&#34; in and out of the atmosphere.  I dismissed this idea when I realized that their intensity was constant.  I would have come away from the experience and probably soon forgotten it except that the fifth flash of light appeared at a angle of about 45 degrees from the path of the first four heading in a southwesterly direction.  The wind was calm, skys were clear, seeing was about 6.  If this was some sort of conventional aircraft I would like to know about it.<n>

When I got closer to it I could see that it was too close to the ground and too big to be an airplane and I thought that maybe it was a blimp, but it looked too big to be a blimp.  Also I saw huge white lights on it that where in the shape of rectangular windows and I saw a blue flashing light underneath the object.  The object was flying west.  I was near a tollbooth when I saw the object and by the time I got to the tollbooth the object was moving slowly west away from I355.<n>

It was almost like it saw me the first time, took off, and then didd a double take. I could not believe how close these things were to the car. I then told the other two passengers in the front seat to look at what I saw. It sat in the same position shining it&#39;s three bright lights every 20-30 seconds from the moment I told the passengers until about 20-25 minutes later when the view of it was lost due to our elevation dropping on the freeway. We were on the I-5 freeway heading north, and everything I saw was on the East side of the freeway. I first saw it right where the I-5 and the 269 meet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, about 30-40 minutes later, we saw a similar light in the sky about 20 miles ahead and four miles east. Only, this light was shining two vertical lights whereas the other was shining three in triangular form. This thing would dive down(eg. &#34;Superman the ride&#34; at six flags) at unbelievable speed to ground level and zip all the way across the horizon within a matter of seconds and then go back up and stop on a dime in mid-air and do it&#39;s light thing again. It did this over and over again for about 20-25 minutes until we hit the 152 and went into th hills and lost sight of it. What we saw looked very dangerous and all three of us can&#39;t believe it didn&#39;t crash. If a human being was inside this thing then he/she deserves a medal for risking their lives.

It was huge and bright all shinning and shimmering. I saw it moving rather funny so I called my son to come have a look. I thought it might be a helicopter or plane but neither one flies like that. I saw several planes go near there and they were drawrfed by the size of this thing. Then after about and hour it just shot stright up into the sky.

I was walking upstairs to get in bed when i saw a small bright blinking light out the window at the top of the stairs. After looking closely i realized the object was moving ever-so-slightly in an irregular movements. The object was in the western sky, at least a few miles away. I cannot accurately judge its distance but it appeared only slightly larger than the brightest stars. Standing completely still and resting my head on the windowsill the object still appeared to be in motion.It never completely traveled more than 2 window-panes away from its &#34;orbit&#34; for the several minutes that i first oberved. I woke up my girlfriend and asked her to look, she agreed that it was not a star or a plain or helicopter. It manuvered like an insect. The light blinked in a blueish-white color similar to the color of a star but occasionally it would blink red. A minute or 2 after first noticing the bright object i noticed a second &#34;vibrating&#34; light that was much more faint close to the bright light. this second light faded in and out of sight and didn&#39;t appear to be moving around nearly as much as the first object it stayed to the right and higher in the sky than the first object and almost in a pattern it would fade in and out of sight. Then i noticed a third light to lower and to the left of the first light, about equal the distance away from the 1st light as the 2nd light was to the 1st bright light. The 3rd light was just like the second, (very faint, vibrating but not blinking, fading in and out), for a few minutes it seemed like when the 2nd object faded out, the 3rd object would fade in and vice versa. The first light would never fade out, but did constantly move in short irregular circles. The 3 objects kind of appeard to be in a formation  of a rising diagonal.  After 15 minutes i went downstairs and looked out the window and i could still see the lights. then 10 minut! es after that i looked out that window and could not see the lights from that window, i went outside on my porch and saw the moving blinking light had moved much closer to me(east) in the sky, this creeped me out and i went inside<n>

Ive never witnessed any thing like this and i was on an air craft carrier for three years and have not seen any of our planes do that.We were all faceing to the north off of route 8 north. There were three men and one woman that seen it.Two of us work in the construction business, one in a factory, and the other does billing for a company.<n>

As I was looking at a blinking star vertically above my head, I picked up a shape mooving South west to North east. The object covered about half the sky during it&#39;s travel in about 4 to 5 seconds. It was more or less following the ST-Laurence river at about a mile from the shore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression was of a plane at low altitude since it travelled quite rapidly (more common at low altitude about 1000 ft). The unusual shape and lack of sound convinced me that it was not a plane (I&#39;ll talk later about the shape).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I tought it could be a few large birds. Again I could not see any wing moovement and at that time of night large birds do not fly in my area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the object was triangular with the tree corners glowing. The glow was 3 circular lights and were not bright. The glow from the light (not blinking) was not at the tip of the triangle but slightly inside. The object had no contrast or defined edges. I could tell it was triangular because the shape sometimes overlapped the surrounding stars (during it&#39;s travel) revealing the shape. Basically the dark triangular object with glowing circles travelled smoothly without a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object travelled smoothly without stopping in the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the object was hard to define since it was not very bright and I did not know at what altitude it travelled. Hold 2 fingers one inch apart and hold your hand above your head, This was the approximate size of my observation of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work in the aircraft industry and I know a lot about them. This object could not have been a plane of the sort I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for reading my strange sighting.<n>

7/2/02 13:00|Los Angeles|CA|Unknown|5 minutes|Unexplainable Jet noise in the LA sky|7/26/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23625.html|422|ndxe200207| Unexplainable Jet noise in the LA sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea if this was a UFO or what --all I know is that it has been bothering me tremendously, so I thought I would go ahead and report it here.  What happened was this:  at approximately 1 in the afternoon on July 2, I heard what sounded like a jet roaring.  It was so loud as to be deafening.  I immediately ran to my deck (I was at home)--I also noticed many neighbors on their decks.  The sound was incredibly intense--It sounded as loud as if a plane was taking off right above us--we (my neighbors and I) were all covering our ears and frantically (and we were all quite terrified as well) searching the sky for a low flying plane.  There was absolutely nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mean --this sounded like a freight train--like a jet was about to crash directly into us, like it was flying just right over head---the only time I&#39;ve ever heard anything HALF this loud was in NYC on 9/11 (I was about a mile away from ground zero)--so I just don&#39;t understand what it was.  There was no plane in the sky--there was NOTHING in the sky for miles around.  We all looked and looked.  It was a steady, jet like sound that lasted at least 5 minutes and then was just gone; it didn&#39;t really dissapate or trail away either.  It&#39;s really confounded me.<n>

At first I thought it was a satellite, until it changed direction. Then I noticed there were others. They were very far apart spread across the entire sky but exhibited the same behavior, they would drift back and forth and each stayed in the same vicinity of the sky. They seemed to be very high up, occasionally they would disappear behind the clouds. Sometimes they would grow dimmer and brighter, and sometimes they would move quickly and other times stop moving completely. They were too far away to tell if there was more than one light on each, the light appeared to be white. We watched them until about 4 AM when we fell asleep. My wife and I were both completely sober.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I am building experience to fly for the airlines. I saw something strange on my way out of Kansas City International Airport the other night, July 2nd, delivering my load of freight. I have ALWAYS been one of skeptism and thought UFO&#39;s were bogus lies from people with nothing better to do....until now.......<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a solid oval, NO blinking lights, or colored lights, moving rapidly across the sky from EAST to WEST. I&#39;ve seen thousands of satelites before and I know for sure this was NOT a satelite. Why?? Because this object was about the size of a dime moving across my windscreen/windshield. Also, it travelled from directly overhead (where I intially saw it on climb-out), to slightly above the horizon (about 1 thumbs width with your arm stretched outward) before I lost it in the haze. The object travelled this total distance in less than 3 minutes time. My estimate - 250 to 300 miles. It had a soft, medium, white silouette light which illuminated the entire object. I was climbing out of 4500 feet at the time......my guess was that the object was in excess of 50,000 feet. I inquired with ATC, to see if I had any potential conflicting traffic, he panned his radar out to include all altitudes, and then he said nothing was on his scope execpt for &#34;a few low altitude targets that were in bound to K.C. International.&#34; The ATC controller and I both laughed a bit over the frequency about it and then nothing was said. It has been at the front of my mind, each day, since I saw the object.<n>

I was driving home from work about 2am driving down my road. I was about to start breaking to pull into the driveway and all of a sudden this white light flashed right in front of me. The only way I can describe it is a HUGH sheet of the whitest white i&#39;ve every seen. Lasted about 15 seconds, if that. My vision was very blurred and I couldn&#39;t adjust to the night. I was really freaked and my dogs were clearly spooked cause they took off running and barking. I stayed in my car for about 10 minutes not wanting to get out. The next day it was all over this AM radio station that talks about this kind of thing, from people around the USA, that saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We were actually talking about strange things we had seen in the sky over the past few years. I had only told them both about a time when I woke up at approximately 03.30 and for some reason went to the window of my bedroom and looked up to the left of my window and saw 3 very bright lights flash in the sky one after the other in a trianglular space apart. They were about as bright and large as a street light if it was about 100 metres away in the night. One flashe dthen a second later another and then another. I thought it was pretty mad and tried walking my girlfriend incase it happened again but nothing happened after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So this night a few weeks back I was telling my friends this story. I know this sounds like pure bull buts it honestly isn&#39;t. I had told them my story and it was about 20 minutes later and I was facing both of them talking, when from roughly the same spot in the sky the same type of yellowy bright lights flashed again. Again they were from a north easterly direction and seemed to be the same distance apart. This time however there was only 2 of them. To give some idea of distance they were about the length of a standard pen apart if you held it at arms length from you and looked at the sky. There was no particular shape that I could make out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

But I clearly remember being in my car at night when it was nearly pitch black.  Then a light appeared in the sky, I think it was blue or green, and it was only about 20 feet above the houses.  Then about 4 seconds after the first light appeared a bunch of other lights, at least more than 10, came up around the first light encircling it.  Then the UFO hoved over the houses for a few seconds longer, then spun for a second and spun away.  I am not completely sure, but I think the lights might have been changing color as they were spinning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The sky was fifty percent overcast. the clouds were cumulus, big,white and puffy. The sky that you could see between the clouds was very blue. The clouds were not moving fast they were approximately 7000 ft. I was by myself loading boxes in a pick up truck when the daylight halfmoon caught my eye, it was standing out very bright in the western sky. As I stood there looking at the moon something moving three fingers blow the moon really set me back a bit. It was a Disk in shape very smooth and luminated like a flourescent bulb. It was moving south, I was looking up at a 45 degree angle. I watched it for about 4 sec then it went behind a cloud, I thought it was over but it came out the other side of the cloud I watched it for about 3 more sec and then it made a wide arc to the west and disapeared. I am a pilot and I shoot aerial photos. I know aircraft when I see them. If anyone else saw this please report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I was at the Cottage restaurant and bar in Huntsville Ontario for the long weekend. My group were all out on the patio having a drink, when I looked up to see a shooting star. I was travelling at the same speed as a shooting star, but it was two round, orange, objects heading west. The circles were almost flying together as in a formation. They then split up and headed upwards in seperate directions through the clouds, into the night sky. It happened so fast I didn&#39;t know what to make of it. I have never seen anything like that in my life.<n>
