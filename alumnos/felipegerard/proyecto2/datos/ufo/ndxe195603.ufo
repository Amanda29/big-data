I would prefer to send you hard copy of the events.  I saw them on two different occasions exactly 1 week apart at approximately 5:30 p.m.  The first one was 15 miles away from the second one.  The first one was approximately the size of a medcine ball, the second was different.  It was shaped like a set of bar bells, 15&#34; spheres separated by a 12&#34; bar of glowing light.  The light was a gloden glow like the filament of light bulbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had my car windows been open I could have reached out and touched either of them, therefore, they had to be within 2&#34; of my face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both objects glowed like the filament of a light bulb.  Both were silent.  The first or perhaps both of them were highly energized.  The first one occurred during an ice storm.  My boss sent me home from work early due to the weather.  I was a bit out of Coates, Minnesota southbound on Hwys 52 &amp; 56 when I noticed this large ball of light drifting across the field towards me. Due to the foul weather I was only driving 15 or 20 miles per hour, the UFO I would guess was going about the same speed.  The road was very icy and I couldn&#39;t stop.  It was so icy the car was sheathed in a coat of ice 1/4&#34; or more thick.  The ice hadn&#39;t even melted directly over the center of the engine after having traveled about 15 miles from my work place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball came across the field, into the ditch and up onto the road.  I thought it was some form of ball lightening though I had never seen that phenomena previously.  It came across the shoulder and onto the pavement.  I couldn&#39;t stop because of icy road conditions.  Also, I thought I&#39;m in a car with four good rubber tires under me and as soon as this &#34;lightening&#34; touched the car it would dissipate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball came up the corner of the car and across the hood at a diagonal.  It just missed the corner post on the driver&#39;s side of the car.  It then went down the side of the car and continued across the highway and the field on that side.  It continued on it&#39;s path from the southeast to the northeast.  During it&#39;s transit, the car engine cut out cold.  I don&#39;t recall if I had to restart it as the car did keep moving, I may have turned the key again to start it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where it had come across the hood the metal was instantly dry.  The right side of the hood was still encased in ice.  The edge of the &#39;cut&#39; was smooth as if cut by a knife.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rest of the ice remained on the car for several hours after I arrived home, my husband commented on the dry section and remaining ice when he saw the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Precisely one week later, same time of day, 15 miles south of the first encounter and on my own street, 1/2 mile east of my home, another UFO appeared.  This was the one shaped like two basketballs with a bar between them.  This one circled the car twice as if pearing in on me and checking my out.  Why, I don&#39;t know, but nine months later I gave birth to my only child.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The car was a 52 Chevy in almost new condition.  The contact melted the component where all the wires and distribution system for the electrical system was.  The annoyance from all electrical components malfunctioning repeatedly after that got to be too frustrating for us and we got another car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two men in black did come to my door following this incident.  I didn&#39;t want to get involved with them and I told them I thought it was two incidents related to ball lightening.  However, I have lived a lot of years since and have never met with the same phenomena since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unbeknownest to me, I had serious birth defects in my reproductive system.  When the doctors finally found them and removed my uterus; they were amazed that I had been able to have a child at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When this boy and I were younger we both could change traffic lights at will, switching the lights from red to green.  Since then there have been changes made in traffic control technology and that is no longer possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/20/56 20:00|Bowie|MD|Disk|15 min.|Unusual object seen from different viewpoints.|5/13/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28758.html|2|ndxe195603| Unusual object seen from different viewpoints.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While piloting a B-25 out of Andrews AFB, I was Northbound over Bowie at 8000 feet. It was a dark, clear night. Looking almost straight down at the city lights, I saw a circular object on or near the ground, unmoving. It seemed to be internally illuminated with segments of red, yellow and green light which were spinning slowly clockwise. I estimated its size as about forty feet. As I watched, it suddenly turned bright white and simultaneously shot off to the North at a speed of around 600 knots. In a few seconds it was miles ahead of my aircraft and climbing through my altitude. I pointed it out to my copilot and we watched as it arced out over the sea and disappeared in the distance at a great height. The total time of the sighting was maybe twelve seconds. I continued North to Baltimore and made a left-hand circle around the city, then headed back to the South. As the city lights were falling behind, my copilot slapped my arm and said, &#34;Did you see that?&#34; I hadn&#39;t seen anything. He said a white light had dived past our right wing very closely at high speed. We looked around but saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later the radio came alive with chatter about a plane crash near Bowie. We heard no more that night. The next morning I went back to the base to file a report, as we were required to in those days. No one ever contacted me about the report. Then I read an item in that day&#39;s Washington Post about a false report of a crash. I quote it here: FAKE REPORT STIRS AIR CRASH HUNT A false report of a plane down near Bowie, Md. led more than 500 police, fire and military authorites on a two-hour search last night. Minutes after the report, 28 state police cruisers, an additional 11 Park Police units and dozens of fire and rescue squads from eight counties joined in the search. The report originated with a caretaker at the Womens&#39; Reformatory at Jessup. State Police said that military units on night maneuvers had probably shot off flares, leading to the report, state police said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be precise, given that it may be from an U. S. military flight log book.   We have met the individual who submitted this report, and we deem him to be an exceptionally credible witness.  He is a former fighter (F-86) and bomber (B-25) pilot, and a former military officer, who was assigned to the Pentagon.  Our impression is that it would be extremely difficult to find a more reliable, credible, and convincing witness.  This is one of several sightings the same individual has had, and those reports will appear in our database, as well, at a later date.  PD))<n>

The Pet|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05076.html|3|ndxe195603| Objects were several thousand feet in altitude and bounced around the sky basically overhead.  I was 17 years old at the time.  The Petaluma Argus Courier Newspaper came out with the event the next day with my name.  I was ridiculed for years. Several months later I received a call from a Control Tower Operator in Oakland who would not tell me his name but verified what I saw was viewed on RADAR at the Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects ere circular in shape and the sun reflected off the material. I and my two class mates were working in a venitian blind company just outside of town when the event occurred.  We were all in our teens. Subsequently I had observed other phenomena througout the years. My girlfriend (eventually my wife) were parked on a hill overlooking the Burbank Airport one summer night in around March of 1956.  A cirlular object floated over our heads and just sat there.  We were sitting in a convertible and just looked up and saw a huge cirlular object with several lights underneath.  It hovered there for about 20 minutes.  Planes were landing overhead above the object.  Eventually it sped off over the Burbank mountains. Soon after marriage driving from Burbank to our new home in Orange, California at about 2 am in the morning, we were tracked by a bright green ball type object that followed us over the organe groves until we reached out home. Then next day the papers were full of sightings over El Toro Marine base near by. Several years later while living in Villa Park, California (near Orange,CA.) I was awakened after midnight with what sounded like rocks on the roof. Then there was a brilliant white/blue light that came from our Patio and lit up our room.  I ran outside to the Patio and the light was not there. I looked up and saw an object in the Western sky that appeard to retract a bright light from beneath (like airplane landing lights) and up into the object.  It then sped off towards the ocean.  The next night I saw a bright light streak across the sky from North to South. Subsequently I was approached by a person outside of Reno, Nevada and had several years of education regarding UFO&#39;s. I met with Linda Moulton Howe in Oceanside, California about 5 or 6 years ago.  I related the story to her.  We communicated for a while and then lost contact.  Professor Hynek and his assistant was also in contact with me regarding this &#39;person&#39;.  But when I sent a tape recording to Hynek and the audio was completely erased including the emulsion, Hynek thought it best to cut off communications with me.  That was the last time I heard from him.  The year was about 1975 when I leved in Villa Park, CA. The original tape from the interview also dissapeared from my safe.  I decided to just forget the whole thing.<n>
