However, a bit later, when the highway goes through a low mountain range with many turns, I noticed that this object maintained its position practically from whichever angle I was looking from, meaning that it must have been very high, many miles high, and therefore be enormous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over 2 hours after the first sighting it was becoming dusk and I was approaching Albuquerque and as soon as I arrived home I got the binoculars but I could not see it any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day or so I was at a Memorial Day gathering of friends and many of us were discussing this object..  there were at least a half dozen who saw it exactly as I had.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I noticed it sounded like the alarm was coming closer, so I stepped out onto my balcony of the second floor of my apt. The alarm was still going off, I happened to look up and noticed several white lights, which were in four different clusters. The first cluster had four lights on it in a diamond shape as if the lights were at the 12-3-6and9 like a clock would be, moving slowly from southwest to northeast direction. The second cluster had only three lights, moving in the same direction, but the third cluster had four lights all moving together but rotating on an axis, in a counterclockwise fashion. The fourth cluster only had three lights, but it was a little different then the rest, because as it went over the highway it rotated slightly, and it reflected the orange highway lights from below. But it then appeared to have a single light in the middle of the triangle, It looked as if it might have been silver, it was the only one that I could tell that was solid. These crafts were about 500-800feet up.There was no sound at all as these things went over head, because by this time the alarms had stopped. It was a clear night I could see many stars, except in the middle of these clusters of lights. I have seenmany aircrafts and helicopters and this was like nothing I had ever seen. I don`t know if there was a full moon or not. I have been asked that before. There was a witness, he was the security guard at the apt. complex. He was outside looking for what was causing the alarms to go off. I reported this to a ufo network and was given several names, one of an aeronautical engineer, and one of a director of the network, who came to my house and even hypnotised me to verify my story.The Hypnosis session was recorded on tape. So he may still have them. I have names which can be gotten from me at request.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I had lived in that house for 10 years and there were never any lights such as these there.  They were the size of car lights, but in the sky.and in vertical row.  I got up to see better and they dissapeared.  I sat agiain, then they appeareed again. I felt that they were watching me, so I close the curtains.  Next day, my friend told me that someone in the area had seen the red light also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elect to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

5/15/90 20:00|West Point|NY|Triangle|3 minutes|Large, slow craft cirlces over West Point, NY, in late spring of 1990.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49564.html|11|ndxe199005| Large, slow craft cirlces over West Point, NY, in late spring of 1990.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the late spring of 1990, I received a call from my neighbor - the wife of a workmate and my wife&#39;s friend - who lived across our parking lot in military housing on top of Stoney Lonesome, a small mountain at West Point, NY.  She said, go outside and look up . ..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did so and over my head came a set of lights in a boomerang configuation.  (Immediately after this event, I made a drawing of the lights, but have since lost it).  The lights were arranged in five or six sets of three.  The three lights in each set were identical: pastel yellow, green and blue.  There were some smaller red lights, but not in a configuration common on commercial or military aircraft.  The sets of lights were absolutely symetrical in their arrangement and fixed in their relationship.  My wife joined me and alerted our neighbors to our right who also came outside to look. The lights were relatively low, and I could hear the throb of an engine.  The sound is best described as the sound made when a set of twin boat engines is operating a little out of synch.  Its speed was very slow and it made a turn around our small area during which I saw a small red light behind the &#34;craft&#34; move suddenly to the craft and disappear, like it was on a tether.  Its speed remained slow, so slow that I wondered if it was ligher than air . . .  faster than drifting (there was no perceptible wind) but definitely powered in a direction at a speed that should not have supported aerodynamic flight.  As the craft completed its maneuver, it moved east toward the Hudson River.  It was soon behind the two story duplex across from me.  I estimated its altitude above me at about 400 feet (based upon clarity with which I could see the lights and hear the sound).  It was two fists wide, perhaps.  Using the roof line of the opposing duplex (which eventually obscured the craft from view) as a reference, I make the following estimate of its size.  The duplex was approximately 30 feet tall (top of roof line) and 40 feet wide.  When it was obsured by the roof line, the craft was about half the width of the duplex.  If the craft was at 400 feet and did not change altitude as it moved east, and my eyes were at about 5 feet above the ground, then the craft&#39;s width was approximately equal to 8000/25 or 320 feet, a very large craft.  I also estimate that the distance from my viewing point to the duplex roofline was 80 feet, making the distance the craft traveled before it was obscured to be approximately 32000/25 or 1240 feet, almost 1/4 mile. It probably took about 30 seconds for the craft to travel that distance once it headed that way, making its speed to that point approximately 30 miles per hour, very slow for an aircraft! (I did these calculations as I am now making this report).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called Stewart AFB and reported the sighting . . . or more appropriately inquired as to what might have been over this Federal installation.  A coupld days later they returned my call and told me it was several ultra-lights operating in formation.  After seeing this craft do a 270 degree turn without changing geometry and after hearing a sound that did not equate to more than two engines, I knew this was not a plausible explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strangely enough, I shortly thereafter was given the book Communion by Whitley Striber.  I didn&#39;t even realize, as I read it, that he lives across the Hudson and a bit south from West Point.  It was amazing to read his descriptions and the explanations given to him by Steward AFB!  The following week I talked to a couple of the cadets we sponsored and learned that they heard cadets talking about something strange they saw circling over the Academy!  Lastly, my partner&#39;s father saw the same object in Connecticuit approximately the same time!  I didn&#39;t learn of that until 13 years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For your notes, I was at the time a Major in the Army teaching electrical engineering at the US Military Academy, from which I graduated in 1976; I recieved a MSEE (control systems) from the University of Washington in Seattle prior to teaching at the Academy. I do consider myself a trained observer of scientfic data and annomalies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

They claimed to have observed this object for several minutes before it started to move toward them.  Upon the realization that this object was approaching they raced off on their bicycles and observed the object scanning the ground with a white light as if looking for them. They noticed the craft to have been oval and emitted no sound except for a slight humming.  They sped away and notified me over the telephone at which time I observed the craft from my home at a distance of a couple miles.  At this time it was dark and the object shown as a white light hovering in the sky.  It eventually sped off after several minutes.<n>

It had two rows of lights on it, upper and a lower. The lights were going in different directions and would change colures. I estimated the length of it to be around 80 feet. And approximately 25 to 30 feet from top to bottom. I couldn’t tell how deep it was due to seeing it only from the side. This craft was hovering in a 30 to 35 knot wind making no sound. It was barely over the tree tops next to a four lane highway. At the time it was near dusk dark and all you could make out were the shape and colored lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Amazingly enough no one else even acted like they saw it.

When I went down the next hill to try and get closer for a better look it was gone. as Iapproached the area where I&#39;d seen this thing I noticed that there were contruction vehicles parked in a field,backhoe&#39;s and things of that nature. All I could think was that whatever it was,was checking out our capability to construct large machinery. I mention to my family what I had seen and of course they thought me crazy! So when I found this site,decided to see if anyone else had seen anything like I had.Also I have to add that when it disappeared it happened so quickly like it kneww I was watching.

By process of elimination we determined that it had to be a U.F.O.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved horizontally as well as vertically across the sky as well as staying still. It was no aircraft we had ever seen or seen since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten minutes it zoomed diagonally, up and out of sight very fast.<n>
