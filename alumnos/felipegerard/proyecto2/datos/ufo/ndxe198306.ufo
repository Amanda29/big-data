6/30/83 20:00|Dunmore (NSW, Australia)||Diamond|30 - 40 minutes|Mother Craft that released 3 Smaller Craft - Witness of the Craft leaving the atmosphere|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24248.html|3|ndxe198306| Mother Craft that released 3 Smaller Craft - Witness of the Craft leaving the atmosphere<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1983 I and two friends winessed a very large flying craft, hovering very high in the sky just slightly north from above our family&#39;s 200 acre property at Dunmore, NSW, Australia. It was between 8 - 10pm on a clear, cloudless night. My friends and I were on the hill in the centre of our property in a car, from which we did not alight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One friend first noticed the craft, which was the very similar in shape to a &#39;diamond&#39; shaped craft. I liken it to a &#34;brilliant cut diamond&#34; which had the point removed from the base. The top section of the &#39;diamond&#39;, which was divided by lights, was about 1 third of the size of the bottom section. The was no noise emitting from the craft. I do not recall the colours, but I recall that the lights around the girth of the craft were a different colour to the rest of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it hovering for about 2 minutes and all of a sudden it excellerated towards us at a great speed and stopped suddenly. I could not tell the distance it travelled but it appeared to &#39;grow&#39; from about the size of a full moon to something 5 times the size, in a true &#39;blink&#39; of the eye. It had travelled directly towards us. We were more amazed than scared. It hovered above us, still slightly to the north and then released from the bottom section (not at the exact base) 3 smaller craft which I liken to Fire Flys due to the way in which they darted in all directions, at great speed. They were the shape of glowing balls. Two were the same colour and one was different, yet I can only recall that one of the colours of the craft were red. I don&#39;t recall if the red were the majority of the craft or not. These craft flitted all over the night sky while the &#39;mother craft&#39; remained hovering near us. This scene continued for such a length of time that one of my friends got bored watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then lost sight of the smaller craft and next thing, the mother craft took off in the exact opposite direction it had come at us, at great speed again. It moved a greater distance away than we had seen it the first time, and at such speed that it went from this HUGE thing in the sky to only a point of light, the size of a star. If you had not seen it leave, you could not have distinguished it from the other stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My thoughts returned to the 3 craft which had been left behind and were now nowhere to be seen. A few/one (unable to recall exactly) minute later a commercial plane flew across the night sky, with it&#39;s stationary lights flashing in the sky. The Fire Fly craft came back into view, as if following at a distance, yet taunting or showing off to the plane&#39;s lack of ability. They remained a good distance behind the plane, darting around as if to show off their abilities to us (we were very visible as we watched them on the top of the hill). The plane&#39;s appearance is what we used to discuss how big the Fire Fly craft were in comparison to the plane and their ability to turn at great speed in any required direction. It also confirmed that they were not the tail lights of a commercial plane. The mother craft still remained stationary in the outer atmosphere whilst this occurred, still appearing as a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five minutes after the plane had flown from view the mother craft returned, again at such speed that it just appeared to &#39;grow&#39; again in size. It did not return as close as the last time nor as far as the first time sighted. It collected the Fire Fly craft very quickly and then took off, at great speed, in the opposite direction again. This time it did not halt in the outer atmosphere but continued on at enormous speed so that the &#39;star&#39; that it turned into appeared to go out like a light bulb that had just blown. It was a like a tiny little flash or blink and then the &#39;star&#39; (craft) was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived at our farmhouse I excitedly told my mother about what we had seen and she commented that the television screen had gone &#39;snowy&#39; for almost half an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not witnessed another UFO sighting since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They were at a pretty high altitude because I could see them well up and over the tree line. They were a good distance apart so I immediately thought they were a couple of planes either heading for Shreveport Regional Airport or Barksdale Air Force Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took my attention back to the road since it was at dusk dark and proceeded to drive on south towards my home and in the direction of the lights. I could no longer see them due to the trees along the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got about a quarter mile from my house I came to a clearing in the trees that allowed a good view to the east and when I looked up at the darkening sky I saw the lights again. This time I saw they were not just lights. They were two objects, eliptical in shape, almost oval, and had three lights emitting from them. One of them was rotating on a center axis but neither was moving horizontal or vertical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped to get a better look and I saw various planes flying around the objects with the familiar red and green lights but the lights on the objects were white, yellow, and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son became frightened at the excitement in my voice so I drove on home.  I ran in to get my wife to come out and look since I estimated the objects were at least 4 to 5 thousand feet up and would have been plainly visible from my home but when we ran back out they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked every night after that for a long time in the same area where they were and never saw them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I was sitting in the drivers seat of our van while my family slept in the tent.  I saw a bright yellow light about 3 feet in diameter appear above the creek that the campground was on. It immediately began zig-zagging through the trees in the campground and came within 10 feet of the front of my van. It went deeper inland until I couldn&#39;t see it.  A much larger glowing circular light then appeared very high in the sky. (It may have been there all along and I didn&#39;t notice it until I saw the smaller orb). I saw 4-5 yellow lights come out of the larger light and descend into different areas.  The large light remained in the sky.  About 5 minutes passed, and the smaller light that passed me came back out of the forest and back over the water. It then rapidly accelerated and went into the larger light.  Simultaneously, the other smaller lights ascended and were absorbed into the larger light! like the one I saw close up.  About 3-5 seconds later, the larger light simply looked like it blinked out. It did not appear to take off at a high speed; it just blinked out.<n>

At your request as heard on the ART BELL radio program on 2/5/01, I am sending you MY UFO story...IT IS TRUE... I don&#39;t remember the exact date, but I AM POSITIVE it was in the EARLY 1980&#39;S... My best friend and I, in our early 20&#39;s at the time, decided to go &#34;Back-Roading&#34; on a clear Summer, weekday night around 10:30 PM... We were out driving the country roads surrounding Red Wing, MN., traveling East in the vicinity of Whiterock, MN. when I, (The Passenger) , saw an unusually bright light, approximately 500-1000 Ft. Up &amp; 1-2 Miles North of us, that seemed to be moving South VERY slowly... We pulled off to the side of the road, turned OFF the engine, and got out of the car to get a better look... The &#34;Object &#34; was now almost directly above us and STATIONARY &amp; the bright light was now gone... We listened, but could hear NO SOUND at all coming from it... It appeared to be TRIANGULAR and very dark, If not Black...(Please Read On)... I took some small binoculars out of the glove box and looked at the object closer... I SAW a definite TRIANGULAR shape, but slightly angled inwards at the back, like the back end of an arrowhead... I also saw 5 LIGHTS on the Bottom of the object...Each a DIFFERENT COLOR, arranged in a CIRCLE, with the lights placed at points as the points of a star shape would be within a circle...The lights did NOT blink or fade On &amp; Off... I don&#39;t know what this thing was, but I DO know what it WAS&#39;NT...A Plane OR a Helicopter... It just stayed there in the sky STATIONARY for approximately 5 MINUTES, and then SLOWLY moved Northwest... We got back in the car and followed it at about 10-20 MPH...to 40-50 MPH...Then to 80-90 MPH... It still outpaced us moving off Northwest untill within 30 seconds or so, it could not be seen... We slowed down &amp; went back home feeling Thrilled, Spooked, &amp; Thoroughly Mystified... We told only our close friends &amp; family about the sighting, fearing ridicule, and went on with life having no answers on the subject... Within a week we were busy trying to convince ourselves it HAD to be a plane or a helicopter, and we were starting to believe our excuses... A week after that, on the FRONT PAGE of our local newspaper, the Red Wing REPUBLICAN EAGLE, were sketches of the very object we had seen 2 weeks before... Apparently several eyewitnesses had seen this object floating at tree top level at various spots in an around Red Wing,MN. where we live... Needless to say, that ended our excuses...But, to this day I am sill left without answers... As I said, this sighting happened in the EARLY 1980&#39;s, and with a little help from our local newspaper, mabey you could get the exact date... Or they might still have the newspaper archived... Also, mabey ART BELL would be interested in this TRUE Story...?? Feel free to forward it to him if you like... Thanks for listening &amp; the IMPORTANT job you do!!<n>

I found this site some time ago and when I found it had reports dating back many years, I decided to see if anyone else reported what I saw many years ago.  Much to my surprise, I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the early summer of 1983, I was 11 years old, my girlfriend and I were having a sleepover at her house in St. Paul Park, MN.  After a few hours of fun running around the neighborhood late at night, we settled down for bed in the back of her fathers pick-up truck, which was parked in the drive way (no topper on truck).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we lay there talking and looking up at the sky, a very large black triangle, silently passed over us.  It had no lights on that I could discern.  It moved at what I would guess to be 10-15 mph.  It was just above tree top level. It created no wind.  It was very unnatural in its behavior.  Even though I was 11 years old, I knew this was not some normal aircraft.  My friend and I became very quiet and went right to bed after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my family. They did not believe me at the time.  I have shared this with many people over the years including my husband, who heard this from me long before I ever found this site.  Needless to say I was excited when I found out someone else saw the very same thing I did (validation).  I feel confident it must have been the same night.   Redwing , MN is just south of St. Paul Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My little school friend and I never really talked about what we saw at the time, but many years later, when we were adults, I tried to talk to her about it because I could never forget about it.  She said she didn’t remember it at all and acted as if I was strange.  I know she saw it at the time because it was frightening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I am a professional who works in the medical field radiologic imagery (not X-ray).  This incident occurred when I was 14 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may seem strange to describe the exact circumstances of my observation, but you have to see this through the eyes of a teenager.  I had a cassette player which was the type that your regular portable unit which was about the size of an elongated cigar box.  My parent&#39;s house was about 5 blocks from the ocean.  At night, the next door neighbor would come over and she would sit at the dinner table with my mom and talk for hours.  So, to play my music and get away from my surroundings, I would take refuge by easily ascending to the rooftop by clmbing a palm tree via the ac unit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening after dusk, 9pm, I was listening to music, not to loud on the rooftop, when suddenly, the tape stopped playing.  At first, I thought the batteries died, but I could see the rollers were still moving.  I fiddled with the volume wheel, but it was not that either.  Perplexed, I sat there for a minute thinkin that the tape was bad or my player was going bad.  I honestly do not remember why I looked up, but I did.  Then I just leaned back and stretched my arms behind my head.  I noticed something odd, but I could not figure out what I was seeing.  Something to the east and to the North was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a dark triangular object that looked to me at the time like a black hang glider up in the clear star lit sky traveling from North to South at a speed of maybe 300 mph or more.  It was dead quiet and it was definitely up there.  No lights but it was so clear out, that I could see its shape.  Now, Ironically later in life, it seemed to me to look more like an F-117 stealth in its overall shape, but this was in 1983.  Whatever it was, it profoundly etched itself in my memory.  About 30 seconds after traversing the peripheral of my view,  the tape player started playing music again. It was playing the song as if it had missed the part where the track was silent.  Before this incident, and after, I never had any problems with the tape or the machine, until I got rid of the player a few years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not claim to have seen a UFO or a secret military craft.  But what I saw defied any satisfactory explanation to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

When we got there, she was the one who first saw the object and said &#34;What is that!?&#34;, I promptly turned and saw a Delta formation with 10 to 15 lights rapidly climbing on the East, their lights have a distinct blue color and appeared to be travelling very high with no sound. At first I thought they should be some sort of military aircraft, but then they started an incredible manouver with all the lights mixing with each other like a swarm of bees, my mother just said &#34;Ooohhh!!&#34; and I felt a strange feeling of facing an unearthly reality, I&#39;ve just keep thinking &#34;This was not done by humans&#34;. The crafts continue passing overhead and I pointed the binoculars at them, nothing more could be seen, only points of lights with maybe a little haze around them (but it could be the focus because I was really excited). I would like to point out that I couldn&#39;t figure out if it was a single triangular object with lights on its bottom side or if they were distinct objects; anyway as the crafts continue they slowly changed light color from blue (rising east) to blue-green (overhead) to a fiery red as they approached the West horizon. The apparent size of the formation was 1 degree (2 full moons) and their intensity approached -1 magnitude. I have managed to watch two more manouvers through binoculars (really incredible) and each of those manouvers lasted for about 3 seconds, after that all lights returned to their original positions instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No news appeared on local television or newsapaper although someone else should have seen the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The apparent velocity was very similar to a low earth orbit satellite, but I have no clue about their real altitude or velocity, the lights didn&#39;t blink at any time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in June 1983 is approximate.

6/15/83 19:30|Phoenix|AZ|Sphere|5 Minutes|Sighting & Possible abduction|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27788.html|19|ndxe198306| Sighting &amp; Possible abduction<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi, I live in Phoenix Arizona. Here is the accounts of my life since the first sighting. First Sighting: In 1983 or 84 I was at my house at 36th Street and Lupine. We were the back house in a very dark culdisac. It was very dark there and easy to watch the night skies. My stepsister and I noticed three stars above the McDowell Mountains just east of Scottsdale Airport that appeared to be moving very slightly. I don&#39;t know how high up they were but it was high. We discussed how they couldn&#39;t be helicopters because there wasn&#39;t any sound from the blades. We also discussed that they couldn&#39;t be planes because the were staying in one spot. They were in a triangle type formation. They looked to be teetering or swaying weightlessly. When we noticed this we immediatly knew we were looking at something very different. They hovered above us silently for about two minutes. Then one of them shot off to the south like a bullet and it was gone. These were the fastest things I have ever seen to this day. The other two hovered a while longer and then one zipped off into the east. The one that remained hovered for about 30 seconds and then it went straight up until we could no longer see it. We were overwhelmed at what we witnessed. You just know when you see something like that what it is and you know inside what you have seen, it&#39;s like they connect with you somehow. We later watched the news and saw reports of people calling in seeing what we had seen. My life forever changed after that night. I began to have feelings of insight or intuition as I call it. The night of my time loss: I was at a party in the desert with some freinds and it was getting late so decided that it was time to leave. Nobody would give me a ride back into town so I started to walk. I walked a distance about half way to town and I noticed the sky above me began to pulse an intense blue flashing strobe and I don&#39;t remember anything after that or losing any time but that 30 minute walk took 2 hours longer than it should have. I know I lost about two t! o three hours and arrived just outside of town, how did I walked that far without knowing it. That was a very scary night. I began to get migrains after that night that hurt so bad I would almost pass out and vomit. I had never even had a headache before that night. It&#39;s all very strange and confusing. I have predicted things like putting on my seatbelt 10 seconds before my wife and I were involved in an accident, I had a feeling something was about to happen and put on the seatbelt real fast and the next thing I know we were involved in a pretty serious accident. I was with a freind at a late night movie asked him for some strange reason to look up at the lights and at that exact moment the entire parking lights(about 50) all shut off at that second. Even I was freaked out by this, I don&#39;t know why I asked him to look at them, I just did and that still trips me out. There are many more occassions where these types of things happened to me.  Recently we were at Lord of the Rings Two Towers and I had a feeling something was wrong at home, I leaned over during the movie and I asked my wife if she left the Christmas lights on at home because it was a three hour movie, I was sensing or worrying about fire. When we arrived at  home I found a candle my step-daughter had left burning on her desk shelf and it was starting to burn the shelf above, my wife was amazed by this! It might seem trivial, but something as simple as driving someplace, feeling when to leave with my intuition and I experience no traffic and make it through every green light. Does anyone else experience these types of things? I was able to start putting computers together without any knowledge of them. I automatically knew how they worked and I instantly knew how to build them. There are many more things I have experienced but it would take all day to write them down, and I feel very strange writing about this. It feels better to finally get this off my chest. Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in June 1983, assuming that it may have been summertime that the witness would have been walking a long distance at night.  Optic migraine headaches can be preceded by the occurrence of &#34;flashing blue triangles&#34; in the visual field, but we have no way of knowing whether that may have been the cause of the witness&#39;s experience.

I can remember hearing music coming from outside the house. My brother and I ran outside where my mother already was to see where the music was coming from. When I got outside I saw a huge oblong saucer flying over our house. It was playing computer-generated type music. The object was flying maybe just a couple hundred yards above our house. I can also remember lights of every color changing and blinking throughout the ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in June 1983 is approximate.

Clear skies, daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred in June 1983 in Borger, Texas.  I had not reported this earlier because at the time it occurred I had no corroborating witnesses, no photographs, essentially nothing to substantiate the claim.  I doubted that anyone would have believed what I saw at the time.  However, this sighting stays in the back of my mind, so I am reporting it, if for no other reason, than to have closure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting occurred about 17:30 (Local Time, Central Time Zone) in June 1983.  I was in my residence and heard what I thought was a really, really, loud jet.  It was so loud that I stepped out on my front porch to see what it was.  I looked up and the object was probably one-half mile away at an altitude of probably two thousand feet.  (These are only estimations.)   It was huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a pair of 10 X 35 binoculars in the living room, so I quickly stepped back inside and grabbed the binoculars.  By that time the object was receding, so I might have been better off not using the binoculars.  I remember the object filled the binocular’s field of view, which at the time made me wonder just how big this thing actually was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was a large black boomerang-shaped object, moving from east to west.  It was travelling at a modest speed, maybe 200 miles per hour (again, it’s hard to estimate something in the sky without reference points.)  I remember as I looked at the object, there were three specific things that struck me.  The first was the size…I can only guess that it was 300-400 feet side-to-side and maybe 75-125 feet front-to-back.  The second was the tremendous noise the object made.  It was LOUD.  And, third, the fact that the object was lopsided; that is to say it was asymmetrical.  I wondered how it stayed in the air…it didn’t look aerodynamic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think another reason I never reported this is the fact that it sounded like a really large jet.  Maybe it was…if so, it was like nothing I had seen before and have not seen since.  The jet sound made me think it was a conventional aircraft, but the shape and the size made me think it was something beyond classification. I did not notice any exhaust or smoke behind the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then I have seen video of the A1 bomber and other stealth aircraft.  On one occasion I saw an A1 pass directly overhead.  Believe me, the thing I saw in 1983 makes the A1 look like a toy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By definition, what I saw was a UFO, because it was not identified, it was flying and it was an object.  Whether it was of terrestrial origin or somewhere else, I don’t know  I wish I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was staying with my mother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a friend spending the night who went to get us some Toco Bell on his bike.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember that helter skelter was playing on TV and there were a bunch or Regan and Bush election comercials on. My friend was taking a long time to come back and my mother and I went outside to see if he was comming down the rode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We spotted the boy driving his bike down the rode holding a toco bell bag..<n> <n><n> <n><n> He looked up in the sky with his mouth hanging open, dropped the bag and fell off his bike. We looked in the sky and seen; &#34;Your going to think I&#39;m crazy&#34; A HUGE round craft with lights all around it and a a bright light comming out of a big hole in the center. It was kinda like a doughnut...there was a hole in the center but the light was blurred or hazy so we couldnt see beyond the hole..The craft was made from some metallic material. &#34;Looked like grey metal. The craft was turning at a medium pace in a circle hovering right above us. The craft was so big it looked like it was a lid to a cookie jar that we were inside. I started running in circles crying...my mother was grabbing me trying to get me in the house...As soon as she got into the house she called my grandmother up on the phone. My grandpa and grandma looked outside and seen the same craft. They said it looked like it was right above them  object. My mother left the phone to go see if it was still there. My mother and I went outside and it was still there. A second later it took off slowily in a diagonal direction upwards then come to a complete stop..then it Zoomed off with a flash in the opposite direction leaving our site. My grandpa seen 1 other small craft leaving with the main one...But I only seen one. Concerned, my mother called The GC Police dept. And said &#34; Please listen. this is not a prank. There was something over our house about 5 minutes ago&#34; The police said. MAMM, we havent had any reportings of any objects in the sky today.It was probably just a plane. My mom got pissed and hung up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I seen something on TV about sightings of a Bush election plane flying around..&#34;Sounds like they were trying to justify something&#34; I would like to see this object again. My memory is slightly clouded due to the time passed. I can say that this was a FLYING SAUCER without a doubt. It wasnt little flying lights or a falling star ...It was a Huge grey metal disk that must have been over a mile in diameter &#34; I forgot to mention, my grandma lived 1 mile away from us.&#34; I seen what appeared to be windows with light comming out of them..The funny thing was.This thing had alot of light comming from it, but the groung wasnt lit up nor were the houses in the general area...I find it hard to believe nobody else seen the same thing even thought it was 11:300 or later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oops almost forgot..There wasnt any sound from the object that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was on a night fishing trip with a friend of mine at the Ashokan Reservoir.  The night was warm and clear with 1000&#39;s of stars.  My friend pointed out a bright &#34;star&#34; that he had been watching move around for about 30 seconds.  When I saw the object it was a stationary bright white light at an extremely high altitude.  My first words were &#34;thats a star&#34;, but after about 15 or 20 seconds of remaining absolutely still the object shot straight back into space at such an incredible rate of speed that it just got smaller and smaller until it was totally out of site.  This departure took less than 5 seconds.  This has been my only UFO siting and I wish I had reported it sooner but I did not know this site existed until recently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We wonder whether the witness might have been observing a satellite pass overhead, just as it entered the Earth&#39;s shadow.  In that circumstance, the satellite would gradually fade and appear to get smaller, which might lead the human visual system to interpret that phenomenon to mean that the object was shooting away from the witness quite rapidly.

This would place the onbect roughly over The Geysers, a famous geothermal field run by Unocal Geothermal and PG&amp;E (which was originally developed by my grandfather and his mercury mining associates, and curiously enough also where my father worked as production foreman). This object made no sound, was surrounded by a faint glwoing aura and left a glowing luminous train which gradually tapered off to nothing. Both Paul and myself stood on the front porch watching the object slwoly slip behind the ridgeline, as if it was coming in to make a nice, gentle landing. Once the object slipped from view, both of us seemed to snap out of our amazment induced shock and proceeded to verify that we had both seen the same thing. I have personally seen 14 UFOs in my life, 4 of which I cannot dismiss as some other phenomena. These 4 sightings, all of which were witnessed by at least one other person, all occurred in/near Cloverdale, CA. Perhaps the geothermal energy production units at The Geysers are of interest to visiting species...<n>

We were going home east just turning from No.BAY Dr, onto No. Way. As we all looked up the inlet, at the end of the pavement, approx mile, there were two very bright lights on the point of the ,mountain dirctlyover the little inter section which goes right up No. Way, and left to another little rd. My first thought and only logical thought was they are doing some hoot owl loggting. That is starting very early in the morning so as to lesson fire danger. But immediatley it dawned on me that it was early evening and so this made no sense to any of us. As we continued up the mile long inlet to the inter section the light disappeared very quick. We were talking about these lights as we made the right hand turn at tht little gravel intersection and as we rounded the corner art about 25 mph, all of a sudden we realized thatthere was a craft directly over our heads at about 50- 75 ft, right on top of the tree line. I freaked as did my wife. I stopped immediatley and got out as did my wife. My kids were looking through the window at this craft.  It was your classic round with lights all the way aroung it. I remember going whoa!!!!!!, what the!!!. As we watched it made a wooshing sound and lifted slightly and raised away.     I swear to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I asked him what he was talking about and he pointed to an object that was directly over the Louisville, KY, skyline, he proclaimed its a UFO.  I laughed and said it&#39;s an airplane and we watched it as it approached our location on the Jeffersonville<n> <n><n> river bank and it soon was clear that it was&#39;nt an airplane at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became frightened and my cousin just yelled out beam me up scotty in which I replied to him to shut up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was oval shaped with multi colored lights making two rotaions two the left then two rotations to the right, it was completely silent and became more freightened then the craft came down and hovered about 20 ft above the bridge silently with no disturbance to the water below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched in awe and fear as it just hovered for maybe two or three minutes then it slowly acended and once it reached an altitude of about 3000ft it zoomed off into the nite sky and left us paniced and we went home excitedly telling my aunt the story who obviously didnt believe us at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I went home to louisville where I told my older  brother what happened of course he laughed at me and ridiculed me, well later that day we had been watching television when a commercial for the local news came on, the reported Jim Mitchell of WHAS 11 said tonite at 11 a Clarksville, IN man has video of a UFO, my brother looked at me with eyes and mouth agape and I proclaimed&#34; I told you so now do you believe me?  We asked my dad if we could please stay up to watch the news that it was important my dad thought it was odd that we would care about the news program but ok but your going to bed rite after, so my brother and I waited nervously all evening long until the news came on, we watched the whole program and it never mentioned it once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two weeks later at around 830 pm, my dad said we need to go to Kmart to get your little brother some diapers before they close so it was my dad, step mom and two siblings in the front and I sat in the bed of the truck wearing shorts and flip flops and no shirt, my dad who was an alcoholic was drunk and drinking and driving along popular level road blasting three dog nite on the 8 track, about two blocks from the Kmart we stopped a redlight on popular level where I could see the Kmart sign all lit up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed something strange, there was a warm breeze raining (down) on me and I looked at my arms and the hair was standing up on them and my neck so I looked up and there was a massive craft like the one i&#39;d seen two weeks earlier but much larger like a mother ship and I could see intricate piping mostly squared in shape and I nearly broke my neck looking from one end to another it was as large as a football field and I began to feel sick to my stomach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began beating on the sliding glass window of the pickup truck yelling: dad, dad but got no response he was to drunk and the horrible 70&#39;s music had drowned out my screams and I looked up again and it was gone, now surely there was multiple people that saw this thing I mean we were not alone at the stoplight and im sure someone saw me looking upwards<n>

It was between 10:30 and 11:00 PM, and I do not recall what the night sky was like as to clouds or moon.  This stretch of highway is very rural with few farms and homes.  The road is winding and the countryside hilly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that the embankment along the road was getting brighter and thought that it was strange how bright my headlights had become.  I looked up and saw approaching from the east/southeast and to the right in my windshield an UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This UFO appeared about twice the size of a full moon.  The object was spherical with 6 rows of oval or elliptical windows; 3 rows above and 3 rows below an imaginary horizontal center line.  The light glowing from within was a butterscotch yellow color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2 o&#39;clock and 8 o&#39;clock as if on a clock face there were two protrusions that resembled bolts of lightning.  At each bend in the &#39;lightning bolt&#39; there was a blinking white light.  Each light blinked on and off in succession on each side of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down but continued driving and after going about 1/4 mile the UFO had completely dissappeared.  The flight direction was southeast to northwest.  There was no sound emitted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Square in shape with no depth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2/24/05  A Window  Forgive me but this report probably won&#39;t do this siting justice. I don&#39;t normally write things like this, but I happened upon this site and it sounds like a serious place and I&#39;ve kept this inside me for years. this is what I saw....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Westwood California.  In Summer 1983 the Movie &#34;The Terminator&#34; was just beginning to appear in movie theatres. I was going to the midnight showing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Standing on the corner across the street from the theatre my friends had already crossed the street. As I was standing there waiting for the light to change, an older black man quickly approached me and said: &#34;You see it&#34; with his finger pointing just above the lower buildings surrounding the theatre. I didn&#39;t see him initially so he startled me a bit. I looked at him first and noticed that he had a nail hammer in his hand. I thought... WTF is this guy doing with a hammer in his hand at 11pm (that question was never answered after the siting). I took a few steps away and he was still pointing with this strange little grin on his face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For whatever reason I concluded that he was not a threat and took a glance. Following his finger movement against a black sky with stars visible, I began to focus and noticed the stars in the distance disappearing from view and then reappearing in a right to left horizontal movement. As my eyes finally solved the problem I realized that what was screening them out was only about 400 yards in front and maybe 300 feet altitude. As I focused further I noticed this perfectly square shape was moving slowly, silently across the sky. So Black was it that only the stars and some high clouds in the background were the only thing that gave away it&#39;s silouette initially. But it was close, I could see it was solid and fairly large and absolutely square. As it moved away, I followed it like a hawk and noticed that it had no depth to it!??, like a huge piece of paper, or a giant Window, Mirror?? Whatever, it looked like something that was never meant to be seen and my feeling is that it would never have been seen unless there was some malfunction causing it to get out of position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had completely forgotten about the old black dude standing there next to me. When it disappeared behind the buildings, the look we gave to each other was one of confirmation that we both just wittnessed something completely real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So sure of what I saw, I laughed to myself for days, knowing it would be silly to even try to tell anyone about it.  It was so intelligent and indescribable that it would be just pointless and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s just how they want it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))...Los angeles ,CA<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

BELIEVE IT OR NOT, AT 13 I PRAYED TO SEE A UFO AND WITHIN 3-5 MINUTES I HEARD A LOW RUMBLING SOUND FOR 15 SEC. AND THEN SAW A DISC FLOAT BY SILENTLY OUT THE WINDOW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hard to believe still, but I was 13 reading a book on UFO&#39;s and prayed to God to see one for myself.  Within 3-5 minutes I heard a sound out the open window toward the road that sounded like a cross between a semi-truck idling and a tank.  After about 15 seconds and seeing nothing go by on the dirt road the sound stopped as abruptly as it had started.  I then suddenly saw the upper half (the lower half was hidden by bushes between me and the driveway) of a disc-shaped craft silently glide by, it&#39;s surface reflecting in the light from the carport.  I saw no lights as it passed by quickly, but there were no windows at all like there would have been if it were a car, and it was made out of what looked like &#34;brushed aluminum&#34;. I watched to see if it would come back around the bend of the U-shaped driveway, but it didn&#39;t.  It didn&#39;t back up because my eyes were glued (and heart nearly pumping out of my chest) to the driveway from where I was sitting at the dining room table.  It couldn&#39;t go straight because it would&#39;ve crashed into the carport.  It couldn&#39;t have gone left because of the orange grove and the porch.  It DIDN&#39;T go right because I would&#39;ve seen it come around the driveway.  I went out after about 5-15 minutes (I lost track of time then because I was so nervous and was trying to convince myself I was hallucinating... after all, I was wondering why God had answered my prayer so quickly!).  But I just kept saying to myself, &#34;But I know that I know I saw what I saw and I heard what I heard!&#34;. I checked it all out and looked for marks on the ground in the one place that was my &#34;blind spot&#34;; the place after where I saw it pass the window, but BEFORE where it would&#39;ve hit the carport if it had continued to go straight.  Looking around and seeing only trees with their giant branches overhanging the driveway, and porches, and carports, I stood in the &#34;blind spot&#34; and discovered that the only way out from that spot was UP!  A break in the tree branches was just large enough to allow a car-sized (or disc-sized) object to go through.  There were no other options period!  Then I knew it was the real thing. (whew!)<n>

6/1/83 21:30|Phoenix|AZ|Circle|10 minutes+|Monstrous round silent UFO|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42435.html|34|ndxe198306| Monstrous round silent UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never talked about this with anyone but the people who were there because I doubted anyone would believe me.  The thing I remember most about this event was that - for something so stupefyingly amazing - I don&#39;t remember a lot about this event, and none of us talked much about it afterward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened when I was in high school and I don&#39;t know the exact year, but it would have been approx 1982 or 1983.  Four of my friends and I were in the desert north of Phoenix in a very rural area where it was pitch dark except for the stars and the light of our fire.  We had been there long enough to build a camp fire and at the time the sighting occurred we had not consumed more than one beer each.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point we all noticed something looming in the distance, coming very, very slowly towards us.  The only way I can describe its size is monstrous.  It was way bigger than a house, or even a couple of houses.  It was virtually silent for its size - I do remember a sort of low humming sound.  There were definitely lights on it, but I don&#39;t remember how many; I seem to recall that it had lots of little lights on it.  We couldn&#39;t see into it; I don&#39;t remember seeing &#34;windows&#34; in the craft.  It was definitely round in shape, but it is possible that part of it was &#34;cut out&#34; - I don&#39;t remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved directly over top of our group at an extremely slow rate of speed.  I remember feeling a sense of awe, stunned and amazed, but very calm.  We all were.  No one was hopping up and down and going crazy with excitement, like one might think you would in such a weird circumstance.  We just watched it go over.  I &#34;think&#34; I remember seeing it disappear behind a mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, I remember the radio station KUPD had a few people call in and they were talking about a UFO sighting in the same area (approx 7th Street and Union Hills Drive).  But the weirdest thing is, none of my friends who were there, none of us talked about it much.  It might as well have been like we&#39;d seen a kite flying.  No big deal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 years ago I had the chance to talk to one of my friends who was there, who ended up marrying the boyfriend she was with and who was there that night.  I asked her if she remembered it and she said she did.  I asked her to ask her husband if he remembered it, and she did that while we were on the phone, and he said he did.  But again, it was like &#34;no big deal.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw, and I know we all saw the same thing.  I wouldn&#39;t expect anyone to believe it unless they&#39;d seen it for theirself.  I&#39;ve always thought that maybe whatever was inside of it had a way to make our reaction to it numbed or dulled, because aside from seeing it, the most fascinating part of the experience for me has been that we didn&#39;t alert the media or that every time we got together that wasn&#39;t all that we could talk about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fact, we never talked about it except that one time I mentioned above when I asked my friend and her husband if I remembered it correctly - that was probably 8 years after the fact.  I&#39;ve always kind of wondered if we lost time and just didn&#39;t realize it, but I simply don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s all I know.  I wish I could remember more details.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it since, and I had never seen anything like it before, but I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing it again!  I don&#39;t remember if the thing left a trail.  I don&#39;t remember there being an aura or haze around it - it seemed crystal clear.  It was dark brown or black, hard to tell.  It was matte, not shiny.  I can&#39;t remember if the lights on it were blinking at all and I can&#39;t remember if there were colored lights, just remember white lights.  Our vehicles were turned off, so I don&#39;t know if there were electrical or magnetic effects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just watched the Peter Jennings special and that is what inspired me to come to this web site, to see if maybe someone else had seen it and reported it here.  Like I said, I&#39;ve never talked about it to anyone other than the people who were there, for fear of being sent directly to the nuthouse. :)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The sphere was dark and it had thousands of lights going around it,it hover over the city for about 2 minutes, and then it disappear behind a cloud. The next day, everyone was talking about it at school. I became a believer right then.<n>

We drove and cleared the trees and saw what I described as an orange football shaped object, maybe 20 ft across, just hanging in the air above the field, perhaps 100 yards above the field.  There were no other lights or sounds, just there. I should note that Mom described the object as red.  There was a white Vega that had stopped in the road ahead of us and the driver had stopped his car, got out and was standing by his car just looking at it.  I pulled in behind him and did the same, stopping the car and turning our lights out, just looking at the object.  As if someone had turned off a switch, the object disappeared, again no sound or movement.  The guy in the Vega stood there for a minute and came back to my car and asked if I had seen the object, I said yes, he said &#34;good&#34;, then left.  Mom claimed to have heard and seen wind after the object vanished but to be honest I didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were quite a few &#34;sightings&#34; of things we couldn&#39;t explain by family and friends during about a 3 year period during those early 1980&#39;s, then they suddenly stopped and we never saw anything unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a pleasant night and we were looking up while lying down on patio lounge chairs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the clear night sky appeared around 20 or more very intensely bright white stars.  They appeared suddenly, one after the other, some would pop out of existing ones; almost as if someone had turned on a light switch and a light bulb was turned on.  They were all white globes in appearance, closely resembling the brightest stars in the sky, but without the telltale blinking of a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first there simply hovering at what I consider to be the height of a high flying airliner.  After the last one appeared, they organized themselves into a square formation, a very precise flying formation.  Soon after, they started flying very slowly away from our observation post.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They suddenly stopped before they were to disappear from our field of view and started to do what I can only describe as flight maneuvers, such as what the Blue Angels would do; all in a tight formation.  It&#39;s interesting to note that they would suddenly stop and make very quick turns; all in formation.  After about 20 minutes of this, they disappeared in the very same way that they appeared: they suddenly extinguished themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s interesting to note that we had an AM radio playing music at the time, but there seemed to be very heavy interference while these objects were in the sky.  I would also like to note that there was a heavy military operation being conducted in the country, but I would not be able to say if that was in any way related to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not claiming what I saw were UFO&#39;s, but I had never, and have never since, seen anything of that sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

The saucer was sighted south from St. Louis as I was moving toward  Dallas Texas( highway 40 something?).I was driving with my glasses on the dash as I spotted what I thought was an airplane in the upper right hand corner of the window. I looked away thinking it was nothing. Something strange about the object must have registered in my head because I did a double-take to reinvestigate. The object descended until it was no higher than the telephone poles lining the highway and was in plain view from my passenger window and no more than 100 feet away.I stopped the car and rolled down my window to insure there would be no reflections in the glass to impede an objective assesment of what I was seeing. I also slipped on my glasses for a clearer view. The object made no sound whatsoever which was particularly note-worthy as the craft was clearly metallic and what appeared to be quite substantial in weight. This was no ball! oon. The craft moved north while following a perfectly parallel synchronicity with the telephone poles and the ground.It was moving no faster than 15-20 miles per hour so I had a perfectly clear view. Its lack of sound and perfect smoothness and machine-like precision were quite remarkable. I knew, even as I was seeing it, that this was something never seen on the 6 o&#39;clock news. As it kept moving north and became more distant, my memory is unclear as to how it left the scene.It was a good quarter of a mile away when it seemed to just disappear. I have a vague recollection of it ascending in the same fashion as it descended,but that may be only my mind filling in the memory gaps.<n>

The house was at least a 1000 sq. foot two story home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The saucer could be explained as having 3 parts and silver or brushed aluminum in color. The lower base, the center which had circular multi-colored lights that rotated around the ship, and the upper dome. The lower dome had a lens (not sure if it was a light).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After stopping the car in the middle of the street we got out of it yelling. People came outside.

Without loosing momentum the object split into eight equal size objects and traveled in opposite directions at same speed as initial object. Almost as if dividing the sky into slices. Objects to high for me to see a clear shape. At first thought it was a jet because of the stainless steel like sheen (chrome like) but noticed it gave off no sound. At first thought it had exploded but then realized the pieces kept going until disappearing over the horizon. It was a warm day, the sky was clear, no clouds. I was thirteen years old, coming home from school and threw my backpack over the fence to my back yard when I looked up and noticed object.

Then they both went closer to a oval shaped figure. The figure in the air saw my dad and my aunt, so it went away. But my dad and my aunt still will never forget that day. The figure was a silverish brown color, my dad said to me that the figure was 123ft. away from them and 50ft. above the ground, when the figure was backing off, it made a flash and threw right into space.<n>

Some where in mid flight, I was sitting on the right side of the plane when suddenly a small twin engine jet looking craft flew up to me and appeared in between the front of the aircraft and the wing no further than 10 feet away. When this happend every body started staring out of the window. I remember getting up out of my seat and standing in front of the passenger window looking at the craft and seeing beings inside waving at me. No kidding. That&#39;s what really stuck in my memory, then suddenly all I remember was sitting in my seat with the rest of the passengers and getting off the airplane as if nothing ever happend. I must be the only person who remembers this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Source elects to remain anonymous.  One of two reports from same source.  PD))<n>

Usually when us kids want to use the toilet at night our father would get up and follow us to the out house because we were scared. One night i got up and my father as usual accompinied me to the out house.I was approximately ten feet to the door when i saw lights like that from a window traveling  upward and about 25 miles per hour.My father told me to walk faster not knowing that my reason for slowing  down was to stare at a strange  object. I stopped and watched the object. my father did not see it until i asked him what that thing was. He didnt answer, we just watched the object ascended. it was approximately 50 feet high and thirty feet across. what was most amazing is that it didnt make a sound. we watched it ascend until it disappeared. my father told me that it belonged to the CIA and that i should never say anything to anyone. He told me that we would be harm if i spoke about itand i believed.It am unable to dicribe the colour because it was dark.I was about 75 meters from that thing.whats also amazing is that the thing was in the river about 75 meters from my home. ill never forget this. it hurt my heart that i cant talk to anyone about it. because i fear them laughing at me.it feels good to let it go now.I was very close to it. It was so dark i could not see my hands. if it had not been for those bright lights from the windows i would not have seen it. I could care less if anyone believe, it just feels good to say what i wanted to say for over 25 years.<n>

We were driving on a back road near Atlanta International raceway.  I only remember we were sopped in the middle of the road and a very large round craft hovered directly above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were lights flashing and circling the bottom of the craft.  The size of the craft was enormous, as it was right at the tree tops. there werea lot of civilians (men dressed in street clothes) pulled over on the side of the road, getting out of their trucks carrying guns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we started driving out of there we talked to no one.  We were afraid, and somewhat dazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never spoke about what happened that night.  Not even to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just realized, that with the internet, maybe more people came forward about this event and I am curious to know were there any others to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
