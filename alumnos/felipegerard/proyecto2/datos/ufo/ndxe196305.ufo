Try India.|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81075.html|1|ndxe196305| I have witnessed  many bizarre things in my life beginning at age 4.5,  this is not the strangest.  Try India.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After supper on the (approximate evening of 5-30) about 5:20pm when I was 12 yrs old, I went to get the newspaper in the front of our house (facing south).  As I was bent over, I FELT something up and to the right of me.  I then HEARD a faint whoosh as a satin black (not gloss or flat) craft flew over the middle of our field, traveling east to west at about 25 mph, and about 150 ft up.  I was perhaps 150-200 ft away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun had not yet set, so there was ample light.  The rectangular craft was about 6-7 ft tall, 30 ft wide, 50 ft long without colors or markings.  I was able to see good detail - there were no seams anywhere. There were no outside lights or FRONT windows. The front and back of the craft angled out 2-3 degrees at the base (pylon).  There were no sharp corners, the edges were rounded and smooth.  There were 3 round (portholes) windows approximately 2.5 ft in diameter evenly spaced on the side I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instead of racing to get a camera, I stayed to observe.  Feeling scared, I looked into the windows which were emitting a dark yellow (not amber or orange) light from the far interior of the craft.  I saw no people, aliens etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Relieved, I assumed it was military and headed to Fort Riley (Junction City, Ks).  I would just like to know if anyone, anywhere has seen this same craft?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thx<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((initials of witness eliminated))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

5/15/63 22:00|Tishimingo|OK|Changing|3 hours|Many campers saw maneuvering lights for hours in southern Oklahoma.|4/12/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96558.html|2|ndxe196305| Many campers saw maneuvering lights for hours in southern Oklahoma<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a teenager in Boy Scouts, I was doing my OA (Order of the Arrow) &amp;quot;Ordeal&amp;quot; which is an overnight solo camping experience.  You are dropped off in the woods at night with just your pack and sleeping bag.  As I lay looking at the sky, a variable number of different colored orbs appeared in the sky at a relatively high altitude.  For hours, I watched as the objects sped up, slowed down, maneuvered around each other.  The objects exhibited different colors and appeared to change colors.  These were red, green, blue , yellow but I never recall seeing white.  Being alone didnt bother me as they seemed a great distance and rather &amp;quot;playful&amp;quot;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday after the solo campout, all new OA candidates must remain silent until the evening meal.  At that meal, one of the adult participants at my table started talking about the lights he had seen in the sky the night before.  He said he was an air traffic controller at the Ardmore, Oklahoma airport and that it was unlike anything he had ever seen.  This started a conversation that involved many of the overnight campers who had witnessed the same light show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I was 10 years old and my family had moved two blocks away to a larger house.  I was visiting my old neighborhood to play with friends when we noticed a bright object streaking through the sky.  I remember that I was facing North and the object was moving very rapidly from East to West.  It arched slightly to the Southwest and as it did so it glinted in the sun.  To me this looked as if it were made of metal. I was standing with a group of other kids and we yelled to some adults across the street and the man said that it was a shooting star, but even at 10 years of age I didn&#39;t buy that.  It was some kind of craft moving very fast and as best as I can remember it was silent.  I have wondered all of these years if anyone else saw it and whether or not it was reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  We note that orbiting objects, and rockets launched to orbit payloads, do not have a westerly component to their groundtrack.  Hence, the object almost certainly was not re-entering space debris.

No lights, no sound, no movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked, I called my mother in and she also said &#34;what the hell is that?&#34;  I had an 8 mm Kodak Brownie movie camera that I always used and ran for it.  No film.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I watched as this oject as it began to movie slowly, silently and perfectly straigt up about 30 fee and just hang there.  A couple of moments later, it started to move to the right about 30 feet also, stopped a few moments, and then go back to the center line over the house and down to the original position; waited only a few seconds this time and went straight up about 30 feet again and then to the left and slowly, slowly moved above all the 2 story houses on the block where it moved behind the trees and into the sunlight coming fromthe east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must stress that it was perfectly symmetrical and its movements were perfectly aligned with no wobbling, no lights and no sound.  It was absolutely suspended in mid-air.  At first we thought it was some kind of kite, but, boy-oh-boy, it sure wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
