I was told this much later by my parents and of course I have no memory myself about the event.<n>

The year was round 1953.We lived in a town of 300 people in southeast tex. Dad would take me at times with him to hunt.We were in the woods fall or winter  time all the trees were bare leaves  on the ground.The round silver object thing was close to a cloud..If it was under  the cloud  it wouldnt be seen because of the color.It was silver round in shape. My Dad and I watched it for maybe five mins it was not moving.When it moved it went in stair step movements maybe three jerks like moving side ways up 3 long stair steps to the right (westward).Probably took a second to make the step like movements upwards angle with, no sound that we could hear,to disappear. Daddy looked down at me and said &#34;dont ever tell anyone what you saw because they will think your crazy!<n>
