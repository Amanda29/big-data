When it got close, we realized that it was not making any noice and was just above the tree lines. It turned out to be a big ball of blue greenish light. When it go above as, the light got so bright that we can see all the way through the coffee under brush like a day light time. We were transfixed for a moment and then we dove under the coffee for cover. We could still see the ball move on slowly almost like a magical illusion. We dispased and we never talked about it. I did check all the news papers and there was nothing about strange object reported any where. I feel better now I can say it to people who will believe me.
