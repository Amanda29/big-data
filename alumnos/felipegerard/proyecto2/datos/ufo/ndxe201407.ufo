Craft with four white lights.|8/8/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/112/S112116.html|6|ndxe201407| An intensely bright strobing light that appeared, silent, and moved with incredible speed across the sky changing position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of July 31st,  2014, at approximately 10:30pm, I was driving on route 15 north of Woodside, Delaware, midway between Woodside and Camden, Delaware.  It was a clear starlit night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden I saw an intense strobing light, emerald green/bluish in color.  The frequency of the strobe was once every couple of seconds.  The strangest thing to me about this sighting is that at no point could I see an object, nor was there any sound associated with it.  It was as if there was a haze surrounding the area where the light emanated from  and it was as if the light came from nothing but open air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I initially saw the strobing light, it was directly in front of me.  The distance was difficult to determine but my estimate was possibly less than a half mile and probably less than 1000 feet high.  The flashing light was so bright that I couldn’t  see the object itself, but it traveled at an incredible distance in an instant and changed direction several times.  It was almost as if it was following me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my vehicle to watch the object.  As I sat on the side of the road  the object came back toward my direction and slowly descended below the tree line into the field.  At this point the light stayed lit so it was visible to me as it descended.  Even though the light was visible no object could be seen, just the intense and now steady bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once again the distance was difficult to determine because of darkness but it appeared to be less than a half mile away based on the distance of the trees that I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light ceased to flash after approximately thirty seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my grandson who was at my house at the time of the incident and told him what was happening as it happened and stayed on the phone with him during the entire incident.  Much to my dismay I am not proficient with the use of my cell phone camera and was unable to capture any of this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire incident lasted approximately 5 minutes.  I had to ask myself, “What did I just see?   Did I really see what I was seeing?  What did I see?  How do I tell someone that I just saw something but there was nothing there, just a light coming out of nowhere that moved across the sky at incredible speed.  If I tell anyone of this, they’ll never believe me”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called 911 when I got home just a few minutes later to report it in case anyone else witnessed it.  I also called the Dover AFB air traffic control tower at the air base and left a message about the incident but they never responded or replied to my call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were very few cars on the road in this country area.  The 911 dispatcher whom I spoke with gave me the number to the National UFO Reporting Center.  They instructed me to immediately write the events of the incident down and file a report while it was fresh in my head, which I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.

We had been watching the stars and the sky due to all the jet noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were pointing out airplanes as we saw them, when a large orange glowing light appeared over the mountains toward the coast.  It appeared stationary.  It expanded and contracted a couple times and disappeared after a few seconds (maybe 5 or so).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked to be over in the Coos Bay area from our mountain top view.<n>

These lights were not really high in the sky, nor directly over me, more like in the sky in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my vehicle to look more closely, thinking it may be a meteorite falling from the sky.  However, the orange lights did not blink or fall from the sky.  They were moving through the sky almost horizontally.  They were fairly close together, like military planes in formation, but the lights were bright &amp; much larger, similar to the little red blinking light on an airplane...maybe as much as 5-10x the size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened my window on my vehicle, to ascertain whether I could hear any sound of an engine.  I heard nothing but some traffic from a nearby intersection.  Then I noticed a third identical light following the first two, though the distance between the last two was 3x the distance between the first two lights.  I thought it was strange but after sitting in my vehicle looking up for ~1-2 minutes decided to continue to my destination a 1/4 mile away to see if I could still see them.  I came to a red traffic light intersection where there were street lights.  I stopped at the red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, I thought &#34;Oh shoot, I should try &amp; take a photo with my cell phone&#34;.   The lights were farther away at this point &amp; didn&#39;t appear as large, but I did snap a photo anyway.  However, I thought it probably didn&#39;t turn out due to the glare of traffic &amp; street lights. In addition, the orange non-blinking lights were much farther away by this time, &amp; appeared more the size of the! red blinking lights on an airplane flying high in the sky, though they were still not blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking around to see if anyone in the other cars saw them &amp; when a car coming the opposite way ran the red light, I believed they too might be pulling into the CVS parking lot to stop &amp; look up at the sky.  But they didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled into the parking lot &amp; turned away from the store &amp; got out of my car to try &amp; take another photo.  This time, I saw 4 lights, though the one that had been first in line was so far away, it no longer appeared orange &amp; not as bright as the other &amp; were going northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe more than 4-5 minutes passed from the time I saw the first two orange lights until I took the 2nd &amp; final photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the store to pick up my items &amp; when I came out about 5-8 min later, I saw nothing in sky but a sliver of a moon in the opposite direction.  I returned home  &amp; at this point, I told my husband that I saw strange bright orange lights in the sky, but was really confused as to what they could have been.  This was the first time I looked at the photos I took.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Surprisingly, the photos did not show the orange lights I saw with the naked eye but rather crescent shaped lights.<n>

I am always looking at the stars being an amateur astronomer kind of guy.  It reminded me of Mars but was way too bright.  My house at 1300 Mary Street West was only a couple of blocks away and when driving home I could still see it high up in the east sky.  The object then moved toward the airport right over my head but was still high up. I called my daughter out of the house to come and see this thing. It flew by us to my surprise I was so happy that I had another witness.  It took off without sound from the big dipper area towards Cassiopeia then disappeared. We waited around to see anything else around when maybe 20 minutes later I seen it or another one come right over a tree in front of my house heading directly east.  We were both amazed as it was very close to ground this time and appeared as a red/orangey fireball as my daughter put it.  It then gained altitude quickly and sped off towards Cassiopeia again and disappeared.  Most remarkable it didn&#39;t make any noise and there were no blinking lights like the many aircraft I am used to seeing in my area.  After watching a UFO TV show later I learned of the G force and estimated that the object could have went up to near 20 G&#39;s as it disappeared in a speed not possible for mankind.  I thought it could be a drone later but it was too big. It was slightly rectangular in shape and about the size of the bottom of a helicopter.  The remarkable thing was that it did not make any noise even when it flew by over our heads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a retiree I have never seen anything like it in my life and decided to do this report as it kept bothering me.<n>

There was no sound either. We were not able to make out the shape of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We assumed what we were seeing was a helicopter at first, until we saw it move.  It would suddenly move one direction, then dart the other way without stopping (from left to right without pausing).

It also would suddenly descend and ascend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the movements seemed very erratic, and not at all like any normal flight pattern.

We were drinking a little and just having a good time at his place in west Suffield CT.  When we both stepped outside for whatever reason at the time and saw what appeared to be a great orb of light at first.  It was apparent that this was not an airplane because it was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It just remained still for about 30 sec then suddenly started to jump in random spots in about a .5 mile radius from its original spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as crazy as it sounds I could actually make out the shape of the craft.  Classic old sci-fi movie flying saucer is what it appeared to look like with a system of lights around the circular edge.  What really freaked me out is when I looked even closer and could make out what appeared to be what some call a (touchdown).  But the beam of light coming from the bottom of the craft wasn&#39;t light at all. It blended in with the sky and I could only see the edge of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When suddenly the beam of whatever it was disappeared and the crafts lights flashes starting with one bulb and went around the saucer ending with a single red flash from a bulb.  That red flash was the last I saw from the craft as it quickly disappeared into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what that thing was but I am just curious if me and my friend are the only ones who saw this craft that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  At the time the witness telephoned our Hotline, we questioned whether the call was a serious one.

This was a beautiful sunny day with no clouds in the sky.  I observed sunlight reflecting off of a round-smooth metallic (chrome) ball in the sky.  It appeared to be hovering about 500 feet over Boeing field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object began moving very slowly to the N/W I could see it clearly.  There were no markings on it and appeared to be perfectly smooth and chrome in color.  It’s hard to judge the size because of nothing near it to compare to, but I’m guessing it was about the size of a house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the object move slowly to the N/W it seemed to “fade out” or blend into the sky (I could still see the shape of it).  I continued watching it until it went completely out of view.  I kept looking in the area to hopefully see it again.  The round metallic object reappeared and began to slowly ascend straight up-then it just disappeared!<n>

Some of them would push in closer to the other or move up higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed to my right another whitish blue object that was actually bigger than the other objects to the left and it seemed to be moving upwards in the sky and would dim it&#39;s lights and then become faint then glow really bright. I think that particular light was originally lower in the sky and when i looked at it through my binoculars it seemed to be shaped like a spherical galaxy or what you would call a saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most eerie aspect of these sightings was the last object i saw not far from that one which was a yellow light that was the same size as the blue whitish one and it was also moving across the sky even farther right to the last one.  It was a yellow color but! it flickered red at first as if it had rotating orb like lights on it and i thought i noticed it rotating as i looked at it through my binoculars but it was hard to say for certain from that distance. Upon closer inspection it seemed as though it may have been shaped like a cone or and upside down pyramid of sorts.  The light rays coming from it even bent like it had a very different shape than any average type of aircraft upside down boomerang.  I thought it looked strange.  It seemed to change it&#39;s direction a lot.  It would continue its path to the right yet it would simultaneously be going up but then seem to go towards the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother also saw this as he was with me at the time and we were talking out on the back porch when i pointed it out to him.  One last thing that i noticed while this was happening was a sudden flash of blue light that radiated out like a perfect circle from a very small circular point in the sky and it was in between the objects that were seper! ated by distance. It also happened to be in the middle of clou! ds.  I ca n rule out thunder or lightning because it never followed suit with more flashes or any thunder or rain.  The sky was clear save for a few clouds and the flash was a circular shape and very bright.  I do live close to an airport but i did not hear any sounds whatsoever and they were all sighted very high in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened on Tuesday the 29th of July 2014.<n>

The light began to hover for 2-3 min.  Then began to fade.  Within 30 sec. the light just completely disappeared.  Within a 45 sec. to a min.  The light would reappear in the same spot starting with a white light that would change to a reddish, blueish, green color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light began to move from the north to the west very slow, then the process would start all over.  When the light would move it would look as if it was three different color lights that were very close to each other but the distance would make it look as if it was one light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As time went on the light was moving away from me and east.

I live 30 min. south of Ft. Bragg, N.C.  And this was not any military aircraft.  It was cloudy tonight and the light would reappear in front of the clouds at times so the object was flying below some of the clouds.<n>

The night sky was clear after clouds and storms had passed by the previous 24 hours day.  Also, compared to where we live in NJ the ground light pollution is much less so we actually could see the stars, etc., very well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, my friend mentioned, “What is that thing moving up there?”  A circular object moving very high at a steady speed, in a straight line, in the sky was noticed. It was very very high, more like out of earth’s atmosphere (a lot).  It looked like a very large circular-shaped object passing earth in space.  It was moving from our position from west to east in the direction of Europe/the Atlantic.  From when we saw it first till it disappeared beyond the treetop line it was about 45-60 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very gradually lighting up, but not to a very bright white light, than it went gradually back to dark and alternatively back to light.

Shasta, CA<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2:30 pm.  7/28/14.   I just witnessed an object in the sky in Mt. Shasta, CA.  The location was at Lake Siskiyou camp resort.  I witnessed the object from the beach looking out the window of my cooking truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked like a piece of mercury or metal drop in the sky.  The object was reflective but it wasn’t from lights coming from the object.  It looked like it was reflecting the sun.  The object looked out of place which caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at the object for about 15 seconds.  It didn’t move like an aero plane or helicopter. It moved like a mouse on a computer screen but in a perfect straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was losing sight of the object from the window, where I&#39;m at the sky is wide open.  At is a partly cloudy day, but there were no clouds in the path of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran outside to try and track the object.  When I ran around the corner to look in the direction of Mt. Shasta where it looked like the path in the sky that the object was traveling it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the speed that the object was traveling I still should have been able to see it in the sky if it was a plane or helicopter. It was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no noise.  It just looked out of place like it wasn’t flying in the sky but almost like it was a fly on a TV screen, part of the view you’re looking at but not in the screen?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around at all of the people on the beach, but it didn’t look like anyone was looking up at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my 4th object I’ve seen in this area that I would say is a UFO.  First one I’ve seen in the day.<n>

UDA<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx. 8:15am PDT, I was sitting on the front porch having a smoke, and I looked toward the Olympic mountain chain to the west.  I quickly spotted a slow-moving object, colored dark grey, and shaped like an old V2 rocket but upside-down.  That is, the pointed &#34;nose&#34; was facing down and the &#34;tail fins&#34; were pointed skyward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object slowly moved from my left to my right (NW or NNW).  Distance appeared to be at least five miles and the object&#39;s airspeed appeared to be 150 to 200mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it, its azimuth was approx. 9°, and it appeared to slowly descend as my view of it became obstructed by a small stand of trees approx. 200&#39; away; it never reappeared on the other side of the trees (probably because its rate of descent would have placed it near ground level and I do not have an unobstructed view of the ground from where I was positioned).<n> <n><n> <n><n> No lights or exhaust plume were visible, and no sounds were audible (even taking into account the many seconds of delay there would have been between the object&#39;s first appearance and its subsequent disappearance).<n>

The bridge is illuminated with blue spotlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon looking at the top of the southern part of the bridge I observed 3 blue in color triangle objects above the bridge.  I could not judge how far above the bridge they were.  Upon viewing them further they began to move south.  I thought they were the lanterns people launch but the wind was blowing at about 15-20 mph from the SW so this could not be lanterns because they appeared to move effortlessly south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three objects then began to dance around by criss crossing each other than going higher into the sky.

After receiving a call from a co-worker, I stepped out to my backyard to observe the skies south east of my home in Oak Grove, Oregon.  The following account documents my observations over the next 2 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within minutes, I spotted over a half dozen stationary objects in what appeared to be a &#34;V&#34; type formation, in symmetrical and near perfect alignment.  Using my binoculars and a tripod to steady my view, I concluded these things were motionless, and displayed in common, a distinct array of multi-colored flickering lights, green, red and yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within the first 20 minutes 2 additional objects appeared from the south taking positions flanking the formations southeast wing.  These two objects appeared more distant than the others and  not as bright, still displaying colored lights and assuming symmetrical positions in reference to the other objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Separate from the formation was an object with the same features including the colored lights in a stationary position.  This object was positioned more north from the other objects and shined brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my observation of this activity, I was drawn to observe an entirely different type of object which appeared much closer to my home and much larger as it moved from dead south in a northwesterly direction.  Its elevation was extremely low, and it was traveling at a low rate of speed very similar to the way the Goodyear blimp might travel.  Because of its low proximity to the ground I was only able to observe it briefly, as it passed by the trees across from my home, obstructing my view.  I would describe its shape to be similar to that of the bottom of a pie pan.  The entire shape was lit up as if its exterior was amplifying a bright light from within.  I made no further observations of this object for the remainder of the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 11:30 p.m., I made the most astounding observation.  Appearing from the south directly headed over my home and my neighbors I saw two lights approaching my location in a direct south to north flight path.  As it approached I was able to get a clear view as it passed directly overhead. Its frame was shaped like a &#34;V&#34; bearing one large, dimly lit, milky white  spherical light, toward the outer most portion of each wing.  These lights were not projecting any light they were more or less just a steady glow, with no fluctuating characteristics.  I can only guess that this craft was flying at an altitude near 3000 to 5000 feet.  I could make out its shape as it displaced the background of the sky above me.  As for its size, it appeared larger than anything I&#39;ve ever seen, military or otherwise.  What also seems very strange is that as this craft moved in a slow steady northward direction, it made absolutely no sound.  No sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curious about the previous nights observations, I decided to observe the skies again the following night at 9:30 p.m., making similar observations with the stationary lights &#34;V&#34; type formation.  This time there weren&#39;t as many.  I counted five, one in the center, flanked by two on either side set apart by identical distance, each bearing the same colored light signatures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As with the night before, there was one singular object shining brightly above my house, slightly westward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up at 4 am and stepped out to see if the lights were still there, only to find they were nowhere to be found.<n>

I have seen many military craft go in and out of the arsenal over the 20 years that we have lived here but I have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I and a friend were out for our usual morning walk when suddenly my friend grabbed me and told me to look up into the sky.  Just above the tree line there was a huge, and very bright, ball of white light that glided quickly across the sky in the direction of the arsenal.  It was so bright that it was disturbing to me and I grabbed her in fear and shouted, &#34;What the heck is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> She explained that it caught her attention because it was so bright against the still dark sky and she first observed it as a ball of light which quickly changed into a triangle and then quickly changed back into a ball of light again.  She said it reminded her of a holographic image the way it changed from one shape to another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved too fast to be an air craft and we wondered if it could have been a meteor although I have never seen a meteor that low to the tree line and that large.  It frightened me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also no sound at all associated with this light.  It passed right above us and then completely disappeared, like a light bulb turning off, within about 5 or 6 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live so close to the arsenal that when military craft fly in or out the sound is so loud that our home vibrates.  We have been outside many times at night when planes have flown in and out and never have we witnessed anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was so out of the ordinary it was frightening to both of us.<n>

When we first went outside, we were shocked to see a shooting start only for it to be closely followed by flashing lights that we thought were an airplane. We got a strange feeling and went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back outside with our third friend, only to start seeing white lights resembling satellites that would fade in and out and move much slower than regular satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of us then noticed that what we thought to be a plane at first until it moved over us.  It had one red light on front and three white lights.  It was in the shape of a diamond and after passing over us it looked as if one of the white lights on the end was above the two lower white lights.  It was flying low enough that if it was a plane we could have heard it, but the object did not make a sound at all.  We watched the object until it disappeared behind a tree.  We sat staring at the sky to see if we could see anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 minutes later we all noticed the shape again. It was just as low and came in from the same direction and exited in the same direction.  It wasn&#39;t a plane.  It moved too silently and too slowly.  I&#39;ve never witnessed anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we saw the second craft we all began to feel very weighted down.  It was as if our legs were held to the ground.  This feeling lasted for a half hour only to start fading when the sun came up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the craziest thing.<n>

I was looking east, just noticing the complete quiet and stillness of the night.  I was out there for 3 or 4 minutes, when suddenly a huge, round, extremely bright fireball seemed to just drop straight down out of the sky from no where!  It seemed as if it was coming directly towards me, as it was getting bigger and brighter.  It was going faster than any airplane I have ever seen, but not as fast as a shooting star.  Its movement seemed very deliberate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 45 or so seconds, it seemed to stop for a moment, and then go in the opposite direction.  I briefly thought it disappeared, it seemed to turn white for a moment, then bright red again while continuing in the second direction away from me.  About 15-20 seconds later, it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just stood there in complete amazement for the next 5 minutes!  About 5 hours earlier, I witnessed with my next door neighbor, a series! of bright, white, round objects, (15 or so), traveling in some sort of pattern, from west to east.  I wrote out one of these reports earlier about that incident!  My friend was joking earlier saying &#34;are we being invaded&#39;?  I laughed!  Now maybe it isn&#39;t so funny!  What are we seeing?<n>

It was my first time driving this route.  At one point I found myself looking way up above me whilst on a narrow road surrounded by trees on both sides of me.  There were these blue lights gliding across the sky.  I was unable to stop because there was another car behind me.  It appeared that the lights came from a hovering craft that spun - causing the lights to look like they were blinking.  It was such a spectacular blue.  A glowing blue.  Because I could not take my eyes off the road just to completely stare at it..  from a distance when I looked up next it had disappeared curving west and into the lefthand side of the trees.<n>

If I wasn&#39;t looking up at the traffic light I would have missed this.  It was lit up and moving low and fast.  Maybe 200-300 ft up (or less) and at a slight angle downward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was a helicopter at first, but by the time my brain told me so this thing was gone out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I might have imagined it until I got the the stop light line and another car with two people inside it were rolling down their window, pale and looking a bit freaked out, asking &#34;did you SEE that?&#34;.<n>

Coordinated with separate occurrence also visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving home my friend and I noticed a bright orange light entering the horizon from our right.  We immediately asked each other what it was noticing it was moving very slow, wasn&#39;t blinking and seemed to burn orange with no tail or sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light drifted a visual distance of a foot to a foot and a half before it appeared to drift in our direction.  We would later comment that it seemed to notice our headlights and swerved in to investigate.  I put my car in park as the second light entered from the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second light passed with seemingly more resolve.  It was larger and passed by much the same way. The first light had seemed to pick its spot in the sky to diminish in brightness.  Light number two seemed to decide on turning in our direction more aggressively at this point I felt nervous and turned off my headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon turning off my headlights, the second light went the same as the first.  This one persisted as the third enter from the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My co-witness captured crude photos on his cell phone as well as a short video capturing their pass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third light, more consistent in brightness did not seem to notice us as it passed by and went the way of the previous two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were bright and clearly different from the other celestial bodies.  I compared it to my wife later as a fireball who&#39;s light reflected off a thin mist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we returned home upon completing a short scan for any other such objects we noticed a second &#39;patch&#39; of three similarly moving, similarly colored objects moving on the horizon.  The second patch was too far to see with the same profound detail however the similar behavior led us to a relative conclusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason for the + followed by the question mark is that along with the obviously unique sightings mentioned earlier, a huge number of &#39;stars&#39; were acting very odd.  More like a junebug around a streetlight then a star.  Wiggling and pulling from side to side.  These &#39;wigglers&#39; can be found nearly every night however the six fireballs are things we have never seen before and defy our ability to explain.<n>

That was when we were certain that these were four different objects, because the upper light of the second set sped up as if it was attempting to keep up with the first set, and the lower light remained traveling at the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about eight to nine minutes of activity, the first two lights quickly disappeared, with the third light doing the same shortly after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, the fourth light was out of sight as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time was there any noise coming from the lights, and they kept the same height constantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to record the action, but was not able to get the video since the street lights were much brighter; yet, the audio gives our reaction to the sightings.<n>

The outside shape of the object could not be made out due to the dark night sky. The light seemed to have something moveing inside of it to the left side of the light.  A huge red light came on just left of center inside of the cf the craft. I was amazed to say the least, so was my friends. The light stayed on for several minutes then just went out.  There was several red lights on the object that weren&#39;t extremely bright like an aircraft would have and had only red lights no other colors. The object moved off to the left, our viewpoint was going to be blocked by a mountain so we ran towards it to get a longer look at the object. It was at that time we thought we may have saw more than one but with our excitement and hearts pounding it was hard to tell if it was just my nerves or shakeing causeing me to think stars were moveing. At that time the object moved overhead of us and appeared low in altitude.  It had several red lights and two on the rear were blinking.  It made no sound and for an object to be so low I didn&#39;t understand what was propelling it?  This experience has rarely left my mind since it occurred, hardly a day goes by without me thinking of it at least once.<n>

I looked north towards my neighbor&#39;s house and noticed bright orange-rust colored lights, possibly over Corona, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wear glasses to correct my vision so I took off my glasses to make sure it wasn&#39;t an optical illusion on my lenses.  The lights were still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put my glasses back on and watched as 3 orange lights danced around what looked like a commercial airliner.  I could tell it was an airliner because of the red and white strobe lights and the slow movement of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They looked almost like they were dog-fighting with the airliner.  They were pulling some weird maneuvers around this airliner--for instance, going very very fast and then suddenly stopping near the airliner, then moving very fast past the airliner, then stopping suddenly again and repeating the process.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The airliner looked like it made some course corrections, as if it was affected by the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then one of the rust-colored lights became more dim, and then dissipated, like it just dissolved into nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2 remaining lights danced around as the airliner kept its original course heading approximately south-south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few more seconds of making very quick, very minute course corrections now behind the airliner, they too both dissipated into nothingness one after another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around my suburban neighborhood and noticed nobody was outside and nobody else saw this amazing dance in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then lit my cigarette and watched the sky waiting for more but saw only stars and more planes, but they were south of my location and weren&#39;t displaying any weird movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and described my experience to my wife whom I abruptly woke up.<n>

My wife and I were sitting outside when a light drew my attention to the northeast, facing two trees on my property and the beginning of our neighbor&#39;s backyard.  First instinctual thought was that a plane was about to pass, but we had not, as of yet, heard any indactive sounds.  As the light began to clear the obstruction of the trees, details became visible and our full attention was drawn to the object, which continued on in a southwestern direction without making any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a red spherical object filled with a central rectangular section of what appeared to be orange fire.  The object was either relatively large or relatively low in altitude, and was bright enough to have drawn our attention before actually becomming visible.  The object roughly appeared to be the size of a full moon in the sky.  We continued observing it with an unobstructed view as it passed almost directly over our property before beginning to take a turn more distinctly toward the west-northwest which began to put it over the large wooded area our property borders.  The object was not fast moving but eventually disappeared beyond the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been watching the sky my entire life; I&#39;ve always been intrigued by the night sky and all the various wonders that appear once the sun sets.  I&#39;ve been using telescopes since I was a child, and I&#39;ve never seen anything in the sky that I couldn&#39;t identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The possibility of this object being a chinese lantern briefly entered my mind and was dismissed in as short a timespan as the next blink of my eyes.  The object commanded your attention in a way that would have been unlikely for a Chinese lantern.<n>

At first I thought it might be an airplane but whe|8/1/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/111/S111923.html|157|ndxe201407| Strange orange light lbject flying overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday, July 25, 2014, at 1020 pm local time (Central time zone), in Minnesota,  I was walking home with my digital camera.  I was shooting wildlife pictures earlier when there was light, but when it got to dark, I just put the lens cap on and turn off the camera.  I then went for a 4 mile walk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a block from my house, I looked up in the pitch black sky and saw a strange orange light – sort of like an “orange moon” color when the moon is low on the horizon.  This was just a very small sliver of orange light, so I was thinking it must be a slice of the moon low on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched this light, it was approaching me, and now it looked like an object that was on fire flying though the air.  I was thinking this was an airplane on fire and would be falling to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This orange light was bright, it looked like a campfire type of orange – like it was on fire.  I suddenly realized I had my camera with me and by the time I got the lens cap off, camera, turn on the object was directly overhead.  I had the camera in full auto mode, so my first shots the flash was on and the auto-focus could not operate properly due to low light – the shutter stayed open because it was expecting the flash to expose the object – so the first shots were just light moving while shutter open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly switched modes on the camera.  The object appeared to about 2,000 feet high about the level that helicopter fly at, but it could have just appeared to low elevation due the brightness of the light.  This object made no sound – it was completely silent. I snapped off several photos of this object as it was now moving away from me.  Its speed appeared to be that of a rescue helicopters (flight for life) that often fly over during the night – my guess about 200 to 300 mph.  It was out of range in about 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I snapped off 17 photos, but all you can see is the orange light in a pitch black sky.  These are 18 mega pixel photos so they can be blow ! up to view better.  However, the actual object size, shape, etc. cannot be determined – I am assuming that this orange light was some sort of engine or propulsion system.  It was traveling Northeast about 90% north and 10% east coming from the Southwest in a straight line.  There was nothing fancy – no sudden movements or exotic speeds – straight line flight about 300 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years ago, I was in the Air Force and stationed at Nellis AFB in Las Vegas.  The “Top Gun” school for the Air Force is station their and it is called Red Flag.  When Red Flag is going you can watch all sorts of aircraft taking off and flying at night.  I know what afterburners look like and what jet engines look like.  I also know what aircraft landing lights look like as well as the other light on the planes wings.  Stealth aircraft do not have engine exhaust that is visible from the ground.  The orange light did not look like anything I had ever seen before.  I have no idea what it was – might be a perfectly simple explanation, but for now that flying object is unidentified.<n>

My mother has never seen a UFO in her life.  She asked my father what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparently, he hesitated when he saw it, then proceeded to run back into the house yelling for me.  I thought there was a medical emergency because he has never yelled like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He ran up the stairs and ran to the room across from mine.  We both looked out the eastern window and I was in shock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the distance was what looked like a rotating disc with lights around the circumference.  It was moving fairly quickly, maybe 100 feet per second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole object was lit up and was clearly visible since it was the brightest object in the sky.  All it did was move south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a suburb and the object appeared to be above the local golf course.  From my location, I estimated that it was about half a mile away because the object was briefly obscured by the trees on a hill on the golf course.  I can&#39;t imagine it being any farther than that because that would mean the object would have to be unimaginably huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never believed in any UFO sightings because I always thought people photoshopped images just to gain popularity and scare people.

I am an avid star gazer and to my astonishment there was an inordinately bright set of flashing lights in an area of the night sky where no star or planet should be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This in itself may not seem that strange as aircraft fly over this area very frequently, however this did not act like any aircraft I have ever seen.  For starters the object was silent and remained in the same place while a series of multi-colored lights flashed it what appeared to be a pattern.  The lights themselves would flash off and on in a series of revolutions around a singular red beam, the white lights would flash in a circular motion around the constant red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object just remained in place until about 1:20am, it was at that time another object, most likely a plane judging by its sound and speed had moved relatively close to the object in question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was here when things got even crazier. The object projected a huge orb of light around it and it flashed as bright as the sun and vanished.  The other object flying towards it made a quick turn to the south and continued flying a normal course as if it were heading towards Dullus International.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will continue to search that area of sky again tonight to see if the object returns, but the shear speed at which the object darted off last night made it clear to me this object was not something one normally sees when gazing up in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other thing I would like to add was that it was a perfectly clear night and thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me I went and got my glasses and an HD set of binoculars and can easily draw and explain what exactly it was that I saw in the western sky outside of Sykesville, MD, last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time in this matter and I look forward to further correspondence.<n>

We all turned to look and noticed the lights slowly moving toward us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, we saw a search light emit from the overhead light source and it appeared to be sweeping down on the tree tops.  As the two lights got closer we could see they were actually 4 bright lights and a central less dim light blinking on and off.  At this point we could make out a dark shadowy shape connecting the outer four lights, two on either end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft was making no audible noise (a windless night) and approaching almost in our path heading south east.  I estimate the craft to be at about 1500 feet above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was almost directly overhead, we could make out a faint  constant engine noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cloudless night and the dark craft appeared to have no standard aircraft body, but appe! ar to be sort of winged shaped.  I estimate the length from one to end to the other be about 200-300 feet.  Its speed was similar to the speed and approach of an airline jet approaching an airport, however there is no close airports.  There were no red or green navigation lights visible.  The craft continued on its straight path until leaving our view over a nearby mountain.<n>

After studying the night sky in between sightings I made some observations.  We live in a high traffic area for planes.  This was not a plane, nor a helicopter.  It made no sound.  Plane traffic had stopped in the area.  They normally circle above us at varying heights.  It was like nothing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noted that two helicopters were moving around the area within 10 minutes of the second object, about 5 minutes before the third object appeared.

However, unlike a normal plane, it was much lower to the ground, had a darker paint job, was very thin, flew very very slowly, and had lights in a triangle formation on the bottom of it.  It made no noise and left no trail in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I saw the craft, I pointed out to my mother that it was much different than a normal airplane.  She suggested that we turn around and take a closer look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove down the road maybe 100 feet before making a U-Turn.  When we returned to the spot where we had seen the craft, the return was less than a minute, we saw no sign of the craft.  It was there one minute and gone the next.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We even drove further down the road in hopes of seeing it again or maybe even a sign that it was still there.  However there was no sign of the craft we had seen.<n>

I walked out a bar and to a car. When I sat in the car, I noticed something was gliding in the air.  I assumed it was a plane, so I didn&#39;t stare at it too long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 or 10 minutes went by, and then I saw my friends coming out from the bar and in front of the car I was in.  I looked up, and the craft was still up in the air, just sitting there.  It wasn&#39;t moving at all, and at that moment I realized what its shape was and how close it was.  No noises came from it, even though it was fairly large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of the car, and walked to where my friends were.  I still didn&#39;t hear anything.  It was flashing these bright lights, mostly red.  It was in a big long strip around the hemisphere of the craft, and it seemed like it was a lot of smaller lights making it look like a red strip. Inside the red strip were little bright red dots, so I assume that means those were individual lights.  Sometimes it flashed green on one side, and sometimes blue on the other side.  The red was almost always on.  I think i might have seen another color, but all I can remember is red, green, and blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft flashed the lights in weird patterns, sometimes it was just still, sometimes the lights flashed.  It was dark out, so they were very bright and intense.  It was hard to see what color the craft was, because of the light, but I think it was metallic.  I know for sure it was shaped like a UFO.  It was a flying saucer, more round than flat.  We were quite close to this craft too, close enough to get a good look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends and I watched this craft move and glide around in the air, taking sharp turns in weird directions.  It would stop, then lower itself straight down in a perfect fast motion, then stop.  Then it would rise up, perfectly straight, and stop mid-air.  It went even higher and higher, in the same vertical way, and then it stopped and lowered itself again. Then it would start flying around back and forth, like it was watching something.  It did this for q! uite a w hile, moving around then going up and down fast then slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt like I could see something around it, but I&#39;m not sure what that was.  I might have been seeing something as a result of those lights, but it seemed like the craft was inside of something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the craft left, it just lowered itself down below the treeline, and never came back up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited in the car for about 25 minutes, but it did not come back.<n>

The whole thing lasted only a second.  As it was going from left to right in my field of vision, about ¾ of the way across, the light from the street light (that was down and to the right) reflected off of it and it was like a camera flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it flashed, I got a tiny glimpse of the object, before it disappeared into the darkness. It appeared to be a round black ball and had a shine to the surface that caused the reflection.  I immediately asked my wife, “Did you just see that?”  She responded that she saw &#39;something&#39; fly by and then the flash from the reflection off the street light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a plane, bird, helicopter nor an alien UFO.  I believe it is the same object as seen on KDVR and CNN news reports from back in March of 2014 and November 2013 that was recorded twice from 84th &amp; Federal.<n>

Having left my vehicle, I proceeded to walk on down the path that goes through a large wood, which after quite a way splits off into bridleway&#39;s signposted left and right/straight ahead or back the way I had came (I have walked this path many,many times over the years and have alway&#39;s felt there is some-one else there the whole time watching me(though of course there never is any-one there at all.......)walking through particular spot&#39;s along the path always make me feel particularly uncomfortable but the whole path is itself Incredibly un-nerving,errie  And Very Creepy(this as I said at the beginning is to do with it&#39;s long history and certain reputation and you can guess the rest and the reasons why......)! anyway upon reaching the junction I decided to walk straight ahead which takes you up hill and around a blind sharp bend which is scarey in itself (particularly at night) as you cannot see what is around the corner until you walk round it.  But having walked up hill and around the corner and stood for a while rather than walk on up to the top (which I usually do)but on this occasion I decided not to because I felt particularly scared and as I was making my way back down the hill it was at this point that I saw a very bright and Quite large white light at a very low altitude streak down at an angle from the sky(to my left)very close to where I was walking as I say I saw it fall from the sky but because I did&#39;nt see it land on the ground (as somekind of craft would do)nor know the exact location of where it landed other than it being very close to where I was walking (if it did indeed land) then I don&#39;t know weather it was just a Shooting star or something else entierly.<n>

I was backing my pickup truck up the drive way and while backing up, I could hear a helicopter get louder as if it was approaching my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I parked the truck and glanced at the clock on the dash noticed it was 9:20 pm.  I stepped out of the pickup and turned to see why the helicopter was so close or low flying.  It was coming from the northwest proceeding to the southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my astonishment, two large pewter gray colored craft where flying in front of the helicopter in a tight formation, one staggered to the left rear of the front pewter craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were approximately 60 to 70 feet across in diameter, about 10 to 12 foot thick in the centers, the outer edges of the craft were similar to the edge of a coin like a nickel, smooth with no markings.  I would estimate the sides would be about 2 to 3 foot on the vertical measurement.  The craft made no noise whatsoever, had no markings, no windows of any type, no lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two craft were in very tight formation.  The helicopter was all black, had no markings on the fuselage but was an Apache Helicopter.  This I know for sure, being that I am a USAF veteran and have worked on a flight line with military aircraft in my past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The helicopter was about 200 yards behind the two craft, following the two objects but not trying to gain speed or overtake the objects, almost as it was tagging the objects.  The two objects remained very close to one another, about 20 to 30 yards apart, one behind the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation including the helicopter flew about 200 feet off the ground, very close to the tree line, the two disk flew in a straight line and maintained the tight formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire clear viewing window that I had was about 20 seconds, before the formation flew behind the tree line that is behind my house.  I had a clear view of the objects from the start to finish.  The light in the sky was good being that it was in the city and over a strongly lit neighborhood.  I was about 130 yards away from the flight path of the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right before the helicopter went behind the tree line my wife was coming out of the house and commented to me, “What in the world is all the noise from?&#34;  Before I could answer her, the helicopter along with the craft went behind the tree line behind the house and proceeded in a direction that took the formation away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best description I can give of the craft was that if you were to hold a 3 inch sugar cookie at arm’s length at about 30 degrees up and tilt it slightly that would give a good reference to the size and how I was able to see the bottom and shape, I was able to observe the craft for the full period of viewing, the disk shaped craft made no noise, very smooth, no lights, no markings, no appendages, just very smooth, pewter gray in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came in and made a detailed drawing of the craft and event to make sure I remembered every detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being ex-military and having worked with aircraft, I know what I saw was a real event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we were impressed with how eloquent and seemingly serious-minded he is.

He does this so I can put the dogs up in the house and open the gate in the driveway so he can back in with his pickup truck.  It only takes about 5 to 10 minutes for the drive home from the school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I had gone outside and opened the gate, I went back inside the house to wait for my husband to drive in.  It was just a few minutes, maybe 5 minutes or so, when I started to hear a noise outside.  The noise continued to increase to the point that it was loud and had me concerned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew it was the sound of a helicopter and I thought it must be flying very low over the house so I went out to see why the noise had gotten so loud.  By this point it sounded like it was right over the back of the yard at our house and I was very concerned of what was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out the back door and started walking out under our carport to investigate the noise.  I saw my husband had already backed up the driveway in his truck and was standing by the driver side rear wheels staring over the back of the property pointing and saying something out loud to me.  I could not hear what he was saying because of the noise of the helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked rather quickly out from under the carport to see what he was pointing at and I saw a black helicopter go behind the tree line very close to the top of the trees behind our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband seemed to be in shock at what he saw and kept asking me if I saw the other objects.  I did not, being that I was walking from the backdoor through the carport which is covered and it took a bit to walk from the back door out into our driveway where I could get a good view.  I did manage to see the helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband came inside with me visibly upset by something he had seen and began explaining it to me and drawing down his sighting.  I know my husband well enough to know that if he saw something like this he would not say so without it being a real event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what I witnessed that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you any questions my cell number is<n> <n><n> 225-((number deleted))<n> <n><n> Thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> Baton Rouge, La.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

I was heading South on highway 2 between Edmonton and Calgary, near Olds, when I noticed a bright light out my drivers side window, East, very close to 1:25 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It travelled North to South.  It was the shape of a kidney bean or unshelled peanut.  I thought it was a meteor or something hitting the outer atmosphere, but is was too big for that, too close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It streaked across the sky for a short distance, maybe about a 1/5 of the total width of the sky.  It then just stopped and disappeared in a kind of glow.  My impression is that it skipped off the atmosphere and headed back out to space.  It was too big, too close though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it streaked through the sky it did not leave a trail like a comet does.  A very little bit of spark kind of stuff, mostly glow.  It glowed green, blue, red, mostly brilliant orange.  It only lasted about 25 seconds, at the most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The company I work for has 4 trucks.  One of the other drivers was at Olds at the same time, but he didn’t see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But talking to one of the other drivers, he did notice a flash in the sky, but did not see it.  He was near Suffield, Ab., close to the Sk. Border, and attributed it to something from the military base at Suffield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after that, our 4th driver texted him ‘did you see that?’  What he saw and where he was, I don’t know yet.  But I suspect he was between Calgary and Medicine Hat.  That was the route for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it was a meteorite or whatever its called.  It is very curious though how big it seemed and so close.  But it wasn’t.  The other driver’s were quite East and saw it to the East also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time and website for reporting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dennis<n>

Sometime after midnight we pulled off the highway and drove south into the town of Maidstone to get some rest.  We were facing south at the corner of Railway Ave. and Third St. W, when we saw the object above a field southwest of the intersection, not that far from us.  I saw what looked like a shooting star, a white streak across the sky.  It suddenly stopped and just hung in the air.  It was a long oval that seamed to divide into two parts, rainbow coloured with an Ammolite type shimmer and a bright white light at one end.  The object hung in the air for some time, long enough for my husband and I to ask each other if we saw what we were seeing.  It suddenly divided and disappeared.  There was no sound from this object at any time it was silent. I have no idea what it was at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Husbands account of the same sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at the intersection facing south when the object came into view.  It was about 300 meters away and it filled up half the windshield.  The object looked like it was made of a cluster of tubes, green with 2 or 3 red lights at the end.  At one end there was a bright white and yellow glow almost like a mist.  The colours on it we the brightest and most vivid I have ever seen.  I don&#39;t know how long it stayed still, 30 or 40 seconds.  It was silent the whole time, I had my window down and there was no noise.  In a split second it shot away from us and was gone.  It looked like it was operated by and intelligent presence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a helicopter or plane nor was it fireworks or a para flair.  Both of us spent more than 10 years in the Canadian military and we are familiar with these things.  This was nothing like we have ever seen before.  During and after the sighting we were interested, calm and not frightened<n>

Best guess is it was about 20 degrees over the tree line.  I first thought it was a star, but soon figured it to be too large.  Then I thought an airplane or helicopter, but still would have been too large for those kinds of lights.  It also appeared to be moving in a left-right-left pattern over a short distance, relative to the object.  If you google Belleview street, Worcester, MA, the little green arrow that pinpoints the road on the map is precisely where I was positioned at the first sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached the intersection of Belleview and Chandler Streets, I spotted certainly three, and possibly four more orange lights sitting dead south in the sky, not apparently moving.  One was slightly lower than the first one I spotted, perhaps at 15 degrees over the tree line.  The other two I am certain of were considerably higher in the sky, one at 75-80 degrees and shading toward the southeast, the other at about 45 degrees, directly below the highest one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other unusual objects near these, and they did not show any distinct pattern or shine light on anything near to them.  My car window was down, and I heard no sounds to possibly indicate their proximity to my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was near my home, so I gathered my head, and sped to grab a good camera.  By the time I got back, about ten minutes later, there was no sign of these objects in any direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One side observation:  on my arrival to my driveway before getting my camera, I looked to the sky to see if they could be seen from my house, but in the general direction of where I saw them, all I could see was a vague pinkish glow behind the shadowed profile of trees and other houses.  Couldn’t see any stars in any direction, so I thought it might be clouds obscuring the night sky.  When I returned home, disappointed and without pictures of anything, at about 12:30 am the glow behind the silhouetted houses and trees was gone, and there were a good many visible stars in every direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope someone else reports this so I know I am not nuts.<n>

The last one that appeared was bright red, then changed to orange.  About that time, we  saw an aircraft coming from North to South.  It was probably at about 35,000 feet.  It looked quite distant relative to the strange lights.  After that I did a little research online, and saw similar accounts of the same type of lights.  I would not make something like this up.

I thought not much of it until I saw 7 or more of them.  Still not alarmed I just thought wow that is quite a few of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with my kids and talking on the phone so i kept driving.  Then, after looking back up the lights had become small orange/yellowish contained orb like objects and had organized themselves into a near arch looking patten but not perfect symmetry.  There were lined up directly with the highway.  I was swearing into the phone(which I DON&#39;T DO) Because I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing. People on the highway were all honking their horns so i know others were seeing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As is approached me I eventually was under and going past it.  As they were close to me, I would describe the orange/yellowish objects almost as if they were perfect self contained fireballs.  I looked to the left as I passed and there was an object, very very dark black following just behind to the left.  I can&#39;t tell you how eerie it is to see something appear that black against an already night sky.  It was strange to say the least.  I tried in every way to rationalize it I could not.  I pulled over off the exit and got out of my car to look up and process what I just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We DO live very close to the military base.  I have lived here my whole life and I can say to you not one person familiar with military craft would be able to identify these things.  The defied any shape and color of anything I have seen.  The black object was the most obviously deep black object you have ever seen and odd/scary to see.<n>

It just seemed to hover over that spot and was about 200-300 yards up from the ground, which would&#39;ve made it a very low-flying plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No noise, no exhaust could be seen or heard.

We first thought they were some type of military exercise since they started out flying in formation side by side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We first counted 3 distinct lights that were a Yellow/white in color moving in formation in a southwestern direction.  Three of them moved into a triangle formation.  Next to the triangle at this time 7 more lights appeared in groups of twos and threes and created a formation of 7 side by side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the foreground, a plane flew by in front of these lights with a distinct flashing red light. You could distinctly tell these lights were not planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights one by one began move upward and seemed to disappear one at a time, like when a plane flies into a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I observed the lights for about twenty minutes before they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The perspective of how big or far away they were was difficult to judge because it was dark and beginning to get cloudy.

I had some work to do late, and had just finished when I decided I would go outside and see how the weather looked.  There were low, broken clouds, moon partially obscured by the clouds. Clam winds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what I thought was a life flight helicopter flying just above the tree line, but I noticed that the lights were solid red, no green, so as I continued to watch it, the light stopped.  It made a quick vertical circle, stopped again, and then started to flicker, then changed from bright red to bright blue, and continued to flicker at a high rate of speed.  There appeared to be 2 small white dots of light flickering in and out of the clouds near the red/blue light, but they would dart in and out of the clouds so quickly, it was hard to be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the light hovered in the same spot for about 10 seconds, still flickering, still changing from red to blue and back, it changed to red and moved off slowly.  The entire sequence of events lasted about 1 minute and 20 seconds. I ran back inside to get my phone to take a video, but I could not get the video to play on the phone.  Kept giving an error code.  I will download it tomorrow to see if it will play on my desktop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were totally silent, no noise at all.  I thought it might be a drone, but it was too high for it to be a toy, and because we live within 2 miles of the regional airport, drones are illegal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most unusual thing was the brightness of the lights.  There were a piercing shade of blue and red, extremely bright, and they didn’t blink, they flickered and although predominantly red, they changed to blue intermittently.  The main light looked like a cluster of 3 lights stuck together, but they never flew independently or came apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights traveled south west, basically over Towne West Subdivision north of Sugar Land, and went in the direction of the Sugar Land airport.  Because it is a regional airport, there is rarely any traffic after 10pm at night, but there are 2 life flight helicopters that are stationed close by that make trips in the early morning hours, but you can hear them coming from a long way off.  These lights were completely silent.<n>

It kept in a straight line moving across the sky and away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a matter of minutes it disappeared into the clouds.

My wife and I are in New York State visiting my family and have been vacationing several days by the beach in Montauk, NY, out near the tip of Long Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a pretty clear and starry night so after the kids went to sleep we went out on the patio of the room we are renting and did some stargazing.  At approximately 11:20pm or so (we did not look at the time so this estimate is give or take 5-10 mins.), just as we were turning to go inside my wife shouted for me to look.  Looking to the SW we saw what appeared to be a bright orangish fireball rising slowly up into the sky.  There was no sound from the object that we could detect although it seemed to be close, perhaps a couple of hundred yards away at the most.  It then seemed to gain speed and ascend quite high into the atmosphere and began to head NE at what then seemed to be quite a high speed, as it disappeared from view in less than a minute.  We were awestruck especially since it moved so fast and yet made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our room is at the ((name deleted)) Resort in Montauk, which is right on the beach.  Our view from where we stood, looking in the direction of the location from which the object seemingly began to rise above the ground (or ocean?) was partially obscured by the building, to the extent that we did not catch view of the object until it had already (at first very slowly) risen to a height of what appeared to be 50 feet or more.  At first we both wondered if it could be some kind of object on fire being carried up by a balloon, but this did not seem to be a possibility once the glowing light rose up very high and then began traveling away from us at what seemed to be a very high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note that I will not be available at the phone number provided below until Aug. 1, however I can be reached by email prior to that date.

Then I see this large round red orange object.  At first I thought it was a red moon because of the fires in central Washington state.  Then I noticed that this single object was hovering at the height of a helicopter but made no sound.  This was a red orange roundish object moving very slowly north east. Not a fireworks display.  It stopped and then moved slowly south.  Stopped again and turned back going north east.  It hovered in the sky for a bit, moving up and down like a cork floating on water.  Then it moved ahead, a bit faster...and disappeared.  No clouds in the sky.  I haven&#39;t ever seen anything like this before.  Never seen a UFO before to my knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Thinking maybe a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened up the camera in my phone to take a picture of it.  Thinking how amazing i was able to capture a shooting star.  It had been coming in very fast but then it just stops in mid air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then started to move extremely slow.  Till it disappeared.  So we figure it aint a plane for sure must be a shooting star.  But in doubt we make our wishes anyways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We go back in ans later explaining to my son and husband.  We decide to zoom in on the picture.  We were shocked and amazed.  And more amazing that I caught a pic of it.  But when we put it close it wasnt a star.  If not something scary but what I dont know.  It was a huge ball of what seems to be fire.  So right then we knew it was impossible to be a shooting star.  What could this be?  U be the judge but make it closer.  I didn&#39;t even know how to explain it.  Maybe a meteor or a little asteroid.<n>

Two Sightings (Jul 4th/Jul 17th)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting 1) July 4th, 2014, (22:45mt)   At aprox 22:45 we were enjoying the neighborhood fireworks.  When I noticed what looked like orange &#34;street lamp colored&#34; sparks, from an aerial &#34;mortar type&#34; firework drifting in the wind.  It quickly became apparent they were actually flying objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One flew by, followed by two in perfect formation.  They were traveling in an Easterly direction, rather slowly.  I turned and asked the other adults if they were seeing the same thing, all agreed they did.  As minutes past it hit me we should be taking video.  We were able to get a short video, but the &#34;orbs&#34; were too far away by that time, and it barely showed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orbs were visible for close to five minutes, then faded out one by one.  They were very bright streetlight orange at first, then faded with distance.  But also faded in and out randomly.  They made zero noise, and had no other navigational type lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting 2)  July 17th, 2014, (23:30mt)   At aprox. 11:30pm while. driving South on Happy Valley Rd and Amity roundabout, noticed three bright very clear orange orbs over the S East horizon.  The orbs were flying in perfectly spaced formation.  As we came down the small hill, a fourth and fifth appeared in the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We followed them East Then South on Greenhurst/Black Cat about 5 miles.  We then turned west on Kuna Rd and pulled to the shoulder as the Orbs very slowly descended towards ground level.  I was able to shoot a small amount of video.  We drove a few miles West then South, but lost the orbs among the yard lights in the distance.  Driving home with windows down, we noticed a heavy burnt electrical smell in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We absolutely have no doubt both &#34;sightings&#34;were the same type of object.  I have an above average knowledge of civil/mil aviation, and can say these were not aircraft, balloons, or lanterns.  Nor were they afterburners or flares from local mil fighters.  With no navigational lights, or noise associated with most aircraft. And though these appear similar to yard/street lights.  Being brighter, well above the horizon, and moving!  Can not be same.<n>

I was just sitting on the couch and looked up and saw an orange-red-white fireball passing somewhat slowly by, through the double windows. It was large.  It was dark out, so it was hard to tell which direction it was travelling.  No noise, no trail left behind.  It appeared to be going away from me at a diagonal direction I had to get up and stand back in the room to watch where it was going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a short time (a minute??) I noticed things that looked like sparks come down only from the bottom of the fireball.  At that point I thought it was likely some type of firework or flare.  It appeared to disappear behind some trees behind a main road near my house where there is a wooded area. In a few minutes, another similar thing came by and did the exact same trajectory, disappearing behind the trees.  I am thinking it&#39;s a firework (??).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was travelling fairly slowly though, and generally in a horizontal direction, as if being steered...I think a firework would go straight up vertically (?).<n>

There were around six or seven lights in the sky that remained in the same area for the two hours we (four males, early-mid twenties) observed them, from around 21:00 to 23:00 on 17 July 2014.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights kept fading in and out, as they rearranged themselves into different triangular patterns in the sky.  They would intensify in brightness, then fade to darkness before reappearing in the same area.  One of the lights was much higher and farther west than the group doing formations.  This phenomena occurred for over one hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 22:15 a low flying military jet aircraft, with the delta wings clearly visible, flew northbound over the West Haven beach, made a sharp left turn (right over our heads) and traveled westbound toward the lights seen over Long Island, following the CT coastline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes after the jet had disappeared beyond our line of sight, two red lights appearing to be attached to a single projectile materialized out of the lone light that was higher than the group.  At first it appeared to be an air-to-ground missile or a plane crashing into the sea.  The object was traveling extremely quickly downwards and to the left in a straight line at a 45° angle from the lone light.  It was traveling at a speed much higher than freefall speed, and in a trajectory that can not be explained by something falling.  It disappeared when it reached our visible horizon.  There were no sounds or visuals indicating any explosion or impact.  The projectile appeared for only a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After witnessing the air-to-surface projectile, the orbs of light in the sky began to travel eastbound as a group and the lone light traveled in the opposite direction.  The lights faded, disappeared, and did not reappear.  We left the beach at 23:00.<n>

Being on the other side of the state from Skiorsky it not odd to occasionally see a single hawk in the air, but to see 2 let alone armed gunships in the air is rare.  What happens next is what makes me wonder.  flying low enough as to either land, or to be below the radar screen a c-130 flys east to west and this is not the first time i&#39;ve seen one of these flying in this direction and altitude in the last month more actually the 7th time.  There is no air base in the region that supports these aircraft certainly not in a east to west manner that they are flying.  There is the westover air force reserve base however it is north of my location and the distance is too soon for the planes to be on a landing approach, these c-130&#39;s have been flying lower then normal air traffic approaching the much closer bradley international airport and are on an intersect course with normal air traffic, which i also find to be very odd, as the FFA tends to be anal when military planes due such a thing.<n>

I believed that it was a mere helicopter in patrol but it begun to elevate and move towards our general direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Lights emitted were Red and Blue, which did not flash simultaneously in accordance to the common pattern regular to military/Police patrol aircrafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red lights flashed three times and then the blue light in the center flashes along with it.  Then it changed to multiple red flashes and some minimal blue flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my neighbor over to look and we immediately pause.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Aircraft flew above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor and I were perplexed because it was above us and it became clear to us what it is.  I would say it was a couple hundred feet or less, but then the most astonishing event occurs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights emitted from the aircraft revealed its definite shape, which appeared to look like a saucer with an extruded block in the center of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sides of the saucer had strips of red lights. Three of them exactly in both sides with one blue strip of light mixed with white in the center of the extruded block.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound of the turbulence had affected the neighborhood dogs which caused them to bark loudly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it sped to the other end of the street it made a sharp turn back and I immediately grabbed my ladder and I recorded the aircraft returning.  From the distance the sound of the turbulence had been very loud for the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Luckily I managed to record enough to approve of sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My witness is my neighbor and he had been surprised as well, unfortunately the focus on my camera had been lacking, explaining the difficulty in keeping range and quality.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I apologize if the video had been shaking around, I was nervous about the situation and I was not sure how to adapt to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then called the hotline and I had been advised to write a report as shown, and to attach a video along with it.<n>

(The jet could have been leaving the Fort Wayne Int’l airport).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I put on my polarized sunglasses the lights became much clearer and I noticed at total of five lights.  Three were stacked vertically and two were side by side horizontally – which were a bit lower and to the left than the 3 vertical ones.  They were moving slowly south/southeast.  As they made their way south I saw another one to the North end of the sky line, and then one more that either became more noticeable or “appeared” to its left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s possible that they were Chinese lanterns but they seemed far too high and bright given the clear sky and full daylight.  Also, I checked the wind direction at Intellicast.com under their local weather report and the timestamp at 08:54 showed the wind moving 6mph NNW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cell phone does not take great pictures, so I pulled my digital cam out of my book bag but the battery was exhausted go figure.<n>

We were sitting  looking at the stars facing west when I was first to see a huge round object coming across the sky from northeast to west.  It  was a gigantic fireball crossing the sky.  I was watching it and alerted my friend to turn and see as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, it appeared to be low in the sky, thinking we were to witness a  huge plane about to crash.  Then we realized  no sound was coming from it and the scale of its size and speed came into perspective. It had to be very high in  the stratosphere.  Total time elapsed was 15- 20 seconds observing it travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Comparing it to the size of the moon in full phase, it would be  approximately 10 percent of the size of a full moon, based on the half moon that night.  Gigantic sheets of flame were coming off it and speed was exeptionally high, guessing 6-8 times faster than any stratospheric jet speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it first  and then drew attention my buddy&#34;s attention to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was huge and we thought as it crossed out  of view aver the mountain  we would see an explosion perhaps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are wondering whether we saw an asteroid not pubicized, but a close call no  mentioned. Possibly space craft coming out of orbit? No mention any were todate and unsettling. The only thing  we saw on line next day was a report about a hole discovered in Siberia? Hope we have contributede to something here and will love to see an another verification on line. Thanks<n>

No sound, despite seemingly low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:30 PM EST, on 7/16/2014, I looked up to witness a &#39;line&#39; of flashing lights in the sky.  My view was not obscured by any trees or other objects, and the sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were not flashing in a synchronized fashion, but seemed to be blinking on and off independently of one another, with each doing so at fairly regular intervals of every two seconds or so.  The lights seemed to be close to the ground, but - sans a point of reference to judge distance by - I only say that because of how large and bright they were.  There were perhaps eight to ten lights that I could see all at once, stretching from a point directly overhead, from north to south, until the roof of my apartment building blocked my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this go on for around fifteen seconds, then realized that the number of lights seemed to be decreasing; it did not look as if they were ascending, or flying away outside of my field of vision, but rather that every few &#39;blinks&#39;, one of the lights would not light up again. At that point I ran inside to get my fiance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got back outside, we went directly to the rear (south) of our apartment building. Since the &#39;line&#39; stretched in that direction, and presumably beyond my line of sight, I assumed we would have a better view of whatever lights remained from that vantage.  This turned out to be the case, as we BOTH still saw four or five of the lights - as well as a single plane flying east to west at a higher altitude than the lights were when I originally saw them - flashing on and off.  Only, by this time, they were much further away from our location, and seemed to be at a higher altitude. Our view was also obscured at that point by a number of trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiance still definitely saw them as well, though I wish she could have seen them as I originally had.  (For the last hour and a half, I&#39;ve been constantly refreshing local news sights and google searches, hoping to find a similar report from someone local.  So far I&#39;ve seen nothing.  But what I have found is a video from San Diego that shows nearly exactly what I saw, only in that video the lights were at a greater height:<n> <n><n> <n><n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot9R6wE4Wtw<n> <n><n> <n><n> And a picture that looks remarkably similar to what I saw during the brief times when all of the &#39;objects&#39; were lit up simultaneously:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://humboldtsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ufo-blinking-lights.bmp)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were bright white in color.

There is a logical explaination for what I saw.  Problem is, I can&#39;t explain it so I&#39;m in search of an explanation. Last night, Wednesday, July 16, 2014 around 21:30 I was smoking on my back deck when is saw an aircraft come over the tree line from the north east headed in a southwesterly direction, about 220 degrees.  The aircraft was soon followed by a second, a third, forth and finally a fifth.  All five aircrafts were traveling in the same direction in a straight line formation and at the same distance apart.  What caught my eye was that all 5 aircrafts each admitted one flashing beacon light and all five beacon lights were flashing in unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before having children, I spent 5 years working at Charlotte Douglas International Airport.  I&#39;ve spent enough time around airplanes that I can identify them in the sky.  Even at night I can recognise the navigation lights on the tail and wings and even see the lights coming from the passenger cabin. I know that the five aircrafts I saw were flying too close to be passenger commercial aircraft so the could have been mitary.  Only problem is, even military aircrafts have navigation lights on the wings and tail, these aircrafts didn&#39;t have any.  The beacon lights flashed very bright as if LED and the intemitance lasted about one second in between flashes.  It was dark enough out that when the lights were in between flashes, no objects were visible from the ground.  Also, no noise was heard, but we don&#39;t normally hear noise from aircrafts traveling at 30,000 feet.  But, as stated before, the big thing that caught my eye was the fact that all five aircraft&#39;s beacon lights were flashing in unison.  To my knowledge, it would be very difficult and time consuming to sincronise call five beacon lights on all five aircrafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In disbelief at what I was seeing, I stepped inside and pulled my wife out to see these for herself.  My wife currently works in the ground control tower at CLT and has nearly 20 years experience in aviation.  Even she couldn&#39;t explain what we were seeing.  She even called our 16 year old daughter outside for a look as well.  She was immediately frightened and ran back inside, but she&#39;s a nieve child.  We sat outside for over 5 minutes watching these flashing lights move across the sky.  These aircrafts never changed formation, never changed speed or direction.  I know that they were moving too fast and were too low to be stars or satellites, however they seemed to move slower than most commercial aircrafts do at cruising altitude<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please help me to identify what I saw.<n>

Approximately five minutes later, his fiancé heard a faint sound and asked what it was.  They muted the TV and everyone stopped in their tracks.  The two family dogs had their ears perked up and  started growling.  He went outside and not a moment sooner he came rushing in frantically telling them to come outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was reaching dusk and as they went outside in the middle of the street they looked in the sky and instantly brought out their phones to capture a once in a lifetime moment.  In the sky, six to eight lights were blinking randomly in a straight line over their street.  The lights never moved, staying over the small suburban neighborhood hovering.  His mother was quick to point out that whatever was in the sky had blocked the clouds near it.  A few seconds later a small airplane was taking flight and was headed in their direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane went under the unidentifiable flying object missing it.  At around 9:25PM the object had flown west and never seen after that.  The family stayed outside after to try and see if it would come back and to further study the formations of the stars.  Three bright stars were in the formation of a large triangle, but later became unidentifiable because of neighboring stars during the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was never came back, but it sure was one scary yet exciting experience.<n>

We live on the intercostal and work nights so often like to hang out and talk on the balcony after work anywhere between 2-5 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On one night we witnessed this really bright star which then grew into a thin crescent shape.  Assuming we were crazy and seeing the moon behind clouds, we searched to finde the moon which we then realized at the time was behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the bright light turned crescent went back to a bright light with a tail as if the crescent got cut in half,  (at this time I called my boyfriend in hysterics trying to explain the sighting but he doesn&#39;t believe) soon after it then fade to just a star then disappeared into thin air.  It didn&#39;t appear for the rest of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on in the week, it appeared again, this time a little more south and didn&#39;t change into a crescent shape, but did grow a tail of light like a shooting star.  Then the tail of light slowly faded, but the light grew bigger as if it was closer then ended up fading out and disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We witnessed it two more times the last time being tonight the 16th.  Tonight my boyfriend was present to assure I wasn&#39;t crazy!  Tonight I seen it first as a bright colorful flashing star, which my boyfriend always claimed as satilites in the sky.  But this flashing light soon turned into a bright white light and then it ends up turning into a crescent shape and then back to a bright star then disappeared.  All the sightings last about 30 mins but randomly in the early AM, sometimes higher sometimes just a over beachside Ormond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks to the last sighting my bf believes me finally!

It was as bright as the moon.  At first, I had assumed it was the moon, although it would have been in an unusual position/location.  It disappeared due to the leaves blocking my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw it again in a clearing of leaves.  Again, it disappeared.  I stood up and watched it above the tree lines.  I wanted to see the shape before I woke my husband.  Already I was thinking “this is a UFO” due to its apparent shape and size and brightness.  When I saw the shape, I knew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So ran in the house and woke my husband.  I told him he had to get up, because he would never believe me.  He did, and we watched it fly over the house together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the front yard to continue watching it.  I was a little frightened and hid under some trees in case it was watching me.  I cannot tell you its size, maybe 1/6 size of the moon and later the size of a large star.  It was solid white, almost blinding light.  It was either a chevron shape or boomerang shape, similar to a stealth shape, but not a complete triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not change directions, but instead flew in almost a straight line untl it blinked out.  It was too bright for my husband to make out the shape of it, but I could see the shape as it flew directly over my head prior to waking him.  We were able to watch it together for at least 30 seconds before it disappeared from our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a military vet and my husband is an executive on an Army base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was definitely an aircraft with no blinking lights, nor colors.  It seemed to be an illuminated craft, as opposed to a craft with outside lights.  It was blazing bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded quite serious-minded to us.

It was right next to what we thought was a planet (as it was very bright).  I did not notice the moving light before but now it was brighter than the planet.  It was moving slowly in a circular motion and definitely was not an airplane.  It was going back and forth and then started to fade and went in a line away from the planet and we lost it in the trees.  I was still going when we lost it.  We did not see it with the telescope and we could not get a picture of it, as it was too far away.<n>

The brightness was like an Iridium flare from a satellite, only it was much larger in radius that a satellite appears to our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not think it was a satellite because it was moving so fast and because the glow was so much larger than satellite.  I do not think it was an airplane or helicopter either, because the speed was way too fast, there were no other lights besides the consistent glow, and the single white light was larger than any light I&#39;ve seen on an airplane at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also there was no sound. If it had been in aircraft and if it had been flying that fast and presumably low enough to produce a light that large, then I expect I would&#39;ve heard some noise but there was none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight path was west to east over highway 26 in Southeast Portland (Powell Blvd.)  Many local aircraft fly this route but none fly it as fast as this: approximately 8 seconds from west horizon to east horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can think of no category to fit the proper description of this light. I do not know what it is, but I&#39;m pretty sure I know what it is not.  And that&#39;s why I want to share this information here with you.  Thank you<n>

After it passed me, a small, solid, bright white lit; was ahead, slightly above, and a little to the south of the helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I focused on the light, and all the sudden at 3 o&#39;clock a red strobe light came on.  About 2 seconds after that at 10 o&#39;clock, a second red strobe light came on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of these lights were comparable to the helicopter, which had several white and red strobe lights that cycle much fast than the other lights.  Even though the helicopter was closer, the size of the three lights were about 10 times larger (assuming it was one object). I could not tell the distance between the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I feel like it was one craft is because after the red strobe lights came on, they never wavered in distance from the solid white light and the orientation around the center never changed.  I would estimate the visual contacted lasted 15-20 seconds until I lost it behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around, but no other witnesses.  I went to tell someone and they said watch this and said, &#34;Sir, what&#39;s above me?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparently, this guy has done this on several occasions and it shows all flights around (we&#39;re just south of Atlanta and generally there is some kind of traffic), but this time it showed nothing.  He stated that this was unusual.  As I have never done it, I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, the craft in question flew directly over the FAA center, which I believe has a no-fly zone over it (I have never seen any air traffic over it).  The helicopter was just north of the Center.<n>

As it was still fairly light out this object really caught my attention.  It seemed to be moving in a southeasterly direction, but the speed was hard to judge since it was moving toward us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20 seconds I pointed it out to my wife, and she said she had just noticed it as well.  I asked her what she thought it might be, and neither of us had any idea.  About 1 minute after I had first seen it, the object just disappeared.  It didn&#39;t seem to have turned or changed altitude, it was just suddenly gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not able to see any auxiliary lights or blinking lights either when the light was visible OR in the area it had been after it disappeared, leading me to believe it was not an aircraft of any kind.  There was also enough daylight left that if it were a helicopter they would have no use for a spotlight as it wouldn&#39;t illuminate the ground any more than the ambient light was, especially from the height it was at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes after the object disappeared, I noticed that some stars were starting to be barely visible, so I&#39;m positive that what we saw wasn&#39;t a star, nor was it a reflection off of any object as the sun was setting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I are both college educated people who are usually able to come to a rational conclusion regarding most any event, but this has both of us stumped as to what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;ve lived in this area for almost 15 years and neither of us has ever seen anything like this.<n>

My friend noticed it too.  My friend thought it looked more orange-red (minor matter).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere was approximately 90&#39; in the air from the top of the hill where we were waking and about 100&#39; away.  The sphere moved very slowly across the sky in a straight line.  It proceeded to move behind a large tree that was on the hill and I was curious to keep the thing in my view for as long as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I ran to the other side of the tree the object vanished into thin air.  Poof!  Gone!  To have seen it so clearly from where we were standing I estimated it to be about 2.5&#39; to 3&#39; around.  It made no sound.  It was not a light projection - it was a solid glowing object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had 3 dogs with us and they made no indication of having seen or felt anything untoward.  There were no other people around - no children, no adults it was a totally clear and quiet evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was NEVER a believer in all the UFO stories I heard people talking about, however, I still remain a little unsettled about this sighting.<n>

I looked up to see any aircraft visable as we are about 100 miles west of ATL and we usually have good air traffic overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a light that would be similar to the brightness of Venus directly overhead, but at about 85 degrees, slightly to the west.  I asked my wife if she could see it and she said that she did.  No other lights were visable in the sky and 30 minutes later in the same spot where we witnessed this, there are still no other lights in the sky, including and stars or planets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was stationary as far as we could tell.  At one point I picked up my daughter and leaned her back and asked her if she could see it.  She pointed to the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 10 minutes, the sun had set over the horizon or behind clouds to the northwest.  The light was no longer there but my wife said that she could still see it.  I could not but as I tried, two aircraft in the area allowed my eyes to focus back on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment my wife said that there were now 3 objects.  I noticed that the main object appeared doughnut shaped and the other two appeared as smaller dots.  To me it looked like one of the dots shot out of  the larger doughnut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After only about a minute of looking at this strange cluster of objects, they disappeared.   These objects were far higher than the altitude of the commercial airplane traffic that was in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions at the time were 85 degrees F, humidity 59 percent, wind south at 1 MPH with a visibility of ten miles.  The sky was and still is partly cloudy with showers off to our northwest about 20 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One last detail... For some reason last night, I was out after dusk and had an uncommon urge to look up at the sky as if I was looking for something out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t look for strange things but last night I just felt the need to and then tonight we saw something strange.  Interesting.<n>

Then I noticed it was rising.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute of rising it started to drift to my left what might&#39;ve been several hundred feet (about an inch from my perspective on the ground).  I was hoping it would dart around but its movement was slow, almost lethargic, albeit not like any aircraft I&#39;ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After what looked like some more swaying about it started to drift up again (about an inch every 5 seconds) before fading out behind a storm cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen a UFO before.

I have seen red orbs like this once before, and suspected it might be a ufo, but was unprepared the first time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the first orb appeared, I watched it dumbfounded for a minute, to see the same object again, then got my wits and went into the house to get my digital camera.  I only caught a smidgen of the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a few minutes later, TWO identical orbs, both glowing red, followed the EXACT same flight path, in the EXACT same direction, at the EXACT same speed.  I got the two in formation recorded, only the first few seconds of it were in focus but they are discerable.  I didn&#39;t have the foresight to have the camera on manual focus and as I zoomed in, it drifted out of focus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not long after the pair of orbs vanished, a FOURTH came into view, once again, EXACT same flight path as the previous 3.  I have a much better video of the last orb.  In it, I have the entire flight, from where it first became visible, to when it went beyond where I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have both close zoom and I also pulled back to include the moon in the shot, to provide scale for distance and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four objects were totally silent, I heard no aircraft sounds whatsoever, saw no blinking marker lights, only the red glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe because of location and time, as well as other physical characteristics of the event, that I was not seeing sunlight reflecting from airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was constant and consistend for the entire event, never waxing or waning, never changing in intensity as a reflection would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, these objects should have been flying through the shadow of the earth, as shown given the time and lunar illumination.<n>

Switched phone to video mode (5 mega pixles) and filmed the entire rainbowand noted a strange cluster of clouds, I make the comment it looks as if a UFO could come out of that strange cluster of clouds, I capture that it is about :36 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is link to that on YouTube.<n> <n><n> <n><n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBEnAZnFRI&amp;list=UUaKKSNYXQkyNlPH-K6QZjzw<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put phone on standby but still in video mode, and go in to use the bathroom.  Then run back in and yell that I have to come back out and see this it is a UFO,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turn back on phone, before I go out front door. (Driveway faces South west) As I walk out, I see a very right light up in the sky start record, then watch most of the sighting with my eyes, checking the screen to make sure I had it centered correctly,<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw is the light go up, come back down, the strange clouds had disapated, above and below the object, then as it made a slow descent I saw 2 separate lights above a lower disc shaped color of a dark royal blue or purple, almost a blacklight color but brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2 light above it which took up 70% of it were very large and bright, with a definate separation of the 2 in the middle. This can be seen on a large screen Hi Def TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it decended it slowed, then as it got lower below the power lines and near roof tops it appeared to be miles away South West of town, I mention Sara Park in the video but my direction is off it appears to be 5 to 7 miles south of town in a desert area. no houses or buildings there, As it got to the roof line the left side appeared to me to flash a very bright red light on one sideas it hovered above the roof line a few seconds then dipped below that and went out of site, The other 3 witness&#39;s saw it ascend quickly lower, then rise again, that is when I caught this on video here: (1:36)<n> <n><n> <n><n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFiBEyVuY4I&amp;list=UUaKKSNYXQkyNlPH-K6QZjzw<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My roommate called the non emergency Police line to ask if any calls had come it.

This had none of the normal markings of a plane. no tail lights wing lights and the lights were too huge to be landing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are on the south side of the City, the airport is far north of here and it only went up and down in direction.

At any rate, the craft hung there, not moving at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it shot up into the air, and then, it descended behind the houses so we wouldn&#39;t see it.  We go in the car and tried to find it, seeing only a ball of light on a hillside.  We were unsuccessful in reaching it, and when we tried, it disappeared.

I noticed a chem trail being sprayed by plane and noticed below the trail shiny things in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So the plane had traveled and they were slowly following the path of the chem trail, but they would almost stop and fly around and around then move towards the plane or almost trying to catch up to it but taking their time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know they were NOT birds because when they would change direction and altitude the different angles would hit the sun, causing them to reflect light or what light you&#39;d expect from the sun, like a mirror.  So they seemed to be metal..actual material unknown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had gotten excited so I ran downstairs and pointed it to my wife, 4 confirmed if she can or did see them and she said yes, I do see them.  There were about 9-16 or so, definitely more then ten (10), they all would fly around in circles following the east/southward path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were hard to follow when going from upstairs to downstairs and back up again since that far away they&#39;d blend in with the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know exact altitude I&#39;d guess 2 or 3 k feet up…<n>

I was laying on my right side and my bedroom window was behind me.  My dog was lying next to my back.  She got up and I turned to look at her and I seen that her tail was between her legs.  Something had spooked her and she does have a lot of sound phobias but I did not hear anything.  I am pretty well versed in canine behavior and body language and have been studying this subject for a while now as I am working towards a career in this field.  She jumped off the end of the bed and went to her “safe spot” underneath the bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As she jumped, I noticed a bright light in my peripheral vision outside my window.  I turned my head and looked and saw a line of 5 or 6 lights in a straight line moving at a moderate rate of speed.  Maybe like 150-200 mph as a rough estimate.  It seemed like it appeared out of nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I focused my eyes on it I noticed the lights were alternating colors of blue and white.  They were all fluctuating in intensity and were going from bight to very bright.  Suddenly, the craft just disappeared.  I didn’t see it take off, it just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimated it to be at an elevation of about 5-7 thousand feet.  I continued to look for the next 25 minutes or so but saw nothing.  The entire event lasted all but 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This took place in the SSE direction and I live about 5-7 miles directly south of downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned on my smartphone 20 minutes or so after the sighting to see what the weather condition were.

It disappeared as quickly as it appeared - it fell for approx 10 seconds - very pretty, but very strange ... We both couldn&#39;t believe that we saw it!! It wasn&#39;t really a perfect sphere and looked as though it may have been sort of shaped like a child&#39;s spinning top (but the top portion was thicker than that of a top).

There was no light pollution other than the moon itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been counting planes to fly overhead and got to about 7 when the stopped for about five minutes.  I was confused, but kept staring at the sky waiting for the next plane to fly overhead.  I don&#39;t think it was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO would flash brightly, brighter than stars, then dim out so i could barely see it inconsistently.  When it was at its brightest it looked like some sort of explosion?  About the size of a plane, if not larger.  It would zoom quickly then slow down the entire time.  I watched it fly across my area of vision, but it never flew at a consistent speed, only quickly or slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too far to tell shape or anything, so it could be a plane or something, but I really don&#39;t think so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also:  I have lots of bug bites from sleeping in the forest, but two in particular.

They were 2 bright white lights, on a straight horizontal path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clearly not meteors or aircraft.  They were too fast for either, had no tails or trails, and were bright white, looking similar to car headlights in spacing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They shot across the sky as if they were chasing each other.

Between 21:00-21:30<n> <n><n> LOCATION: Leander, Texas.  (RM.1431 between Trails End Road &amp; Anderson Mill Road)  SKY CONDITION: Clear Skies.  Good Visibility.  It was not yet dark and the Sky was fairly well Lit. The &#34;SUPER&#34; MOON was above the horizon but low in the sky.  The Sun was gone from view, but its light still present.  It was not yet dark and<n> <n><n> MY POSITION: Driving East on RM 1431.  Traveling ~55mph.  This is a route I commonly take 4-5x per week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Driving east on RM.1431, the SuperMoon was directly ahead of me and I was admiring the incredible view.  Suddenly, this ROUND, WHITE BALL of LIGHT came streaking out of the Southern Sky to the North at an Altitude of approx. 700&#39;-900&#39; at a Distance of ~100&#39;-150&#39; in front of my vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This BALL OF WHITE LIGHT (which I will call an ORB) moved so fast, I feared a plane was about to crash, but I could tell it was NOT a plane.  No plane moves at this kind of speed.  The ORB moved more like a shooting star, only its path was horizontal to Earth and gravity didn&#39;t seem to be affecting the movement of this ORB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it streaked North, I had to look out my left window to follow it and as I looked North I expected to see this ORB already beyond the Northern Horizon.  What I saw next clearly confirmed this was NO Shooting Star!  As the ORB passed over me streaking North, I followed it by turning my head to look out my driver&#39;s side window.  At the speed the ORB was traveling, I expected by the time I reacted and turned my head left that it would have been well beyond the Northern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I located the actual position of the ORB, I was astonished to see that it had not shot out of view, but had stopped accelerating just after it crossed over RM.1431.  But that&#39;s not all.....The Hi-Speed, Low Altitude ORB I witnessed had now become 2 ORBs and were in a &#39;wild dance&#39; in the sky about 100&#39;-150&#39; to the north of RM.1431.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As if the 2 ORBs were putting on a show for me, the lights went into a highly energetic, highly reactive state of movement that looked like a couple of Tasmanian Devils do the Tango.  The 2 ORBs spun around each other, twisted, tied and twirled in a relatively tight area with one another for about 2 seconds and disappeared.  I did not see how the 1 ORB became 2 ORBs.  It could have split into 2, or perhaps paired up with another ORB not in my awareness...<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the best description I can offer of what I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> SIDE NOTES:  One final statement...I am a musician.  For about 30 mins prior to my ORB sighting, I was trying to perfect the cadence of each syllable so that every word fit the music just right.  I played my recording over &amp; over singing these lyrics.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s by Intelligent Design We&#39;re on this Rock Spinning through Space Spinning through Time Where Material overlaps  The Paranormal that overlaps  With the Divine That&#39;s what we find  This is a song about our Universe and how this Physical world overlaps with the Paranormal world, which also overlaps with God&#39;s Infinite Divinity.  We are connected in ways unseen to these other dimensions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this doesn&#39;t sound crazy, but it&#39;s the truth....I heard on Coast to Coast AM that some people have invited ETs into their awareness and In the last week or two, I had actually made a few conscious requests for contact to see if anything would happen.  Today it did.<n>

The fireworks were over the river.  We were by the car parked across the street from the river, in front of Fort Rock Farm.  Fort Rock Farm was behind us, as we were facing the river. Fort Rock Farm has been abandoned for years, without any lights on at all tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the adults, my son, pointed behind me and said, &#34;What&#39;s THAT?&#34;  The other three of us turned completely around and looked.  Hovering over the back of the field of Fort Rock Farm, were two red lights positioned opposite one another, like car headlights, but closer together.  The lights hovered up high (possibly rising a bit) and then the lights began to very slowly descend until they disappeared.  They made no sound at all.  It was too dark to see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although there are R. R. tracks behind the farm, there was no train going by.  There was no reflection of any fireworks.  I kept checking back, when the fireworks were going off, and there was no reflection at all behind us of the fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the event, I had a camera in my hand, but was so shocked by what I was seeing and by trying to make sense of it, that I didn&#39;t think to film or take photos until the event was over.

I’ve never witnessed anything like I observed on the evening of July 12, 2014.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was flying from Chicago to Dallas-Ft. Worth at FL320.  Sky conditions were clear.  I fly for a major airline and have flown this route hundreds of times.  We were about sixty miles north of Fort Smith, Arkansas, on a heading of 210.  The time was around 2110 (9:10pm) central time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I spotted an object at my 1030 position, traveling from east to west.  It was about twenty degrees above the horizon.  It was emitting a very bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was moving across my windscreen, I kept waiting to see a strobe or some other indication that it was an aircraft.  It was moving at a very high rate of speed.  As it moved to my 1 o’clock position it split into two bright lights.  The objects began to separate from each other and then they immediately disappeared.  The first object appeared to be the size of a tack head, if held at arm&#39;s length.  Then when they separated, they appeared to be the size of a pin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another commercial aircraft, that had seen the same object, immediately asked Memphis Center if he was tracking an aircraft that had just flown over him.  Memphis replied that there was no traffic in his area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time, I told Memphis Center that I had seen the same object.  Another commercial pilot then chimed in and said he had seen it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next five minutes, the other pilots and I gave a brief description to Memphis Center what we had seen.  All had observed the exact same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must reiterate that the object or objects did not have a tail streaking behind or moving up or down.  They were moving in a straight line from east to west.  The bright white light emitted by the objects was more intense then I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In all my years as a pilot, I have seen weather balloons, falling stars, meteors and comets.  This was different from anything I have ever observed in my thirty year career.<n>

There is quite a bit of light pollution in my area, coming from Houston to the north, and a small baseball field to the east, so star gazing is minimal.  There is a small, private airport, about 3/4 mile SW of my location.  Approximately 5 miles NE is Ellington Field, a former AFB, and still a current NASA facility.  My neighborhood is full of trees, which partially obscured my vision of what I have just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2105 hrs, I was in my front yard, speaking with a family member on my phone, facing north.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw movement in the sky, and turned to see what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed a multi-colored, red, yellow and white, brightly lit object, moving at a ridiculously high rate of speed, coming from the SE, and traveling almost due NW, or right to left for me.  This object had a long tail, similar to a comet or shooting star, that was a sort of a fuzzy, faint yellow.  The lights were not blinking, bright, yet hazy, like it was surrounded by part of the front part of the tail..<n> <n><n> <n><n> The angle of elevation was somewhere between 45 and 60 degrees.  I couldn’t say if this object was at 35,000 feet, or skimming the treetops of the houses across the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw the object, it was NE from my house, and as I was trying to tell my family member what I had just seen, and running out into the street to get a better look, the object continued on its NW course, dis! appearing over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was in my view for a very short time, somewhere between 5 and 8 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my perspective, this object appeared to be about the size of a basketball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise coming from the object, but every dog in the neighborhood was  barking or howling at something that I couldn’t hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an active, 25 year Police Officer, and have never seen anything so strange, or move so fast.  I am not one to believe in alien spacecraft, much less report on one, but what I saw doesn’t compute with anything I know, and I would really like to know what the hell I just saw..<n>

As we were driving, I happened to notice an interesting air craft.  It was blinking red and greenish lights, it had appeared to disappear quite quickly.  For fear of my friends thinking I was crazy I kept it to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were pulling into the parking lot of our complexes, it had returned to my sight this time it was close and slow moving.  My friends in the car happened to see it at that point it was quite large bit at this point was shining an led square shaped like light and hovered in one spot for a good min or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night, I went to Wegmans with a friend.  As we were driving, I told her about what had just happened, and coincidentaly there it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We followed it not about a half an hour we noticed that it was circling around Liverpool.  It would make these sharp right turns that are physically impossible for a human made craft such as a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This experience is extremely life changing and to me it&#39;s a blessing to have seen something of this intelegance!

Though my camera sucked at the video and doesn&#39;t show them nearly as bright as they were in person, you clearly see 3 bright orange lights, two of them disappear out of no where, and then a 4th and 5th light come from a set of trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the video rolls on, you can really only see 4 as the 5th one was kind of far from the camera and can&#39;t really see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I stopped recording because only one light was left, I took off in my car and drove to a nearby soccer field.  I got out and looked every where for even a glimpse of an aircraft and saw nothing.<n>

It was about 10,000 feet in the air and it had about 4 lights that flickered (in no pattern or sequence) red and green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft hovered and then made very fast movements back and forth, it also made spinning movements.  The spinning, quickness, spontaneity of the lights and closeness to the ground ruled out any possibility of this being a plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not many people saw it because no one made a big deal but I alerted my friend and she also agreed that it was like nothing she had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 minutes of scoping the 1 mile radius, the aircraft seemed to just disappear.<n>

Not moving, faded into nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello,<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the sky to the south west while driving home I saw a light, like a star but much brighter.  It was a clear evening, very few clouds and being around 7.30 to 8 pm, it was still very much light.  The &#34;star&#34; was white and seemed to be at least double the size of how Venus or Jupiter would look on a clear winters night, yet this was in daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m an educated man and have an interest in astronomy.  I said to my partner who was sitting in the car next to me, I think Betelgeuse has gone supernova.  I was so excited and couldn&#39;t believe it.  I tried to show her where but she didn&#39;t see, I viewed it for what seemed like 10 seconds and then over a period of around 1 second it faded to nothing.  I knew then that if a star like Betelgeuse had indeed exploded it should be visible for weeks or months.  I rushed home and put on the news in case there were any reports of such things, there were not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mulled this around in my mind that night.  The light was not moving, when it faded there was nothing, no object at all left in the sky.  I found this website and thought I should report it.  I would like to add that I am in my 30 s and have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I live in an apartment where cars are subject to tow so I always need to get up early in the morning to move my car.  I got up and walk to my car to move it which is about 300 feet from my apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was getting in to my car I happened to look up and saw a black object in the sky.  I am used to seeing helicopters and military aircraft in the area since this is north san diego.  But I knew right away something was different about this object.  It was far away enough that it just looked like a baloon.  Luckily enough I had my binoculors in my car which they said 10 x 30 on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I observed the craft it had an irregular flight pattern.. (going up and down left and right). As I focused in with my binoculors I could tell right away what it was.  There first thing I noticed every now and then on it was it had what appeared to be a set up lights on what appeared to be fins on the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I observed it spin, it appeared to be shape shifting and spinning its mass as it was moving with some lights visible.  Once I saw that I started to get excited and look for any other person in the area to point out what I was seeing. I kept an eye on it as I was moving, I found to construction workers talking in their trucks and walked up and pointed to what I was looking at.  They thought it was a balloon but with my binoculors I could see what it really was..<n> <n><n> <n><n> As all this was going on it was drifting south east and gaining altitude.  I did get a view of the craft when it was not shape shifting and it was diamond/teardrop in shape and had an organic appearance with fins in the middle with low light lights on it.  The surface had a vein like appearance of something like a vegetable with black and dark red in a striped like organic way.  I may have seen a windscreen but it was too far too tell. After seeing that I ran back to my apartment to get my camera and try and get a view shots through my binoc! ulors but by the time I came back out it had already been lost! in to t he clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a broad knowledge of all kinds of aircraft and balloons and can say this was not like anything I have every seen in my entire life and has changed my perception about life as I know it. I have attached a sketch and a video of the area of its flight. Sadly I could not get any hard evidence of it.<n>

I first noticed it from Vaughn, NM, I noticed a light high in the sky in the direction of Santa Clara, the light seemed stationary but would turn around in circles like a spotlight searching the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light continued from that location for as long as it took to drive to Santa Clara.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just breaking daylight and I could tell as I neared Santa Clara that the light emitting UFO was just above and to the east of Santa Clara.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the sky became visible blue color I could see the object was still there shining its light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was many thousands of feet in the air but appeared to be circular shapes, it was still in the sky when I left the area.

Around 12:45am I noticed a bright orange light over the water that wasn’t there a moment ago.  I went to the beach to go look at it with my Mom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got to the beach, we could see that the object was hovering in the air above the tree line.  It appeared to be the same size and similar shape to a hot air ballon.  The light was so bright and high in the sky that it had a reflection on the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched it, a second one appeared.  They would hover, then combine into one glowing object, and then one would reappear again next to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were watching, two other campers joined to stare at the orange fire balls.  I did not know these campers.  We stood there in awe for about 10 minutes as we watched these two balls of light fade in and re appear in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the two lights sunk below the tree line and left a orange glow for about 30 seconds till the lights faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a military base near by, and there were about 5 to 8 boats on the water that night at 1am.  Those boats were still on the water at 2am, when I finally decided to go to bed.<n>

At least a hundred that would alternate between brightening and dimming.  Some moved past each other faster than others, some in formation and some not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lasted for almost two hours.  About an hour into the event a high altitude airplane flew very quickly under the moon on the opposite side of the sky, so we know these lights where not airplanes.  None of the lights made a sound, but the Earth had a strange vibration.  None of the sounds were from a train, a/c unit, or from highway traffic; there is a difference between these vibrations.  Even some of the backyard dogs started barking and howling without any seeming provocation.<n>

This event occurred whilst we were in the middle of a conversation and both of us immediately went silent as an unknown voice spoke silently in our minds about receiving access to our mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire event lasted roughly five minutes, started at the same time, and ended at the same time.  Without any verbal communication we both looked at one another and stated the same confusion as to what just happened while complete paralysis consumed us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately after the event we experienced a large increase in the light being reflected off of the moon that disturbed both of our corneas when attempting to better understand what was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For several hours after the event I kept feeling as though I needed to ground myself electrically as if there was a current running through my body with a heightened attention on my feet.

As i got to the door, it was approaching fast and stopped about 60 feet away and 80 feet up.  It hovered as clear as day silent as a smooth wind .my wife screams as i have to see what was the commtion.  We watched it watch us for 10minutes solid at least.  I stood dumbfounded and afraid.  Upon the final minute or so it pulls off circlelar in shape with light blue lights rounding the edges with a red light emitting from the bottom. As it left it seemed to grow wings as pass as silently as it pulled up.<n>

What was most notable was that there was “drippings” or embers of fire or what have you from the bottom of the object.  The object then slowed down considerably and continued on its northerly path with the fireball decreasing in size until it completely dissipated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object moved in a relatively similar direction but instead of continuing the same directional course as the first fireball, the second moved upwards in the sky until it slowed to a halt and dissipated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted, that there was no noise, smoke, or trails associated with these objects.  To the best of the observers knowledge fireworks were not at play nor could the objects be attributed to flares.<n>

It was not a meteorite because it was way too large, didn&#39;t have a tail and didn&#39;t burn out.  It was not a plane because it didn&#39;t not have blinking lights and there was a plane flying overhead shortly afterwards.  It made a sound like a low thrum.  It made the dogs nervous and they started growling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second one came, heading in a different direction, less than a minute after the first one disappeared over the horizon.  It flew overhead and then disappeared, but we could still see the shape blocking out the light of the stars overhead as it moved across the sky.  It was not quite shimmery, but kind of like it looked reflective or see through.  It made the same sound until it went &#34;see through&#34;.  Then it was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very strange!  We tried to film it.  It should have shown on the video as it was so large, but we have no video footage, even though our voices were heard.  The sound did get picked up, however.  We would like to know if any satellite or space debris has been reported breaking up in the atmosphere.  We&#39;ve never seen anything like it and we love to star gaze on clear nights.<n>

I was outside with my 2 dogs doing potty break.  We live within earshot of Sea-Tac Intl. airport; about 5 miles ENE.  An aircraft was departing  and the engine noise was what I thought to be a bit louder than normal.  In hindsight, it was throttle-up at the beginning of his roll for a northerly departure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In looking up, an occulting light caught my eye. It was a bit whiter than a high pressure sodium street light an seemed to flash on and off about ever 1.5 seconds for an on an off cycle.  The &#34;on&#34; cycle was about twice as long as the off.  When I first looked up I was facing nearly due west.  If you make west 12 o&#39;clock, I first noticed what I believe a fireball, about a point (the width of a closed fist across the knuckles) above and west of the 3/4 waxing moon.  The object was traveling roughly the same path the moon will follow as it drops towards the western horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not streaking like a shooting star and there as no tail. It was moving slow enough that when it passed behind the neighboring house to the south of mine I was able to take 3.steps to my right to see more of the trajectory as it cleared the neighbors.  The flashing was not strobe like but more akin to a flashing red street light.  I did wonder if it might be an aircraft plunging out of the ! sky because the departing jet from Sea-Tac had not cleared the tree line yet and was still significant just after the object dropped out of sight the aircraft emerged climbing out to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did do a little hunker down waiting for some results but nothing occurred.  I stayed out for a few more minutes observing the general area of the sky this all happened in.<n>

I always listen to your reports on C2C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Technically this is ufo, but I don’t know if it was ‘one of our’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a month ago (this is 8/11/14), I saw an object in the sky that caught my attention.  We live in Santa Rosa, CA, and about 3 miles from the airport.  It was about 9:00 pm, the sky was dark, no fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed out of my second story window that there was an object and I thought it was an airplane coming straight on to the airport.  But it wasn’t moving at all, and there was only one light.  I laughed at myself, thinking ‘oh sure, you just want to see a ufo.  I got my husband to look at it.  I kept track of it for about 20 minutes- it’s possible that it moved a tiny bit, but when you are staring at something like that you can be fooled, so I don’t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also seemed to maybe have some periodic flickering colors on the right side. For those 20 minutes it did not change course.  When I went to bed it was still there, same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was south from here, very small.  San Francisco is 50 miles from here, and I supposed it could be in that direction.  I don’t know if I could actually see that far, but it was a dark cloudless night and the object, although very small, was bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured the angle was about 50 degrees up from the ground where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now here is a funny thing. My sister lives about 50 miles south of San Francisco in the area of San Jose.  I never mentioned this siting to her (I actually pretty much forgot about it). About two weeks ago we were talking and, guess what, she saw the same thing! But hers was a few weeks after my siting. I did not say anything as she was relating it to me; I put my hand over my mouth and let her finish talking about it, and then told her. What a shock!  She saw hers later than mine, more about 11:00pm. And hers was somewhere over the Lockheed area (I think a little east from her). She watched hers for about 10 minutes- it did not move. Other than the time and date, and a little more east from her place, it was exactly the same description! Today we were talking about this and I decided to write you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided it must be a drone. Do you know?? I don’t like the idea of drones lurking in the sky any more than an ET.<n>

He looked up too, and within seconds it was flashing lights from each side, at that moment I thought it was just an airplane but I kept looking, and this orb dropped a red light which disappeared within seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb was still in the sky, and had stopped blinking from the sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute later the Orb looked like it was flickering, and started to disappear, but my friend said he could still see it in the sky while I was driving, and the light was very faint by this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it disappeared about 30 seconds after that.<n>

Torrance, CA looking west toward the Redondo Beach coastline.   There was a marine layer several hundred feet high and appeared to be off the coast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out of my house to make sure the cars were locked and noticed a bright red-orange light rising from the horizon.   Looking in this direction you can often see aircraft departing from Los Angeles International Airport.  I am a pilot so when I saw the odd and very bright light I looked to see if there were any of the flashing position lights normally seen on aircraft.  There were none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light rose to what I estimate to be about 1,000 feet I noticed two additional red-orange lights rising from the horizon.  I refer to these as lights 2 and 3.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recognizing this was unusual I called by two adult sons to come witness what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light #1 dimmed to a faint white light and stopped in the sky at about 2,000 feet.  The other two rose together then separated their formation.  Light # 2 appeared to track out to sea in the direction of the northern end of Catalina Island.  Both dimmed like the first one but could still bee seen.  Light 3 continued to rise and stop at roughly the same altitude as Light 1.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This pattern continued with four to six more lights.  Some of the lights moved in a straight path.  Some changed directions and stopped in one place at times before continuing to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued watching Light #1, as it approached us.  As it got closer it appeared translucent and white.  It was wobbling and the closest thing I can describe it resembling is a modern parachute.  However, this was no parachute!  It passed us to the south and we lost it as it went behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very bizarre!<n>

At approximately 1 a.m., I went out on our back porch, which faces north and overlooks the valley.  Our place is located on the very top of Sloan Mountain, which is very rural.  The only ambient light was from a few lights in the valley, one cell phone tower to my left and a distant glow from Harrison, Arkansas, located about 25 miles away.  Even though the sighting took place during the Fourth of July week, there were absolutely NO fireworks were being used at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the porch, facing northward when I noticed a roundish red/orange light, distance is difficult to estimate, but I had the impression it was about 5 miles away.  The light was just smaller than dime size.  It looked unusual in this environment, so I did a mental assessment of the other lights I was used to seeing.  This light I was seeing was above the horizon, noticeably higher than the distant mountains top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The initial light was at my eleven o’clock position and had some slight movement, both vertically and horizontally.  Two smaller objects came out of the original light; they expanded to the same relative size of the original one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed other similar lights appear randomly.  In total, there were nine of them.  They were not in a precise formation, but were generally aligned, but were on different planes.  There was some movement, but like the original, no drastic movements.  They randomly blinked on and off, sometimes disappearing for two or three minutes, reappearing in slightly different positions.  The only constant light was the original.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed these lights for over thirty minutes.  They randomly disappeared, with the exception of the second and third light, which merged back to the original light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My field of view of these objects/lights was from my 10 o’clock to 3 o’clock.<n>

Due to a typo on my part in preparing notes for my files, I mistakenly indicated two weeks ago [Close Encounters in Joplin Area: Part One] that an encounter in Joplin took place in early August when it actually occurred on July 8.  The full report is the subject of this column.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, it was so hectic when I was writing the column last week that I completely forgot to give credit to NUFORC, the source of all but one of the sightings described.  (Sorry, Peter. Oh well, they say as you get older your memory is the second thing to go, but for the life of me I cannot remember what the first one is.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> That being said, the incident that occurred that Tuesday evening was a ufologist’s dream; three reputable witnesses, willing to be identified publicly, reporting a close encounter that left behind physical evidence of its reality.  In addition, the initial witness possessed the training and experience to be considered an expert on objects and craft in the sky; he is an airline pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 9:15 p.m. on July 8, Barry Powell, the pilot, was walking his dog when he noticed a strange craft with orange lights in the northern sky.  He realized almost immediately that it was approaching him, descending as he did so, and his leashed dog started to jump excitedly in the object’s direction.  At that point John Cruzan, general manager of the Joplin Globe newspaper, and his wife Traci, who is a technician in the medical field, came around a curve and were confronted with this strange scene.  They immediately stopped and got out of their vehicle, joining Barry in trying to determine what they were all seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached the confounded trio could make out a huge object, apparently soundless and displaying multiple lights in of yellow, blue and orange on its underside.  I said ‘apparently’ because every dog within hearing distance was barking excitedly.  Barry’s dog was even jumping up toward the craft to the extent his leash would allow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the UFO departed, still at slow speed, the witnesses followed in the Cruzans’ Jeep. They lost sight of it as it descended behind trees, but continued to an area they felt it might have landed.  At that point even stranger things began to happen.  A spotlight they were using, which plugged into the cigarette lighter, dimmed but did not go out. The seatbelt warning buzzer began sounding intermittently, and the vehicle’s automatic transmission began to act up.  None of these oddities had occurred previously, and to my knowledge none of them have been repeated since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the most chilling aspect of the incident showed up in its aftermath. On John Cruzan’ arm was a sizeable red spot that caused enough discomfort for him to go to a doctor, who told him it resembled an injury caused by a laser. It has since healed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spoke with Mr. Cruzan about his experience earlier this month. Although he did not express it in so many words his attitude was clearly that of knowing the experience was real but also knowing that many people would find it incredible. He was unwavering, however, in the fact that he was simply describing the event as completely and accurately as possible within the limits of human vocabulary. I came away from the visit convinced that he was one of the most credible witnesses I have interviewed in years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clusters of UFO sightings in a limited area within a relatively short period of have occurred on several occasions before, and the diehard skeptics insist that they result from a single case of misidentification receiving publicity and triggering the imagination of others, making them even more prone to turning the lights of distant aircraft into an alien spacecraft. In this instance, however, the witnesses were in almost all cases unaware of the previous incidents prior to having their own encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [Special thanks to John Cruzan, Margie Kay and the rest of the team at Missouri MUFON, and UFO Casebook for providing information used in writing this column.]  (If you have had an encounter with any type of paranormal or unexplained phenomena, no matter where or when it occurred, I would like to add it to my ever-growing files.

At first we thought it was a star low in the sky that we hadn’t noticed but quickly realized it was rising up from behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it cleared the trees we saw a very very large, very bright light almost shaped like a diamond that changed color from white to blue and then pink and purple.  It rose steadily to an unknown altitude and then the light began to fade to a dull white but never completely went away.  At this point it began to move directly toward us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We knew it wasn’t a plane as it had none of the regular blinking lights and we could see two planes in the sky to compare it to.  I currently live just a few miles from an airport and see and hear planes up close at night on a regular basis and I have never seen any that looked like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer we could clearly see one very large round dull white light on the bottom front and two more of the same but half the size next to each other behind the large one.  Next to the smaller round lights were two super small dull white blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved steadily toward us and directly overhead.  It was difficult to tell the size shape or altitude but we could hear a very low hum sound as it passed overhead.  The round lights were huge but not bright at all as we looked up at it.  It moved over the house behind us and then was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe I have seen something similar when I was a teenager living on Cape Cod.<n>

It was moving slowly like a plane that was leaving the Salt Lake airport and heading south.  It also looked like it might be heading east (towards me) as well.  It appeared to be moving, but very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very steady as well. Much like a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was orange and it flickered.  It would alternately look larger and smaller as the orange glow flickered and it looked just like a fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to move slowly and flicker for well over a minute, maybe two minutes.  I watched it for a while and even tried to take pictures and video the resolution is poor on my phone’s camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, after a while, it just winked “out” (quick but not instantly) and then I could barely see it. It now looked like a tiny white dot like a plane that’s very far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The white dot could possibly be a star directly behind where the orange object had been, but it looked like a plane in the distance.<n>

I happened to look up and see the saucer shaped object.  It was neon purple and it was lined with a strip of neon blue in the middle.  It had bright neon pink lights on either side of the craft.  And it both neon lights were only singular on either side and each one flashed one at a time after the other and down on the trees. and then it hovered downwards and was gone behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to run across the street but it was at a far enough distance that I would have never have seen it.  it probably wasn&#39;t even close but I happened to see it at my distance.  I don&#39;t think it actually landed anywhere it just went beneath the tree line where I couldn&#39;t see it anymore and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was flabbergasted at the fact that I was the only 1 outside at the time who could have seen it.  It literally was a bright neon purple saucer and it had blue in the middle and pink interchanging lights on the side and it literally was gone in 3 minutes flat!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cried a little because I was so terrified given that I&#39;ve never believed in these things before and I didn&#39;t want to ever think that this kind of thing could be real, but I was also excited because it was awesome at the same time!!<n>

The objects hovered perfectly still, I stopped my boat and I could not believe what I seeing, I saw one of these crafts make a maneuver  in a hook type move half way around the other objects at a speed that no man made craft could of possibly do, the objects remained absolutely still for another few seconds then they all started moving very very slow and suddenly dissapeared, the dark cloud was still present but with in mins was totally faded and gone the cloud was not black but almost like a dark storm cloud,<n>

A. sightseeing with my husband, when I felt strange and had the sensation that maybe an earthquake was going to take place, and also noticed birds stopped singing.  The trees in the area, which was an empty part of the cemetery with no people and many palms, started to move strangely and bend from the tops as if pulled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt odd.  I took a picture of the palms and then applied a simple vignette filter to the photo in-camera (Canon EOS 60D) and saved it, not noticing the object at all at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards, we went to our car, which was a ten-minute walk away, and found the battery completely dead, to the point we had to buy a new one from AAA to start the engine, and the alarm was going off only when switched off/battery removed, which was impossible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went home, and when I downloaded the photo we saw the object.

I thought it was odd because it was the middle of the day and this thing was extremely bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved rather fast across the sky heading from south to north.  I stood watching it for a few minutes trying to figure out its shape.  The shape seemed to be changing.  After about five minutes of traveling across the sky it stopped and appeared to be getting smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and grabbed some binoculars.  I was able to get a better look at the shape.  It was a semi circle with two prongs coming out the front.  It seemed to be tumbling but every once in a while it would stop tumbling and you get a clear look at the shape.  It was definitely getting smaller-heading away I can only assume.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point a jetliner passed in front of my binocular view, and the object was way farther than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anybody else see this thing?!?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was staring at the spot where it disappeared, a large craft of some kind, with blinking red lights, slowly moved to the left, appearing to hesitate in mid air for brief seconds, then proceed again slowly to the left.  It appeared to possibly be a round craft.  The only lights present were red.  It was very close to the top of the mountain and made no sound.

I looked up and noticed 2 small bright orange orbs which were near each other and kind of floating around.  I estimated their altitude to be maybe around 3000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were kind of hovering near each other and the distance between them increased and decreased and back again intermittently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided I had to have a better look at these things, so I stopped at the St. Bonaventure Church on Mt. Royal Boulevard.  I noticed the orange orbs again almost directly overhead but slightly south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds one orb started moving steadily but not too quickly to the northeast at a bearing of perhaps 60 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second orb started following that orb in that direction, and both orbs moved at identical speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second orb passed behind the clouds a few times before disappearing totally, and it was then that I realized how high it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The clouds were actually somewhat low to begin, but I still estimate the altitude of the orbs to be at several thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly I noticed a third orb identical to the first approaching from the opposite direction to join the first two, and it was slowly cathing up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three orbs quickly disappeared as they flew northeast, probably because of the low clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the orbs glowed, the glow they emitted had an almost &#34;flaming&#34; quality. The orbs didn&#39;t display any of the normal &#34;running lights&#34; that ordinary aircraft do, such as red or green strobes. The orbs simply glowed orange and that was it. I drove around for about 20 minutes trying to see them again but the didn&#39;t appear again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s worth noting that several miles to the south, there was a summer fireworks show taking place, and in fact the orbs did seem to approach from that direction although still quite removed from it. My first thought was that the orbs were embers from pyrotechnic display. After I saw their deliberate straight-line movements I knew this was not the case. I occurred to me that maybe the pyrotechnic display was deliberately being used as a cover for whoever was controlling the orbs. Obviously if someone said they saw a UFO, someone else could say &#34;Oh, there were Fireworks in the next town over that night.&#34; I concede, that much is true. But what I saw was not Fireworks nor burning embers blowing in the breeze. I estimate their speed to have been maybe 200 - 300 mph once they started moving east. Not extreme for many aircraft, but still definately not Fireworks. I&#39;m curious if any other reports will be made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a video with my Android phone of the objects, but the quality is really bad and doesn&#39;t prove anything as far I&#39;m concerned. I will still share upon request, however. I may have heard a very low rumble while witnessing the orbs, but it was not very loud.<n>

I said outloud, &#34;What is that?&#34; While thoughts were processing in my mind, is it a helicopter?  A firework?  My husband said, &#34;What, where?&#34;  I said, &#34;Out there in the sky, what is that?!&#34;  He yelled, &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> He put the four ways on and the truck into park. Another vehicle came up behind us, my husband motioned the guy to go around.  The guy stopped, my husband and I got out of our truck, and said to the guy, &#34;What is that?&#34;  He looked out his passenger window, and said, &#34;I don&#39;t know man, could be a firework.&#34;  Then he drove off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several vehicles came and went, while my husband and I observed.  I grabbed the binoculars and looked, the &#34;thing&#34; was cone shaped with what looked liked fire spinning around it...very slow moving, very orange and very bright.  Resembled the search light of a helicopter, it&#39;s the only example I can logically give.  But I&#39;ve never seen an orange spot light on any aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is bizarre, I gave the binoculars to my husband and he saw the exact same thing.  It definitely appeared to on fire, spinning, very bright orange, and a cone shape.  I don&#39;t know if it appeared as a cone, so much so that it was spinning and the core of it gave off a triangular appearance or what.  It was like nothing we had ever seen.  And the fact that not a single other person gave it any thought, no one else stopped to get out and observe this bizarre sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are clueless, was it a meteor?  No firework would drift or move so slow and burn so bright after explosion.  None that we&#39;d ever seen. It literally went over top of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved on, we got back into the truck and followed it, eventually in minutes in completely disappeared.  We wonder did it burn out?  We will never forget this!<n>

I kept looking for the wings but couldn&#39;t see any. also, the shape was not a perfect pill shape as it sort of curved in a bit in the center, so it was almost the shape of an infinity sign only not as exaggerated in the middle.  i kept trying to see the wings but never saw any. and i kept trying to tell what color it was but it was so bright (white light) that I assumed it was a chrome color reflecting the sun. but it might have been self-lit, i don&#39;t know.  i thought of running into the house to get my camera but i knew i was going to loss sight of it as my apartment faces north and it would be over my porch roof in a matter of seconds. once it got over my roof, i rushed into the apartment, grabbed my camera and rushed to the south window to see if i could shoot it. but it was nowhere in the sky. (my apartment is on the 3rd floor and i should have been able to still see it as it wasn&#39;t moving very fast.) there was no noise. I can&#39;t estimate how high it was or how big it was as I had nothing to compare it to in the sky. there were some light wispy clouds way up high and those weird chemtrails streaking across the sky but other then that it was a clear blue sky. i have seen airplanes go by and even though they are further away and higher, I can make out their wings. this one had no wings that i could see. it did not leave any kind of trail.<n>

There were two people in the vehicle.  We looked over to the right (Southwest) and saw a big bright yellow light that was indistinguishable in shape. It was at approximately 10 degrees above the horizon and looked like a smashed circle.  To its left there were two smaller white lights that we could tell were not stars because they were too big. None of the lights moved, they were all still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After maintaining constant eye contact with the object for approximately two minutes, the yellow light began to shrink and in about ten seconds it looked exactly like the other white lights in shape and color.  Still none of the lights moved.  Within one minute, the previously yellow light (now a small white light) disappeared from the sky in one second.  The other two remained at their positions.  About three minutes later, all of the lights disappeared.  The area of the sky where the lights had been seen remained lit up, for no apparent reason, while the rest of the sky was cloudy and dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five minutes later, the yellow light had shown up again as a small dot in the sky and in about three seconds it expanded into its previously larger size.  The other white lights never showed up again.  As we reached Harrington we went back to the house to grab a camera and we returned to the Highway 28 with two other passengers. We turned left onto the beginning of Scott Road and parked to observe the UFO.  At that point, the light had shrunk again to the size of a small yellow dot of light, and that time it had lowered to approximately 3 degrees above the horizon.  After about two minutes sitting in the car observing the light, it began to expand again, and in about three seconds it had expanded to its larger size to which we had seen before. We attempted to photograph the object but the picture turned out somewhat blurry and distorted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In an attempt to get closer to the light we continued driving on Highway 28 towards Odessa.  The hills blocked our view of the UFO so we decided to drive back to Scott Road and park there again.  There we did not see the big yellow light, but we saw a small yellow pulsing light.  We observed it for about four minutes and determined that it might not have been the same light.  At about 12:49 A.M. we returned home.<n>

I enjoy stargazing &amp; frequently look up while outside at night (my back door faces east) and since the moon is only 1/2 full and low on the horizon, it was dark in the yard &amp; I just used a flashlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moving southwest to northeast in a straight line I was surprised to see what appeared to be a bright red rectangular shaped object with a bright white light in the middle.  The shape was something like a sport skydiver might use, except this rectangular object was moving lengthwise.  I know it wasn&#39;t a helicopter (saw &amp; heard the police chopper flying earlier before &amp; after the fireworks show), it didn&#39;t look like a plane and I never heard any sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved to the front yard to get a longer view of it and saw my neighbor (retired military, worked on helicopters) so I called him over to look at it.  He was as surprised and puzzled as I was.  He didn&#39;t hear anything and saw the same rectangular shape and colors as it was moving away from us.  The object eventually grew dim and disappeared from out sight, the entire episode lasting 1 to 1-1/2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the ISS schedule, but knew I wouldn&#39;t find it listed as flying by.

I checked my star scope app to check for any comets coming by but none.  I was thinking maybe a shooting star but ive never seen one move so slow.<n>

My husband and I had just entered unincorporated San Diego County when from the car we saw an unidentifiable object in the low sky on the east side of the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a cluster of between three to five very bright white lights.  The cluster formed a sort of circle, but it changed formation.  The cluster flew erratically over an area relatively low to the ground—this was an area of undeveloped land for the most part.  It would move around, dip down towards the ground, then move upward very fast, then move around again in a formation, kind of dipping and shooting up and making sudden turns, all fairly low to the ground in ways that no plane or helicopter or other flying thing I know of could do.  Certainly nothing of this size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights on this were incredibly bright.  My husband asked if we should turn around at the 76 exit and go back to try and see it again once we passed it.  I didn’t think I could take a picture of it since it was moving so fast and erratically.  My husband said it must be a drone.  I went home and read about drones and none were described like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is a lawyer and I have a Ph.D. in education.  We have no particular interest in UFO’s.  We did see the hovering amber lights over Orange County from our home in Dana Point earlier this year, but didn’t think to report it.  This sighting was, to me, much more unsettling<n>

It was headed generally North on a meandering trajectory after heading West a few degrees that took about 7 to 10 minutes to cover about 30 degrees of the sky overhead.  It was eventually lost in the high thin clouds blowing off an approaching storm North of my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not a conventional aircraft, no other lighting was visible other than the slow strobe and far too small to be a stray weather balloon.  It is possible it &#34;may&#34; have been a satellite that just lost control, but the meandering path, which did head due west for a few degrees early in it&#39;s trajectory suggests otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No noise, no contrail.  No aircraft in area, and far too high to have been a lightning bug (which display different as well).  Too far away from any fireworks displays to have been a stray cinder.<n>

Four identical and unrecognized lights, amber-red in color and roughly diamond shaped, with the weight of the diamond pointing downward, appeared from the east, on a low approach, less than 90 seconds apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These light configurations, shape, and behaviors were unlike anything either of the observers had previously seen.  The lights were at least three times the height of typical commercial air liner lights relative to the apparent altitude and distance, were only made up of one color, amber-red, and did not have any obvious flashing patterns.  We live less than 3 miles from LEX airport and are very familiar with mundane commercial aircraft, helicopter, and private general aviation light patterns, color, and flight paths in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four diamond lights followed the same flight path.  The flight path approached Lexington from the east-south east and at a low angle over the tree line.  In all four instances, the lights seemed to move slowly over the north-east portion of the city before turning to the due north.  They followed the same accent, flying at an approximate 30 degree angle upward, relative to their approach angle.  All four diamond lights disappeared in succession, 30 seconds apart and in about one third of their approach time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In each case, and at a similar point over the city, a small red flash was seen to drop away from the parent lights.  These occurred in the same fashion with each parent light, with the exception of the last and fourth light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Last and fourth light followed the same path and dropped a similar flash from the parent light and at the same location as the previous three, except, the fourth diamond shape dropped two additional small lights approximately 15 seconds apart for a total of 3 dropped infant lights before turning to the north and disappearing in the same fashion and direction as the previous three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The infant lights from all four sightings had a visible duration of less than two seconds before disappearing from view.  Each infant light was of the same or similar color and brightness as the parent lights, but about one-one hundredth the size.  All infant lights had the same angle of drop which was 90 degrees straight down relative to the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately two minutes after these sightings, a commercial air liner made an approach to the Lexington Airport from the east-southeast.  This approach seemed  unusual, relative to the average airline approach, in that the airliner&#39;s approach was unusually shallow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional high level air traffic was observed for several minutes after, moving north-easterly from the south-west, due east from the west, and north-westerly from the south-east respectively, several minutes after the initial sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both observers are male professionals in their early 50&#39;s and college educated.<n>

7/5/14 22:15|Suwanee|GA|Disk|30 seconds|Was in the car and saw a bright blue and white light following the road at a low alt.|7/11/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/111/S111124.html|665|ndxe201407| Peculiar single light seen coursing to the northeast through broken clouds, for approximately 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday evening, July 5th, 2014, at 22:05 hrs. (measured; + or – 60 seconds) (Pacific Daylight Time), I was seated in a lawn chair on a neighbor’s front yard patio in Harrington, Washington, (Lincoln County), facing generally to the southeast.  Also present on the patio, at the time, were three other adults.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I gazed at the mostly cloud-covered sky (estimated 70-90 percent coverage), I suddenly became aware of a single white light, approximately the size and luminosity of Jupiter or Venus, moving across the sky from my right to left, i.e. to the northeast.  No red navigation light was evident, which would have been the case, had the object been a conventional aircraft flying legally at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few seconds of first sighting the object, I opened my cell phone, and noted the time to be 22:05 hrs. (Pacific Daylight Time).  I called out the time to the other three witnesses present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light immediately caught my attention because of its quite noticeable luminosity, and because of its relatively high (angular) velocity, an estimated 2-4 degrees per second.  I am quite familiar with the appearance of the International Space Station, as it orbits overhead, having witnessed it hundreds of times.  The angular velocity of the light I witnessed was noticeably greater than that of the ISS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was moving from my right to left, moving generally to the north and east.  Because of parallax, I am unable to estimate the object’s ground-track more accurately than to say it appeared to be coursing generally northeast.  It was at approximately 20-30 degrees above the horizontal plane, and it appeared to be moving across the sky approximately parallel to an imaginary horizontal line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light passed in and out of the clouds two or three times during the sighting.  My distinct impression was that the light was “embedded” in the clouds, rather than beyond them (from my view), and that was the same impression that the three other witnesses had.  However, my recollection is that the object did not seem to illuminate to a noticeable degree the clouds when it flew either near, or in, them, although my recollection on this point may be flawed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four of the witnesses watched the object for approximately 8-10 seconds, commenting the whole while on how unusual and incongruous the light appeared to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light entered a cloud, and the four witnesses continued watching that area of the sky, expecting to see it again.  However, it did not re-appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the sighting, the witnesses were located approximately 30-40 miles to the west of both Spokane International Airport and Fairchild AFB, so they all frequently witness both commercial and military aircraft of many types, in the course of a typical day.  The witnesses agreed that the object they had just witnessed was inconsistent with any type of aircraft that they are familiar with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I plan to contact the local National Weather Service office, or FAA Flight Service Station, hoping to be able to obtain the altitude of bases and tops of clouds in the area, for the time and date of the sighting.  That information may allow triangulation, to establish maximum altitude, distance, and velocity of the object, as well as an estimate of its size.  I will append those data to this report, as soon as they are obtained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have held a commercial pilot’s license for almost forty years, and have held an instructor’s rating for ten of those years.  I was raised in an airline family, and I lived with a U. S. Air Force family for one year.  Consequently, I am quite skilled, I believe, in being able to identify most private, commercial, and military types of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My vision, recently tested by an optometrist, is correctable to 20/20, or better, and I have no color perception deficit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a somewhat similar sighting from approximately the same location on October 17, 2011.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS, PETER DAVENPORT, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL UFO REPORTING CENTER))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Data for the altitude of the bases of the clouds was obtained, courtesy of the National Weather Service in Airway Heights, Washington.  They reported that the bases were at between 14,000 and 16,000 feet (above ground level).  Using trigonomentry, assuming the object was at approximately 30 degrees angle of elevation above the horizontal plane, it was approximately 5.7 statute miles in distance from the witnesses.  If it traversed an estimated 30 degrees, then it covered approximately 2.8 statute miles in 8-10 seconds…  These are very approximate numbers, which depend on the accuracy of the measurements taken by the witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

It was several minutes after 10 pm.  My husband was bent over in the street in front of our house, attempting to light the first firework.  My granddaughter and I were gazing up at the sky.  It was a clear night and we were looking at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, we saw a light, about the brightness of a planet, moving overhead.  The object was coming from a southwesterly direction.  At first, we thought it was a plane, but quickly realized that there were no blinking lights and it was moving at an incredible rate of speed; much faster than any plane I have ever seen.  Also, we could not detect any sound coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We quickly called attention to it and my husband stopped what he was doing to watch it with us.  The object was traveling in a northeasterly direction, traversing an arc of about 120 degrees.  We were stunned at the speed with which it traveled, having never seen anything that has ever come close to that speed; not military or civilian jet or satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within about 10 seconds, it disappeared from our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I  are used to watching the sky and have always,up to this point, been able to identify what we have seen.  We had no clue what this object was, however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  All three witnesses to this sighting are well known to NUFORC, and we consider them to be exceptionally capable, and reliable, witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please see similar sighting from Harrington, WA, for approximately the same time.

I apologize for the initial movement, I was attempting to turn my cell phone to the right position.  There was so much occurring, that it was difficult to get the right filming position.  There were anywhere from 15 to 20 spaceships involved in this sighting.  The only way to describe their size was to say that from where I was standing, their height from top to bottom was half the length of the moon.  Their colors would change from bright orange to white and then to a vibrant red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they appeared red, I could see a tall, vertical and massive cylinder-like structure and a bright white V to the right side.  Their movement patterns would begin in a formation, change positions from side to side, hover and then become smaller and vanish.  If you look closely at the top and very bottom of the line-up you will see the first ship disappear before your eyes and another one appear at the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The green flashes of light across the screen are fireflies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the firefly interference and the incredible occurrence before me, I decided to finally stop filming.<n>

The flashing was a long green flash then a quick red flash, it was repeating. before it flew away directly east the red light started to flash wildly or it seemed that way to me.  As it was leaving the red light became 3 small red lights. It looked like 2 rectangles, one on the left and one on the right with 1 small red square in the middle.  The shapes of the lights was very crisp and clear without distortion or halos.

At first, we assumed they were commercial or private aircraft, but it became quickly clear they were not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights, flying in a triangle at perfect synchrony, moved directly towards us.  As the lights moved to within a close distance of our home, it was impossible to see anything OTHER than a light - i.e. we did not notice the outline of any object, even though it appeared as though the aircraft were each flying fairly low to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other odd thing was they were flying in ABSOLUTE silence.  No engine noise, no propeller noise, NOTHING.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Things became especially odd when the &#34;middle&#34; light seemed to &#34;fade&#34; out into nothingness despite nearly no cloud cover during the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quickly thereafter, the front &#34;light&#34; faded out in a similar fashion while the other light continued to move over our house in an easterly direction.

I am certain that this was not any type of firework, as I&#39;ve never seen a firework behave in that manner.  The nearest firework display had been cancelled because of flooding to confirm that it was not a remnant of a firework show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew horizontally across the sky, at a steady, but fast pace. It was too fast to be a plane, and did not dissipate like a firework would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, July 5, my family and I went out on a sunset boat cruise around the lake.  The sunset was spectacular, reflecting against the clouds and as anyone would, we were in awe at the sight.  I was first to notice a strange, almost black sphere floating between some clouds. I pointed it out to my family, and they began to stare with confusion too.  It behaved in the exact same manner as the object the night before, but did not appear to have any visible lights against the intense sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, this object was far too fast to be a plane, didn&#39;t fade or create smoke like a firework, and was far too close to be a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object flew out of sight, and seemingly into the setting sun and surrounding clouds.<n>

Just as suddenly as it appeared, it disappeared into the blue.

I at this point was in another vehicle then the people that I mentioned before.  We were several miles behind them, so they beat us into town.  They turned around and we met in our cars on the main stretch into Harrington.  As we pulled up next to them; they were telling us they saw a UFO a few miles back on highway 28.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we went back on highway 28 towards Davenport to see for ourselves; we turned off onto the beginning of Scott road just barely out of Harrington.  Off to the southwest we saw a yellow light in the sky which appeared to me to be a circle at the time.  It was definitely not a farm light because of its great height in reference to the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we sat there staring at the light we saw, without warning, it expanded in size by a massive amount in under three seconds.  We couldn&#39;t accurately tell how large it was since we had not point of reference to base it upon.  The mood was frantic as everyone was trying to figure out what this possibly could have been.  Could it have been a firework?  No it couldn&#39;t as it was a solid color and last there for nearly twenty seconds in the sky.  Was it a lunar eclipse that was momentarily obscured from cloud coverage.  No; there was no eclipse that night.  And then the light started to shrink very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We headed onto the Odessa highway to see if w! e could get a better look, but the hills were obscuring our view on both sides.  We couldn&#39;t see it at all now. We called in a night at that point and headed home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing I know for sure is that I will never forget the experience I had.  I wasn&#39;t what you would call a skeptic on Alien vessels or other unexplained spacial phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t tell for certain what exactly it was that saw, but I am definitely more open minded about the talk of alien craft now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we consider him to be highly reliable.

It was in the direction southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I met two friends which I was telling about the red light, and some underground knowledge and they then pointed out in the same direction, lights in the sky that look like UFO’s.  I walked up a slope and the two friends followed to get a better view, and they appeared to be coming from the right, so that we could be more able to see them from the trees in front of us.  There were 9 glowing lights, colored white, light yellow, light orange, and then the one red one I saw earlier, the red being the brightest and largest looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red one was the farthest behind coming into view after the white, yellow, orange lights started moving into formations.  Then came the red light from the right, from the tree line, moving more towards the formatting lights.  Once the red one was getting into view and looked more like a V, one by one did the lights disappear, until there was only a few lights flickering, and dissipating, while the red one was moving toward them, in a curve, going up into the sky, then disappeared.  After all this, around 4 am, I had psychological hallucinations, like rainbow fractal crystals and static with lights on the ceiling.<n>

On one of the holes at the course there&#39;s a good hole to view fireworks from.  During the fireworks we noticed 3 orange lights high above where the fireworks were popping.  The three orange lights we&#39;re in a triangle formation until the middle light lined up with the other two lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they all started to move.  From the bottom to the top they slowly started to fade away as they look like they were descending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 to 20 minutes later we noticed one of the orange lights appearing in the horizon .  Shortly after another orange light and then shortly after another. the lights proceed into the sky and slowly faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> after seeing this I looked up UFO sightings on youtube and literally found a video of exactly what I saw, formation and all.  After looking up many UFO sighting I&#39;ve noticed that the ones that are similar to the ones I saw are mostly sited by schools.  My sighting was over Paredes middle school in Austin, Texas.  I just thought it was a very weird coincidence.<n>

From my location looking towards Mount Wilson which is north of me in Baldwin Park, CA, what caught my eye was a bright light I thought it was a shooting star at first but it just got bright almost near the brightest star and it dimmed down.  I thought no that&#39;s not a shooting star, then I thought was it a satellite?  no I continued tracking it it was headed in a straight line towards north east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It got really dim especially cause the light pollution and the smoke from the fireworks but i could still make it out that it was going in a straight line.  What happened that it grew bright again and dimmed, when I continued watching it it continued to go bright and get dimmed, so it would go bright like a star then dim to almost unseen, I even lost it for a bit, but since it continued in a line I could just make out where it should be, but I also noticed that it seems to go farther in the distance.  It just was really weird never seen anything like that. what it did was go bright then dim right away then travel maybe 3 or 4 sec then repeat about 3 times then I lost it then it did it again but lost it cause I guess it either was too far or it flew fast away or just stopped blinking. so at a count of one its bright then one sec dim then 3 or 4 count dimmed. but it was really bright that&#39;s why to me it was a UFO cause I never saw anything like that, it was not a plane cause it had one light and it was really small almost invisible when not lit.  The color was like star light color and bright.<n>

It was like a small fire in the sky.  It was not a firework.  It just hovered there above the tree line about a mile away.  I dismissed it because we had just watched the firework display in Kirkwood Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove home to Cottleville, Missouri, and walked out to my back yard around 11:15 and I saw 13 objects in the sky exactly like the one I saw in Kirkwood except these were moving slowly West at about the speed of a hot air balloon.  There was no noise.  They were all in a staggered formation at the same speed and remained equidistant from each other the entire time.  A single object lagged behind the main group but didn&#39;t seem desperate to &#34;catch up&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then 3 more appeared in a perfect triangle formation when they passed by and stayed that way until they disappeared.  It looked clear in the middle of the triangle...so I&#39;m confident it was 3 individual lights not connected to each other in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked for an outline around each object such as a parachute or balloon but I couldn&#39;t see any thing attached.  The objects&#39; altitude remained constant until they disappeared in the distance.  It seemed like they slowly flickered out but I&#39;m not sure...maybe they just faded into the distance.  I can&#39;t imagine hot air balloons floating in the sky that late at night during a time when people are lighting off big fireworks in the neighborhood. Seems idiotic to me… And why did I see one earlier all the way southeast of where I was in Kirkwood just an hour earlier?<n> <n><n> <n><n> So strange.  It was eerie and confusing.<n>

Around 10:00 p.m. my sister and I watched an orangish-red light in the SW sky move slowly away from us in an upward trajectory.  It had no blinking strobes that would have identified it as an aircraft. We forgot about it and around 11:00 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside to watch and listen to fireworks, and a live rock concert taking place across a neighboring field when I noticed a semi-bright white light low in the southern sky over the Bellingham Bay - Lummi Island area.  I was thinking that it looked like the moon behind clouds... the sky was about 95% overcast with small open holes where I could see some stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light slowly turned in a westerly direction changing from white to the bright orangish-red color.  I got my binoculars and my sister and when we looked for it again it was behind a clump of trees but we could still see it intermittently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it completely re-emerged there were two of them! moving slowly and appearing to be connected in some way.  One appeared to be following and catching up to the other light -- or they were two lights connected to a moving craft, that appeared to get closer together as the object rotated and moved away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt that there was no way that two aircraft would be flying that close together at night.  They did what the earlier light did, slowly moving away from us in an upward trajectory in the SW sky and then blinked out or disappeared into the cloudcover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting lasted for about 4 minutes in total.  In between songs at the concert and fireworks we noticed that the lights made no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 - 20 minutes after the sighting a commercial airliner went through the same area of sky as the lights and it had the obvious bright white nose light and strobing lights along with its jet engine sound.<n>

The evening was a very clear sky (no Chem Trails) and a half moon was just rising above the horizon.  The temperature was about 75 degrees and slowly dropping- as it does out in the township.  I happened to glance to the east, seeing a bright light in the sky. At first, I thought it was a firework display.  The object was at least 200 feet above the tree line that is 200 yards away from where I was standing, was fire orange/red, very large, and held a definite course.  The object moved faster than any aircraft I have ever seen as well as being the largest I have ever seen within a short distance to the tree line.  It appeared to be oval, but because of its brightness, I could not discern a distinct shape.  The first object appeared at about 11:00 pm while the neighbors were lighting off small fireworks (like bottle rockets and Roman candles). It seems everyone noticed the craft and all fireworks in the area ceased. The craft came from the west and moved towards the east. My speculation is that is it came from Cleveland towards Pittsburgh. The craft was moving faster than an airplane but slower than a meteor. It appeared to be a huge ball of flame in the sky but had a clear flight path. The object moved out of range in about 2-3 minutes. We called everyone we could; many had seen the same craft. The object made NO sound. About 10 minutes later, the same event occurred again. The flight path was exactly the same, the same height, direction, and duration. I have never seen an object in the sky that was this large, even a blimp would pale in comparison. As it was dark, I cannot provide a good estimate of its size ~ (This object would be about the size of 7 blimps- all fire orange).<n>

They moved slowly like a plane but appeared much brighter than a plane.  Typically planes come from much further away and the flight pattern from Paine Field is towards the house, perpendicular to these light&#39;s pattern.  I kept trying to adjust my eyes and decide if it was the smoke from the fireworks that made them appear so close and bright.  Also, more lights continued to rise up from behind the hill, two more and finally one last one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was when I began to video record with my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved across the same path as the previous lights and eventually faded into the horizon.  I did not assert that they were UFO&#39;s until I saw the reports on this website.<n>

We noticed two &#34;airplanes&#34; in the distance flying in formation, we thought they were watching the fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we noticed they didn&#39;t fly like planes and they were glowing orange instead of red/green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About then there were three more coming out of the southwest.  The first two gained altitude and headed south and disappeared in the overcast.  We noticed them at about 600 to 1000 ft altitude they appeared to our best estimate 50 to 60ft in diameter.  My estimate of distance was about a mile to 2 miles out from the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got out binoculars and a camera.  The video is pathetic but, captured.  We had one then come out of the west towards the house at about 500ft up.  I then took the binoculars and got a pretty good view of the saucer shape with an orange light of varying brightness on one side rotating on the axis of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it joined up with the others to the south and disappea! red, either two came back or two more showed up at the south end of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights dimmed and disappeared.

We watched it slowly cross above and it flashed a very bright flash again.  It did this only twice and began to fade away into the big dipper (south to north).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, there was another trailing behind it.  Again it looked like a satellite on a straight course.  While watching this one it suddenly JUMPED ahead and caught up with the other one covering a vast space in the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then there was a third, then a fourth, then a fifth, then a sixth, in succession, spread out with many miles beteween them and all traveling south to north in the same line.  At times they stopped and displayed a bright &#34;light&#34; ray coming out of them in a search-like mode.  The light moved around.  It didn&#39;t just flash once.<n>

I only looked up because of the expression of the officer&#39;s face in disbelief as too what he was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s what caught my attention.  we did not pull over but I stuck my head out the window and saw that the Sphere began to go straight up and disappeared<n>

I know because of this, what we witnessed could be easily dismissed.  But the sightings were spread over the Hillsboro area, and uniform in appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw red lights stationary in the sky.  There was no distinguishable form other than the lights.  I first saw three of these lights in the north, each at different altitudes from our perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They faded from view, only to have two more float up from above the horizon (tree line and surrounding rooftops) into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights quickly blinked out. I thought these probably were lanterns, the kind with little candles in them.  But then I observed two more lights in the south, already very high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was a vibrant ruby color, not likely candle lit.  They had a slow pulsating light that very in intensity.  These lights were only visible for a few minutes before they faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no noise.  The moved like they were floating.  If it were two or three objects like these I would dismiss them.  But there were seven that I witnessed in two different directions, roughly five miles from where I viewed them.  Really unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like it before.<n>

Through my window the solid reddish orange light seemed to have a 5 pointed star shape.  The craft traveled a steady speed.  There were no blinking lights, just a solid color.  It wasn&#39;t a normal light so I watched it travel from the NW to the SE but as it approached the SE horizon the lights turned off and the craft went dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then witnessed three other identical crafts traveling the same speed and flight path aprox 20 second to 40 seconds apart.  As one would come close to the SE horizon and go dark the next would appear in the NW horizon.  It was difficult to judge altitude, but I would say they were traveling higher than typical helicopters but much lower than commercial jets.  We are close to a small airport where single prop planes are constantly in the sky and we are also in the flight path of a regular helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These was no noise to suggest either of these types of crafts.  Along with the lack of noise, the coloration, speed, flight path, and number of craft ruled out these possibilities.<n>

To the north of us there was someone setting off a lot of fireworks.  I saw these two red lights that I assumed were a plane.  They would flash green for a few seconds then back to red.  The only thing that made me think it was not a  plane was that it stood still.  I asked my husband if he saw it.   He assumed as well it was a plane because it started to move, but then stopped and hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the object started moving the lights stopped flashing to green and stayed a constant red.  We stood there and watched it for 10 min just hovering in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize this could have been a helicopter, it moved and hovered like one, but the lights didn&#39;t flash.  They stayed a consistent red.  After ten min it moved to the east and out of site.<n>

The river was to my left, and the town was to my right.  There were many fireworks displays up and down the river and many planes over the river, both large commercial jets at higher altitudes as well as many small private planes at lower altitudes.  There were 8 people in our group, including small kids, and as many as 100 people lining the streets near the building where I was watching from.  The Tarrytown Fire Department had many members present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:51 pm, as there was a pause in the show in preparation for the “Grand Finale,” I happened to glance at the sky to my right, away from the river.  I saw a bright blue light streaking across the sky at low altitude, perhaps a few hundred feet up.  It seemed destined to streak into the river until it skidded to a halt and jumped back away from the river, taking a stationary position near the shoreline.  The movement of the object instantly struck me as bizarre, as it covered an incredible amount of distance in a few seconds and made a sharp 180 degree move.  It also seemed to disappear for a few instants, or “skip” as it moved into position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took out my cell phone and took one photo and a 1 minute 47 second video.  Even though the fireworks finale was going on behind me I couldn’t take my eyes off the object.  It was an extremely bright blue light, it appeared to be round or orb shaped, and perhaps 5 to 10 feet in diameter, though the exact size was hard to tell.  When the fi! reworks display ended the object instantly vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few others in my party saw the object after it moved into its stationary position, but nobody saw it move into position but me.  It was unclear to all of us what it might be.  I do not know if anyone on the ground saw it although I am pretty sure I saw members of the Tarrytown Fire Department pointing at the object.<n>

No more than 8 minutes or so later two bright red lights were slowly traveling from west to east overhead side by side in formation. One slowed some but stayed up with the other.  This lasted for three or so minutes overhead then they changed direction toward the northeast and faded into nothing.  No sound as I tried hard to listen, nothing. Weather - High clouds, no open sky of stars and good visibility.  Faint light from the setting sun in the west. Winds around 5-6 mph.

There were planes flying in the area and were obviouis that they were planes with proper lighting. I heard them mention the lights but paid no attention as I was watching the firework display. My wife said is that an airplane what is it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So about 22:30 we left the gathering and headed home.  When we got to the intersection of HWY 30 and Summit Rd in Fenton, my wife said there it is again.  She was driving and I rolled down the window and hung out looking directly up in the sky.  There were light high clouds and this object was above those clouds I would say 10,000 feet maybe a maximum of 15,000 feet.  It was huge according to the light patterns.  There were 7 lights in a long row, with 2 lights centered just opposite the long row of lights.  I would guess this craft was at least 6 or 7 football fields long maybe more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought why would there be 9 helicopters grouped like that flying in constant formation.  Shortly after that I realized it was one large object moving slowing above the clouds.  I told my wife Holy Crap that is a giant UFO!  It is moving in sync.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife tried to take a picture of it but the street lights were blinding out the camera when she held it up.  Just about that time all 7 lights switched off and then there was only two lights and then one of those switched off.  At this time traffic lights had changed and we had to go because of traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The more I thought about it the more I suspected we had just seen a huge craft of some sort.  The craft made no noise all I heard was the car engine running.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now fast forward to July 10th.  On the news channel here in St. Louis they ran a piece showing the lights in the sky and a guy talking about them.  He had gotten them on a video loop and sure enough it was the same configuration of lights stretched out on the horizon.  This craft is huge and it has been seen several times over the St. Louis Metropolitan area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you look into reports filed at local TV stations you may be able to get the video.  That video has on it exactly what we say above us July 4th.<n>

Approx 10 minutes later it appeared moving in the sky again, this time my wife noticed it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in our pool about 15 minutes later and noticed 2 orange lights coming directly towards us and went directly overhead.  They were orange, kind of oval to tear drop shaped, one right behind the other (maybe 200- 300 feet behind the other)  No other lights, they were not pulsating (not Chinese lanterns) and most importantly NO sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx 5 minutes later a third light went directly over us the same as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I saw two more objects off in the distance.  That was the last we saw of these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m new to the area so I’m guessing the came from the Northeast heading to the Southwest, moving quickly but not extremely fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Visible each time for a minute to a minute and a half before we lost sight of them.<n>

When it reached the altitude that it would have exploded at it did no do so.  As I observed it progressed from W NW to SE, at about a 60 - 70 deg. angle from my vantage point, across the southern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it reached a point approx. &#34;half-way&#34; between the western and eastern skies it turned due south and at which point I was viewing it from the rear,and continued on until it faded from view.  The speed at which it covered the distance from the western horizon to the point of its turning south was about 40 seconds, which is why I thought it was perhaps a military jet on afterburner.  However, that seemed odd as there was no sound, even after it had made the turn to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other odd part was that a jet, which I assume had taken of from Detroit Metro, was heading south and made a slight heading alteration to the southwest so as to not cross the flight path of the object I was viewing.  I DID hear the sound from the passenger jet, though it was faint. I would guess the altitude of the passenger jet at about 20,000 ft +/-, and that of the object to be quite a bit higher, maybe 30,000-35,000 ft.  I did get photos of the object, but they show only an orange / yellow light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this was coming to an end and I was thinking I had just seen some type of military aircraft, I was turning my attention back to the fireworks when to my amazement two more of the exact type of lights rose up from the western horizon, one directs behind the other, though separated by what I would estimate to be one to two miles, though in a straight line.  I took several photos of these two objects, though they are not very detailed beyond showing orange/yellow lights, one trailing behind the other.  Again, these two objects traveled from W NW to SE, at the same angle in the sky from my vantage point, and upon reaching the same &#34;mid-way&#34; point turned due south, and continued until out of range for me to see.  I thought perhaps they were military aircraft that had taken part in some type of July 4th event, and were heading to the air national guard base in Toledo.  However, as I am in the flight path for planes leaving Detroit Metro, and can watch the aircraft in-bo! und to Metro cross from West to NE along the western horizon from my property, I&#39;m familiar with the headings aircraft generally take / use, either in-bound to Metro, or out-bound from Metro, as well as those heading from other points toward Toledo Express airport west of Toledo Ohio, about 30 miles to the Southwest.  These objects did not use any flight path I&#39;ve ever seen other aircraft take, nor did they appear to be on any heading I&#39;ve ever seen other aircraft that over-fly Monroe take.  Again, COMPLETE silence as these lights passed over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the other two fade from sight, I turned back to the west to see if any more were forthcoming.  As I did so a neighbor to the east put off a couple of fireworks which caught my attention.  As I turned to watch the treeline to the east I noticed a fourth orange light traversing from the north to the south, within 25 deg. of being directly over-head, again, moving at high speed, as a jet on afterburner would, minus the noise.  It made a slight course correction and proceeded to the same point the others had, and continued on until it faded from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, nothing.  I&#39;ve been doing photography since I was sixteen, I&#39;ve photographed the craters on the moon, planes and stars at night, and just about everything else I can photograph.  I&#39;ve studied just about every plane type, and researched &#34;ufos&#34; enough to know that the vast majority are man made aircraft of one type or another, be they experimental, military, drones, satellites, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw last night were not &#34;space aliens&#34;.  They were man made craft, of that I am certain.  But, what type, I don&#39;t know.  They were very fast and used some type of dampening system to mask the engine sound on afterburner.   Where they were going in such a hurry and the fact that obviously other people have been seeing the same type of aircraft in this region and along the upper mid-west over the past couple of weeks is also interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other thing is the fact that the passenger jet altered its heading so as not to intersect that of the first object I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That al! so tells me these objects were most likely some sort of military craft. my question would be, why all this activity in this region ?<n>

We did this in order to ease her panic about the noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We suddenly looked up in the eastern sky and saw two crafts emerge from behind a tall tree which appeared to us like small airplanes with several red/orange lights in a parallel formation to the ground on each craft.  We did not hear any aircraft noise, as we were familiar with small aircraft noise due to my neighbor building and flying his own planes – sometimes coming over our houses in the neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After these two emerged, they traveled southwest and went behind another tree.  They appeared to be flying fairly low, at about the same height and speed of a small aircraft.  Then two more emerged, flying in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say that at least 8 appeared (in pairs) coming from behind the trees and flew in the same direction as the others, but as they flew on, they appeared to rise some and disappeared before our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time, we looked back at the first tree, and they were still coming, sometimes alone and sometimes in twos.  When they flew in twos, one flew directly over the other craft.  We watched as they all flew to the southwest and disappeared before our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend on facebook said they saw the red lights as well while they were outside with their family in another part of town.

The light was so bright that it surrounded the entire craft.  I was not able to see any shape of the craft because the light was so bright so I am going to say it was a sphere.  It did not flash, it was a static light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was relatively high up in the sky, but still below the cloud line.  It flew straight across from the right all the way past our front yard and off to the left.  Because of the height I did not hear any sound, but I still found that a bit odd because other craft around that altitude usually make some sort of noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft would pivot slightly to the left and right.  Sort of like a boat in rough seas.  Do not mistake this for the normal &#34;zipping across the sky&#34;  this looked more like wind was effecting it because it was moving at a relatively slow speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other lights other than the red.  No white lights, no strobes, etc...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having said that, I have to take an educated approach to this sighting.  Even though I might belive in something like this, there is always a possibility that there is a simple explination to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself, well the slow speed and subtle pivoting, and bright red light... it could have been a helicopter.  But not a commercial one because of the bright red light, so then maybe a military helicopter.  But the fact that the light was so bright and no other strobing lights were on it, and there was no sound I am having a hard time accepting my own answer to this.  I have seen other military helicopters in the area and they are extremely loud.  And just to rule it out, it was moving way too fast to be a hot air balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live near a small airfield (Bowman Field) and I see aircraft all the time, and am quite familiar with the lights on crafts.

I turned to my left and saw a round, glowing, orange/red object in the sky.  It was west of us, and low enough to the ground that I could make out the shape, but still far enough away that much detail was yet to be seen.  I immediately begin to think of what it could be, but the shape, color, and behavior was nothing I have ever seen on any flying object that I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object began to pulsate more rapidly and moving at a high rate of speed, faster than any plane I have witnessed. The object began to move south, and suddenly it stopped in mid air for a good half a minute or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it began to speed away, going southwest, and disappearing within a few seconds. I could not believe what I just saw; I am a paranormal investigator with a background in Sociology, and consider myself open minded but very skeptical.  I have read about alien ! and UFO encounters, but never witnessed anything of the sort, so I always wondered about the legitimacy of such claims.  But after tonight, I am a bit more a believer, especially after digging online and finding that reports of UFO encounters in Chicago around the 4th of July are anything but uncommon.  It helps too that my old neighbors down the street saw the same object last year!<n>

We had channel 7 news on as well in case things weren&#39;t as visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glowing moon and the effects of the clouds running across it caught my attention.  I told my boyfriend to look as well.  Not too long after that perhaps less than 2 minutes later.  I could no longer see the striped-bands of clouds illuminated over the moon as I just did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the entire moon (which was in crescent form btw) was encased in what looked like a large yellow glowing...light I guess.  As if the little crescent was in the center of this perfect glowing yellow/amber hue/glow/light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then from what looked like the bottom tip/point of the moon, directly under the bottom point in the moon, and this yellow glow around the moon was still apparent and actually blocked a little of the vision of where this &#34;debris&#34; came from---but anyway<n> <n><n> <n><n> From this area in the sky, and out of nowhere it seemed, fell these flaming large objects.  It started as a huge mass and I didn&#39;t know whether I was watching a meteor, something on fire in the sky falling or what?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, this mass broke off into what looked like 2 fragments but could well have been more...could only see this initial fiery breaking down of whatever was falling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after the breaking down, just like some normal thing in flames, it went out, and I feel I could tell for only a second that when the flames went out there was still an object in free fall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I had been talking to one another the whole time.  He saw everything as well, and it truly perplexed us!  Main firework show had not begun, a lot of air traffic out there in the skies, which kept my boyfriend and I checking out the different aircrafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked to the TV for any explanation...where we saw in text under the news reporters that sky divers were falling.  Which I thought was odd and rather dangerous, but kind of bought it and put my guard down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked dramatically for anything similar to that all night.  Nothing matched what I saw.  And I was outside for awhile.  Various fireworks and cannons and aircrafts could not be substituted for the large mass descending completely on fire.<n>

We were seated on the grassy area outside Dublin Coffman High School stadium.  The fireworks began about 10PM.  I was in a lawn chair beside a mother and her adult daughter who was sitting on a blanket in front of us.  The night was cool, clear, with just enough breeze to move the smoke from the fireworks away.  The moon was out and between 1/4 to 1/2 full.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Midway through the fireworks, I heard the mother beside me saying &#34;What IS that?&#34;  She directed my attention behind me.  I had to turn around in my seat, so the object was almost due West, beneath the moon but well above roof and treetop level.  The dimension from our vantage point would be roughly in the aspirin-size range, maybe a little larger.  It was a length-wise oval (wider than it was high), apparently solid object.  It was absolutely stationary--no perceptible movement at all.  There were no blinking lights or color changing occurring.  The entire object was glowing an orange shade that to me, was pumpkin-colored.  There was, however, smoke residue of the fireworks in the air, so that may have affected correct perception of the exact shade.  There may have been a slight haze around the object, but again that is questionable because it could have been smoke.  The level of the object, however, was high enough above most smoke that it was not substantially ob! scured--we could see it distinctly.  It was not a fireball, as there were solid edges to it.  Also, I have seen one fireball--they move.  Fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of the group there, I only definitely know the mother and her daughter and myself saw the object.  Others were preoccupied with the fireworks.  And somehow, I was remarkably nonchalant about seeing it, and did not process it as a big event.  The object remained there over a period of a couple minutes, at least, while we calmly dissected what it could and could not be, and how it had no characteristics in common with planes or helicopters in flight, etc.  We were alternately looking at it and turning away to speak to each other (and, on my part, to even glance at the fireworks I was &#34;missing&#34;).  During one of these times when we were turned away, it vanished.  We looked back and there was no sign of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of the possible explanations, it was absolutely not a plane or helicopter.  I KNOW what they look like in various orientations and stages of flight (have lived near airports and heliports and seen countless numbers).  We occasionally have blimps (Goodyear, whoever) and hot air balloons in town.  This did not look like any I&#39;ve seen.  Further, if one has ever watched a blimp or hot air balloon fly away:  paint dries faster.  They do not disappear in a matter of moments.  Mylar balloons are metallic-looking and reflective--this object glowed, seemingly from within, more like a light bulb.  Also, any balloon or Chinese lantern--which I&#39;ve seen suggested on someone&#39;s video of a similar object--would surely have been buffeted about by the breeze and unable to remain absolutely motionless for minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers were a 31-year-old mother who works in child care, her mother who works with children and adults in performance arts, and myself, 68, retired with background as a medical and legal secretary, and work in graphic design.  I will add that I have also had a lifelong passion for photography, had my camera in a tote at my feet, and am dumbfounded in seeking to explain why it never entered my mind to take a picture or video.  I didn&#39;t even process the object as what it was, until it was gone and the mother said &#34;We&#39;ve seen a UFO!&#34;  I think it was just a little too real, and too curiously out-of-place in such a mundane setting, for me to process its significance.<n>

It seemed to drift slowly towards the South and towards the horizon, although total distance was only a few degrees.  Motion only noticed over time, it was too slow to actually see it moving.  On a clock face, motion was in the 4 o&#39;clock direction.  Faded slightly during sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching it, then the fireworks, sad I didn&#39;t have binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fireworks finale began and I watched that.  When that was over, I looked again and the object was completely gone.<n>

Back of home faces due Northeast towards a tall tree forested area.  Western side of Green Lane Reservoir lies on the other side (north) of this tall tree forested area.    Site map layout can be e-mailed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event began around 10:05 PM EDT.  Skies were dark and clear, highly transparent - many stars visible.  All local area fireworks shows had concluded about 20 minutes prior.  No activity at all.   We were all cleaning and packing up from family holiday get together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college graduate and IT Professional and have been an amateur astronomer for over 50 years.  Very familiar with night sky, celestial objects, stars, planets, constellations, cardinal directions, etc.  Never saw anything like this phenomenon before.  The others, with various educated backgrounds in nursing, health care, accounting and plumbing concurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was admiring the stars and the clear dark skies to the North, when I caught a glimpse of a brightly lit orange colored orb like object rising up through the tall trees in the sky but from behind the tall tree line to the far rear of the property.  I pointed it out to everyone else present at the time.  This orange colored orb like object then rose up to about 10 degrees above this rear tall tree line and then followed it straight like an arrow due East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate the apparent visual magnitude of this object to be -3 to -5. Similar in range to the planet Jupiter or Venus at maximum brightness.  But, clearly orange and orb like not like a white or blue white pin point star or planet I am familiar with.  Some minor light pulsations were noted as it traversed along its path.  Absolutely no sounds were heard. No red or green aircraft marker lights or aircraft landing lights on the object.  No other discernable features. No smoke or contrails either.  Traversed its path North to East covering about 90 degrees of sky in about 20-30 seconds. Hard to tell in darkness, but estimated the altitude of the object to be less than 10,000 feet, somewhere in range of between 1000 and 5000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all very puzzled and awestruck by this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, shockingly, 3 (three) more identical objects rose up and followed in succession along the exact same flight path North to East.  Exact same characteristics.  Color, brightness, some pulsation, no sounds, no marker lights, no smoke or contrails etc.  These subsequent trailing orange colored orb objects appeared to follow each other along same path in about 20 second intervals from the first one across the northeast sky like a string of bright orange beads.  The new ones would appear and follow while the previous ones were disappearing into the eastern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All 7 witnesses experienced this spectacle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We managed to get a snapshot through one of our smart phones of the last of the objects. Different resolutions could be provided via e-mail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other points of note.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.	  Definitely not meteors – seen them, know them, no arcing, trails or contrails evident.  And, much too large and orb like given proximity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.	  The Planets Mars &amp; Saturn were clearly identifiable and visible on the opposite side of the sky along the ecliptic (South-Southwest) from this event.  Mars in Virgo near Spica and Saturn near center of Libra.  Half moon also in Leo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  	Two separate commercial aircraft with flashing marker lights were observed traveling East to West much higher in the sky (30,000+ feet) near the zenith during the course of the event as it was unfolding.  Presumably these were aircraft out of the New York Area going cross country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.	  Can probably rule out prankster candle balloons or gas lit bags because the objects did not deviate at all along the flight path – there was no undulating or sine wave motions.  And, much too bright for just a meager internal light source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.	  The fight path of the objects took them right near the star Deneb in the rising constellation of Cygnus in the Northeast sky.<n>

Although we couldn&#39;t gauge the distance, we got the impression that it moved very quickly -- faster than a commercial jet.  It stayed in the sky far too long to be a firework, and showed no signs of rising or falling, as fireworks normally do.  We saw the object appear, then disappear, three times.  Each time, it was visible for 5-10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We couldn&#39;t hear any sound from the object, although of course it was difficult to tell with the fireworks going off.  The object did not appear to have any blinking lights of the kind that planes have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of the four witnesses report that the same object has been seen in three previous summers from this same location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular instance, we also saw a translucent bubble shape moving across the sky, near the yellow light.  That shape seemed closer, however, and it may have been associated with the fireworks.<n>

First we thought it was a flare but it was much higher than a marine flare would be.  Some one speculated it could be space debris.  As it streaked downward 2 fiery tails came straight down and appeared to burn out before reaching the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later we noted a fiery orange object high in the sky sky to the west.  It hovered at the same height for 1-2 minutes and then flew to the south at a constant height.<n> <n><n> It no longer appeared fiery as it disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello, Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listened to your appearance on the Jeff Rense program when you had guests on who saw the events before the Seattle fireworks on July 4, 2014.  My report is the one above.  I live in the Eastlake neighborhood, of Seattle, 1-1/2 blocks from Lake Union, in a condo.  We have a roof deck above the 3rd floor of the condo where we watch the fireworks every 4th of July.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of your guests seemed to think there was something ominous about the military helicopter carrying the American flag.  That has been a part of the Lake Union fireworks show for about 26 years, as long as I’ve lived on the east shore of Lake Union.  When they first started the show years ago they had searchlights all around the lake to track the helicopter with flag.  But as budgets grew smaller, they went to the military helicopter with a light on the flag, which does not show off the flag as well as the searchlights did.  The helicopter always comes from the north, flies over Gas Works Park (where there is a big daylong event), and then flies around the lake shore before going back north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I made the above report, I looked online to see if there were any reports about the events I saw.  The first object I saw was a white light streaking, like a shooting star or meteor.  But it suddenly broke into 2 tails that went directly down to the water.  Online I found information that skydivers were supposed to jump into the lake, wearing sparklers on their feet, and the promotional material said it would look like a meteor.  I could not find any news items that said the skydivers completed that dive, although I know skydivers landed at Gas Works Park in an earlier skydive as planned.  I don’t know if that is the explanation for what I saw. I find it hard to believe that sparklers could be that bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other object I saw was a fiery, flaming thing. It was orange-red, like when you see a car burst into flames in the movies, as if fueled by gasoline or other accelerant. First I thought it might be a sky lantern, because I frequently see sky lanterns launched from that area - North Queen Anne Hill, in the vicinity of the Lake Washington Ship Canal.  But the flames were so big and bright I did not think a sky lantern could have that much fuel. My next thought was it could be an aircraft on fire, but then it would have crashed. Instead, the flames disappeared.  Then from that location in the sky I saw a steady blue light moving across the sky, I estimate at the same height an airliner at cruising altitude would be, and in about the same location as I often see aircraft.  But the light was steady blue, not flashing, and no other lights were visible.  This light maintained a constant speed from north to south (as I looked toward the west), and I saw it go behind a cloud and then reappear until it disappeared from my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here’s what I found on one online description of the skydivers:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Skydivers<n> <n><n> If you&#39;re going to Gasworks Park for the 4th of July celebration, fireworks won&#39;t be the only things in the sky you&#39;ll be seeing.<n> <n><n> Skydivers from Shelton company Skydive Kapowsin will be jumping into the Gasworks Park area twice as part of the fireworks show. The first jump will be into the Gasworks Park crowd at 7:30 p.m., while the second jump at 10:10 p.m. will be into the water at Lake Union.<n> <n><n> The second jump will feature skydivers wearing wingsuits with lights on them, so look for their bright lights to be screeching across Lake Union.<n> <n><n> ____________________________________________________________________________________<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not sure if this makes things more clear or more confusing, but I realized I hadn’t mentioned the blue light before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks,<n>

I could also see that it was hovering. I zoomed in with my binoculars and I could see three lights - red, yellow and orange. The lights were flashing from right to left.  They also had a luminescence not typical for the usual aircraft I might see in the sky.  I had seen several helicopters overhead so I suspected I could be mistaking this hovering craft.  Once zoomed in through my binoculars it did not look like a helicopter.  I could see the outline of the helicopters when zoomed in on them. I was not able to see any detail aside from the lights on this craft.  I ran to grab my camera and zoomed in to capture it as the light turned southward and vanished instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following morning my thirteen year old son returned home from spending the night with friends and wanted to show me some unusual photos he had taken while situated to watch the fireworks. He had been on the west side of the city, on top of a hillside looking down toward the lake, and had a straight on view of these strange lights in the sky. From his vantage point there were three of these bright lights forming a triangle shape, without any lines or visible material in between these lights. He snapped two very clear photographs of the lights. He noticed they moved formation, not remaining in this triangle shape before they all disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I posted these photos to my Facebook page on July 5th. The only comment made in response was from his Aunt who was at yet another part of the city, closer down toward the lake from where he and I both were during this time. She had also seen these lights and suspected they were of UFO nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I have seen on one other UFO reporting sight as of today, July 6th, 2014 - there has been one other report of this sighting in Seattle.  It sounds like he was on the same hill as my son and reported a very similar description.)<n>

Objects|7/5/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/110/S110952.html|842|ndxe201407| Seven red-orange lantern-like orbs, 5 initially in V-formation, hovered over O&#39;Fallon MO after 10:00 p.m. July 4, 2014.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10:00 p.m. on July 4, 2014, I stepped outside, facing west in general, to observe the small fireworks my neighbors were setting off.  When I looked up, though, what I saw was far more interesting than any fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 50 years old, college educated, and a former UFO skeptic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my 85 year-old mother to witness as well; we both watched over the course of about 20 minutes.  Initially, we saw 5 orange-red objects arranged in a V-configuration in the area of the sky as we looked toward the Big Dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They hovered and moved very slowly, moving independent of each other.  They maintained a steady orange-red circular glow at the bottom of the objects, and the objects themselves were dark but their base and outline seemed almost lantern-like in shape and appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I chose the description &#34;teardrop&#34; to most closely describe what I saw, but again, they seemed somewhat lantern-like, tapering more narrow toward the top.  These objects seemed to be observing the activities below them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 minutes, they moved off from each other, first very slowly and almost imperceptibly, then one by one ascended toward the northwest horizon and eventually disappeared as a pin-dot at what seemed to be a very high altitude in the atmosphere.  They each seemed to accelerate rapidly as they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes after this first sighting, another such object approached at a fairly low altitude (perhaps 500 ft. to 1000 ft.) from the southeast, traveling very slowly.  It moved to where we were looking toward the northwest, then hovered for about a minute or two.  It followed a curved trajectory as it slowly moved to the southwest horizon, paused, then ascended rather rapidly and accelerated away to the northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft seemed to have a very thin white ring surrounding it, barely perceptible, and almost translucent in appearance.  It maintained this white ring as it noiselessly accelerated toward the nort! hwest as the other objects had done.  I must emphasize that all of these objects moved absolutely noiselessly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, about 5 minutes after that object, the last object appeared overhead, this time approaching from the northeast, and headed westward, before slowing to a hover.  Then it seemed to drop in altitude and come toward us (our neighborhood, anyway), as if to be coming lower for a closer look at the activity and at us; I would estimate it was no higher than 500 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, the street lamp across the street lost power, although its power was restored about 5 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother became frightened and implored me to retreat into the house, as she had a sense it was coming right at me.  It seemed that way to me too, but I did not feel frightened, but was far more curious.  It loitered about 20 or 30 seconds, then moved away toward the northwest and high altitude, as the others had done.  It also had the interesting white translucent &#34;ring&#34; around it that remained steady as it moved off, which struck me as being so! me manifestation of a self-contained energy field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to get pictures of these objects but unfortunately I was unsuccessful (cheap cameras and background light were probably at fault).  As of 10:23 p.m., that seemed to be the end of the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also relevant is that the meteorological conditions included a clear sky, occasional breeze 0-5 mph, no rain, and a temperature around 74 degrees F; all was calm weather-wise.<n>

They then appeared to play and moved around in the back yard, and I noticed at the same time there was the cluster in the tree in a similar spot, and height as last night.  The small balls of light also came by the window and flashed.  It seemed as though they were watching and observing me.  Then they just disappeared, orbs and cluster in trees.<n>

We joked their on a field trip to observe our bizarre rituals lol boyfiend went out to the front of our building to see if they went over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the last one go to where the others disappeared and im not even kinding it just blinked once then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best 4th ever.

It was apparent that the ball was further from us than the plane and the ball was making a sweeping turn to the north following Interstate 95.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to observe the object as it faded out of view due to tall trees and low clouds obscuring our view.

Overhead, he and I picked up on at least 4 red/gold (perhaps orange) lit-up anomalies in the sky.  They all appeared to be traveling in the same direction at set intervals, soaring by.  It struck us both as unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jokingly said that perhaps it was North Korean/Chinese/USSR airplanes; a scouting party... to prepare for an invasion.  He came up with something a little more realistic, perhaps they were memorial balloons, adrift in the night sky, honoring veterans or otherwise on Independence Day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regardless, they appeared alien.  We see airplanes in the sky at night, most a lot higher than others.  However, you know they&#39;re US planes with their red/blue lights... these were wholly different and there was a few of them.  Worthy of alarm, at least in my opinion.  I&#39;m near-sighted, so, needless to say I couldn&#39;t see them as well as my brother, but, they were assuredly lit up and in red/gold or yellow-orange.<n>

I walked down a pathway and saw one bright white light floating through the sky very fast.  It couldn&#39;t have been in the sky more than 30 seconds. about a minute later at home I saw one very dim light floating slower than the white light but aster than the 3 red lights. it floated through the sky before disappearing into the sky. What were these?<n>

I was facing north, standing to the west side of the Museum of History and Industry at the South end of Lake Union.  I noticed one orange, non-blinking light appear high over the North end of the lake. More likely the light was over the Puget Sound.  The light moved slowly south and did not change size, color or brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first light was then followed by a second and a third at equal spacing, single file moving south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the lights were directly due west from me (over Queen Anne Hill) the lead light turned west and then disappeared but not behind the high cloud cover.  The second and third light followed the same route.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the three lights were gone, a single orange none blinking light appeared at the same point of origin as the first three.  This single light stayed stationary.  At about the same time this single light appeared, 3 or 4 Helicopters moved to the West and could have been below the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was full of multiple aircraft and helicopters that night.  The marker and anti-collision lights are VERY obvious.  The lights I saw did not look or flash like aircraft lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later an orange light appeared as before, to the North of my location.  This time the second and third light appeared quicker and the three lights moved into a triangle position.  Again they moved South at the same speed and route as before.  The “lower” appearing light moved in and out, changing the shape of the triangle.  Again once the lights were due west of me, they appeared to go west and then disappeared.  This time the high cloud cover was going. They simply went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did get pictures of the lights.<n>

The objects were a solid orange color roughly in the shape of a horizontal oval and maintained a straight trajectory, not jumping around.  The time was 10:00 PM, and it was a clear night.<n>

Its almost as if it was comfortable to be there because of all the other lights in the sky that night!  Like it was camouflaged.<n>

I was watching the firework display in Arvada Colorado.  In the east, off to the right of the fireworks, I saw four orange yellowish lights slowly moving to the right, and then moving to the left in perfect sink.  At first I thought it was a part of the show, but after about a minute of watching, I told my wife and she agreed that it couldn&#39;t be a part of the show.  We both watched as the lights moved very slowly from side to side.  Then, while in continued slow smooth motion, one light disappeared and then another light disappeared, and then another, until one light remained. It remained in continued slow steady motion. The other lights then reappeared one at a time until all four lights appeared. Once again, they all appeared to be moving slow and steady from side to side in perfect sink. After about another minute the lights began to disappear one at a time until one light remained. The remaining light continu! ed movement but seemed to dip downward a bit before completely disappearing from site.<n>

They weren’t very big but clearly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They hovered in a triangular shape for about 10-15 seconds -- one object above and two below that.  I told my friend, those are UFOs!  But he laughed and said, &#34;No they’re not.&#34;   And I said, then what are they?  He had no answer.  The triangle moved slowly and in unison to the right (S) and moved behind a tree, so we ran over to the edge of the yard to see if we could track them.  I could see the orange lights through the branches.  (These objects were high in the sky; I don’t mean they were behind this tree across the street.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they emerged, the orbs spread out into a line and the one farthest to the right turned and dropped a bit below the others.  Again, they just hovered for about 10 seconds.  I was slapping my friend on the back and saying, see, see, those are UFOs!  Then the one to the far right disappeared.  It was just gone.  The other two hung on for a few more seconds and then they, too, were gone, first one, then the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes, there were many choppers and airplanes in the air waiting for the fireworks, but they were noisy and I could easily identify them as aircraft.  At the time we saw the orbs, all the aircraft were farther north and were clearly not near the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I flew airplanes as a student pilot years ago, and have many hours of flying time, including solo landings.  I know what aircraft are like and these were not conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireworks had not started so these were not fireworks.  Unless there’s a new kind that can hover, turn, stop, and change formations in a crisp manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was thinking maybe they were flares, but they just didn’t look like flares.  The orbs were not wavering, fuzzy, but very stable and clear in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the west, there was a quarter moon out, but again, it couldn’t be confused with these very orange, very round, very clear objects that were hovering in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked online the next day and somebody posted a video that shows an orange globe hovering and moving in the sky.  A commenter said it was a Chinese lantern, which, he said, were everywhere last night.  What we saw was not a lantern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home last night, I called my son and told him about it and he said, wow, that’s weird because I saw an orange object hanging over Beacon Hill about the same time.  He said he thought at first that it was a planet but it seemed too big for a planet and it was very round and orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, that whole experience was a first for me and my disbelieving friend who witnessed it with me.  I have no idea what they were but sure wish I could find out.<n>

The appearance of each would take about 5 minutes before disappearing into thin air. Some were bright orange (4), only the second one was red.  No sounds were heard in the night skies.  At one point, several flashes of white light appeared across the horizon.  The lights came from the north and looked like wide beams of strobe-like beams that you would only see in a rock concert setting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I tried to capture these objects ascending to the skies while holding our iPhones.

Downingtown, PA.  Location Downingtown West High school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While waiting for the usual yearly 9 PM fireworks show to start there was an unexplained delay and as the crowd eyes and mind wandered the sky wondering why the delay.  We and many others were getting ready to leave thinking the show may have be cancelled.  We started to get up out of our lawn chairs and in the sky behind us we noticed 4 slowly moving orange craft that were circular moving very slowly pulsating and drifting west to east.  Clearly not normal aircraft my daughter started taking pictures with her IPhone and my wife used her camera. Then the craft had an additional 14 to 18 craft drifting by the field with several families noticing and joking about being UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had seen 5 last year at the same place however they did not float by in the same way.  However they just disappeared last year and so did there just go by and then they went into a straight line and disappeared.  They did not shoot away in a flash just simply turned into nothing.  On the way home which was only a 10 minute ride we stopped at a gas station near our home to get some creamer for coffee and my wife went in my daughter and I both could not wait to look at the pictures, What we say gave us chills and goose bumps because when we used her IPhone to get bigger close-ups  the body of the craft were not longer round, but the craft was clearly seen.  All lit up with bright lights like steps all around the craft I am attaching or uploading the best photo we have.  We were hoping to get these to you before the C2C show tonight because I remember last year on the 4th we had reports all over the US with the same orange craft.  I want to say orbs but these are orange round appearing craft.<n>

At around 9PM the closest fireworks display in Golden began and most of us were turned in that direction watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later my friend tapped me on the shoulder and pointed in the opposite direction of the fireworks (east) and said &#34;What is that?&#34;  I turned and looked where he was pointing and saw 3 lights hovering in the sky.  They were completely stationary for about 15 seconds.  Then a fourth light appeared and they started moving slowly left to right in a perfect line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my 4 friends and I were all watching and making a bit of a scene pointing and yelling in confusion and at least 10 other people had turned around and were looking too.  There were at least 30 people on top of the trail we were on, I can&#39;t say for sure how many people witnessed this object but there were several.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 4 lights appeared to be absorbed into one, and then would re appear as 4.  Then, all 4 disappeared suddenly, reappeared for a few moments, moved upwards slowly, and then disappeared again.  This all happened in less than 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard one man ask one of the park rangers who were there if he saw the object and what he thought it was.  The trail ranger said hesitantly &#34;It was probably parachuters&#34;, which made no logical sense.  No one had any other suggestions of what it was and everyone appeared to have the same uneasy feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were not fireworks or like anything I have ever seen in my life.  I feel confident reporting this as there were several witnesses and no explanation for these lights.<n>

Other larger groups in the vicinity also reported seeing the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were to distinct groups.  The first and most suspicious group of 4 appeared from our vantage point to be over DIA.  This group changed formation repeatedly but would return to a group of 3 in line with one that moved randomly around them.  These objects moved laterally and up and down. No man made aircraft that I have ever seen moves in this manner. I was in an ait squadron in the Navy and have seen all sorts of planes, helicopters, etc.  These objects did not move in a manner I have witnessed in man-made aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second group appeared to be a bit north and ~5 miles west of the first group.  This was a group of 5.  It is possible that this 2nd group could have been parachutists that I have heard were working a fireworks show.  They did appear to descend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report was prompted by the fact that this was the 2nd time I have seen a similar event on the 4th of July.  Either last year or the year before we witnessed objects that moved like the eastern-most group reported last night.  They most definitely moved 1000&#39;s of feet up and down and potentially miles side to side in a way that was not possible by man-made aircraft.  Also, these objects were in the air long enough that we actually got bored watching them and went back to watch fireworks.  We would watch the UFO&#39;s for a few minutes, the fireworks for a few minutes and so on for 15-20 minutes.  Since they appeared to be in the area around the airport, I was skeptical that they could be anything other than aircraft, but this was quickly cleared up by the extreme maneuvering that we witnessed.<n>

A few minutes into the show, I saw what I thought was an airplane flying by in the distance, and I remarked to my husband how nice it was that the passengers got to see the fireworks.  As we continued to watch the fireworks with the aircraft in the distance behind the light display, I saw the craft suddenly change direction which immediately piqued my interest.  I again pointed out the craft to my husband to note its change in direction.  The craft that we were watching did not have any discernible form other than the light coming from it, which would change from bright, flashing red, to a bright flashing green, and would also stay solidly colored in each tone as well (not flashing) with no discernible pattern to the change in color or flashing patterns.  We continued to watch this craft move from! side to side across the horizon, which at my best guestimation would be perhaps the distance of a few miles (again it was difficult to tell it’s height and true distance from us in relation to the horizon) but it was as high as the fireworks were and would disappear below the horizon, only to rise again, many times hovering perfectly still with no movement whatsoever, to quickly moving to the left or right, then up and down.  When the fireworks ended, only about a 20 minute show, so we saw this occur for about 10-15 minutes, the craft went below the horizon and we thought it had gone, only to get up and prepare to leave and we saw it again.  This time it was leftward to us, moved back and forth a few times over the course of maybe 3-4 minutes and then made a final descent below the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to state that I am definitely a skeptic of so-called UFO sightings.  This is not the sort of thing that I seek out, that thrills me, or even particularly scares me, I primarily just laugh these sorts of things off whether heard from someone or in say a movie. I am perhaps mostly just in a state of disbelief.  No aircraft that I have ever seen or even know of can behave or perform in the manner I saw this craft do tonight. Hovering perfectly, perfectly still, moving from side to side at higher speeds than even a helicopter can move (that I have seen at least), disappearing below the horizon, only to reappear, move about, and then disappear. Unfortunately again we could not discern a shape other than that of the light. The only lights I have seen associated with traditional aircraft seen in the sky would be a blinking red light or a variation therein. This had distinctive brightness, distinctive change from red to green, and change in solid light to blinking. I have! never seen anything like this before, and I knew immediately that I needed to find some place to report this. I believe that I have witnessed a true unidentified flying object, and I am interested to look further into others’ reports of similar experiences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for the forum and for your time.<n>

Not planes or fireworks. Flying objects that were silent<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I went out in to my driveway, I looked up to see some fireworks going off when I saw an Orange light just hanging there. I thought at first it was a firework, due to its firey orange color, that had reached its peak height and was ready to explode. Instead of explode though I noticed it was moving south, towards me, at a slow pace maybe 30-40mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I realized it was flying I watched it for a minute then ran in and grabbed my video camera and got the wife.  As we watched it fly overhead and right past us the orange glow just faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time we both looked back north and noticed another one coming.  This one did the exact same thing.  It flew south then slowly faded out.  This happened two more times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects seemed to be following each other at a distance.  One every 2-3 mins apart.  The great thing about the night of the 4th was that it was a clear night and even after the lights faded we should have still been able to see the shape of the objects due to the fact the sky was so clear and we could see the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure what they were but as I said the were a bright firey orange color and were roughly 2000 feet high and completely silent.  They didn&#39;t make a sound! I see and hear planes go over all the time since I live about 5 miles S.E. from DTW.  These were NOT planes and were not on the flight route of the planes that land or take off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects looked as if they were following Inkster rd due south and veered east over Lake Erie.  I found these same objects on youtube when I typed in UFO&#39;s of July 4th.  As far as my video went.  The video quality was terrible.  Trying to record and object like that at night is harder then I thought it would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not a UFO nut I and my wife work for GM and have no history of seeing things and can explain almost all of what I see in the skys.  This night however I saw 4 Bright Orange Lights flying overhead at a somewhat low altitude and did not see any type of body to these crafts against the backround of a Very Clear Sky.  These lights simply faded out as they flew over and were gone!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot explain this or tell anyone what it was I saw other then orange lights.<n>

Sequentially, this is what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we returned home after watching fireworks near Sidney Fisher Park, I pulled into the ((deleted)) condominium complex and noticed an orange light hovering above the beach just east of the condo complex.  As I exited the car, I walked around the condo complex to try and get a better view, but by the time I got there, the orange light had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded upstairs to the fifth floor condo, and proceeded to the balcony and witnessed another orange light hovering what seemed like no more than a mile off the beach, maybe 2,500 feet in the air, and directly east of the condo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While that light hovered in place without a sound, I called to the rest of my family including my wife and my father-in-law, an ex-rocket engineer with Lockheed Martin space systems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they joined me on the balcony, we witnessed another orange glow travel from the north down the beach, pause for a moment near the condo at about 1,500 feet above sea level, and then proceed to travel east out over open water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of us were left speechless, trying to explain the sighting and the fact that there wasn’t a single sound.  During this time, the original orange glow that was hovering, literally just disappeared in place.  It wasn’t like it was hidden behind a cloud; it was literally like the light turned off and the object was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother-in-law ran back into the condo to retrieve binoculars as I started to try and take pictures with my iPhone.  The pictures are added here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next 5 minutes, we witness two orange glows side-by-side almost in formation follow the same path down the beach from the north as if they launched near the Kennedy Space Center and paused at about the same altitude as the prior aircraft, roughly 1,500 feet above sea level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the two proceeded to rise vertically in place to about 2,500 feet, close to the same altitude the first aircraft was at, but slightly more north in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I tried to find it in the binoculars, the second of the two aircraft had again just disappeared in place, like the light was just turned out.  Returning to the original aircraft, it too had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the prior aircraft were hovering in place and rising to the roughly 2,500 feet above sea level; a final aircraft followed the same flight path as the prior three.  As that aircraft neared the same area of the prior two, it paused, rotated and turned out towards sea.  This one, I could find in the binoculars what appeared to be two circular exhaust engines side by side.   The aircraft proceeded slowly out east for what seemed like 3-5 miles before it too disappeared out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stunned, we all turned to each other in amazement at what we saw.  Were they test helicopters?  Where they drones – never heard a completely silent drone?  Given the clear distinct side-by-side orientation of the engines for the final aircraft, it was confirmation that it was a powered aircraft vehicle.  But even at that, we couldn’t explain the orange glow as it approached us.  Why would we see the glow of engines?  How did they hover with no underneath engines for flight stabilization?  A thousand questions; all leaving us with the conclusion that we just witnessed a unique UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((deleted)) Condominiums, Ridgewood Ave., Cape Canaveral, Florida.<n>

Most were blue white, some had red with them.  Intermittently the lights flashed on and off.  Some streaked across the mountains and disappeared.  Some remained stationary and could be seen for several seconds.  Often there was nothing and then a series of lights flashed on.  Sometimes they were stationary but flashed on and off in the same position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never have I seen anything like this.  My wife has more acute vision than I and said she saw that some lights flashing were dome shaped.

It moved very fast towards us and disappeared behind the trees in a duration of about 2 to 3 minutes.  No blinking lights, one luminous color only.  This is not known military or civilian.

We noticed 3 lights in a triangle shape in the distance (few miles away) above the tree line.  At first we thought they were other fireworks that didn&#39;t explode because they had an orange color (even though fireworks don&#39;t really travel high enough to be seen that far away) But these did not go any higher and stayed in a perfect triangle formation.  We kept waiting for them to disappear or to flash like aircraft but they stayed in the air in the same place.  I believe there were 3 objects because the distance would have made the object massive if it was a single object.  My son tried to photograph and could not. He retrieved my phone and it would not capture the light either because of the distance.  I switched to movie mode and I thought I did not capture anything but once reviewed I was able to capture the triangle formation for a second and have the picture as proof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes the left most light disappeared and the other two went higher in the air and disappeared too.  My years in the Air Force AND life experience up until now have left me without an explanation.  They did not act like 3 aircraft such as helicopters, the only manned vehicle I can think of capable of staying perfect shape without moving for the amount of time.  The were not hot air balloons or flares or anything like that.  I was actually worried it was a missile launch for a minute and couldn&#39;t tell they were moving because of perspective. But as time went on they continued to not move.<n>

They were far enough away that they would have been over the ocean from this direction.  This occurred at approxmitely 9:30 PM.  This was the 4th of July and there were fireworks in the area; however, these were extrodinarly high.  It would have been higher than most airliners fly.  I live very close to the northeast corridor that the airlines and military use frequently.  I am very familar with sky watching and frequently use a telescope.  These fireballs moved much faster than any known man-made aircraft, but slower than a metoer.  They disappeared after about 20 to 30 seconds and were totally different from anything I have ever observed.  These were not fireworks or meteors.  These were the fireballs that everyone seems to be seeing along the east coast.<n>

The night sky was exceptionally clear, and I was gazing up at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed something moving in the sky, if it had not been moving it would have looked like another star.  It was a white dot of light at a very high altitude moving very fast, but not like a shooting star.  It was moving from southeast to northwest and stayed visible until it was gone beyond a treeline on the horizon.  It never changed course.  I&#39;ve seen planes fly that high before, and they always look like they are in slow motion being so far away, but this was moving much faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had only the one star sized white light and no other lights that might indicate a plane or helicopter.

Most were blue white, some had red with them.  Intermittently the lights flashed on and off.  Some streaked across the mountains and disappeared.  Some remained stationary and could be seen for several seconds.  Often there was nothing and then a series of lights flashed on.  Sometimes they were stationary but flashed on and off in the same position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never have I seen anything like this.  My wife has more acute vision than I and said she saw that some lights flashing were dome shaped.  She also saw what she described as rays emanating from the red part of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The streaking lights moved very quickly across the mountains.  The view I had covered several miles.  When I called 911 to report this, I was told that earlier similar lights were seen on mountains slightly west of me called Putsch Ridge.  That area is not visible from my balcony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite serious-minded.  PD))<n>

Several minutes before the fireworks started, a kid pointed straight up with his arm and said something like &#34;Hey, a blue ufo!&#34;  Most people who heard him (he yelled pretty loud) looked up and we saw a small, far away group of 6-10 faint starlike objects.  The group was traveling NE at about the same speed as the international space station. It approached the moon and disappeared. I was willing to assume it was the ISS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, another group appeared in the SW and followed the same NE path and disappeared near the moon, too.  That eliminated the ISS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a 3rd faint group appeared in about the same place in the SW, traveled near the moon, made a 270 degree turn to the west, went a short distance and disappeared.  That really eliminated the ISS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was interesting was the path of the groups.  The path was not a perfectly straight line, it was a series of distinct course changes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At least 40 people that were sitting by us saw and many commented on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were probably 4000 people sitting on the field, facing South, all looking up in the sky for the first fireworks when these objects appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Expect more reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a pilot and used to flying at night - and they def weren&#39;t meteors, airplanes, satellites, fireworks.<n>

A several mile length across the range of the mountains I saw at first soft focus white lights, almost like fireflies.<n> <n><n> About 10 of them, then perhaps 20-30 more flashing on and off intermittently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the white lights appeared to blink on and off in a kind of photon white blue, very bright.  Back and forth randomly blinking on and off or just holding position these lights sprinkled on and off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then some white lights appeared to streak across the air in front of the mountain range back and forth very fast.  Some of the lights appeared to leave momentary trails of white behind as they zoomed across the sky.  Then some of the blue lights, about 3 or 4 of them to the left blinked on a bright vibrant transparent light above them and looked like a dome shape.  On and off very quickly ... then the blue lights appeared to have a brilliant red light right next to or within it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights danced across the foothills up down all around in various areas.  Then some of the red lights had beams of red light flash on and off here and there.  To my visible eye, these beams were only a couple of inches long beaming down, but could have been yards or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this in my lifetime.  The strangest thing is that to my eyes these flashes of light would have all appeared separate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But this morning I awoke and had the strongest impression and feeling that this was ONE invisible craft like a long almond shape, where all this was taking place.  All these lights stayed within this one area, flashing on and off.  If it was a craft it had to be miles long.<n>

At 21:15, 9:15 PM, driving home on county Road 11, above a hill at the highest point on my route north back home I saw a bright red light.  Originally with the air traffic from MSP I was expecting an aircraft of some sort. At about 130th street I was able to better make out the object and saw no other running lights, which aroused my interest.  The object was about the speed of a light plane and continued changing the observation angle to the point where I was directly under it. It was round with no appendages.  The outer edges of the object were a dark red and the object was an increasingly brighter red toward it&#39;s center.  There was a bright white light in the center which varied from very bright to much less so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this object while I traveled 3/4 mile at 40 mph and it crossed from my right front to overhead and to my rear in that time.  It crossed my line of sight going into trees.  It was no higher than 500 feet in my estimation, steady in that elevation and by reconsidering my positions on a map it was traveling to the South-SouthWest, against the reported breeze from the South.  It was 5 to 8 feet in diameter if its elevation was 500 feet, proportionally greater if higher in elevation.  It was sharp and distinct when seen closer and especially when it was directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total time of the observation was about 45 seconds.  This was just after sunset with cloudy skies.  I had two cameras with me, shame on me for not stopping and trying to grab a picture, or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conventional explanation seems limited to a balloon flare but the object was going against a light, but prevailing breeze. With many people out on the Fourth looking at fireworks, some kind of balloon drone combination would have to be considered too. But that is if one needs to find a conventional explanation.<n>

I immediately took note of the time and went outside with my wife.  We are quite familiar with air traffic patterns here with Philadelphia Int. Airport 12 miles away and southwest of our location.  We are also in the flight path of helicopters for local news outlets, coast guard, and Mcguire AFB.  We are quite sure none of these can be confused with what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When first observed the orange light was at its brightest and pulsated.  It was moving from the eastern sky towards the southeast at about 30 degrees above horizon.  The light moved much slower than any aircraft I&#39;ve seen.  It didn&#39;t appear to be very large but would appear larger when at its brightest pulsation.  We could not see if the light was attached to a craft.  We watched this light for 4 minutes when it stopped for a brief moment then headed in the opposite direction for a brief time then just appeared to blink off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the fourth of July and all of the local Firework shows were canceled due to the high winds left in the wake of hurricane Arthur.  The sky was very clear due to the high front pushing down from Canada. Winds were coming from NNW.  At one point an airliner seemed to be headed straight for the light heading NE.  The airliner was closer to us than the light and it was appx. 2 miles away.  Neither reacted to the other although I think the airline could probably see the light.  They were both close to the same altitude.<n>

The green lights were blinking but the red were steady.  We could not see the actual aircraft, just the lights. We were at Bradley Park in San Marcos, CA with many other people, for the 4th of July fireworks show.  Everyone was watching the sky in front of us (they were shooting the fireworks off slightly to the south) and there were two sets of these lights above us and to the right (west) and left (east) of us.  They seemed to be cruising along normally and then changed directions.  They changed directions,zig zagging randomly, and hovered seemingly perfectly still for a long time.  The moon was about half and it was bright. At one point they both were hovering, and then the one to our right moved, I couldn&#39;t see due to some smoke in the sky, and then when the smoke cleared it was gone from sight.  Since it was only smoky for a few quick seconds, it seemed odd to me that the lights were gone from my sight completely.  Then the one to our right started moving away from us, toward the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could have been some type of military aircraft since there is Navy and Marines here. But the movements were not like anything I&#39;ve ever seen in person or in movies; it captured my attention and I watched the lights instead of watching the fireworks show.<n>

I decided I would take a slightly shorter walk this night because I was getting started so late and didn&#39;t want to walk in the dark too much. After making my preparations, I began my walk at about 20:40. The sun was setting very low in the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing on the corner of Argillite Road and Bellefonte Road when I saw the first anomalous objects. The time was approximately 21:00 and the sky was still light, but darkening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were in the sky in the distance in the direction of the Flatwoods City Building beyond Super Quick. There were two objects moving slowly towards the direction of Russell, to the east. They appeared spherical in the distance and I thought they were odd because their appearance and behavior didn&#39;t match to a plane or a helicopter. They were not shaped like a plane, appearing vaguely spherical in the distance and were moving far too slowly to be planes but faster than a balloon would normally travel. Both objects appeared to be dark gray or black in the distance. The lead object had a light on it of an amber/red color that appeared to come from the bottom of the object. The object following behind it was unlit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many in the neighborhood were setting off fireworks due to the 4th of July. Many were large type exploding in the air with very loud booms and sparklers and wizzers coming out at 200 to 400 feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On arriving home, my father remarked to me that he saw two objects to the east over the Armco Steel Plant (located in Russell, KY, to the east on the Ohio River) moving east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later as I was standing in the driveway watching fireworks, an anomalous red light flew over the house at a high speed from the north horizon towards the south. After passing directly over the area it dimmed slightly, then lit up fully again, then dimmed once more until it could no longer be seen. I called to my father who was watching fireworks on the back porch and he come out with binoculars. About five minutes later, an object of similar configuration did the same, and a few minutes after that another one came. This happened numerous times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time, I was able to get a better look at the object through the set of binoculars and could see that there was a dark solid mass of some kind attached to the light. The light appeared to be moving under this dark object which appeared vaguely round or spherical from my point of view. It was at this point that I made the mental connection back to the anomalous objects I saw during my walk. I realized that I had had a daylight sighting of two of these strange spheroid objects, one of which was shining an orange/red light from its lower part and the other of which was not. When I moved the binoculars down, I could still see the dark outline of this object as it flew quickly over the house, so it must have been very close. I would estimate it to have been 30-40 ft. across if it were at an elevation of 1500 – 2000 ft. If it were at this size and elevation it must have been moving completely silently at a speed of about 200-300 kts. All of the objects in this series moved in! a straight line at this speed from horizon to horizon. They made no heading changes but they appeared to dip in altitude as they approached the area and then climb and fade as they came over or passed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this first series of objects had flown directly over the area, another object came in a similar direction from the north, but was flying over an area slightly to the east  us rather than directly over us as the previous objects had done. This object exhibited the most atypical and dramatic behavior of all the objects sighted. It appeared to descend and dim its orange/red light, appearing to fade as the others had, but I could still discern the fuzzy outline of a dark spheroid object in the darkness. Instead of totally fading and climbing back up, it slowed down and suddenly lit up in a brilliant fluorescent blue-green green color before descending rapidly and going out of view to the southeast within what seemed to be only a mile or so. We did not see this object again after it did this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this happened, a few more of these strange objects appeared over the house in the same course as the previous series, but eventually the activity tapered off after about 22:30 and the objects were not seen again that night. My father and I remained watching for them for a period of about an hour and a half more but saw no more of these anomalous objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound or noise of any kind could be heard from any of the unidentified objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the course of this UFO encounter, we observed three brightly lit objects which appeared to be satellites. Their direction of travel was approximately, one east to west, one north to south, and  one south to north. Planes were observed flying overhead during this incident with red, green, white and strobe lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the course of the incident we managed to capture photographic evidence of the objects, but they are low quality due to the fact that we were taking pictures of distant objects at night with cameras that were not meant for nighttime use.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night, July 5th, my father, mother, and grandmother were all out watching fireworks from neighborhood again (the same type as the night of the 4th).  In about a similar time frame as the incident of the previous night, more objects of the same kind seen on the night of the 4th were sighted by me, my father, and mother. I also managed to capture a photograph of one of the objects that appeared this night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The direction or travel was from the northeast horizon towards southwest 	I kept watch outside the house the next night, the 6th, in case more objects would show themselves, but aside from a dim red light in the distance to the west which faded rapidly, I had no sighting comparable to the previous night&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My sister thought they were balLoons, the type of balloons that people take rides in as they were rounded and glowing orange at the top and appeared to have yellow/orange flames beneath them and rising up thru them kind of whispy like.  Beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my neighbors out and they saw the second object as it came over the trees and their house.  They then disappeared in the east, possibly No. Fort Myers.  A short while later I called my neighbors out again as I saw 2 orange lights in the east, one directly above the other, then another appeared and then another.  We watched them for a while and they disappeared, then we saw 2 of them to the north of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later saw 1 of them in the sea, which went out of sight after a few minutes.  I gave up watching and went into my home and out to the ((name deleted)) which faces south and saw 2 of them coming from the sw and then they disap! peared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have the cell phone with me when they were so close and missed a great picture for you.  I went into the house to get it but none of them came close enough after that.  The time is approximate.  There was no sound from the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On another occasion, November 19, 2013, my sister and I left our house (faces north), I looked up and I saw a very bright white light slightly nw and in front of us, it started to blink..then another bright light came on slightly ne and it started to blink then another in the center (but in front of the others forming a triangle) came on and started to blink.  All three blinked together for a few seconds then they all went out at the same time.  IT was huge as at my level there is about 160 feet of land between two of the lights.  I hate to lump this together but there is one other occasion.  I can&#39;t recall the date but one evening coming home on Gator Circle I saw something odd in the sky.  I turned south at ne 13th ave and s! topped to ask 2 girls if they needed help as they were parked with no lights on..they said no, we&#39;re taking pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my car around and saw in the north 3 red lights on what must have been a huge object and then saw the object I had just seen and another go into that dark area.  I said, look, theres two of them and they said ...there were six.  The huge object then very slowly turned to the north, started moving in that direction then just disappeared in the distance.  I asked the girls if they had pictures, they said yes but they weren&#39;t very good.  Then we left the area.  I lumped this for your info as I hadn&#39;t made reports on these.  Your welcome to separate them and use the info on tonights incredible sighting.. they were just beautiful.<n>

I went out onto my balcony to watch.   Obviously, I was looking up to see the fireworks when a very bright green light caught my attention.  It was small and difficult to make out at first and it was completely still.  It seemed to also be watching the fireworks display although it seemed like it was very high up in the sky.  I couldn’t stop looking at it because of the intensity of the color.  It eventually moved back and forth a little bit and I could see a red light right in the center of the green lights.  It also became a little larger and I could see that the green lights were not like one would see on an airplane.  Besides, this craft seemed round or saucer shaped so definitely not an airplane.  The best way I can describe it is that it was like looking at the top of a carousel with the green lights going round and round really fa! st.  The way the craft moved also made it highly unlikely this was something that originated on this planet. There were no turns to change direction, like an airplane would have to make.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took some pictures with my Samsung Galaxy 3 but they aren’t very good as this craft was so high in the sky.  Eventually the craft started to move south as the fireworks display was ending.  I was sad to see it go as it seemed to be enjoying the fireworks.  I have never seen a UFO before and this has really had an impact on me.  I don’t understand why I felt so sad to see it leave and now I am anxious to see it in the night sky again perhaps tonight or sometime soon.<n>

We are sky watchers and enjoy looking for anything in the night sky, i.e. satellites, airplanes, stars, and the moon phases, so we recognized immediately that we were observing something very different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched it slowing, silently come towards us, my husband said, “What could that be?”  We speculated this and that but really was at a loss as to what it could be.  I mentioned maybe it was a drone but there were no navigational lights as required by the FAA at night, just a soft orange glow traveling in a deliberate path obviously not just something drifting in the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was low, about the height of the fireworks that were going off, lower than a small airplane but higher than the treetops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it came adjacent to where we were watching, it made a 45 degree right turn toward the south.  A couple of minutes later another one came from the east and also made a left turn to the south as it came adjacent to our position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, one came back from the south, either one of the first two returning or a different one and it continued to the left over our house and to the north out of sight.  When the next one came into view, I excitedly ran and got my camera and took pictures of the rest that came into sight from several different angles to the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In total there were seven and the last one stopped and made a 45 degree turn upward and disappeared out of sight.  I could find no information online suggesting what these objects could be.  I did a search on YouTube and found some videos of exactly the same objects we saw.<n>

The object appeared to be approaching us, ascending quickly and moving toward the trees where I was standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, as it reached the treeline, the lights shut off.  Because it was dusk, I could not see the shape of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time of the object&#39;s ascent, what appeared to be a commercial liner was flying unusually low and to the west of the object, not on a course that I usually observe such planes taking.<n>

It started at what seemed a fairly low altitude and then ascended toward the moon, disappearing just beyond the moon.  We then saw another, come in from a different direction, but looked and acted similarly to the first, then another, again looked and acted similarly to the other two.  This lasted approximately 5-10 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then saw one much lower than any of the previous three had been, appeared to be barely above the street lights.  It was coming from the south, moving north.  It seemed to be coming directly toward us, then arced up toward the moon and disappeared before getting as high the moon.  We saw approximately 10-12 of these follow the exact same path.  Probably 30-45 seconds apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other people appeared to be viewing them as well.

The orbs then stopped and just hung in the sky for a couple of minutes and then, moments later, the two objects took off in the direction from which they came at what seemed to be warp speed because in a millisecond they had become just two tiny points of light before disappearing.

I then noticed another coming from the East and finally told someone near me.  While I was watching the Eastern sky for more red orbs that person told me about another coming from the Northwest.  After noticing this orb for about one minute until it phased out I looked to the South and noticed three more coming from the Southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched these for a minute when I noticed a fourth emerging from a building all of which were in a straight formation line one behind another.  I watched these four for about three minutes until they too phased out when nearing the area of the School.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the fireworks for about three minutes when I noticed four more coming from the East each one of them trailing the other by about one minute but still visible when looking over the building from our vantage point.

I could hear fireworks going off so I was standing in my driveway looking at the sky to see if I could spot any fireworks before we embarked on our ride.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was overcast with cloud cover so I couldn&#39;t make out any stars yet and I couldn&#39;t really see anything BUT cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If there was a plane in the sky, I guarantee I would not have been able to see it.  It was that overcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right when I got out into the driveway, I looked towards the east (the direction of where I take my dog on her nightly run) and immediately saw a bright red sphere in the sky, slowly moving/hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was strange because it was SO overcast- it stood out because it was the only thing visible in the eastern sky besides cloud cover that I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was NOT a firecracker or firework.  I saw fireworks later in the evening and they were nothing! like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red sphere was large- about the same size as the sphere I&#39;d seen on New Years Day of this year at 12:05am.  About the size of Jupiter x 3.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting only lasted about 30 seconds.  It stood out as a bright red orb, it hovered, and pulsed, about 25 degrees from the horizon (low).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it began to slowly descend, and then it began to flicker out like a candle would.  The red color started to get dimmer and dimmer before it disappeared completely- exactly like a candle would when it burns out.  Or when a light bulb is at it&#39;s end.  It &#34;flickered out&#34; is the best description I can give.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately knew that this was unusual because of how overcast the sky was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was completely silent- no noise at all.<n>

I was standing on the beach between the Sandpiper Beacon Beach Resort located at 17403 Front Beach Road in Panama City Beach, Fl. 32413 and Landmark Holiday Beach Resort 17501 Front Beach Rd, Panama City Bch, FL 32413.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was facing the gulf (south) watching fireworks that were on both sides of me.  I was watching the ones to the left of me when a friend said &#34;look at that&#34;.  I turned to my right and saw a ufo approximately 20 feet in diameter, spherical, glowing orange, the outside surface texture was not frozen solid, but had small waves on it.  However it was not transparent.  It was traveling from west to east.  The ufo was between me and Emerald Isle Beach Resort (Emerald Isle Resort stands 23 stories tall) when I first saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I judged its size and speed (about 60 mph) against the Emerald Isle Resort and Landmark Holiday Beach Resort, and Sandpiper Beacon Beach Resort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it large for about 3 seconds, (from the Emerald Isle Resort  and Sandpiper Beacon Beach Resort.) then in about one second it traveled about 2 miles east to around pier park (approximately 7,200 mph) and stopped.  It seemed to go straight along the coastline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that initial sighting, there were multiple lights in the sky (not from the fireworks).  The spherical lights were orange and red.  They would sometimes fly in formation, and other times go away or towards each other.  There is no way they can be lanterns or airplanes.  They moved to fast and quickly went in opposite directions.<n>

Spouse pointed to bright yellow/intense orange circular light in sky below and to south of Big Dipper; thought it may be Venus or Mars because it was larger and brighter than any stars in the sky and it did not move.  I didn&#39;t think that it looked like a planet, it was larger and brighter. It remained still, unmoving.  After about 3 minutes, it then disappeared in an instant.  There were fireworks going off and the moon to the south of the light, but they did not affect the brightness.

The time was around 8:16 PM (I made a point to look at my watch).  I watched the jet and the small white traill of condensation left behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was extremely clear outside and I seen the jet coming along ways before it finallly passed over.  The direction it flew from was WSW to NE.  Illustrationally speaking for a mental image, a flight path from Dallas, Texas, to New York City.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the jet neared closer, I noticed an odd object behind it.  I didn&#39;t think much of it until it got closer.  The jet didn&#39;t pass directly over me, it probably was (roughly) an eighth of a mile South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer to passing over, I noticed the object trailing about (roughly) a half mile behind it, on the exact same path, flying at about the same speed.  I was in T- Total shock! I watched both the jet and then the silver/grey disk-shaped object fly of towards the North-East.  Nothing abnormal happened, no erratic movements, no lights, and no sound.  By the time they were out of sight, my watch read 8:22 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disc was about 3/4s the size of the jet, including wingspan.  Nothing very outstanding was noticed, other than it appeared seamless.  Also, it appeared at a slightly higher altitude than the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s worth noting that this is the THIRD UFO visualization I&#39;ve had since moving to Batesville a few years ago, but the first daytime/evening visualization.  The previous two occurred at night after 10PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have got mysterious lights on video both times previously.  Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t have my camera where I could put my hands on it, and did not want to move from watching the phenomenon before me.<n>

It reminded me of the size of a satellite traveling.  The object however, did not move.  It blinked for a few seconds and went dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched around the area expecting to see it blink again in a different place as when a plane is visible or again, a satellite.  After a second or two, it began blinking again in the same spot.

My wife and I were driving north on HWY 101 up to Geyserville, CA, from Santa Rosa, CA. After passing Healdsburg, CA.  We pulled onto Alexander Valley RD.  We were going to a casino.  On the way up we had noticed very strange looking Sunset? I took a movie with my phone.  A Very bright area in the movie.  Then we noticed a bright blue line?  If you look at the movie you can see it on the upper left.  This Line was similar to a jet stream but it did not dissipate?    It was solid from where we were.  You could look back behind us and could see that it extended clear back towards Santa Rosa.  That’s over 28 miles.  We had reached the casino and we could no longer see it after dark.  It was not a jet stream, it was bright blue.  We asked others at the casino it they had seen it.  Even the guards.  But no one had.  But it was there because we did film it although I was lighter in the film.<n>

(The ski resort had opened its lifts to take visitors and mountain bikers to the top of the mountain and back down).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lift operators were spacing passengers out so my wife and daughter were several chairs in front and there wasn’t anyone behind me.  I yelled to attract attention but no one was close enough to hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming down from the top I saw a white ball or perfect circle moving on a straight line from left to right.  It was difficult to tell the object’s height or size based on my perspective, but it appeared to about 6-feet across, perfectly round, and white and perhaps 50 to 100 feet above the trees on top of 5,236-foot mountain.  This would be only a few hundred feet above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a windy day and at first I thought it was some weather balloon broken loose but the wind was in my face and the object was moving left to right on a perfectly straight line at a constant speed---too fast for a bird, too slow for an airplane.  It took about 30 seconds for the object to cross my limited field of vision as I descended to the base of the ski run.  It seem to go into a cloud or perhaps was becoming smaller in the distance just as the tree line blocked my vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not hear any reports of anyone else seeing it.<n>

I said to my husband what is that?  He said I cant see it!  I could see right up into its bottom though it was high up it was big and a oblong square shape.  And was a intense orange with red lining and looked like it was radiating fire or pulsating red, As we passed it I kept watching it over my right shoulder it stayed there and I kept telling my husband to look in the mirrors it&#39;s still there.  He couldn&#39;t  see it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it in my side mirror till I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  At a distance I saw white lights or a white glow on the top of it. I wanted my husband to stop the car or turn the car around cause I wanted to see it again. He just thought I was looney, as I described what I saw, and didn&#39;t  believe me.  As I looked at it in my side mirror as we were driving away from it I was comparing its size to the tree line and it was big cause I watched it in the mirror for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes going 65 down the freeway.  I&#39;ll never forget the intense orange and red colors or the way it glowed, lights don&#39;t glow like this.<n>

I watched it for a couple seconds then ran inside to get my camera to take some pictures of it.  I dont know how to upload pictures on here but i have them if someone wants to see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways I took a couple pictures of them and then watched the object for about 2-3 minutes and the object seemed to move for a couple seconds then stop and then start to move again and so on.

My bedroom faces due East; the Sapphire Mountains to be specific. I noticed what appeared to be a quickly moving cluster of a few (maybe 3?), very deep red &#34;dots&#34;.  No white lights and a shade of red that clearly was not &#34;airliner&#34; or &#34;port&#34; red. It/they moved towards the Northwest above the mountains.  Quite possible that this/these objects were higher in the sky than my eye and brain could register.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Horizontal movement in a straight line only.<n>

The object began to move erratically, first straight up then it made a 90 degree turn.  It would move at angles and then radically move in a saw blade motion.  I tried to capture it on my cell phone but really did not have much success.  I am not saying its extraterrestrial, my first thought was military.  I was amazed at its ability to move so quickly and in so many different directions.

7/4/14 00:30|Bel Air|MD|Light|30 seconds|Reddish light.|7/11/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/111/S111157.html|1001|ndxe201407| Police Officer observed 2 silent red spheres with shimmering white halos moving east in &#34;wing-man&#34; formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s my report to MUFON:  I am a Sergeant with a state police agency; while on patrol on a side street near the 8700 block of north Milwaukee Avenue in Niles, Illinois, on the evening of Thursday, 07/03/2014, at approximately 2315 hours, my eye was caught by two (2) pulsing round red lights in the SW sky, one on top of the other, which appeared to be a cell or water tower in the vicinity of Maryhill Cemetery.  This caused me to do a complete double-take, because I know there are no such structures in that area.  When one of the objects began moving slowly from west to east, and the other followed in a &#34;wing-man&#34;-type formation (slightly behind and further south than the object to the forefront), I thought, because of their basketball-like appearance and large size, that they were helicopters of the &#34;bubble-cockpit&#34; variety, flying low on the southern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I parked my squad car and shut off my engine and all lights, and exited my squad car to observe the aircraft.  As soon as I got out of my car, I realized that these were not helicopters, and were much farther away and larger than I originally thought.  There was no helicopter sound whatsoever in the relatively quiet night air, and the presence of many airplanes in the sky (Niles and Park Ridge are under major flight paths in and out of O&#39;Hare) provided me with an excellent contrasting point of reference to what the UFOs at least &#34;were not.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects glided eastbound, slowly and deliberately.  They were basketball-sized spheres, approximately 5-times the size of the strobe lights on an airplane, with a shimmery white halo completely circling the sphere.  The red light was unlike anything I have ever seen, having a pulsating, almost &#34;liquid&#34; or &#34;living&#34; appearance, and glowing, rather than piercing the night sky.  The white light appeared like an aura (similar to the heat you see emanating from a rocket or jet engine).  I was awestruck!<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the first craft was almost directly in front of my line of sight, the spheres both suddenly &#34;receded&#34; quickly up and into the western sky (back where I first saw them, but much higher).  The UFO that was offset to the rear disappeared so quickly that I barely had time to register that it was gone.  The craft that was more &#34;in the lead&#34; receded up and back to the point that it looked like a red star, and then blinked out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw that there were two adult male citizens, one African-American and one Caucasian, looking up at the sky from a residential driveway across the street and south of my location.  I approached them and we all verbally confirmed that what we had seen had not been fireworks or flares of any kind, but were definitely very large, unidentifiable aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all very excited.  I remember that my emotions were in a &#34;condition red&#34; or &#34;high alert&#34; status - I remained in this psychological state for many hours after the sighting.  The African-American citizen kept repeating &#34;warp speed! they took off into space at warp speed!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two things I would like to point out are that, 1)  for the 20 minutes or so prior to this sighting, I was unable to connect to the internet on both my Blackberry cell phone or my in-car Panasonic Tough Book Laptop with Verizon air card.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five minutes after the spheres ascended out of sight, both my telephone and in-car computer came back online. 2.  I did not think to take photos of the craft because the camera on my Blackberry produces very poor quality photos.  I&#39;ve tried to take pictures of the full moon in the past, and they come out as a blurry white pin-dot of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am working on getting a record of any 911 calls for suspicious lights in the sky during this time period.<n>

We then began watching closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were orange and appeared to be separated at equal distance, away from our location.  The lights were far away and we could not make any other observations about the source.  The lights appeared to be moving together away from our location and eventually were not visible.

Witness A remained at the window, while witness B started googleing what this could possibly be.  After a while, Witness A then called over Witness B yet again upon spotting 1 more lights that was flashing red and then white in the same area.  This then split into two separate flashing objects.  The red and white lights were moving very slowly to the left and then very slowly moving back to a neutral position.  This lasted for around 2 minutes before moving to left once more and disappearing behind the trees out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness A and B stayed at the window for around 10 more minutes.

The sky was fairly clear over my house but there was a light cloud cover that I noticed at sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted an orange object that I intially thought was a helicopter coming from the east traveling in a south western pattern.  Because I thought it looked strange so I took a photo with my smart phone camera.  I quickly magnified the image and it did not look like a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the first orange object faded from my view, another orange light traveling in the same pattern came into my view.  Both objects were cruising at a casual speed, probably as fast as a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were silent and the orange light appeared to be changing from small to bigger and then bigger to small.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as the second one faded out of my view, a third one came along traversing in the same pattern.  Then another after that one.  At this point after seeing 3-4 orange objects I started! shooting a video of the orange/orb lights passing by.  I got about 9 minutes of solid footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in shock as I witnessed the first 3, I have never seen anything like it.

The object was very fast it moved to the North in a speed much faster than any aircraft that I have ever seen.  We live in the flight path for Nashville International Airport (BNA) so I am use to seeing aircraft commercial and military in the sky during the day and night time.  The speed this thing was moving was amazing.  This was not fireworks, flares, a planet or any star.  By the time that I had told my brother about the object it had already went out of view.  I could not make out any size or shape.<n>

It left a streak in the sky about a half inch long at arms length but it was a wide light like a highlighter rather than thin like a pencil.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now here is why I think this was weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spend a lot of time at night looking up at the sky, I know how falling stars look, I watch satellites go by  on a regular basis and I have seen the ISS over dozens of times and know its speed and brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In fact at 8:15ish pm I saw the ISS fly over (south to north) and fade out just like I had seen many times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most every satellites I see here are usually going from south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most falling stars I see are much faster and the streak is much longer and thinner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am under the flight path for most military jets from Nellis AFB but they fly from the base to the training range (east to west) over my house then back a little north of me from West to East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Generally with a lot of noise and very identifiable by their lights and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In fact I was thinking earlier in the night that they were not out doing their regular night time training and the sky&#39;s were quiet that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never see flights from the north to the south due to two reasons.  The mountain range is very high to my north (Gass and Sheeps peek) and due north of me is actually area 51 and the groom lake complex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is a No Fly zone for the normal training flights from Nellis.  Even the famed Janet airline flights don&#39;t do North to south, they do NW to SE to get to McCarran.  And don&#39;t fly evenings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So here is how this went down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in the pool laying back looking up at the stars and due to the way my yard and pool is I usually look north to it being the darker part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard what I thought was a plane, which drew my attention to an area I wasn&#39;t focusing on, when all of a sudden, I see this streak and at the leading edge of it is a bright shiny object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The streak was only half an inch long and appeared like the old star trek shows where they come out of warp and leave a short light trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was a plane with landing lights but when the trail and light went away as fast as it appeared I looked to the area to the south thinking I would see the plane continue through the stars due to the sky still being in twilight but could not find it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is seemed strange to me for the fact that nothing ever comes from our north to the south and the way the light looked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And I have never seen a falling anything from the North to the South.<n>

Pointed it out to the driver, but he didn’t really pay attention as he was driving.  Less than 5 minutes later we had reached our destination.  I spotted another of these objects. This time the driver saw it, too. He said it was probably a tower. I told him it wasn&#39;t a tower. It wasn&#39;t blinking and it was orange, not red.He looked around at some other towers and agreed what we were seeing was NOT a tower. It finally just disappeared.

Because of its brightness, it was lighting about ¼ of our large back yard.  Upon my seeing the UFO, it continued to move very fast in random directions around the backyard at a estimated height of 5 to 6 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I viewed the UFO, it appeared to stay about the same height above the ground as it darted about while staying in the backyard area.  It took me about 15 seconds to realize what I was seeing after I opened the door to see my dog! barking and jumping at the fast moving UFO which was a single light source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then called my dog’s name and he ran through the open door back into the house and I closed the door.  I then turned off one of the patio lights (leaving another on) by quickly walking to the patio light switch (possibly 20 ft. away) and then immediately looked through our backyard glass French door and the UFO was no longer visible.  So, although I viewed the moving UFO for about possibly 30 seconds, I believe the UFO was in the backyard for about 3 minutes, because of the estimated duration of my dog barking.<n>

I took the dog out around midnight to find a strange looking cloud similar to a roll cloud moving quickly east.  It flowed across the horizon like a giant jet contrail, and stretching as far as the eye could see.  However it was tremendously lower and larger than I would expect of a contrail and the consistency appeared more like shaving crème than mist.  It had peculiar alternating curls forming intermittently on each side as it continued east.  I watched the cloud as it traveled out of my city and was startled by the silhouette of a giant black triangle.  It was completely silent and without lighting.  I observed the object hovering in front of a cloudbank that was illuminated by the city of Moraine.  I decided the combination of this unnatural and eerie cloud formation and the giant black triangle would be enough to finally vindicate me with my wife who finds my interest in the unexplained distasteful.  After around five minutes of prodding I dragged her outside.  By that time the triangle was gone, the sky was clearing and stars visible.  She had been less than thrilled when I described the sighting a few weeks earlier and refused to wait and see if we could spot the craft again. She stormed away, frustrated again by her &#34;lunatic husband&#34;.  I stared up at the stars where the previously unnoticed and rapidly expanding puffy white clouds where racing toward one another.  The moment the door slammed shut two tine white orbs that seemed to have long straight tails streak through the cloud cover.  They resembled the little firecrackers in twisted white paper you give you kids to throw at the sidewalk while you light the real ones. I had seen the combination of strange cloud behavior and streaking white orbs recently, so I hoped I could expect to see more. And for the next four hours I witnessed more abundant and varied phenomenon then I ever would have expected. I still hav! e a flip phone with a terrible camera so it was too dark when ! I attemp ted to take pictures. Within minutes a black helicopter with a bright green light came into the area where I was observing the clouds. It was quieter than the Blackhawks I became accustomed to at Ft. Campbell, but bot nearly silent.  It hovered briefly overhead, the turned to pursue a thick smooth puff of cloud as it started to suddenly rapidly ascend towards the main cloud cover.  The cloud seemed to have a slight glow and as it speed off the rear fanned slightly making it look like a little flying whale. s I lost sight of them quickly behind the tree line. Shortly thereafter, noticed a dim bluish pulsing light coming from the larger group of clouds. The mist settled quickly and I thought there could be craft overhead but when I stared my vision became blurry and my eyes wouldn&#39;t focus.  Repeated attempts to avert and clear my eyes and observe the object through the mist began to give me a strong headache.  By the eerie way they moved and the abnormal consistency I assumed that! something other than then nature was influencing them.  However I decided to check around the back of my building as it has less light posts and better visibility,   Not sure how long I sat out there, but just when I was about to give up a glowing yellowish white ball of light dropped straight out of the sky,  I couldn&#39;t judge the distance properly or discern where it came from, It seemed to just materialize at high altitude and drop straight down.  However a few minutes a an aircraft ascended at a steep angle from what seemed to be where the glowing ball must have fallen.  This craft was possibly unrelated as we are close to an airport. had rapidly flashing red and white lights just as civilian craft, yet it was silent and moved very fast.  I remained outside a short time, until my growing headache compelled me to call it a night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he stated that he did not want to talk about the incident.

Then, we passed what I would guess to be directly under it, went forward driving, looking back to see it again.  We never saw it again nit was there 1 minute &amp; gone the next.  So, either a very large, solid metal hot air balloon with a light at the bottom or something unexplained.<n>

Yet nothing I feel confident enough to say is a ufo.  Until the morning of July 2, 2014, approximately at 3:14 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw is something I have never seen before.  It was so amazing it sent chills down my spine.  As real and dramatic as my experience was to me.  I was hesitant to make a report.  I changed my mind because when I arrived at home and turned on the news like every other day.  One of the first segments was a segment on ufo sightings.  Followed by a segment about the rocket luanch the night before.  I felt that the local news was trying to discredit what was clearly a dramatic sighting.  That meant I was not the only one to see it.  I wanted to go ahead and report my sighting and hopefully find out if there are more reports in my area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 3:14 a.m., I noticed a bright red Orange ball of light coming in to visibility.  Much like an approaching plane that is going to soon land.  Then it came to complete stop.  This was extremely bright orange red light about the height that police helicopters fly in a city.  Then it made what look like a right turn yet when it did this, it went from being a ball of light.  To what seemed to me to be a long cigar shape with three lights in the middle...orange, red, orange.  Then it slowly moved in what I can only described as a snake slithering.  Then it slowly faded to a flashing light.  That stayed stationary for about another 45 minutes.<n>

Up in the sky was this translucent blue and white looking circular light.  As we spoke about it and to it, an orange/red light ran through it as if it could tell we were speaking to it.  It would morph into a cylinder light.  I wonder if it were moving around or spinning.  It would get long and thin and then become round again. It would pulsate also when we were talking so it looked like the lights were blinking in it.  It was difficult to get an exact shape.  It split a couple of times or appeared to.  It moved up and over to the right as we walked the dog around.   We went back inside as I wanted to share this with you.  It was almost like a living entity, like it responded.  I got a little scared for a second and it grew dimmer.  As I relaxed it got brighter like it was proud or communicating.  One thing interesting.  We walk our dog about 5-10 minutes at a time.  She does her business and we go in.  It seemed we just got out there and it was 30 minutes later.<n>

We were looking at the sky, noting that it is finally clear. It has been raining and very windy for a few days. Just rain and cloud and wind.  No thunder and lightning.  So it&#39;s finally clear, but we can hear thunder... although it didn&#39;t sound like thunder when we heard it again.  It was far away like thunder but close as well.  It kept happening almost rhythmically.  It was like a rapid, heavy pounding for approximately 3-5 seconds with a pause of maybe 30-45 seconds.  Then again and again.  It reminded me of someone pounding on a garage door or metal roof. It felt like it was coming from the sky in the north but there wasn&#39;t any cloud or anything.  Whatever it was must of been huge because it was far away yet quite loud. My husband was out earlier and said it was happening for awhile.  A total time of about 40 minutes. I asked my daughter and her boyfriend if they heard anything while they wer! e out walking in Birds Hill park about an hour before, they said they didn&#39;t, but noted a strange light that they thought was the moon at first peeking through a bit of cloud.  They also noted that if it was the little sliver of a moon, it was in the north, which they know couldn&#39;t be right.  By then, the moon would be approaching the west, since it was around 10pm. Kind of a coincidence.<n>

A number of other people soon started talking around us about the same thing.  The initial occurrence of seeing the object lasted several minutes.  I quickly dismissed the possibility of it being an aircraft as the flight pattern was not something I know or had a seen a plane being capable of doing.  It appeared to be traveling quite slowly, but then it would alter its path very quickly and even zipped up from a straight line into a  90 degree turn upwards.  After several minutes, we lost sight of it.  The object appeared a short time later on the west side of the fireworks display.  It maintained a straight path towards the display going eastward and then it actually stopped in midair for a minute or so and then continued going east where we lost track of it again.  As I said, several people arou! nd us and my children all saw the orb.,<n>

Marie, Canada, on a road trip from Minnesota to Montreal, my two teenage children and I were watching the local fireworks over the river separating the USA and Canada.  It was raining on and off with overcast skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the fireworks, I looked off to the SW and noticed and orange light approaching.  As this got closer and easier to see, it appeared to be an orange/red fireball.  It was moving from SW to NE at what I’d describe as the speed of a light plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise and the object did not change shape and finally disappeared out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’d estimate the height between 1700 to 2500 feet.  Whilst I was watching this, I told my kids to look in the direction I was as they were watching the fireworks and hadn’t noticed it yet.  I asked them, “What do you think that is”?<n> <n><n> <n><n> They both looked, turned to me with wide eyes, and both said, that’s the same thing we saw at home in August.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I posted a similar sighting on 8-26-13 of four of these things in Minnesota.  The first sighting still has me baffled and now I’m really intrigued.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These aren’t planes or lanterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After my first sighting I contacted the National Weather Service for wind directions which ruled out balloons etc.  I did get a couple of photos of the first sighting but not this one.<n>

I estimate it was at least 1000 feet up and moving in a perfectly straight line, due North.  I thought it might be a bird until I saw it was a spherical shape that was collapsing then reshaping to a sphere again, over and over.  Solid black. I also thought it might have been a tumbling trash can lid, but it kept constant altitude and a perfectly straight path.  I watched it all the way to at least Trenton until I could see it no more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a link to the video in a DropBox folder.  The video is unedited and straight from my iPhone 5c.<n>

So off the second floor balcony we watched it for approximately 45 minutes more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I watched it with the binoculars (looking northwest), I saw at times it moved vertically, horizontally and even in a circular motion at times, but for the most part it would stay in a fixed position for approximately 5 minutes and then move sporadically in all different directions until it fixed itself onto its next spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had a red &amp; green lights and at times appeared to have white electrical bolts of circular lightning on the surface of the orb.  The red light seemed to rotate in a circular position sometimes skipping one of the circular quadrants.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watch the orbs in the sky and then I noticed a few more of the same types of objects that had the same characteristics but were higher in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky became darker as the time progressed but the initial orb was always in the clear area of the sky.  I then went on my computer to see a satellite image of what was located northwest from my vantage point and found a huge number windmills off a network of roads, kind of like grapes on a vine... covering multiple ridge-tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What spooks me out is that the orb distance and angle of movement leads me to believe they were sucking the power out of the windmills.  With or without the binoculars one could see the orbs move and defy any normal kind of aircraft movement.  In the binoculars it was obvious how fast they changed direction vertically, horizontally and also in circular movement.  We took turns looking at the orb and when I was waiting my tu! rn to get the binoculars back I noticed several more orbs of light... I counted a total of four similar red &amp; green lit orbs....<n> <n><n> <n><n> WOW what a night, I would have never believed it until I experienced for myself!  Like I said I&#39;m an architect and have a great deal of precision in drawing lines and angles...my conclusion is that they were hovering over a field of windmills like bees hovering over flowers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I saw on several occasions, both white haze beams and also a sharp bolts of lightning come from the orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more thing we also even experienced a shooting star about midway through the sighting!  There you go I got to get back to work.....<n>
