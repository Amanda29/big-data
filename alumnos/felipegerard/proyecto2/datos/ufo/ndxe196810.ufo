Yea, I know, Peter!  You can’t understand why anyone would wait to make a report, but I never saw the UFO.  I was the switchboard operator on duty at the base that night.  I was inside.  I knew about it because the base commander at that time put a perimeter around the base. I’m sure there was some kind of protocol, but I don’t even remember that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been so long that I don’t remember if the base commander was Col. Hudson or if he was the wing commander!  I don’t even remember the date!   It could only have been from October 1968 until June or July of 1969. (Hell’s Bells, Peter, I’ve even forgotten the exact date of my discharge!)  I’ve searched your database and there has been no report of the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Loring AFB was a SAC base and there were nuclear weapons stored there.  I know there was an incident in the 70s at Loring, but not the one I am referring to.  The story was that &#34;civilians&#34; had lit balloons and sent them over the base.  I may have been young and ignorant but that was a phony story!  By the way, my husband, who was stationed at Loring also, was on leave when I arrived there in October 1968.  He has no recall of this incident at all!  Which may mean that the incident happened in late October or early November 1968.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now you know why I haven’t reported this incident. I’ve been listening to you on Jeff Rense’s show for years, but couldn’t bring myself to make a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know the date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what the UFO looked like because I didn’t see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m afraid I may be the only person left who wants to know what really happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do what you want with this &#34;report?&#34;  If you put it on your website, you can edit it however you like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I am a 53 yr old professional and still reside in Miami.  As I was playing hide and go seek with neighborhood kids, I noticed a large glowing oblong  light or object that seemed like a fiery fireball, appear from above/behind the now defunct Miami Orange Bowl Stadium, which first appeared smaller as an airplane does when it shines headlights straight on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved from east to west, it took a perfect &#34;L&#34;-shaped turn south towards my neighborhood.  I was next door and ran home and my mom and aunt ( who still lives there and is nearly 80 yrs old), were standing outside and several other neighbors and kids were looking up at this light and were stunned at its appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object flew literally above our neighborhood at maybe 2000 feet high at which time it stopped and turned into a large disk whose &#34;underbelly&#34; started to create a spinning white-bluish light in several perfect puls! es until the end, when it shot a greenish odd light that spun in an almost octagonal shape ( what haunts me most, as that color and light were not from Earth), and then disappeared without a trace leaving a greenish cloud or &#34;smoke&#34; in its place. It made no noise whatsoever.  My mom and I still talk about it and my son makes fun of my story, but to this day, I think about this incident almost daily as I cannot compare this to any thing else I have experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never shared this story before, other than family members but saw similarities to events posted in October 1969 on this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We walked out on the front porch looking for them and approximately at a 90* angle of where we were standing, there appeared a UFO..It was disk in shape with very bright, white, florescent in appearance, lights encompassing the middle of the disk shaped object..the light were illuminating at sporadic intervals in a fast pace around the object. The object was very still in the air for approximately 2 minutes as we watched in awe.It made no sound at all.   Suddenly from out of no where, another disk shaped object appeared and hovered next to the first one. This UFO identical to the first one.   The first one, as if waiting for this second one, tilted slightly and off it went into the yonder with the other one following. Needless to say, my stepmother and myself looked at each other as this strange occurence took place and said &#34;do you see what I see?&#34; We never reported this to anyone as we figured no one would have ever listened, let alone, believed it.  Till this day we still talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

When we turned down to Lake Parker drive past the Lakeland High School we saw a saucer/disk flying object in the sky.  It had rotating lights.  We continued on Lake Hollingsworth drive to Cleveland heights boulevard where we travelled south past the cleveland heights high school.  Off of Cleveland heights we parked to drop off my fathers friend.  We parked the car and got out and watched the object for about 15 minutes.  It made no noise. No humming, no sound. We thought this was very unusual. We went inside the friends house for a short time. When we left the friends home, the flying saucer/UFO was gone.  The next day in the Lakeland Ledger Newspaper, their was a headline on the paper which said. &#34;What was that object over LakeLand last night&#34;.  This is factual, and documented.  My husband and I are conservatinve people.  We are in our 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s.  I am not certa! in about the day.  But am fairly certain the event happened in October.  But most likely in the fall.  This narrative summary above is being reported by my son in law with my permission. I wish to remain anonymous.  Please refer to the 1968 Lakeland Ledger files.  Possibly this is on Microfiche?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The community is well populated.  I was at my upstairs bedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I saw an oval shaped object in the sky.  It might have been 200 ft above the light poles. It was light gray in color with a red light about a 45-degree angle from the craft. The craft was spinning but in the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sounds were heard.  It hovered over this hamburger stand for at least 50 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During that time it shined a bright light from the front of the craft down towards the people below.  It stayed on about a minute or two.  About six times the craft would fly very fast off towards the west.   All you could see in the distance would be the red light disappearing.  As soon as you turned away to talk to someone, it would fly right back.  Each time it went out toward the far distance it would come back just as fast as it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to hover over the stand for about 5-10 min each.  Then it would fly very far out, and come back again and hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about an hour of this back and forth, it finally went away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I went back  to the building and again I changed my mind ,I was so young and who would beleive me  if by the time we got back there it would be gone.So I turned around and went back to the spot and watched the object, it was still there. I continued to look around for anyone to appear ,no one did and I finally left and went home.I got home about 15 min. later and woke my dad and told him what happened .He asked me if anyone else was around, I said no, so he said go to bed and forget it, no one would beleive me anyway.My father died in 1988 and he was right,no one ever has believed me.I have never since seen another craft like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We knew this was no street light beacuse it was too high in the air.  The light did this movement for several minutes then began moving from side to side. There was no noise but we believe it was too far to hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it to be a helicopter until it stopped, became brighter, appearing larger then split into two equal size lights approximately an inch apart from our viewpoint which would have made it several yard apart.  These two lights began moving up and down in unison for severl minutes then stopped and began moving from side to side in unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes of this they stopped, moved towared each other and became as one bright star again then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then, I have had two other people tell of similiar sightings from several years apart and different areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It had multi colored rotating or changing lights around the circumference about six feet wide.The colors were orange/red/blues constantly changing.There was no noise ,sound,or wind.It was a perfectly clear night with stars but I do not remember the phase of the moon.I got out of my 56  chevy and looked up at it [WITH MY GLASSES ON] trying to see if i could see anyone or anything in the lighted area for about 10 or15 sec. but all it was were the multi colored lights. The object then started moving slowly overhead to the west then increase speed to be a dot and gone out of sight or sped off and just disappeared. It did move quite a way in any event before going away. It was thrilling to see it. I did not seem to lose any time while this occured or seem to be affected by it.But some years later on the show The Greatest American Hero on I think the second episode the y portrayed the same craft, lights, and the way it went out of sight. I would say exactly, so I always assumed that there must be many others who had seen this oject because it would be difficult to exactly imagine the object I saw, But then again who knows? It was interesting that when I got home I woke my father up and told him what I saw and he said it must have been a helocopter. He was the director of tracking for NASA.The next year or so after he was one of 17 scientist scheduled to go to Woods Hole to discuss Phenomina in the Bermuda Triangle. He passed on right before the meeting and the first Moon Landing I might add. The Fellow who,s house I saw the object over died of cancer at an early age, but the rest of his family are living fine.<n>

Distance at sea from a sailboat at night is imperceptible,so fearing collision with a larger ship, I &#34;came off the wind&#34; to slow speed.  The orb,not as large as the moon would appear, shot dead across the dimly lit horizon, toward the starboard-quarter in a split second.  There was no trajectory nor trail of flames like a rocket.  It simply passed at an incredible speed. No one to whom I&#39;ve spoken had any explanation for this observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, my family, two crew members &amp; I were enroute to Hawaii from Newport Beach, CA.

The lights moved north together at the speed of small planes. When they reached a N.N.E. position, both objects very suddenly performed a 75-degree ascent at an extremely high rate-of-speed, and disappeared almost instantly.

A white, non-blinking light was first sighted low on the visible horizon, S.E., about 1-and-1/2 to 2 miles distant and moving slowly from east to west. The light traveled to a position due south of us (still 1-and-1/2 to 2 miles distant) and stopped. Then light then grew larger and brighter, and we had the impression it was moving north toward us. Suddenly, it vanished. At the same instant, another light (or the same light - changed in appearance) appeared just above the tree line, about 200 feet S.S.W. of us. This was a steadily-glowing orange light, that revolved slowly around its vertical axis, revealing a consistent &#34;gourd&#34; shape - about 60 to 80 feet in length. It continued hovering and slowly rotating for about 2 minutes, and then slowly descended behind the tree line. The light was not visible after its descent. We then heard something run along (inside?) the tree line, from the position where the light descended to a position due south of us. We immediately left the area. At no time did the orange light emit any sound, heat, or other sensation. Total witnesses: 2 adults (my father and my junior-high English teacher) and 6 to 8 boys (my classmates and my younger brother). Sighting never reported.<n>

He was plowing this field and he got the feeling that he was being watched.  The tractor had its headlights on and he looked around, but did not observe anything at ground level.  He looked above the tractor as he reached the end of the field and observed a large cigar shaped vehicle hovering motionless above the tractor as he did his turn around.

When it was almost directly overhead at about 5000 ft.(estimated), it stopped dead in its tracks.  We could see that the bottom of the object was silvery and kind of ossilated slowly from green to red to maroon across this silvery &#34;underbody&#34; of the object...at the three points of the triangular object where reddish orange lights that sometimes turned to a greenish color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After sitting motionless and soundless for about a half a minute, it made a slow 180 degree turn leaving a vapor trail.  After making the slow and perfect turn, the object again sat motionless for a few seconds, and then took of straight and level at an icredible speed  &#34;in a flash&#34; it reached a point about 15 miles east of us just above the horizon.  Again the object stopped dead for about 10 seconds , then when straight up at incredible speed until it went out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this had all taken place, we noticed that the vapor trail was still disapating directly overhead in the atmosphere where the object had made the 180 degree turn around.  This vapor trail seemed identical to that which you see when a high altitude aircraft leaves a vapor trail.  This trail widened, and distorted over a period of about 3 minutes or so.  Our observation was that the original vapor trail formed an absolutely perfect 180 Degree semi circle..  No vapor trail was caused by the craft when it was excelerating away from us or toward us...  Only during the perfect turn...<n> <n><n> <n><n> During all of this there was never any sound coming from the object..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I grew up on a farm in eastern South Dakota. My uncle was traveling to his home near Nunda, South Dakota a very small elevator town near Brookings, South Dakota. He had been helping my father cut silage on our farm near Volga, South Dakota. My uncle Gene, said that the object at first looked like a bright star in the southeastern sky. The object then grew in size rapidly and appeared to be coming at him on a pependiclar vector. Then it was very close to him as he was driving over a hill about two miles from where he lived. It was huge now and hovering over a swamp. At first my uncle didn&#39;t know what to make of the object. He stopped his car which was a 1959 Ramble Station Wagon. He got out and studied the craft which was about 800 yards away. It was saucer shaped emitting a very bright pinkish red light. He could see what looked like bars connecting the two saucers together. In between the bars were windows and he could see aliens inside looking back at him. This terrified him and he got back into his car and sped off for home. The craft was about 1/4 mile off to his left and kept up with his speed. Then my uncle had to turn left and the craft went over his car at that point and out over his farmland. As soon as my uncle reached home he called my father and told his story. We went outside and sure enough in the distance off in the southwest just above the horizon was a red object. My father and I watched it for about 10 minutes until it suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> didn&#39;t know what to make of the object. He stopped the car he was driving which was a 1959 Rambler station wagon. He got out of the car and studyed the object. It was emitting a very bright pinkish red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was shaped like two discs on on top of the other inverted and connected with what looked to him like bars of metal. To his astonishment there was an area in between the bars there was windows and behind the windows he could see aliens looking back at him. This jolted him back into his car and he sped off the last two miles home. The object kept up with his car and stayed probably a 1/4 mile to his left. He had to turn south at the next intersection and at this point the craft went over him out over his farm land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested additional reports from the uncle and father.

Fall was dry so need for pumps in the strip mine after a rain was nill, but pumps needed to be maintained.  My detail from the shop of 6 men including me went towed in 3 pumps that needed to be oiled and lubed up.   We were driving down the pit when one of the guys noticed the german wheel excavator had stopped digging, its lights got real dim as we appeared over the rim.  Our two way radio did notwork, all there was static. Another man noticed a disc with an orange halo around it.  It was moving real slow.  Me and my crew was scared and tried to call the whhel shovel but all we got was static, 4 hours would be the shift change.  At shift change, the drivrr noticed an unusual lighted object that came closer to the german wheel excavator.  it was disc about 50-100 ft across and domed tounded on top.  Very creepy, it then disappeared.  We drove by a relay station (pwer booster station).   Something had blown out, could smell it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> later we saw on Route 116 a police car travelling extremely fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retrired coalminer, Koean war veteran , and college grad.  This no joke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We would like to invite the other witnesses to submit reports, as well, but the witness provides no contact data, so we are unable to communicate with him.

10/1/68 15:00|Lima (Peru)||Circle|2-5 minutes|It hovered over the park for several minutes then suddenly took off at incredible speed.|7/13/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44925.html|21|ndxe196810| It hovered over the park for several minutes then suddenly took off at incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never told this to anyone until now except for close relatives.  This happened when I was 14 years old, but I remember it vividly to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was visiting my aunt and uncle who lived in Lima, Peru in South America at the time.  I had gone up to the balcony of their home.  Across the street was a large park about 4 city square blocks. I had climbed on to the balcony to look down at the park to see if I could spot any of my friends playing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I did so I saw that everyone in the park, and there were many people, were all looking up, so I looked up as well.  As I did I was so startled that at first I thought the sun was crashing down upon us, but in that split second I realized that what I was looking at was stationary and was not going to crash on top of us.  Then I realized I was seeing a circular material object that was very huge and bright white. It was hovoring over the trees at very close range.  It was at least the size of the park itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It cast a huge shadow over the park.  It hovered there for what seemed several minutes.  It seemed to be spinning quite rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, suddenly out of the blue it took off at incredible speed and disappeared.  I was stunned I was not sure what I had just witnessed, but eventually I came to the realization that it must have been some type of space ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked back down at the park no one was looking up, and everyone seemed to be going about there business as if nothing had happened.  This was something that impressed me a great deal, because at that age I was hardly interested in UFO&#39;s or any such thing.  I was a typical 14 year old kid. UFO&#39;s were the last thing on my mind.  It left me completely dumb founded for quite some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>
