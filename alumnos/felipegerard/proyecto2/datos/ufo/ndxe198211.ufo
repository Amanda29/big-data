We just arrived about 12 miles up the beach from the beach entrance to camp at around midnight so we could meet friends in the morning at our favorite spot and avoid morning beach traffic from Houston where we lived at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A flashing light was in the rear view mirror just as we parked. The area behind us was swamp so it couldn&#39;t be a land vehicle that was approaching us and it seemed to be blinking at that distance. I scrambled for my camera when it became clear that it was something tumbling toward us but I only had daytime 100 ASA film in my 35mm Nikon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up from the van, I saw what was an oblong, still silent craft covered entirely with triangular windows and thin black frames around them as it slowly tumbled with no visable means of propulsion or wings, it never made a sound and always maintained the same distance from the ground. It was about two telephone poles off the ground and stood about two telephone polls in height which was easy to determine since there were telephone poles to compare to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Roughly football shaped, each window was back lit with a different soft pastel color. As it came over the power lines nearly directly above us it took a sharp 90 degree turn, tumbling only in the direction it was traveling and followed the power lines up the beach northward and disappeared into the distance. It was literally a stones throw from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We scrambled out to see what would happen next and nothing further took place. BUT! The next morning when it was about to become noon after our friends arrived, we were to go to 7-11. I joked about the UFO sucking the battery dry when the van wouldn&#39;t start. My friend said there was a flashlight with new batteries in the glove box and sure enough the flash light batteries were drained too!  Really creeped us out but it was awesome at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years I&#39;ve shared my experience with friends and received awe, and at times skepticism, but it&#39;s always been important to me to come forward. One friend who was a UFO buff said that my description only represented about ten percent of all sightings he had read about and that never had anyone been that close to this particular type of craft. Cigar and saucer shapes were far more common.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still have a sketch of it I made the following day after I returned home. I could say that is was a religious experience for me.<n>
11/15/82 20:00|Fremont|OH|Light|1 minute|Silent, invisible craft, shoots blue beams of light on friend and I.|5/29/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89154.html|3|ndxe198211| Silent, invisible craft, shoots blue beams of light on friend and I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the autumn of between 1980 and 1982 my friend and I witnessed an event that still baffles me to this day.  We were both 12 to 14 at the time and were standing by an open lot next to his house located a hundred yards from my house.  This lot is located on top of a valley that downtown Fremont is located in.  Going from the lot to the bottom of the valley is approximately 40ft.  While standing there talking the trees lining to top of the lot starting moving violently, as though a hard wind was blowing down on them.  A light slowly came up from the valley and was shining through the tree line.  My first thought was that a helicopter was approaching and conveyed this to my friend.  But, there was no noise, the craft, or whatever it was, was completely silent.  As the light approached the top of the tree line it went out and the trees stopped moving.  A few seconds later a blue beam of light (I am getting goose bumps even to this day typing this) shown directl! y on my friend.  The beam of light was perfectly cylindrical in shape, as though a glass tube was directing the light down.  The light shown on him for maybe 2 to 3 seconds and then went out.  A second later the beam of blue light shown on myself but for only for a second, went out and once again shown on my friend for perhaps another second or two and again went out.  There was no indication of a craft.  We did not see the outline of one, hear any noise coming from one, and no indication of a craft leaving the area after the final beam of light.  We were both petrified as we stared at each other for a few seconds.  My friend ran to enter his house, and being dark I was absolutely terrified of the hundred yard run I had to perform to return home.  I immediately proceeded to sprint home faster than I ever have.  I told my mother of the incident but she seemed skeptical at best.  For most of the night I stood at the landing of the stairs looking out the window trying to make ! sense of what had happened.  My mother had to tell me a few ti! mes to g et to bed.  The next morning my mother noticed that I had a peculiar color to my skin, as though I had been sun burnt.  Every exposed area of my skin was visibly red with what appeared to be a light sun burn.  My mother stated that perhaps I did have something unusual happen that night.  My friend also had the same sun burn like pattern on him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two weeks later my mother showed me an article in the local newspaper of others seeing strange lights in the night sky although none exactly as the encounter my friend and I had.  My friend and I did not speak of the incident again until we were in our late 20â€™s.<n>

I was in the Coast Guard on the C. G. cutter Valiant, which was (is?) stationed in Galveston Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were going to Norfolk, Virginia, for some battle training at the naval shipyard there. I was usually put on lookout, since I had very good eyes back then. I think we were off the coast of Miami (anyway, I remember it as being in the Bermuda triangle) and I saw a light come down from the clouds.  I was looking north, and this light came from the west and landed on the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds later, I saw the light continue flying east and up and into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dismissed this as a water plane landing on the ocean at the time, but wondered why it only took a few seconds to fly off again.  Then again, it could have been a helicopter that just idled near the water.  It was too far away to know for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing about this trip, is that on another watch in the Bermuda triangle, I was told to report all boats and ships in the area because there where multiple contacts on the radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought the guys were pulling my leg, because it was a clear night and the moon was shining bright, but there was nothing but smooth water on the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I switched shifts to steer the ship, sure enough there was multiple contacts on the radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought maybe a school of whales, but we never saw any break the surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I witnessed a UFO when young. It was ring shaped but changed size and shape with a blue/gray translucency. It slowly went thru the bare treetops. I experienced several changes after this event. I also saw a small hovercraft at another time soon afterwards. I beleive it was of US Military in type. It hovered over a small pine wood ridge in the forest. Later in life I witnessed with another person, a group of triangular lighted crafts at night time and had an experience with a &#34;man in black&#34;. The crafts were located over Shea&#39;s Monument in Mass. I am not using &#34;Word&#34; and I am only sending this due to future events that will occur before the end of this year. Do not contact me except in person if you need to. My family does not know so I do not want phone calls, emails or other intrusive communications.

11/1/82 00:00|East Texas River|TX|Egg|10 minutes|Four witness huge craft in East Texas.|11/20/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04754.html|9|ndxe198211| Four witness huge craft in East Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of this occurrence, my brother was 24 years old. My brother&#39;s fiance&#39;, my husband and I were all 21 years of age. My brother, sister-in-law, and myself all have IQs above the 98th percentile, are college educated, and are in business administration, mainframe programming, and systems engineering, respectively. My brother, his fiance&#39;, my husband and I were riding around in the county back roads late at night with my brother at the wheel, some fifteen miles from the nearest town. We decided to park the car at the end of a dead end road, a well known spot to the local young people, near the river bottom. Facing in a northerly direction, directly in front of the car was a pasture, then virtually miles of undeveloped &#34;bottom&#34; land covered in timber and underbrush, and used for nothing other than an occasional hunt. As we sat there in the car, talking and listening to the radio, we began to notice a faint glow quite some distance away, which formed a semicircle above the tree line which we were facing. As we watched, the glow began to brighten, and slowly a very large egg shaped object began to rise from the forest at a distance of approximately three to four miles from our location. As the object began to move in a SSE direction (and closer to us), I became extremely nervous and began to ask my brother to leave. Moving very slowly some 100 yards above the earth (judging by the proximity of the 60 ft oaks),  and glowing white much like a huge florescent street light, it had no visible windows, lights, portals, or attachments of any kind. The others in the car at first seemed very curious at this sight, and were wanting to stay and watch it. I, however, was insistent that we leave immediately, and I soon convinced my brother to start the car. In order to leave the area, as we were on a dead end road, we had to travel due east approximately one mile to the intersection, and then travel south back toward town. As we began to approach the intersection, the object had traveled just to the SSE of the intersection, and had stopped and was hovering in mid air for a moment, and then reversed it&#39;s course as if to meet us at the intersection. We were moving down this small, dark backroad at an incredible speed, and as we reached the intersection, the object had almost reached it as well. The only sound that was emitted was a strange, barely audible humming noise. It was at this point that we realized that this &#34;ship&#34; was approximately the length of a football field, and twice the width. As we rounded the corner of the intersection and began heading south, the object redirected it&#39;s course as well, and began heading south directly behind us at a distance of some three hundred yards. I watched out the back window as we sped down the road, all the while yelling at my brother to &#34;Hurry Up!&#34;, and in and instant this huge object literally zipped into the sky so fast that I could not distinguish it from the stars. I continued to look for it, and soon, I watched as it moved slowly in a horizontal direction, then reversed and rapidly danced around the sky in all directions for several moments. I lost track of it at this time due to the tree limbs rushing by overhead. Judging by the size of the object as I had observed it previously, it had managed to ascend to an altitude of some 30,000 feet or so in a split second, without any increase in noise level. The most bizarre part, in my opinion, is that we had spoken about the occurrence immediately after it occurred but after that night I was the only one who mentioned it again. A week or so after this event,  my husband and I had joined some friends at the lake, where they had a small bonfire and party. I was sitting on the tailgate of our pickup and again it was a very clear night. I noticed something move in the sky, and began to tell our friends of the experience we had had the previous weekend. As I started to recount the story, I began to feel extremely nervous, and decided to drink a beer to calm down. As I began to cross the parking area toward the beer cooler, I felt the most excruciating pain of  my life. In mid stride, several yards from where I began, I felt as if a bomb had exploded in my head. I had collapsed on the ground and was throwing up from the intensity of the pain. My husband picked me up and loaded me into the pickup, then drove to my parents house just a few miles away. I laid on the den floor, still sick and in extreme pain, while my father applied ice packs to my head and waited for my mother (a nurse) to return from work. A couple of hours and narcotic pain killers relieved the pain. I didn&#39;t mention the ufo incident to anyone again for over ten years, strictly out of fear. Over a decade later, after thinking of that night again and again, I mentioned something to my sister-in-law about &#34;the time we saw the ship&#34;, and literally watched the hair stand on her arm. She had an incredible look on her face, as she told me that she had not thought of that night since it had happened. She wondered how she could have forgotten such a sight, and shuddered as she relived it. Based on this, I then asked my brother (now her husband), the same question. Again, the same response. In over ten years together, neither of the two had thought of that night until I had brought it up, and then all the details rushed over them as if it had happened yesterday. My husband and I were divorced just thre! e years after this occurrence, and he had never mentioned it to me in those three years. I have thought of  contacting him to ask the same question. I have always had full recollection of  the entire episode, and have remained silent due to fear. I wonder why I remembered and they did not.<n>
