8/27/82 01:00|Southwest Harbor|ME|Cylinder|75 minutes|Two crafts taking or dumping water|10/23/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103340.html|1|ndxe198208| Two crafts taking or dumping water<n> <n><n> <n><n> I report here a pretty intense story told to me in July of 1984.  I was having dinner with two friends in Brookline Massachusetts and in the midst of dinner we were discussing vacations and places we had gone to for vacations as children.  I told them how my family would travel from Vermont to Owl&#39;s Head, Maine, for several weeks in the summer.  I mentioned that a cousin of mine had a restaurant in Southwest Harbor and how my parents would take us there for occasionally while we were staying in Owl&#39;s Head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, the mention of Southwest harbor seemed to change the tone of both of my hosts.  They exchanged anxious looks and became quiet.  I noticed they continue to look at each other but not say much, and one of them, asked the other if he wanted to tell me.  They agreed they did, and here is what they told me:  In late August of 1982 my friends rented a small house on Goose Cove in Southwest Harbor, Maine.  I should say first that both of these men are serious and sober not given to storytelling or having a fascination with the occult or paranormal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They described the place being on the north-northeast side of Goose Cove and described a daytime view out to the ocean straight ahead of their house.  They could, at night, see lights in houses on the east side of the cover and the west side but said it was very woody and not densely settled.  They had a rental for a couple weeks.  Towards the end of their stay on what was a Thursday night, they had gone to bed early.  The house was a story and a half with two small bedrooms on the second floor.  A stairway separated the two bedrooms and at the bottom of the stairs was the front door leading to the porch which faced Goose Harbor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point they both woke up hearing a humming sound and bright lights coming up the center stair from the windows in the front door. The light moved up and down and side to side a bit and the humming sound had some variation in pitch. They described the light looking like it might be coming from a helicopter search light but without the sound of helicopter engines. The time was shortly after 1:00 am making it now early Friday morning.  After more than ten minutes they got up the nerve to go downstairs to see what they could see. About 400 feet in front of the house there was a large metal object, a low cylinder, in a proportion like a tuna fish can but dark gray with yellow-white lights on it. It was flying about 45 feet above the surface of the water. The lights were redirected to the surface of the water and the volume and pitch of the hum dropped. Next they could hear and see a column of water beneath the object. Both were unsure whether water was being sucked up from ! the ocean or being dumped into it. This continued for over half an hour. A bit after 1:45 am they heard a higher pitch, and within a few minutes the cove became brighter like early dawn. Soon they could see lights coming from above and saw a second object like the first. It came down level with the first one and hovered southwest of the first object with a distance of about 50 feet. Its lights redirected to the water surface and the pitch and volume of sound lowered and then it too began to drop or suck up water in a cylinder form. They watched this from their window on the first floor of the house for about 35 or 40 minutes. Then the fist object moved about 1000 feet into the cove away from the house. Soon the second object aligned itself above the first and together they began to rise up at the same speed and then hovered together about 400 to 500 fet above the water. Then the hum returned to a high pitch and they lifted upward very fast and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They checked to see if there were lights on in any of the other houses and saw none. They went upstairs and packed. At about 5:00 am there was decent light to carry luggage to the truck and they packed up and headed home to Massachusetts. They did not call or visit the police station. They drove to Cape Cod where they spent the rest of the weekend with the parents of one of the men. These parents had seen a UFO together in the late 1950s on Cape Cod. The following morning deer looked into the kitchen windows at them.<n>

About 13 staff from Camp Red Pine were sitting around a bon fire beside Golden Lake.  Suddenly one person spoke up and said look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There in the sky was a sideways, teardrop shaped &#39;thing&#39;, a florescent green color, sitting in the sky.  We all froze. We watched.  It proceeded to move ever so slowly horizontally through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 14 or 15 seconds went by.  It then turned upward(?), with  the teardrop rounded end facing down.  Then, without even a flash it went straight up and disappeared.  It was out of sight in a second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound. There were no &#39;lights&#39; per say, just this florescent coloring around this teardrop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WE all remained silent for another 10 or 20 seconds, then it was pretty much a &#39;What was that!?&#39; from us all!  That&#39;s it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five or six years earlier my father saw the same type of thing near Gooderam, Ontario.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was during deer hunting season, so i guess thats late October.  This sighting was early afternoon.  About 10 seconds it was in view.  We didn&#39;t see it go straight up or vanish, it just went out of our sight.  We tried to find it again in the sky, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/20/82 23:30|Fowlerville|MI|Oval|15 minutes|Silent Object over Fowlerville with  Revolving Lights|11/20/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26149.html|3|ndxe198208| Silent Object over Fowlerville with  Revolving Lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event happened approximately 20 years ago, but still is quite vivid in my memory.  Was traveling with my family in the late summer of 1982.  Was driving north on I-75 near Monroe, MI with my father and brother in the front of the vehicle when they saw an object in the sky with lights, which did not resemble an airplane.  The object was either moving slowly or not at all, but could not tell for sure because of our moving vehicle.  My mother and I were both in the back and did not see this.  Approximatly 1 hour later we were now traveling on I-96 westbound and were approaching the Fowlerville exit, when my father and brother had said that they could see that light again.  This time time all four of us saw the light and we stopped the vehicle along the expressway and got out to view this.  We estimated that this object was between 1/2 to 1 mile away and maybe 300-500 feet in the air.  We could not distinguish any type of outline to this object, but it did have a revolving or running style light. From our current viewpoint, it appeared to be a line of lights.  Also, we could hear no noise from this object.  We watched this for approx 5 minutes and then got back in our vehicle and drove to the highway exit and followed this object until we were directly under it.  The object was moving very slowly and we stopped our vehicle and stuck our heads out to view this.  From this angle, the lights appeared to be on the bottom perimeter of the object and formed an oval shape.  The lights also were still moving in a continual revolving or running style.  Also, there still was no sound from this object, even though we were directly below it.  We viewed this time for only a minute until it dissappered from our view over the tree tops.   As I remember, it was a clear night and there was a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was flying from Fresno to LA, I know it wasn&#39;t a dream  because I never sleep on flights. I&#39;m scared to fly, we were descending into Los Angeles When I noticed outside my window (near the Wing!) two metallic Balls. The 1st object was 20 times bigger then the other one, it was the size of a one car garage. The tiny one was as big as a medicine ball. It circled the big one like the rings of Saturn. They both moved in sink, they were going as fast as the airplane and at the same time seem to swivel in miniature circles (perfectly in sync).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I gazed into the big one, it seem to gaze right back at me, it looked like the &#34;Death Star&#34; from Star Wars. It had a electronic boards imbedded in it&#39;s texture and it had a few lights, I think I remember both of them having tiny antennas. These objects seemed to be checking out the plane, the pilot had to of noticed. The Beverly Hills YMCA had reserved the airplane for Summer camp that year. We had just ended our trip to the Sierra Mountains. The plane was packed with little kids and a couple of staff. Everyone had been sleeping on the plane accept me and a 6year old next to me. I yelled to a counselor after I caught my breath, he was pissed because I had woke him. He yelled &#34;what now?&#34; Your going to get it. As he came down the isle he kept grumbling, I stared out the window, the UFO kept spinning very fast as the tiny one orbited it. He bent down to look while he stood over me. On my right was the UFO and on my left was the counselor, I watched is eye&#39;s start to meet with the window. I looked quick to my right, as the objects started to rip away faster then two blinks of an eye, they were gone and he was not convinced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got in trouble that week for lying.

Was home in my bedroom and couldn&#39;t sleep because it was a very humid summer night. Stood by the open window and looked at the night sky (north). I saw a very bright green circular object larger than the size of a full moon travel from S/E to N/W. This looked like a &#34;glow in the dark&#34; type of green. It was so bright that it left a green streek of light behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen shooting stars before but they were always pin points of light that quickly shot across the sky and burned up. This was huge and traveled much slower. My window was open and the object made no noise. The only thing I could think of was that it might be an meteor that graised off the atmosphere and skipped back into space. From what I understand if it was a meteor up close, it would be traveling faster then the speed of sound and I should have heard a sonic boom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We lived on the water next to Absecon Bay. I was coming down my street(which was a culdisack) and as I approached my driveway looked across the bay and saw a large purple sphere at about 45 degrees. I pulled in my driveway and watched this thing for a couple of minutes then went into the house to wake up my wife. She came outside and asked what was going on, when I told her to look in the sky and tell me what she is looking at. That &#39;s when she was shccked. As we observed this large purple object, two smaller orange objects came out from each side of it and just hovered, I wish that I had a camera, but no luck. As we watched they were gone in a flash. No sound, no trails, just disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I woke up at 3:45 am to go to work and went out side to retrive my sneakers and a funny feeling came over me to look up at the sky so I did and when I did I seen the strangest thing that I have ever seen in my life. It was a giant sphere object that was blue in color and had these whiteish transparent humanoid things swarming inside the object. I just froze with a chill though out my body. After snapping out of it I went inside to wake my friend she came outside looked up and froze because their was a two more objects the first one was the same the other and the third was white with a rainbow of diffrent colors. We were both trans fixed on them. Also had time loss. l lived near the ocean . Checked out the objects no projections or clouds or gases called the radio station and had another report of the same sighting from another person was going to report it to the police but they would not belive us. As far as calling the Air Force they would tell us it was some sort of weather ballon. So thats why we called the Radio station. Who do you go to for help in knowing what these are. I was I was very late that day going to work it seems that time was slowed down and while seeing these objects there were no dogs barking or birds chriping it was like a dead calm . I had to go to work eventuly when at work I was reluctant to mention anything about my incounter but Isaid to myself what do i have to lose. So I told two coworkers about the objects that I have seen. they told me they have seen the same objects but from a far distance accelerating at very high speed going up ward. To this day I&#39;ll never forget what I have seen I remember it like it happen yesterday and I now know we are not alone in the universe . You have to ask yourself what you belive in like what is god is god human?  Or is god of extraerrestrial origin. Are we the only life forms in the whole galaxies because we don&#39;t know where the universe begins or where it ends. One time in histroy people though the world was flat until someone proved otherwise. Some say it imposable to travel to far away planets because it would take forever. But intelligent life would use a diffrent way to travel by manipulating time and space because they are far more advanced than we are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Then it moved like a humming bird off to my right,in a instant. I stood wondering what i just seen, i turned around facing south, looked up into the sky when i saw three real bright lights behind the clouds move one right after another in a eastward direction.The next day i told the coworker what i seen after he pulled out of parking lot last night.

8/13/82 00:30|Littleton (I think)|MA|Rectangle|6-7 minutes|Football-field-sized, soundless, rectangular object with lights on bottom, over northeastern Massachusetts|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17759.html|14|ndxe198208| Football-field-sized, soundless, rectangular object with lights on bottom, over northeastern Massachusetts<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving back to Chelmsford MA from Lawrence MA with a friend.  It was approximately 00:30 on a summer evening in 1982.  We were heading south on Rte 495.  There was a normal amount of light traffic for this area and time of evening.  We both saw an unusual light in the sky, far off.  It was obviously not a star (too large and too yellow) and not a street or highway lamp (we could see others) and it was moving towards us.  I believe it was in the sky on the driver&#39;s side of the car.  It was not alarming, but continued observation for several minutes piqued our curiosity, because it was clearly moving, becoming larger in our sight.  It was kind of a feeling like, &#34;what the hell *is* that?&#34; I remember that we reached a point of wanting to stop the car and observe it for a while.  It moved to a position where it was too high over us for me to see and I began looking for an exit to get off the highway so we observe.  My friend, during this time, had been craning his neck to look up through the windshield to keep track of the thing.  Finally, he leaned way out of the window and looked over the car.  He was in this position when I took the next exit, which I believe took us to a little-traveled portion of Rte 110.  I heard him exclaiming like, &#34;whoah!&#34; out the window.  Almost immediately, I stopped the car on the side of the road and we got out.  I remember that it was extraordinarily, strangely quiet -- I mean, no other cars, no activity evident in the nearby houses.  I looked up, and the thing was right above us.  I&#39;m bad a judging size and distance, but it was an enormous platform-looking thing to me with lights (I don&#39;t remember the color or if there was any flashing) on the bottom, mainly around the perimeter, I think -- I vaguely remember seeing the edges as darker than the light-polluted sky.  Because it was a good 200 to 600 feet up (I really don&#39;t know), the rest of it was dark, and the sky was dark, I got the impression, from the lights, that it was rectangular, although my friend later said t! hat he t hought it was diamond shaped.  Anyway, the thing appeared to be immense, like the size of a football field, or maybe 75% of that, I don&#39;t know.  A feeling of shocklike amazement hit me immediately, because something like this simply was not in my experience, which may help explain why I couldn&#39;t judge its size or height in better than the general terms given.  I felt transfixed (not by any outside force, but by surprise and emotion).  I glanced around, expecting to see cars stopped on the road and people hanging out of every window, gazing in awe and perhaps panicking at the sight of this thing, but there was no one, no disturbance whatsoever, no cars passing on the nearby tressel.  The object made no sound at all.  I remember standing there, staring up at it with my friend, just staring for another ten or twenty seconds, and it started to move away from us, just a bit, slowly -- then suddenly it accelerrated at an alarming speed (I don&#39;t know if it was an &#34;impossible&#34; speed, but it was not like anything I&#39;d ever seen), I mean, it just zipped away.  We seemed to be able to continue to observe it as an indistinct light, as we had seen it at first, for a while, but then it was gone.  We were left stunned.  One of the most amazing parts of the experience was that I felt no real desire to speak to anyone about it the next day or thereafter.  My friend told me he had felt the same.  Even now, when I mention it, feeling that I had told so-and-so about it before, long ago, they say I didn&#39;t.  It&#39;s a bit weird.  My friend and I discussed it only once or twice thereafter -- this is how I found out that he thought it was diamond shaped, while I had thought it was rectangular.  He concurred with my &#34;football-field-sized&#34; description, to my recollection.  Very, very strange.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it since, and I am unaware of other UFO reports like it.  I have no doubt that it happened, though.  I have never used drugs, by the way, and have never in my life been drunk.  Although I had thought once or twice ! about do ing so in the past, I have never reported this to anyone unknown to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/10/82 22:30|Marysville|CA|Disk|60 seconds|On Aug. 10, 1982, this house size saucer flew close to our car, the occupant  waved, and it flew off.|1/19/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41238.html|15|ndxe198208| On Aug. 10, 1982, this house size saucer flew close to our car, the occupant  waved, and it flew off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, children and I were driving home from a friend&#39;s house, westbound on Feather River Boulevard in the &#34;linda&#34; section of Marysville, cruising about 25-30 MPH when a rapid, strobelike flashing began to reflect off of the tall trees on either side of the road.  The flashing appeared similar to the effect one would see if lighting a white flasher firework on the 4th of July, except that this light just kept flashing brighter and brighter.  We were amazed at how much of the boulevard this was lighting up, and we looked back to see the light that seemed to be coming from behind and above us.  I slowed down to stick my head out of the window opening and look.  What my family and I saw was startling, unbelievable, but undeniable....there it was.  I thought I was going to have to slap myself.  This round, disc-like object, I thought, was something that came maybe from a movie prop?  People weren&#39;t supposed to see this for real,  just in the movies, right?  The very closest description I could give you for this craft is that it was able to hover, it was approx. house-size equivalent, it had a large bay-type, bluish-tinted window with what appeared to be 2 beings standing behind it, looking out towards our direction.  These beings may or may not have been people, but if they weren&#39;t, they were at least darn close.  They wore some sort of dark, wrinkly iniforms I think.  The one on the left I took for a male, and he waved briefly.  The device that was emitting the strobe-light like activity appeared to be a rotating ring of lights on the underside of this craft that were in a mini-structure that was only slightly lower than the ships bottom, or belly, and was round.  I swear I have never written anyone about this before, but you could get a great idea of what this craft looked like if you view one of the old lost in space rerun episodes featuring the jupiter 2, except that some of the edges were only slightly more rounded.  The craft continued its descent, approaching a distance of close to 75-80 feet from us.  At this piont I panicked and floored the gas pedal.  The 383 magnum v-8  in that old plymouth we were riding in reacted by pushing us into our seats and accelerating the car to speeds which didn&#39;t occur to me at the time weren&#39;t road-safe. Now I&#39;m sure the ship could have caught us, but instead abruptly veered off to the right and sped off into the distance.  It seemed to be completely out of sight in an instant. It made no sound as it traveled. Later, we were informed by our local sheriffs dept. that there were more than 300 calls placed about the object at that same time.  A representative told me that our local air force base had been called and had been informed that the air force base had no craft flying in the area at the time.  I was highly skeptical of reported ufo sightings before this took place.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was some things I wanted to add to my report. My mom, a friend, an elderly couple we were riding with, and myself saw this craft. It came in from the north, lowered it&#39;s altitude which had probably been 100,000 ft. to 80,000ft. It hovered for two minutes, then raised back to 100,000 ft., and then flew south and just disappeared. We had just gotten out of Sunday evening church services and had seen this object talking as I stated before. My friend and I talked about it afterward, saying it back to outer space. I was only a kid at the time, eleven years old to be exact, while I believed in life on other planets and in Bigfoot, I did not believe in u.f.o.s until I saw this craft. It was saucer shaped, and was just a bright round object, white in color. We told the church choir director about it the follownig Wednsday, who asked if it was a helicopter, but my mom pointed out it was too high altitude for a helicoptor. I had wanted to tell all this before to this agency but was pressed for time the last time I did this. This is not a cheap gag, nor a tall tale. This is the truth as well as I can remember over the last twenty-one years. The adults were straight laced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Thanks for spending the time to inform your neighbours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I approached you after your presentation and you asked me to write down my question and send it to you.  So, here goes.   I remember an incident where we were uncertain about what we witnessed.   Unfortunately I don’t remember the year this event happened but it may correspond with other reports in your records.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 30 years ago my family and I were camping at Steamboat State Park on Banks Lake.  Steamboat State Park is a large campground; even 30 years ago it had a capacity of 100 or more campsites.  I do remember that it was at an annual family reunion that is always scheduled for the first week of August.  Late in the warm clear summer evening somewhere around 11 pm we finished playing a card game and left our screen tent.  Our entire group immediately noticed what appeared to be an odd looking &#34;vapour trail&#34; in the sky.  It ran from the SE to the NW.  We are all accustomed to seeing vapour trails that are created by jet planes but this one was very different.   It appeared to be much lower in elevation and seemed to generate its own green tinted light.   We know that a vapour trail may pick up light from some other source and reflect it.  To our estimation there was no green tinted light source that would illuminate this trail in the air.   The trail reached from one horizon to the other and was of a consistent color and intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This vapour trail was so unusual that within a few minutes’ people all over the campground were stirring from their campers and tents to view it.  We remember that people were waking their sleeping children to see it.  Many people were so alarmed by it that they went to their vehicles and were scanning the radio stations to see if something dramatic had happened.   Over the next half hour an atmosphere of alarm and fear was felt in the entire campground.  It eventually dissipated and people began to settle down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea of what happened or what caused the trail in the sky, never heard any explanation.   If there is some connection with a sighting in that area I would be interested in knowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time, keep up the good work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) Davenport, WA 509-725-3765<n>

I then suddenly saw a saucer with little square windows all the way around lit up with light. The saucer was flying fairly slow and low to where it was clear of view. The saucer span in circles while moving forward. For example, like if somebody is holding a spinning basketball on their fingure, and walking forward while the ball is spinning. The saucer flew out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I climbed onto the top of my Dad&#39;s camper and was lying on my back, watching the sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a small, bright, white, light moving west to east across the sky at a mediun, steady pace.  Within seconds, a second light appeared to the east of, and slightly above, the first.  This light was round and white, but many times larger than the first, and diffuse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first light continued moving east until it was directly below the second.  There was a brief hesitation, then the first light shot straight up into the second.  When the two lights came together, they both instantly disappeared.<n>

We flew from Cozemel to Chetineatza (sp?) for a day trip. Either my mother or father took this picture. Nothing was noticed by anyone at the time. All most twenty years later I scaned this picture to use as a wall paper on my computor. It was only then I saw the U shaped con-trail just above the pyramid. I make no claims as to what it might be. It does not match any surrounding cloud formations and looks like a con-trail to me but jets don&#39;t leave con-trails like that. I am hopeing some one can analize this picture and tell me what it is. Just below the con-trail there is what looks like a silver object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
