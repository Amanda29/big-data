Looked up , saw what i thought was a reddish star. Didnt think much of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the way back I searched for the same star. It was way off to the right from when i first saw it. Stopped and looked at it for about 30 seconds.  It MOVED SO FAST close to me. It was still high in the sky, but it was SO big. At first I thought it was a star, twinkling. The &#39;Twinkling effect&#39; was really long rows of light coming from the object. I dropped everything and ran because it seemed to be studying me. I was scared. I went outside and it was gone.<n>

It is unusual, in that I have not read too many similar descriptions on your site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Predawn late April, very clear sky - that greenish-yellow light.  Looking eastward from the city of Hayden, Idaho directly above the Lake Hayden.  The mountains around the lake were black in silhouette, appeared three orbs, yellowish/white in a straight line, about one inch apart in appearance.  As soon as I saw them, I pulled over to check it out.  Within five seconds after I stopped the stationary lights/orbs slowly disappeared while in their same location.  The lights faded within four seconds, all at the same time and left a &#34;perforation&#34; circle for each which lasted one second.  Nothing was left in their place - no craft or smoke, just clear pristine air.  Please report back to me on this one.  Has anyone else seen something like this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I had just gotten off the highway.  As I traveled on the winding  back road, off to my left In the distance, I noticed a bright light low in the sky. My first thought was that it was a helicopter.  As I traveled along, I noticed it was going in the same direction as I was,West. I thought It was strange because it was very bright, and not very high in the sky.  I then thought, it must be a helicopter searching for someone.  I lost sight of it behind the trees on the winding road.  about 30 seconds later ,right in front of me just above the tree line I saw a triange shape craft with red and green lights underneath.  I stoped the car, because I could not beleive what I was seeing. It looked like a stealth, but was moving at a crawling speed.  I remember saying to myself it&#39;s not making any noise like plane.  I downed the car window to see if I could hear any noise coming from it , but I heard nothing.  It moved very slow and silent just above the trees toward the northeast.  I wanted to tell someone what I had seen but kept it to myself, because I knew they would think I was crazy.  that  was a little over a month ago.  Then I was on my way home from work again and heard a radio talk show on UFO&#39;s decribe exactly what I had seen.  I was bothered by it so much that I told my daughter and son-in-law. They searched for flying triangles on the internet and found your websight.  We couldn&#39;t beleive that what I had described to them was not only a true UFO sighting, but also had been seen by many others.  My son-in-law said that you had a UFO reporting center to help track sightings.  I decided to send you a report of my sighting. I hope it helps to find out what these flying triangles are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object glowed appeared as a blueish white glow with tints of green and red flickering (almost like a reflection) in the glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft appeared to move with the coast line, then made a tight circle and came out on a tangent from the start of the circles with a slight acceleration. When the craft accelerated, the resorts lights around the massive pool area and surrounding bulidings dimmed for approximatley 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was clear skis with an occasional cloud. There was no sound and this was 30 minutes prior to midnight. The path of the craft was also not part of the Cancun international airports flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the tight cirecle that was made could not have been done by any aircraft that I know except a helicopter or small ultralight which would have made noise considering the night was still with a slight breeze coming in from teh ocean, meaning any sound from the craft would have been audible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the craft had the same appearnce of light from as it approached and flew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something not very typical of aircraft that use a variance of light to signal which way you are looking at the craft. Also, these lights were not flashing but more changing and &#34;fluxing&#34; with frequency.<n>

It did not appear to be illuminated in any way, but more reflective, like a night time cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not tell it&#39;s size because I could not determine it&#39;s altitude.  But it was very visible in the nightime sky.  It was not traveling at very high rate of speed.  There was absolutely no sound from the object.  The object kept a steady flight path, but not a smooth one; rather jerky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been an avid night sky watcher most of my life, enjoying shooting stars and seeing satelites pass over.

Two stars appeared to be moving. They were moving slowly from west to east. One was following directly behind the other and and was to the mind&#39;s eye a distance of between two fingers making a &#34;victory&#34; sign.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In order to rationalize what I was seeing, I wondered if these were two satellites in a linear orbit. I have seen single satellites in orbit both at night and near dusk, but I have never seen one follow the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch, the second light moved southward and caught up with the front light. The two lights then continued to proceed eastward directly in formation (seperated by now the distance between the index and little finger) just above Ursa Major and literally faded from view. A northbound commercial airliner at approximately 25,000-35,000 feet agl on a nortwesterly heading was visible in the lower eastern sky. By comparison, these two objects appeared to be much, much higher than the commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was the most fascinating thing about this sighting was the almost scary ability of the two craft to blend in with the stars. Unless you spotted them and followed their movement, you wouldn&#39;t even think that anything out of the ordinary was occuring in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can still not rationalize what these two objects were, nor how to explain their movements.

The lights were separated by the width of my first and second fingers held at arms length. I called my wife to the deck and she also observed the lights. As we watched the lights move, they appeared to get closer together, although that could have been a function of perspective. When we lost sight of them in the glow of Kansas City at approximately 30 degrees elevation, they were separated by approximately the width of my little finger held at arms length. No direction changes were observed. No anti-colision lights were seen, and I was able to observe stars between the two lights as they traversed the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked JTrack, thinking it was perhaps the ISS with a Progress resupply rocket performing a rendevous, but the ISS was below the equator at the time of sighting.<n>

As soon as we got outside I went to light my cigar and looked up at the stars, as it is a nice clear night sky. At first glance I saw only starry sky, with Venus shining brightly as it always does. Moments later I looked back up and noticed one star acting funny. It seemed to be moving very slowly, and had a glow about it. The glow was very slight, and only appeared behind it in a trianglular shape, as it appears behind meteors and such. I told my friend to look at this point. Seconds later there appeared to be an explosion of some sort, with a funnel shaped cloud resulting. The object still resembled a star at this point, just a small white circle, but moving. A second after this explosion and resulting cloud, the object slowly split into 2 objects. The objects no longer had any smoke trail or halos around it, but kept moving across the sky, very slowly. As the 2 objects moved, they traveled in the same trajectory, while the trailing object moved steadily slower than the first. After what seemed 2 to 3 minutes, the second object became noticeably more distant than the first, and also less bright. As the 2 objects made their way to the other side of the sky, the first object lost its brightness, becoming a fuzzy blur, while the second object faded then reappeared to its previous brightness. A minute later, as they passed further across the horizon, they both faded from view. It should be noted that after the explosion occured they traveled only straight across the sky, rather than downwards toward earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs.

I swear I&#39;m crazy. To tell you the truth, I was sitting at my window... smoking a little weed. Now, I COULDNT be hallucinating. I know it was NOT laced. Anyway I see this shape. It&#39;s night but I see it. It was 3 lights, 2 grouped close in the front and 1 in the back. It was very close also, I thought it was a police chopper at first the height and  the light were too close. I see a light cutting through some fog or something. It looked like a helicopter. It swung the back around but it stayed keeping the light focused. It was light in fog not solid beam or anything. Then the 2 front lights dissappeared and left the back 1. I didnt hear any sound which is strange for how close it was. Then after 30 sec. it looked like it exploded in mid air. Around this time I kept hearing like distant gunshots and I though damn its a car chase and shootout. But the circle. It was round red with a yellow smaller circle inside of it I mean perfectly round. It looked like is stretched out fast not appeared. It stretched from nowhere. It stayed for like 20 seconds or so and I stared at it. And it was almost behing a big tree in my neighbor across the streets yard. But i could see it well. I looked away or blinked or something. it was gone but a light slowly drifted behind the tree. I had seen 4 military jets earlier in the day. MacDilll is south of us or something maybe north. not super far or anything. and it was odd. After the circle I saw jets really high up blinking red and orange. going back and forth 3 or 4 times. Then I looked over and saw otherr jets or something VERY high up to my right. I saw a plane approaching kinda low... enough to hear it and see it close. But there was no soud it went over my house. I thought it was a jet but no sound. it had 5 lights. like the shape of a f16 or such. so i sat there for like 4 minuites watching the sky. i then went outside and saw nothing. so i went inside and watched. i saw out of nowhere a shotting comet. it was like a star but huge like a comet. no sound and faded in and out fast. i watched for a while and just saw the red and orange blinking plane far in the distance. so now im writing this. I still think its crazy, but they&#39;re out there. and thos planes were the government. i swear it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs.

A light in the sky caught our attention, so we decided to stand there and observe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a red light with a tail located in the sky above the field directly across the street from the restaurant.  At first, we thought it was a flare, but quickly dismissed that it wasn&#39;t because it wasn&#39;t moving upwards.  Rather, it was moving very slowly towards our direction.  The tail faded out as the light slowed down to a stop and eventually became a solitary red light.  We watched it for several minutes and during this time, it stayed stationary.  We ran through all of the possibilities of what it could be and we were just stunned having seen nothing like this before.  I even remember looking around the packed parking lot and seeing if anyone else was observing the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to move on because nothing was happening.  After walking a short distance, I thought to myself to just take one more look.  I&#39;m glad I did because what I observed next was shocking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red light had grown into a full-fledged self-contained exploding orb in the sky.  I know that sounds weird, but it&#39;s almost as if the light were in a clear balloon and exploding within the balloon.  There was no sound as this happened either and we thought that was weird.  Next, the bright orb dimmed and became white, then split into three separate white orbs.  Two headed southward and one headed northward.    The two headed southward traveled a short distance until one literally faded out and the other looked perfectly like a star amongst the others in the night sky and just stayed there.  The one headed northward also faded ever so slightly at a slow pace in the sky and also eventually looked like another star in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is what we observed from the time the red light caught our attention until the three orbs faded and blended in with the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch out of Cape Canaveral.

We were scoping out some area to hide in until I looked up and saw what looked like a moving star with symmetrical blue smoke on both sides. The smoke was on moving behind the &#34;star&#34; in a curved shape. I was like, &#34;That can&#39;t be an airplane!&#34; Everyone thought it was the craziest thing they had ever seen! Then all of the sudden, the &#34;star&#34; blew up into two pieces and it looked like a nuclear explosion in the sky. I was thinking &#34;Oh my god, a meteor is going to hit the earth.&#34; But the thing was, it didn&#39;t seem as if it was going to hit us at all. The &#34;star&#34; blew up into two smaller stars and kept on going in a straight line, one star behind the other. They did&#39;nt dissapear at all and kept on going in one straight path. It was the freakiest thing that I have ever seen in my life. I don&#39;t know what the hell it was, but it&#39;s nothing that could have been made by man. It also couldn&#39;t be a meteor because when a meteor hits, it disintegrates. This one just kept on going. I&#39;m wondering if anyone else saw this. It seemed like my friends and I were the only people that saw it.

Event date was 04/29/2005, not 04/28/2005.  Sorry!  Walking out of BJ&#39;s @ Centrum at 9:00pm tonight, I happen to glance southeast towards Jupiter when I see two small, moderately bright (say Mag 0) yellow-white lights about 3-5 moon diameters below it and one moon diameter apart. In an instant I see what at first I think is a firework explosion: a fuzzy ring of yellow-white light around the rightmost light, which expands to about 2 moon diameters in about 5 seconds, then fades out. The two lights move along a line northward, more or less parallel to the horizon, through the eastern sky. The rightmost (trailing) light is &#34;fuzzier&#34; that than the front (leftmost) one. Over the span of about 90 seconds they move about 25-30 degrees to the northeast, before they seem to fade out behind the clouds. During this time the leading light increased its distance from the trailing one to about 5 moon diameters. The trailing light grew less fuzzy over the period of time that I followed it. The velocity of the objects was consistent with either high-altitude airplanes or satellites. The speed, color, and brighness was not consistent with any meteor I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs.

My first reaction was that it was on fire. It did not appear to be a plane since we could see planes in the vicinity and the features on this seemed very different to airplane lights. This supposedly flaming light kept moving towards us for about a minute when suddenly it split into two. Both of the lights were as large and brilliant as the first one had been but now we could see smoke trails coming from them. This lasted for about 10 or 20 seconds when suddenly a third light appeared, this one was very dim and we only saw it because it seemed to be illuminated by the two other lights. At this point we began thinking it was only one object since with the appearance of the 3rd light, it formed a triangular pattern. This triangle suddenly stopped moving towards us and seemed to take a 45-degree path upwards. The Triangle was clearly visible for about 30 seconds when the two bright lights at the bottom disappeared. The smoke that had been emitted from these two bottom lights also stopped. The smaller dimmer one didn’t seem affected by this and kept rising for maybe a minute or 2 minutes longer. It was passing next to a star when suddenly it exploded. This explosion was not as an airplane’s is supposed to be, there was no fire visible but debris seemed to go in every direction and maybe a second after the original explosion a shockwave appeared. The shockwave was bright blue and it moved very quickly, shortly after this we were able to see debris from the explosion falling, very slowly. We were left speechless and wondering what it was. We checked the news outlets but there seemed to be nothing on this. Surely someone else had to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs.

I wish I could draw it for you, but it was like there was an energy being generated and cut, symmetrically both above and below the object that was similar to an angel fish.  Then there was a flash that was literally like an explosion.

We pulled over and what we saw may be a once in a life time thing. This is not a lie!!!! We saw this huge orange light with a tail like a comet coming to hit the earth...then the tail faded away and the orange light grew smaller almost as small as a star in the sky with a even bigger white glow around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this object moves across the sky it all of a sudden divedes into two little star objects. One of the objects continues to move while the other all of a sudden lets of these rings that grow larger around the small object and it seemed as if that object exploded but with no sound. It also seemed like it set of millions of tiny other objects.....or like some type of wave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> we then jump in the car thinking that the world is about to end...this freaked us out..but also excited me...The object that was left then continued to float across the sky....during all this there where several airplains in the sky and I wounder if anyone eles saw this.

When we got outside, there was one glowing red-orange-white orb of flashing light in the distance.  There seemed to be a large hill in the distance and the orb was maybe a few hundred feet above the hill, but it was hard to tell.  It was perfectly stationary for the minute or so it stayed there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The surprising thing was that the people outside said they saw it speed across the sky very quickly to it&#39;s current position and just stop there.  This is where and when we saw the light, which was glowing like a disco ball, but flashing a thousand times faster and much brighter.  We did not see it fly across the sky, but if I had I would have been even more astounded.  I had never seen anything like this before in my life until the summer 2008 when I saw something very similar in Croatia over the Adriatic Sea, amazingly about 30 seconds after I told this story about the Mexico sighting to my sister and cousins in Croatia.  I will post that one as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about one minute, the object slowly dimmed over about a period of 30 seconds and was gone.  The children of the family we were staying with said they have seen orbs of light over the trees in their backyard while they played golf there.  The father said that near or in Cuernavaca there is a hill or mountain where many &#34;hippies&#34; come to visit because of all the strange lights, orbs, etc, and that the Mayans and Aztecs both thought this hill was of special importance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

They were both kind of zig-zagging back and forth as they moved forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they both stopped in mid-flight and three more of them seemed to come out of the larger one. There was four of the smaller ones flying a circle around the larger more-bright one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They all stopped after about 5-6 seconds and parted separate ways.

At first he blew it off as a descending plane into PBI airport, but soon noticed it hovering and making erratic movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He claims it was very bright, with multicolored lights, blue red and amber which were rotating around this craft. He claims he didn&#39;t remember any sounds from it and was scared at some point too. He saw this large object descend downwards toward the ground (or ocean) at a fast rate of speed then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He stopped a policeman later on and asked if there were any reports of any airline crashes.

I live by train tracks (not too close, but close enough), and by leaving the window open, I could hear trains, any sort of cars, animals, anything.  I was on the Internet and watching tv, I also had a fan on, yet I heard this really loud noise, like an airplane was flying over.  My town has a population of about 25-30k, and the only airport we have is municipal..I&#39;ve lived here for about 13 years, and I&#39;ve never once heard/seen an airplane in this town.  Anyways, I looked outside, and I see this craft.  It&#39;s triangle shaped, has three huge bright white lights on each corner, a small red light and small green light by the back left white light (one of the points was guiding), and what I think was a small white/purple light by the back right white light (I tried to adjust my eyes to see if it was a light or just glare..I wear no contacts or glasses and have perfect vision).  The small red light flashed about every second or second and a half, and the green flashed the same, except twice as fast.  This made me wonder if it was a plane.  I&#39;m an avid believer of UFOs, but I&#39;m always open to explanations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drew a recreation (in MS Paint) of what I saw: http://ballz.ababa.net/exetergirl/ufo3.txt  When I saw the craft, it seemed 2D in the sky, and it was pretty far away, and diagonal from where I was watching it.  I&#39;m not good with figuring out distances and how big things can be depending on how close/far they are, but this seemed pretty big and pretty high up, not just above the tree tops, but not right below the clouds, it seemed about in the middle.  I can&#39;t really discern how big it was, it could have been about the size of a plane, but it seemed like at that height, it would be bigger than a plane at the same height.  I could distinctly see the shape of the craft.  It was an equilateral triangle with rounded off corners, and it looked like a silhouette.  It was bright out (a full moon just a couple days before), and it was also a clear night.  The triangle looked like it was just a piece of shaped paper flying through the sky..like I said before it was 2D, and I couldn&#39;t see anything like engines or any other objects on it.  All I saw was the silhouette of a perfect equilateral triangle, as if it had lights on top or on the side.  This was the second time I&#39;ve seen it.  The first time I saw it was with two other people in July/August of 2003.  The &#39;03 craft looked exactly the same, but it was going E/NE, while the &#39;05 triangle was traveling N/NW.  The closest military base that I know of is in Davenport, Iowa (about three hours away, I believe), and it would seem a bit odd to me if it was an airplane or military craft.  I don&#39;t remember if any sort of magnetic or electrical effects happen, but I do remember both of my cats &#34;freaking out&#34; right before I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This pattern seemed to make a solid triangular object with three of the lights making the three corners and two more extending from the leading edge apex light of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no sound as it passed over head heading North at a fast pace, well away from the aircraft I witnessed moments before, over the local university and then I lost sight of it as it passed over the hill behind my residence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to be flying at about 10,000 to 15,000 feet, but it was difficult to determine an actual atltitude since it was dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The jet I witnessed before was at crusing altitude (30,000 to 35,000 feet) and was 45 degrees from my position. The object I witnessed was directly overhead.<n>

At the I-540 bridge which connects Crawford &amp; Sebastian counties, my sister saw 6 circular objects, they split into pairs, 2 went west 2 went north, 2 went south. When she got to work, one was just to the south-east of her &amp; hovering somewhere near the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights blinked in a clockwise motion, then went out except for one in the center, that looked like a star, but she could still make out a shape,because they only appeared to be about 2000 ft. high. Then suddenly a national guard jet took off from the airport, and search lights came on around the airport. &amp; the lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Given the description of the objects, and the duration of the event, we suspect that the lights may have been part of an advertising light complex.

A round white light crossed my field of vision (south to north), in about five seconds. It seemed to be going too fast for a jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I leaned across the seat and looked out the rolled down passenger side window to make sure it was not a reflection. I saw it as it disappeared behind the hills. It maintained a consistent altitude. The light was too big to be a light from an airplane. Maybe the size of an eraser on a #2 pencil held at arms length. A slight haze around it. It covered a lot of distance quickly.<n>

The aura appeared to be the wash from the rotors of silent helicopters flying north over Deer Isle at an elevation of 10 miles up or more.  We started to view thru a telescope, but quickly realized it was easily seen with the naked eye.  The orb and wash effect moved in various directions only to return to the initiation point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching for some 45 minutes a large triangle shaped object passed over our home moving west to east. It was silent as it floated over the 30 + foot trees that ring our summer home.  It disappeared in the blink of an eye and the previously seen wash disappeared also.  The sky was studded with stars that appears to be out of their normal position. My sister saw what she believes was recon aircraft coming from the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sitting in my hottub in the back yard looking up at the Eastern sky when very suddenly a bright light appeared out of nowhere.  It appeared to be quite high (like a star) was traveling slowly, in a straight line, from North to South, and passed, from my perspective, just below the tail of the Big Dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dim at first, just a dim star-like dot, then suddenly and very briefly (1-3 seconds) became very bright - brighter than the brightest planet in the sky.  Then it dimmed and disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My theory is that it was a satellite that perhaps reflected some sunlight briefly.  It did not zig or zag or change directions.  I often see satellites in the night sky from our back yard, traveling in straight lines, but this kind of &#34;flash&#34; is unusual, so figured I&#39;d report it.  I enjoy your site.

We got about 3 blocks from the house when our friend in the back seat said &#34;you better look up&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked up and sitting next to the chemtrail was an object either reflecting sunlight, or it was self-luminous, we are not sure which.   We stopped and watched the object which was moving very slowly. It moved into the chemtrail and then slowly drifted out again.  We were unable to make out a definite shape but could tell that it had some sort of protrusion jetting out from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we sat, the chemtrail began to drift and diffuse somewhat.  As it drifted, the object also drifted with it, following it.  It continued to move in and out of the chemtrail.  Having no camera with us, we raced back to the house to retrieve a camera.  As we drove in, we found our two sons were outside and they were also watching the object.  By the time I got the camera the chemtrail had drifted a good ways away from us and the object was almost undiscernable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put the digital camera on zoom and snapped a shot, which I include with this report.  Although Davis Monthan AFB is close by, I dont think it was from out of there.  (I know because I was stationed there in the 70&#39;s),<n> <n><n> <n><n> I submitted these photos to Dr Bruce Macabee and it was he who requested that I submit this report to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC is not yet receptive to the notion that &#34;chemtrails&#34; are anything but &#34;contrails,&#34; generated by high-altitude aircraft.

This town is very close to the Salton Sea in Southern California. It was a very dark night, me and my good friend were just driving through a small canyon, this canyon was very short with windy roads, so you can’t drive fast thru this canyon. The sky was clear with very few clouds. We were driving the speed limit which was 40 MPH through this short canyon.  We were just about to reach the end of this small canyon, when all of a sudden I saw out the corner of my eye a very bright spotlight, similar to a spotlight that police helicopters use. It was showing at the top of the canyon, at that moment I told my friend to look, the spotlight seemed to be moving parallel to the car. The spotlight flashed on for about 20-30 seconds, then it would disappear, we turned off the music in the car, rolled down the windows to listen for any sound, we heard nothing, it was really shocking to me, I am a very logical person, who was very skeptical about UFO’s. But on that night I became a believer. My friend and I could not see the source of this very bright spotlight, we could not hear any sound of any kind.  This is what had my friend and I shocked. The spotlight was following parallel to our vehicle for another 3-4 minutes. It would flash on for about 20-30 seconds, it was moving, it must have flashed on and off five or six times, reflecting of the tops of the short canyons. I turned to my friend and said, No one is going to believe what we just saw, he looks at me in amazement, and said, I know. We both still have this encounter very fresh in our minds; we will never forget what we saw that night. I am a believer!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

((NUFORC Note:|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43646.html|71|ndxe200504| I took a minute to watch the star&#39;s before heading in for the night. Looking up to the east I noticed a satilite moveing across the sky form the north to south. As I watched it, it tracked a steady course and speed. The light reflecting from it was constant and even. It&#39;s size was about the same as that of a ball point pen, to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then for about the duration of a second and a half ,the light increased in a perfect solid circle about 100 - 150% in size and brigthness.Then began to dim, and it&#39;s tragetory changed about 20- 30 degrees to the east I guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued watching the light continued to dim till it was not visible anymore.The speed remained constant throughout this event except for the second and a half when the size and brightness changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably not the flare from an Iridium satellite.

The sky had a few clouds but it was mostly clear. I saw it straight ahead and I saw a flash of light come from the other side and traveled halfway around the object and stopped.  It did not flash all the way around the object.  It only flashed once.  It was a disk- shaped object that was a dark color like a dark grey or brown, not quite black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The interstate wound around and the object was no longer in front of me but it was traveling along to my right.  I was straining my eyes to see legs to a water tower, or helicoptor propellers, or wings to an airplane, but there was none of that.  It was not a water tower because for one thing, I found out that it was moving and there was nothing sticking out of the object like wings or propellers.  It was definitely going too slow to be an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other thing I could think of would be a blimp of some kind but it didn&#39;t have any kind of writing or basket and I don&#39;t know if those have lights.  Also, it was 8:00pm on a Monday night and no events going on that would require a blimp that I know of and it simply did not look like a blimp.  However, I am trying to justify this because it goes against everything I believe in or ever thought possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was traveling in my line of sight for about 20 minutes.  When i got off on the Man-o-War  exit I turned the wrong way so that i could follow it and take a clear picture with my camera phone.  By the time I could stop it was too far away to see it in the picture.  My camera phone is not very clear at all, anyway.  It just kept traveling away from me and I gave up and turned back around and went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am just a Nutrition grad school student and I do not have any expertise in the aircraft area.  All I know is what I saw.  Can someone please tell me what this thing might have been?  I need some peace of mind.<n>

I was black or dark gray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 8 minutes I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. I called my boyfriend and woke him up. He ran outside with me still on the phone. I saw it.

Sounded like a airplane, but just to be sure I went outside again. I believe it was a C-5. Heading the same direction as the Unidentified Flying Object.<n>

Just a guess.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Well as I just finished meditating, I was looking out side at the full moon on this cold crisp clear night at about 11:30pm U.S. Central time.. I went outside and took in the stars above. They are so majestic and I have been always drawn to them. The are just so mesmerizing to me. I am so fond of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well as I look at the sky this one particular object in the distance that seems to be blinking faster than normal and seems to have a distinct color(s) to it. I am like well it could be a plane at first but it was not moving and didnt drift off towards the horizion. It stayed in place. So I ran back inside and got these mini-binoculars. They aren&#39;t very strong at all in clarity but I was able to see a little better. I definitely got to see more color and to see what it was blinking. With a faint feeling for what the object may have been. The colors were Green/Red/Yellow/White and Blue. Now unless a star can produce those colors or a helicopter has those feature than I would have to say I was looking at something literally out of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now it seemed like it has a top and a bottom row of colors. It also seemed to be turning as in rotating from Right to left in a circular motion because the color of the lights seemed to be stronger in one postion while in another position there was a different set of colors. I definitely looked like it was roating just based on the movement of the colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also at one time saw a white light perhaps orbish looking thing that was at the top of object. It was just slightly off to the right side of it and then it shortly disappeared soon after I observed it. I went back at looking at the object its about 11:40Pm U.S Central time. I decide that I want to get a closer look at this and see if I can get a better view so I can get more detail of this object. So I put on my coat and hop in my mini-van and I am off and away. I seem to be making ground on this and I am so excited. I pull off to the side of the road about 2-3 miles from my house which is to the North West. I get out and I don&#39;t see much better details, but the colors seem a bit brighter and distinguishable. They are definitely moving from Right to left in a circular motion. Seems to be two set&#39;s of lights. I hop back in after several minutes convinced I will get closer. I go about another 8 miles down the road. I get out and I view the object and it looks like its getting farther away. I am like damn. So i am well I better get as much viewing time as I can. The bulk of my observation is about 10-12 miles from my house and I am just looking at this thing for about another 20mins. Still in the same place in the sky and still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am content and I am most satisfied to as what I have seen and experience. It was definitely a ship/craft/object that was not a plane, not a star and not a helicopter. I drive back to my house and get back. The object is still in the sky but just slightly to the right in the sky but not far off from its original position when I first saw it while looking at the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decide to look again with the binoculars and well looky here I can see it pretty good again. It seemed to be back in its original distance from me from when I first saw it. So while I went back home it must have followed me a little bit back to its original postion in the sky or close enough. Anyways I go inside and come back on the computer to check some message boards. I then go outside 5 mins after I first came in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the craft has moved much further in the sky to the right even more. I was like ok. I got my binoculars again and looked some more. I was just so fascinated with it. I saw the colors once again and it was still rotating. I was like ok going back in. this was about 1:25Am U.S Central Time. I am back in on the computer for about 30 mins and then got back outside again(around 1:55am/2:00am U.S. Central time) and it is no where to be found in the Night time Sky. I was like well that was quite a show and I was most pleased and it was a fitting end. Why you ask? Because it gives further credence that it was A. Not a Star, B. Not a Plane. And C. Not a helicopter(unless helicopters like to hover for long periods of time which they can&#39;t due to fuel restrictions).<n> <n><n> <n><n> So in conclusion, what did I see? Well, in my eyes I saw a craft that was exhibiting a circular motion from right to left(Clockwise) and had multiple colors associated with it(Red/Green/Yellow/Blue/White) It seemed to be moving to and fro. Stayed in the realitive same area for up to 2hrs plus. Then it went out of site not to be seen again, anywhere in the sky. This object was bright. Like a star but it had movement upon looking at it through binoculars. It could be very easily mistaken for a star by a mere one glance at it but any more than that then it really starts to catch your eye and you realize this thing is pulsating like a christmas tree. This was an exciting time for me tonight and in the early morning hours. I wish to have further encounters and I would like to think that this was my first upon many ecounters that I will have. That this is just to break me in so to speak and each ensuing encounter will be that much more up close and personal. We shall see.<n>

Some witnesses apparently mistook the meteor shower for a plane crashing in Connecticut, the FAA&#39;s Holly Baker said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;We&#39;ve checked all around. There are no aircraft unaccounted for,&#34; she said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bright lights apparently came from the Lyrid meteor shower, which was scheduled to be visible to the naked eye between April 20 and April 25, said Peter Judge, spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;We&#39;re getting various descriptions of lights in the sky,&#34; he said. &#34;Everything from green lights to planes going down.&#34;   Firefighters in Branford, Conn., responded to several reports of a possible plane crash in Long Island Sound in the Thimble Island area, but a search did not turn up anything and was called off a short while later.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was taking night pictures of fishing boats on the docks (most being time exposures of 2 to 13 secs).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t notice the objects until I put the photos on my computer. First I wondered what was in the dark sky in one photo...shaped like a badminton birdie..a point or nose that is brightest, with a sort of skirt that stems out from there and a little red light off to the side below the skirt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing the thing in one photo, I started picking apart other photos from the night and found more. The pictures speak for themselves. They might be something logical..if so I would like to know what they are???<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((BEGIN CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear ((name deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe the anomalous object, located to the left of the Moon, may be a lens &#34;flare,&#34; i.e. a reflection off the surface of a lens in the body of the camera lens.

What a strange lense flare!!  I have taken lots of night pictures and never had this happen before. Did the photos come in clearly? I think I may have sent them too small so when u zoom in it breaks up. For some reason when I send photos over outlook they don&#39;t send well. If you want I can send one through AOL and see if it is more clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END #1))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((RESPONSE #2 FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The more I study these I see that indeed they all seem to line directly with a light..all pointing away from the light. Weird though how the same light in diff pictures without  moving the camera (was on a tripod), create these flares in different &#34;outshoots&#34; of the light beams, as if they &#34;moved&#34; since the last photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway..they had me freaked out for a good part of a day...but I am convinced you are correct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END RESPONSE))<n>

But it moved unlike a star would or a plane for that matter.  It would move in very small movements from left to right and up and down.

Said event occurred at extremely close range. This prompted the witnesses to locate and call a UFO investigator directly from the scene once the event terminated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> LOCATION   The precise location of this event is being described in a slightly vague manner. Certain factors dictate that we keep secure the exact location in order to protect the privacy of certain community facilities and nearby persons. The below described events occurred in RURAL ORANGE COUNTY, just north of ORLANDO FLORIDA   The body of water described below is a typical small Florida freshwater lake with the attendant subtropical &#34;bushland&#34; growth in the area. This terrain DOES contain a number of alligators and snakes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BACKGROUND   The Georgia UFO Group (GUFOG) sponsors a &#34;UFO Hotline&#34; for all of Georgia. On 22April05 at about 10:55PM, the GUFOG line received a phone call from rural ORANGE COUNTY FLORIDA. Tom Sheets of GUFOG answered the call and spoke with the complainant who identified himself completely and without hesitation, also providing his cell phone number. The caller was found to be the Primary Witness (PW), a 19YOA Orange County area resident. He sounded excited (but maintaining control) and related that he and two of his friends were currently at a local lake where they&#39;d been fishing since earlier in the evening. PW stated that about 15 minutes prior, he and his two associates had encountered at close range, a glowing round light that was so astounding the three of them concluded that a report MUST be made to someone and ASAP. The PW asked the 411 operator for contact information on UFO investigators.......&#34;ANY UFO INVESTIGATORS&#34;, thus the GUFOG Hotline was contacted. Thereafter, Tom Sheets referred the case on to Roberta Puhalski in Lakeland. Puhalski is the founder of the Central Florida UFO Group, and herself a colleague of numerous investigators in Georgia as well as other states.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The facts in this case were gathered by both investigators; Sheets conducting administrative chores at long range, with the field work and interviews falling to Puhalski and the Florida group. Sheets took the original phone call, plus conducted subsequent verifying phone conversations with the PW, and provided other consultation in this matter. Then Puhalski continued with additional phone conversations, leading up to her 24April05 meeting with all three witnesses at the scene of the occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> EVENT DETAILS   As previously indicated, this party of anglers had been out since earlier in the evening, at this, their personal favorite fishing spot used for several years. (As far as the witnesses know, nothing unusual had ever been observed in this immediate area prior to 22April05). The PW stated that they were carrying Mag-Lites for illumination (heavy duty law enforcement-style flashlights), and were wary of the numerous alligators known to infest this sub-tropical area. At this point, witnesses observed what was first thought to be an animal&#39;s eye shining with reflected light i.e. an alligator&#39;s eye off in the bushes and undergrowth about 20 yards away. Suddenly it became apparent that this WAS NOT the case, as a ROUND, ORANGISH-RED, DIMLY GLOWING ORB-LIKE LIGHT, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASKETBALL (+) suddenly rose up into PLAIN VIEW ABOUT 20 YARDS AWAY. This round light continued UPWARDS AT A FAST RATE OF SPEED, described by witnesses as being perhaps 200MPH or almost FASTER THAN THE EYE COULD FOLLOW (at that close range). It was SILENT, and appeared to be SUBSTANTIAL in it&#39;s emission of light. Upon reaching about 150 feet in altitude, it hovered, then moved SIDEWAYS perhaps about 100 feet, then back DOWNWARDS, and then SIDEWAYS again, TRACING something like a TRIANGLE in it&#39;s flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This glowing light was ALSO described as possibly being ATTACHED to some sort of SOLID OBJECT OF UNKNOWN SHAPE that was DIFFICULT TO SEE as it was not emitting any LIGHT or GLOW i.e. the impression that this SOLID SHADOWY MASS was BEHIND the glowing light and as stated, moving extremely fast. This object/light eventually flew off behind the adjacent trees and vanished. ALL witnesses were impressed by the AMAZING SPEED demonstrated by this object at such CLOSE RANGE. The witnesses made unsuccessful attempts to relocate it, then called 411, and then the GUFOG Hotline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> INVESTIGATOR&#39;S COMMENTS   Tom Sheets indicates that the PW seemed very sincere during the initial phone conversation, with no reservations about providing continued cooperation. This party of young fishermen (senior teens) was obviously STILL searching the event area when the first conversation with GUFOG took place via cell phone. Additionally, after subsequent conversations, the 19 YOA PW seemed to impress Sheets as being more &#34;on the ball&#34; than the average older teenager, conversing on a mature level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Roberta Puhalski went to great lengths in setting up the 24April05 witness interviews and the physical inspection of the event site. Puhalski received full cooperation from the three witnesses, each providing additional information in separate writings, along with their signatures. The event site being in rural ORANGE COUNTY, a sort of brief &#34;bush trek&#34; (!) was necessary for Puhalski and the witnesses to arrive at the lake shore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She conducted a thorough witness debriefing, which included a physical &#34;walk-through&#34; of the occurrence, along with supporting photographs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Puhalski maintains that these young men are credible witnesses, citing their body language and tendency to look her directly in the eyes when giving their account. Furthermore, witnesses were VERY forthright in their statements, using open handed gestures, as the details of what occurred during the event NEVER varied.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During subsequent discussions between Puhalski and Sheets, a mutual opinion was reached regarding the PW......a seemingly credible witness who was looking for answers........something aerial, something mysterious and unknown had invaded his long time, heretofore peaceful, fishing spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ADDITIONAL FINDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS BY INVESTIGATORS   WEATHER CONDITIONS   The weather at this rural event site was reportedly fair and mild on the evening of 22April05. Specific information was obtained from the NWS daily recap of conditions at the Orlando International Airport; 10:53PM-----Temperature 70 degrees; Visibility 10 miles; 5.8 WNW winds; Humidity 53%; Sea level pressure 29.91, General description being partly cloudy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon on 22April05 was almost FULL, fullness being reached two days later on 24April.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The investigators feel that even with the almost full moon, the HIGH SPEED and SHORT DURATION of actual flight time made any physical MASS behind the GLOWING light DIFFICULT to clearly see i.e. that part WAS NOT emitting light. (Note: Sheets indicates several other investigations where the witnesses reported similar circumstances).<n> <n><n> <n><n> DURATION OF EVENT   The investigation revealed that about 5 MINUTES elapsed FROM the initial observation of the glow off in the nearby brush, THEN it&#39;s aerial flight and departure, CONTINUING with the witness&#39; effort to search and relocate, THEN calling 411. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;ACTUAL FLIGHT TIME OF THE LIGHT/OBJECT WAS ABOUT 5 SECONDS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING SHORELINE AND EVENT AREA   As described above, the witnesses were fishing from the shore, and off to their right about 20 yards away was the denser brushy area where the light/object was first observed at ground level. This area has one portion that extends slightly out into the lake. Located by Puhalski very near this shoreline, and within the described brushy area, was an unusual looking grate structure in the ground, along with several short pipe like structures coming out of the soil. The witnesses called it a drain, but it looked out of place to Puhalski, being surrounded by small overgrowth, yet in a small cleared out area within the aforementioned brushy area. This grate is within just a few yards of where the light was first observed at ground level. Speculation regarding the short pipes and the grate currently tends to associate them with some sort of drainage or below-ground conduit, perhaps linking up with an underground spring or water source.  The event site inspection revealed NO signs of trace evidence. (Photographs and diagram contained in the investigative file).<n> <n><n> <n><n> OTHER PHENOMENON   Investigators Puhalski and Sheets have conducted numerous past inquiries where, perhaps not rare, but certainly uncommon and only slightly understood natural phenomenon might have been in play. These were explored in light of this reported incident. One sample of this speculation is described below, to wit;   Research Source- &#34;Remarkable Luminous Phenomena in Nature&#34;, compiled by William R. Corliss (Catalog of Geophysical Anomalies).<n> <n><n> <n><n> GLN1-----Low-Level Nocturnal Lights Outline and Brief Excerpts   Description; &#34;.......softly glowing globes..........other luminous apparitions.....hovering, drifting erratically.......range from candle-size to radiating masses several feet in diameter.......colors vary widely, white, blue, yellow being most common......bobbing, swooping, evasive antics seem to beckon observer, frequently vanish......appear nearby.....low-level nocturnal lights seem to prefer wet, swampy areas&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background; &#34;.......standard explanation........spontaneously ignited gases escaping from swampy ground........this apparently reasonable explanation.......shut off all scientific research..........examples (provided in text) demonstrate the marsh gas theory will simply not do in many.........a complex, challenging phenomenon&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Corliss continues on to describe that no explanation has been found as to how escaping gases can spontaneously ignite and that they are actually COLD as opposed to what would NORMALLY be expected from burning methane. Furthermore, Corliss is perplexed that no one has been able to determine how clouds of luminous gas can perform all sorts of aerial maneuvers for extended periods without losing shape and size. Corliss provides some possible explanations related to a cold flame being some sort of unindentified phosphorescence that is related to electromagnetic fields that might help in the production of light and maintaining size/shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Numerous examples of low-level nocturnal lights are given in Corliss&#39; text, which is compiled from MANY first hand reports. Some are in ways similar to this Florida event, but those cited examples DO NOT SEEM TO INVOLVE SUCH HIGH SPEED, DIRECT MOVEMENT and SOLIDITY as described by the Florida witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As indicated above, Investigators Puhalski and Sheets have spent years looking into various types of UFO reports, which include a number of possible natural &#34;spook lights&#34; (we use this term generically) as described by Corliss.......BUT.......at this time, it is UNKNOWN what was observed in ORANGE COUNTY on 22April05. The BLAZING SPEED described by the witnesses, plus the DIRECT MOVEMENT and SUBSTANTIAL GLOW is consistant with many other &#34;up close and personal&#34; UFO encounters. ALSO CONSISTANT is the description of an UNKNOWN and HARD TO SEE MASS being behind the more easily observed glowing light. UFO encounters such as this are OBVIOUSLY NOT a natural atmospheric phenomenon, &#34;spook light&#34; or other such glowing apparition. If this is the case in the ORANGE COUNTY investigation, the Corliss information described above simply does not apply.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that these fishermen have returned to their fishing spot since 22April05 with no similar events being noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ORANGE COUNTY and ORLANDO area residents that may have witnessed a similar event on or about 22April05 (or any other time frame) are urged to contact Roberta Puhalski, founder of the Central Florida UFO Group at &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;CUFOG@webtv.net&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   The IDENTITY of EACH witness is held strictly confidential by both the Florida and Georgia groups.<n> <n><n> <n><n> END   Roberta Puhalski, Founder-Central Florida UFO Group, Lakeland Florida   Tom Sheets, Georgia UFO Group, Fayetteville Georgia<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to Roberta Phualski and Tom Sheets for sharing this report with NUFORC.

4/22/05 21:27|Hitchcock|TX|Light|Two minutes|Strange Lights In the Texas Sky|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43597.html|96|ndxe200504| Strange Lights In the Texas Sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I were driving home from our church seminar tonight and, at about 9:27 PM (central time), I saw a two dark yellow square lights hovering in the sky that were so close together that they almost looked like a single horizontal-ish light. They looked like lit-up windows one might see in a house from far away. In retrospect, I am pretty sure that they were two separate lights (or lit windows) on a single craft because there was a definite curve in the lights, as if they were curving around the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not an airplane; it wasn&#39;t moving at all and it certainly was not a star or planet. Believe me, I can tell the difference and this was not something you normally see in the sky. The lights or whatever they were a part of did not move at all; they remained perfectly still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, I tell my mom, who was driving, &#34;Look. That doesn&#39;t look like a star and it&#39;s not moving. What the heck is that?&#34; So, she looks. Moments later, the light dimmed over the span of about two seconds until it was out. I&#39;m a pretty sensible person, but this definitely wasn&#39;t normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, my mother and I are the only witnesses that I know of, unless somebody else saw the anomaly in the sky like we did.<n>

After dropping off patients in Balad flying back to Al Asad under night vision goggles at an altitude of 200 ft I observed what appeared to be 5 lights all on the same craft at an altitude of 60,000 ft or more traveling from south to north. Could not be seen without goggles on, craft was not moving erraticly or at super high speeds, did not make any sudden turns. No aircraft were operating at that altitude at that time. Lost sight of object/s after approx 1 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
4/21/05 22:50|Piscataway|NJ|Unknown|2-4 minutes|A buzzing sound interupted my piano/singing; 1/2 lit light green slats, white & red lights on other side, 20-30 ft up & from my house.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43685.html|99|ndxe200504| A buzzing sound interupted my piano/singing; 1/2 lit light green slats, white &amp; red lights on other side, 20-30 ft up &amp; from my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was singing and working at my piano on some songs I&#39;ve written for about an hour, and heard a loud buzzing sound. I stopped to listen if it was the sump pump. It was coming from my right so I looked to the right and out the window right next to my house but on the other side of the tree next to my driveway was a large craft, 1/2 was lit in what seemed light green lighted slats, and the rest of it had red and white lights flashing on and off, I think some of the white may have stayed on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The green lighted part was the front or the direction it was moving. I couldn&#39;t make out the shape of the entire thing because it was so dark outside. I ran upstairs to call the police on my cell phone but looking out upstairs at it, as it kept moving slowly away, I started shaking so badly I couldn&#39;t function to call the police, couldn&#39;t remember where the phone # was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally called 411 for the police in Green Brook as it seemed to be going in that direction.  The officer laughed at me sarcastically and suggested it may be an advertising gimmick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the 5th siting for me since I was 13 (I&#39;m 55 yrs old now) and the closest ever.  I am very uncomfortable about this as I had earlier left a cell phone message for my brother wishing him a belated happy birthday and ended with &#34;Well, I haven&#39;t seen any UFO&#39;s lately&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach right after I said that.  I knew I would see one again but did not expect it so soon or so close to me.  It may have been about 20-40 feet away from me and about 25-30 feet high.  I could tell it was flying behind and away from my tree as I saw the branches in the light of the craft as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The green was a beautiful color, but appeared like they were slats laying or placed next to each other at an angle that suggested it to be a wide oval but the rest of it was not visible to determine that.  I would guess it was the size of a small airplane, and a blimp shape.   I do not look forward to another siting but know this will occur.  They are getting closer each time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister called me after I told her about it that she heard on the news that there are meteor showers and we may see green lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was NO meteor shower.  This was a vessel, deliberate in its movement low across the sky right next to and perhaps when the buzzing started, right over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I reported it to the police in GB it disappeared either from view or the lights just went out.  I could not tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I intend to buy a good digital camera to keep on me at all times. Since I may not always be able to put my glasses on, I am even considering laser surgery on my eyes for distance. I want to be able to show proof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will try to submit a map and drawings (of the bright orange oval craft I saw 10-14-04 as well).<n>

Could not see much detail, but the shape appeared flat on one side with a subtle dome on the other..  Shade was lighter on one side, but predominantly black. There were no lights on this object and no sound.  It doesn&#39;t seem possible that anyone could travel inside of it, so we are thinking it could be some sort of surveillance craft.

We didnt see it clearly because it was dark after sunset, but we could see that it was darker against the sky and was triangle shape (around 9pm) had larger yellow light in center and smal light on point and red and blue light on the end corners of the triangle. We didnt hear hellicopter sound and didnt know what was that. We assumed it was not a hellicopter. It floated there for about 15 or 20 seconds and moved away towards where we were coming from. And in its behind we could see bright light in center (on tail side) and red and blue slowly glowing on each corner of its tail side. We watched it until it was gone too far that we could see it anymore with our naked eye. We dont know what was that. Itdidnt look like a plane or hellicopter.

First South and then another one two hours later traveling North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 4pm on April 20th 2005 I was in my back yard with my kids enjoying the weather. There was not a cloud in the sky and I&#39;ve been watching planes and their contrails. I was following one jet that was directly above me and heading West. Watching the plane a circular object crossed its path heading South. The object reminded me of watching satellite at night. It was traveling at a similar speed as the plane I was watching before. It appeared brighter than the satellite I&#39;ve seen at night and if it was night it would of been as bright as the brightest star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seeing the object got me excited so I ran upstairs to my bead room to get my camera. I grabbed it and ran back down and managed to take 3 pictures before the batteries died in the camera. I watched the object continue to move south until it came too close to where the Sun was in the sky. After that I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6pm the same day I brought home some Pizza for my family to eat in the back yard for supper. My family was already out side waiting for me. As I came out the door I looked up and seen another object that looked the same as the first one but was instead traveling North. I quickly pointed it out to my wife. We watched it continue North for a minute until it went behind a cloud and we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believed it was possibly only a satellite, it did cross the sky similar to one. Two days after I was convinced that it was not one. Again I was in my back yard and I found another one North West in the sky. This time it was not moving. It stayed in place for about 4 minute until it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We could get a pefectly still view of what appeared to be a bizarre disk-shaped cloud moving obviously at a great rate of speed and height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the truly bizarre aspect of this oject was the waves a thermal energy surrounding the thin, disk shaped moving contrail.

My roomate is an experienced pilot, who at one time was going to get a commercial airline pilot&#39;s license. He stated that he had never seen anything like what he witnessed tonight.  He will contact you shortly to give his version.<n>

As you can imagine, I was really anxious to check out the night skies as I travled across miles and miles of unpopulated, unpolluted, natural land........ and sky!!!!!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had plenty of time to watch the sky day and night because I wasn&#34;t driving.  I spotted shadows behind clouds in the day that were a disk shape, dark in hue at least twice.  I saw one cloud that was moving the opposite direction than the other clouds, and this was definately not normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got into Missouri, we stopped in a small city by the name of Sarcosie, and I saw a dark bouish disc shadow moving around behind the clouds at a very low altitude.  I cannot explain any of the things I see...yet...but I swear that my accounts of what I see are ALL true.  Just watch the skies patiently any time you can, day or night, and you too will be amazed at what is going on up there.  Somthing is in the wind.....<n>

PD))|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43578.html|120|ndxe200504| Camas, WA- multiple moving objects observed and filmed 4/19/05 (1:20-4:20a.m.).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers, a young married couple, mid-20&#39;s, witnessed a congregation of unknown craft, east of our home. Around 1:20 a.m. my wife noticed a star-like object swaying in the distance, through our bedroom window. It was extremely clear that evening and the moon was very bright (rare for Washington nights this time of year). We both got out of bed to get a closer look, when we noticed 3+ objects, all emitting what looked light red and green light. Not believing what we were seeing, several other craft came into view to the north of us. We witnessed strange and rapid movements, and light emissions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 10 minutes, I grabbed our video camera and started filming. We switched off, capturing 20-30 minutes of footage. We filmed interaction between the craft and obscure individual movement of 2-3 of them. Viewing the objects through the video lens allowed us to see much greater detail and some great close-ups were captured.  One object was mainly filmed as it was the brightest and most prominent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife believes she saw this same bright object the following night.  However as she turned on the video camera and started to focus on it, the video camera shut off.  She tried a second time, and the video camera shut off again.  The bright object was in a different position in the sky, and this was an earlier time of night through a different window in the house.  This is the 3rd night since our first sighting, and the sky is cloudy so we cannot see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been looking at the star, Sirius, or perhaps some other &#34;twinkling&#34; star or celestial body.  We spoke with the witness, and he sounded quite sincere, but he witnessed the same object several days later.  He stated that he recently moved to Washington from Los Angeles, where the residents rarely see the night sky clearly.  PD))<n>

I did noticed that it seemed to be extremely thin and it was moving slow- like a drifting balloon  on a light breeze day.  It went over Glendale Blvd and over the Siler Lake hill and then into a cloud bank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, we both thought it was US military, though it had no markings- a dull matte charcoal color, very silent and slow moving....<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information.

I saw a charcoal greyish colored roundish disc (saucer) to the north of me seeming to be going from west to east.  This had to be at 13:00 because when it was over I got my phone and the time was 13:03.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed slightly wider on the bottom.  The total time was about a minute or slightly less.  It began to drift side to side decending some as it did. Then it moved at a steady upward slight incline and vanished!  There were few thin clouds in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remained looking a minute or two but didn&#39;t see it again.  Within a few minutes three (of what I think are military) jets went through that area.  They flew two in the front and one behind, from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she seemed exceptionally objective and lucid to us; we suspect that she is a very good witness.  The object was slightly to the west of due north, according to the witness, and she seemed certain that the jets she witnessed were military in nature.  PD))<n>

At first I tried to somehow label these as possibly bubbles or balloons .But after watching it they did not behave as that. The spheres were twirling and following each other as in a spiral line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother also observed them.  He did not know what to make of it either. The line or lines of spheres were moving up and down and back up again like a roller coaster movement. They happened to move around a larger tree.  We estimated the sizes to be that of very large beach balls maybe 3 feet or larger in diameter, because of the distance we were from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove closer they moved out and around the tree then disappeared into the tall bushes and grass area. The terrain and the position of our vehicle made it difficult to visually track them once we caught up to the tree we first saw them at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We still dont know what they were.The terrain is very open and vegetation is sprawling. In some areas it is dense and some not. That is also strange to us. Because we could not see what happened or where they went.  We looked for a dust devil or wind activity but saw no dust.  Even if it was a dust devil,I dont think it could control the formation and co ordintated the movement we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with one of the two witnesses, and he seemed quite lucid, and very objective in his description of the sighting.

It took a few mintes for her to see them, they were high in the sky, then she noticed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house to get binoculars. She said she then saw another light blue object. She said they formed 2 shapes, a diamond then what she called a peace sign.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I came back outside they were passing into the trees and I never did see them with the binoculars.

The craft was too high to be seen clearly, but what caught our attention was that the craft was creating a contrail behind, as well as ahead of it.  The only thing I can think of, was that it had a pressure wave well ahead of the craft.   At first we thought that it might have been two aircraft, one following the other at a distance, but none of us were able to see another craft.   It appeared as if the craft had a leading pressure wave that was disturbing the atmosphere ahead of it.   I was just curious if anyone has ever reported anything like this.  Maybe it was a new type of military craft?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

He said they are always there because of a practice bombing sight in Avalon. They were to the Northwest. They did look like planes to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But to the Northeast, I pointed out a light the size of a star, moving at extreme speed. It was really high up, and then we lost sight of it. The night was really clear, the stars were bright. No clouds. It was between 10:00 to 10:30 PM. For as high up as it was, moving like it was, it had to be going an unimaginable speed. Our friend said it could have been the space station. I&#39;m not convinced that it was.<n>

The lights made no noise and did not appear to resemble any type of aircraft usually seen in the area. The sky was mostly clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a very similar formation in October of 2002.

Then they went off beginning at both ends, not quickly but dimmimg out..I said What the hell is that?! One of us went to get her husband to look out the North side of house but the lights were gone.. There was no sound at all. To this day we talk about this and don&#39;t know what it was...I have never seen anything like this before!!<n>

4/16/05 17:00|Mendon|MA|Light|1 hour|Stationary red, blue flashing lights in sky west, southwest of Mendon MA ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly the star, Sirius.  PD))|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43523.html|153|ndxe200504| Stationary red, blue flashing lights in sky west, southwest of Mendon MA<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure if this is an actual UFO, but it was strange enough event that I thought I should report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9PM Eastern time, my 14 year old daughter asked me to come out side and look at a strange light in the western sky.  I came out an saw what looked like a bright star, but which clearly included pulsing blue and then red lights.  The blue and red lights were clearly visible.  At first I assumed that it was an aircraft of some type, but the light source seemed not to be moving across the sky like a jet would.  It was holding it&#39;s position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing the light for several minutes, I called my brother who lives approximately 10 miles away and asked him if he was able to see the light as well.  Both he, his wife, and my sister, who lives in the same neighborhood clearly saw the light, and agreed that the light was very clearly pulsing red, blue and white.  We both continued to watch the light for approximately an hour, until it slowly slipped below the tree line, where I was no longer able to watch it.  My brother was able to see the light for approximately another 1/2 hour because his home is not surrounded by trees, as mine is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Relative to Mendon MA, which is south west of Boston MA, the light appeared to be around 10 degrees south of due west, and started off  at approximately 15 degrees above the horizon.  My brother also thought that he saw another similar light source due west at a higher altitude.  I looked there as well to confirm his sighting of a second similar light source, and saw it as well, but it was not nearly as bright, and to be honest, while it looked similar, I could not make it out well enough to say with 100% certainly that it was also pulsing blue and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter told me that the light was pointed out to her by a friend of hers prior to telling me about it, and her friend stated that she had first noticed it in the same approximate location the night before.  We will be looking for the light again tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t help but assume that this light was perhaps either a satellite or maybe even the space station.  I understand that early this morning there was a docking, so perhaps what we were watching was the docking lights of the space station.  I tried to look on the net for a description of space station docking lights, but could not find any.  Also I&#39;m not sure if the space station would stay in on location in the night sky.  Also, unless they were testing the docking lights the night before, docking lights would not explain why my daughter&#39;s friend saw the same  lights the night before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was quite embarrassed to do this, but after observing the light for approximately 55 minutes, I called a local TV station in the hopes that perhaps they could get a better look at the lights in the sky.  I never hear any mention of the reported lights on the news, I can only assume they thought it was a hoax.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what I saw, and unfortunately all I really saw were pulsing lights, and I could not make out any form other than the lights themselves.  However I can say with 100% certainty, that the lights were indeed pulsing red, blue and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 43 year old engineer, as is my brother, and neither of us are the type of people to cry wolf, but this was most definitely the strangest thing I have ever seen in the sky, and I hope to see it again tonight.  I hope others see it as well so that I can get an explanation of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witnesses are observing the star, Sirius, which is quite prominent in the western sky during winter months, at the time indicated by the witness.

You can post this report if you wish to.  There may be a logical explaination for what I saw, but yet I do wonder since I have observed UFO&#39;s before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Christian, and I work in a professional environment and am telling you the truth.  My honesty is something that I try to live by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, the day was somewhat cloudy and I was traveling home from my place of employment going down the Russellville Road toward Franklin here in Bowling Green, Kentucky.  I just happened to look up at the sky through my automobile front window and saw a perfectly round bright black object sitting high up in the sky.  It was completely round and solid black, and it seemed like it was not moving at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized at once that this was no cloud because it stood out so well between them.  The whole thing was just a basketball sized round black object sitting stationary in the sky.  It looked just like a solid round black circular ball object of some sort.  This told me that whatever the thing was is was definately far away and very high up in the sky.  If this was a balloon of some sort then why was it black I asked myself, and it appeared to be not moving at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to keep my attention on the moving traffic and I finally lost sight of the object.  This did seem strange because I could not locate the object or whatever it was again as I stopped and searched throughout the sky.  Has anybody else here locally seen this?  I am not sure of what I saw that day!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

One moment flat then one moment circular.  The inside looked like spokes from a wheel (maybe 6).  It was at an altitude of under 2000 feet because as I was viewing the object a Southwest Airlines 737 came thru my viewer as it was descending to Burbank Airport.

She told me she was watching out at the sky when she noticed what appeared to be 2 bright stars, as she watched the lights started moving in different directions and then stopping on a dime. So she got her video camera out and started recording what she saw. She had discribed the objects to me, she said they had lights, and one would move up and down. I believe in ufo&#39;s but I thought yea right mom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I went to visit my mom on sunday and she took this video out and showed me the video and what I saw was so amazing I couldnt believe my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She video tapped these 2 ojects in the sky they looked like stars like she said but they would move very fast and then slow down. When she did a close up you could see lights on either side of the object like it was going around it, it looked like they were circle, but when she got real close when she zoomed in the oject looked like it wasnt there but you could see what i can only discribe as a very faint circle with like a hole on the middle. And then they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the source of the report to share the tape with NUFORC, so we can review it.  PD))<n>

Monadnock, in the air and moving very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right away, we saw one object, and then another, pop out of the first object and fly off to the east until it was obscured by the dorm called Cheshire (the event took place in the rear parkinglot at Franklin Pierce college.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other students noticed us looking up in the sky and quickly the object drew a crowd of about 4 boys and three girls, with other students gazing at the object as they walked by.  Most of them were drunk, both I was absolutely sober.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of the girls started to freak out because they were scared and walked away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my roomate tried to walk as close to the object as we could but we estimated it as at least 3 to 4 miles away.  Originally, my roomate said this object flew right over his head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects that popped out and flew away happened very rappidly, and seamed to have yellow contrails they left behind them breifly.  They seamed to be white and yellow in color.  We ruled out it being a star, a plane, a planet, or a satelite.  We went and got a camera but by the time we got back the object was so far away that we couldnt focus and get a good picture becuase the object looked like a star or a plane in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object we assumed was some type off unidentified military object or possibly a extraterrestrial object.  Eventualy we watched this object get too far away and it was not discernable from any other stars in the sky.  I happen to think this event was military related.  After a while I noticed many (5 or six) other craft that looked just like the first object, but were staying stationary and very far apart ( 5 miles) and seemed to be flashing red , white and blue lights in successing order.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time that went by, we compared the object to six planes that flew by, as well as two sattelites.<n>

Because of surrounding trees, about 120 degrees of shy was visible overhead.  It was a cloudless night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was boomerang shaped or possibly trianglular. A series of dull lights, remimded me of amber bicycle reflectors, between five to seven of them, were arranged in a chevron pattern along the leading edge.  I am unsure if the object was boomerang shaped or triangular since the lights were an a chevron pattern and the training edge of the object was not clearly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The motion of the object caught my attention since it was balck but a bit more matte and light than the backgound sky, like a silhoutte.  I initially thought from the size that I was seeing the silhouette of an eagle flying glow overhead when I first caught sight of the object from the corner of my vision, but as soon as I turned my attention to the object, I saw the lights and details.  It clearly occluded the stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot estimate the object, but it was about the same size as a bald eagle flying about 50 feet overhead.  The object made no sound.  It traversed the arc of the sky visible to me in about 8 seconds (about 120 degrees).  The speed and direction of the object appeared constant during the time I observed it.  The lights did not flash or otherwise change shape, posiiton of color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I lost sight of it in the trees, I moved to a clear area which toook about 5 seconds.  I was unable to locate the object in the sky again.<n>

I don&#39;t smoke but like to go outside and look at the stars when she&#39;s smoking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking at Jupiter, which was almost directly south, when I see five glowing circles cross right across Jupiter travelling North.  The glows weren&#39;t lights like on a airplane but circle shapes that glowed; they glowed dim, real dim.  There were five glowing circles that were underneath a triangle shape; one was in front and two on either side.  The glowing circles were in a chevron shape but the whole craft was a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first noticed it I called my wife over to see it.  Neither of us had any idea what it was, it was not an airplane and it had no sound, no sound at all.  It went across all the sky we could see in about 20 seconds, at least three times faster than an airplane.  We thought it could&#39;ve been the stealth bomber but we didn&#39;t think even that could go that fast.  My wife is a computer programmer and I an animator; we are both intelligent well-educated people.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> CASE BACKGROUND   On 15April05 the Georgia UFO Group received a call on the &#39;Hotline&#39;. The caller identified himself by name and address i.e. a middle-age disabled resident of McDonough Georgia (McDonough is about 26 miles SE of Atlanta). He stated that the previous night he, along with his wife and a neighboring couple, had observed a highly unusual object in the sky. He went on to describe the event (duration about one hour), indicating that he was pretty amazed by what they observed. After getting the basic details, this investigator instructed the Primary Witness (PW) to prepare a detailed account, plus a sketch, both to be forwarded to this writer. PW also provided the phone number of the second witness (W2).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This investigator phoned W2 and found him to be a retired firefighter, and afterwards a hospital security officer by profession. He provided basic details of the event and also agreed to forward an account and a sketch to GUFOG.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After receiving all of the above described documents on 18April05, this writer again spoke with the PW and W2 within a few days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The final detailed account summary contains more information than the preliminary recap sent to GUFOG members in the group&#39;s bulletin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WITNESS ACCOUNTs- SUMMARY   PW stated that at about 10:00PM on 14April05 (and continuing until about 11:00PM) he observed what he thought was a &#34;falling star&#34; out of his bay window. When it did not briefly extinguish as expected, he went outside to observe more closely. Looking to the NW, he continued to watch a brilliant light which began to dart back and forth, up and down, zig-zagging at about 1/2 of the way off of the horizon. PW retrieved his binoculars (10X50) and continued to watch. Under magnification, he at first observed a &#34;pancake-like&#34; object which seemed to have red, blue, and silver lights on the bottom. During subsequent observation, it seemed to get closer and MOVE to give a view of DIFFERENT SHAPES......a triangle, later a shallow &#34;C&#34; shape almost like a boomerang, then a classic lens shape with a protuberance similar to a cupola, each profile displaying the aforementioned lights. PW indicated that the rapid movement reminded him of the electronic indicator on a heart monitor in a hospital, but after he thought on it some more, perhaps looking through the binoculars had caused some of that due to his natural hand and arm tremor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After steady observation, the PW called his neighbor, W2, who also came out to take a look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> W2 told this investigator that he watched the object both with the naked eye and the binoculars. He estimated that it was about the size of a LARGE MARBLE held out AAL, at about 45 degrees off of the horizon, shaped like a TRIANGLE with blinking blue, green and silver lights. During his observations, he too noticed very rapid movements. PW added that it seemed to him that the object had a SHINY METALLIC-LIKE COLOR ON THE BOTTOM ALONG WITH THE CHANGING LIGHTS. During his observation using the binoculars he also noticed a GRATE-LIKE SURFACE at one point, which resembled &#34;criss-cross&#34; like openings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> W2 added that he got the impression that this object was beyond our atmosphere and would be HUGE in order to allow for what they observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Local conditions during the observation was a typical mild, clear, Southern spring night, tending to the cool 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s, with little or no wind noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> INVESTIGATOR&#39;S COMMENTS   This writer is intrigued by the many shapes attribute to one object over the course of an hour&#39;s observation. However there is a similar recent report on file from the same general area, to wit;   On 3Aug04 at about 5:15AM, a Stockbridge Georgia resident (Stockbridge is about 8.7 miles NW of McDonough) reported to GUFOG via &#39;Hotline&#39; that he was watching an UNUSUAL LIGHT back in the direction of MCDONOUGH. Said light darting up and down, back and forth, and then as the two of us spoke, he stated that it began to change into a BOOMERANG or V SHAPE. (See NUFORC entry: Stockbridge Georgia; Occurred 8/3/2004; Reported 8/10/2004; Posted 8/11/2004; Shape: Changing; Duration: Appx. 30 minutes)   OTHER FACTORS   In considering prosaic causes for this described event, celestial bodies were reviewed as should always be done for most night reports.  The planet Jupiter is brighter than normal during early April05, estimated about -2.5 magnitude, but BY MID-APRIL is actually FARTHER away from the Sun and Earth than normal.  Venus, due to it&#39;s current close proximity to the Sun, is not a factor herein.<n> <n><n> <n><n> GUFOG Special Advisor Mark Ausmus of Atlanta reviewed the sky for 14April05 between 10:00PM and 11:00PM via his &#34;Starry Night&#34; software.  Mark found no dazzling bodies that might be brilliant enough, even if viewed through unusual atmospheric conditions, to produce anything remotely resembling what has been described.  Jupiter is off to the SE.....Saturn to the west, but less than dazzling.....Sirius to the west, up about 30 degrees, but again not a suspect.....Capella to the NW, another non-suspect in this particular circumstance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness descriptions obviously do not fit with any artificial satellites, nor meteors.  Both the PW and W2 were found to easily recognize local commercial air traffic for exactly what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any citizens of Henry County or the south Metro Atlanta area counties with similar observations during the mid-April time frame can contact Investigator Tom Sheets at the Georgia UFO Group office in Fayetteville at 678-817-4555 or email at &lt;&lt;&lt;georgiaUFOgroup@hotmail.com&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   GUFOG protects the identity of ALL witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tom Sheets, Founder GUFOG....Mark Ausmus, S.A.

I just couldn&#39;t believe it!! A small white light appeared (it moved like a satellite, only much, much closer to Earth) from the northeast sky, travelling towards the southwest.  It was low. I assumed it was an airplane, but as I studied it, there were no blinking lights.  As I watched it, it seemed to slow down or even stop.  It started to get brighter and brighter and it got to the point where it was just as bright as Jupiter, which was in the southeast sky that night.  It reminded me of a plane that is coming in to an airport at night, with all it&#39;s bright landing lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then seemed to change direction, I thought it was going to go due east, but as I watched, I realized it was changing its altitude as well as it&#39;s direction.  It climbed fast and high, and dimmed quickly. I was able to see it for about 4 seconds before it was too high to see anymore. There was absolutely no sound, and it was definitely close enough that I should have been able to hear something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been interested in the night sky since I was young, I go out to find constellations and planets, and like to view meteor showers and comets.  In 20 years of looking at the sky, I&#39;ve never witnessed anything unusual, now I&#39;ve seen two of the strangest happenings all in one month.  What is going on?<n>

Based on our aircraft crossing a prominent river bend a few minutes after the incident, I estimate we were somewhere east of Sunbury, Pennsylvania. The terrain was very hilly and wooded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Despite the fact that I fly a great deal, I never get tired of looking out the window. As we were flying west, an object caught my eye to the south. The pilot said we were cruising at 17,000 feet. I would estimate it was 2,000 feet below us. What caught my eye was that it appeared to be stationary. Normally, when you see other air traffic it appears to move quickly through your field of vision or remains in your field of vision as you fly the same direction. This object appeared to be fixed in position. I only had a quick glance at it but it appeared to be a light blue colored, oval shape with silver appendages or protrusions. My first thought was that it was a balloon but I don&#39;t know what one would be doing 15,000 feet over rural Pennsylvania.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very familiar with aircraft recognition both from flying so much and serving in the Army as an intelligence analyst in the 1980&#39;s. This object did not look like any civilain or military aircraft that I could identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We joked about it at first, but became curious as it seemed to change colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very clear evening and it didn&#39;t appear to look like anything else in the sky. Because the curiosity got the est of me, I went and got the video recorder. I started taping and was amazed at what I was seeing with the camcorder on full zoom. The object would change it&#39;s shape and display what appeared to be multiple colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My battery needed to be recharged on 2 occassions due to not using the camcorder in several months. I would recharge for about 15 minutes and then head back out. On the third time out, the object had moved to another location. I tried to record what I believe was still the same light, but it was much further away and I wasn&#39;t able to see it doing the same things as before. We watched the tape that I recorded and was amazed and puzzled. We have no idea what we were watching. I have never believed in UFO&#39;s, but feel pretty certain that what we saw was not normal. I could be wrong? I have absolutely no experience in this area. Whatever it was, I have never seen anything like it before in my 39 years.<n>

The light stopped its forward progress at the approximate NNW direction from my balcony, and seemed to hover for a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then abruptly soared upward at a fast rate of speed, then shot straight forward rapidly from West to East.  It hesitated again, momentarily, then the light disappeared.  A few seconds later, at least three normal aircraft appeared in the sky (their lights relatively identifiable), traveling in a gerneral East - West direction.  The object in question did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the darkness, and the absence of aerial refernce points, I could not estimate the object&#39;s distance from my location, nor its altitude.  I do know, however, that I have never witnessed an airborne object moving so erratically.  And, no, I was not under the influence at the time.<n>

It started to &#34;swing&#34; back and forth like a pendulum in mid air and stopping mid-swing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved in a non-linear fashion, sometimes slowly upwards or to the side. It rose up in front of the clouds in this manner as I watched it while driving. I watched it for about 5-7 minutes and it lost my site due to tall tree cover. I know it was not a plane or a helicopter or weather balloon. It was shaped in no manner to indicate such. It appeared to be like a disc from the side, it shifted in perspective from oval to a &#34;straight&#34; line. The actual size of the object is unknown because the distance from the car to the object was too far to determine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS:My girlfriend was driving directly behind me and witnessed the event also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with both witnesses via telephone, and they sounded to us to be exceptionally objective, rational, sober-minded witnesses.

It started out looking like a meteorite but then began to flash in a pulsing fashion as it moved to the north.  In the time that I observed it, it actually seemed to go out completely a few times allowing a non-illuminated object to be seen, barely visible but still there.  Finally it disappeared just as the plane that I was originally watching changed course in its direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both the plane and the object were unusual.  The plane because it did not follow the normal flight path of the commercial airliners that move in and out of the local internation airport and it appeared to be higher than normal for the distance that it was away from the airport.  The object itself would normally have been considered a standard large meteorite except for the fact that I&#39;ve never seen one fall to the north in this area and I&#39;ve never seen one glow and pulse like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Before doing so, I was taking some pictures looking back the way we had just come. I didn&#39;t see anything unusual in the sky at the time I took this picture, nor did I notice these objects in the picture afterwards. A couple of months ago a friend was looking at my pics from the trip and asked me what the objects were in the upper part of the picture. I thought they were just birds, but when I zoomed in on them, we were surprised at what we saw! There appears to be 2 identical saucer-shaped objects, light grey with a darker underbelly, metallic (you can make out the sun reflecting off of them); one of the objects has what appears to be some sort of static-type discharge coming off of it. Unfortunately, I had the photo quality set to &#34;normal&#34; instead of superfine, so am unable to get more details than what you can see when you zoom in on the objects. These objects didn&#39;t show up in any other pictures before or after this one.

It was gray it was about 500 ft-1000ft  from the ground it was flying so low it was almost like a plane had just taken off low.  It did not have any marking. It reminded me of the F-117 stealth fighter the only difference was this was completly flat. I was able to see seam work of how the object was put together ( I can&#39;t remember the direction they went in, ie horizontal or vertical) However the most remarkable thing is the object just seam to glide over head and there was no destinct sound that would draw your attention to look up, you&#39;d just have to be gazing at the sky to see it. There was no lights. it flew from right to left and headed towards Santa Monica.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness on several occasions about her sighting, and she sounded credible and sincere to us.

I was sitting in the front passenger seat and the car was in the righthand lane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had just past the small red island thats next to the Bridge and i was looking out to the south bay past the Bay bridge and and i saw the Big and long looking 747 jet Aircrafts flying towards and away from SFO. When you see a big plane or any plane far out in the distane they look slow and closer it is the faster it seems to move and the same for the opposite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So there was two planes, the one leaving SFO and the one coming in.the one leaving was further in the distane and you could see it moving reall slow and the same for the one coming into SFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right in between the view of the two jets was this bigger object, it was not longer then the two jets that are at two different distanes, but it was taller and had the shape of a blimp or an round and smooth oval and it had the shine of sun hitting cromed metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What realley got me thinking was why was the oject near the two planes or even further away in the distance moving  faster then the planes. it was hualling ass in the air and it was big but not a plane. It was goin away from SFO just  above the jet coming in and i saw it move east at real fast speeds and then it went up at a 45 dagree angle and disappeard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all happend in about 5 seconds.i Iook at the planes and they were not even moving that fast. the object was not a plane or a fighter jet. I have seen the Blue angels fly around the bay from my roof top in richmond during fleet week and they move real fast in the distance and the object was just about the same, maybe faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear day when i saw the object. the object was taller then the 747. fighter jets look like little hot wheel toys in the air. if you have seen one you know what im talkings about.<n>

It was making a loud engine noise.  It was not going very fast, kind of cruising.  I thought it looked strange, but not so strange that it was beyond human technology.  It was my impression that it was some sort of plane created by man.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another person was walking toward me, and he had seen it too, and joked to me that it must have been a stealth plane.

It was very, very low (about 150 - 200 yards from the ground) and for a split second, I thought it was a plane-until I saw it&#39;s streaking &#34;tail&#34; and how fast it was traveling--it was definitely no higher than the C-130s from Little Rock AFB fly during their normal training patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was heading from East to West and it caught my eye because it seemed that there was a bright flash, then it streaked for about 2-3 seconds, then the light disappeared.  I didn’t hear any sound, as I was listening to the radio at the time.  As far as brightness, at first I thought it was a low-flying plane, so it was pretty bright. As far as how big, I’ve no idea.

The moon was fully illuminated with a very bright crescent at the bottom  http://www.stardate.org/nightsky/moon/  The sun light that was hitting the moon allowed me to see the entire moons shape.  The moon was low on the northwest horizon, about 30 degrees. On the north side of the moon I could see 4-5 very faint lights that appeared to flash, move erratically and change color. My vision is excellent and I&#39;m not sure if this is an atmospheric phenomenon or what?  I would guess anyone staring at the moon tonight would easily see what I saw.  Is it distant stars that appear to flash due to the upper level winds and clouds?<n>

The lights flickered on and off, and with views from binoculars and telescope, I noticed a definitive triangular formation of identical bright blue lights, all equally spaced apart.  A few of them moved around with no noticeable pattern.  Throughout the whole hour I viewed them they remained just to the right of the moon.  There was a definite difference between these lights and the stars around them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/11/05 21:54|Island Pond|VT|Cylinder|1 minute|300ft cylinder moving east to west.  White lights in front, blinking red lights on tail.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43624.html|211|ndxe200504| 300ft cylinder moving east to west.  White lights in front, blinking red lights on tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was home on the night of April 11, 2005 watching a PBS tv special about the laying of the trans-atlantic telegraph cable. I was sitting in a chair next to a large picture window that faces directly south.  The only lights on inside the house were a small night light in the bathroom and the light from the television set.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the corner of my eye I saw a bright light outside which emerged slowly from behind some trees on the east side of my house.  The time was 9:54pm.  The light appeared to be a cluster of bright (prismatic) white lights which was immediately trailed by a long, very dark space and then there was a small cluster of blinking reddish lights.  My first impression was that the cluster of reddish lights was an airplane chasing the white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran outside to my porch and watched this object move slowly, perhaps 100-150mph, from east to west.  The sighting was at least a full minute.  It very soon became apparent that this was not two objects  but one.  The white lights in the front were trailed by a long, dark, unlighted structure that blotted out the stars as it passed.  It was a bright, starry night with a crescent moon low on the northwestern horizon; the moon was below the treeline behind the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trailing cluster of blinking, reddish lights followed in perfect, attached unison to the white lights and the unlighted structure, never moving closer or further away.  My best estimate of the size of this object (seen from the side) is about 300ft.  The object passed about 1000-1500ft from me and passed over the hill behind my house with about 200ft of clearance.  The hill&#39;s elevation is 1900 ft, my house is about 200ft below that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object passed directly east to west over the southern portion of my 11 acre, heavily wooded, hillside lot.  The area I live in is sparsely populated with few paved roads and no streetlights.  The lights of the local village are visible in the valley below my home, about four miles away to the northeast.  Only half of the village is visible due to intervening hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object passed my home I heard what I took to be a freight train passing through the village, this is a frequent and familiar sound.  I did not equate this sound with the presence of the object which did not seem to make any sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record:  I have ten years of military experience with the US Air Force and US Air Force Reserves.  My service was spent working on and flying in military aircraft (not as a pilot).  I am familiar with military aircraft and helicopters<n>

In fact, that is what I thought I was seeing, except for  two noteable differences. The bottom third seemed to be transparent and at the very bottom a white light as bright as the sun. The object could have been anywhere from a hundred yards to a mile or more away from me, I had no frame of reference to judge its distance. It moved slowly north to south seeming to slow a bit as a ballon drifting in the wind might. Its altitude seemed constant. It appeared at least five hundred feet above the floor of a valley I was facing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it in surprise, I ran to get a camera and was back in about twenty seconds by which time the object was gone. At the speed it was moving while I was watching, this should not have been possible. This was a clear day, the sun overhead and no noticable wind at my location. I have a picture of where I saw it, but not of the object itself. The size was about the end of my thumb at arm&#39;s length. There was no sound and it was so quiet that I could hear rocks scrunching under the wheels of a Jeep about a quarter mile away. So I didn&#39;t seen it arrive, I think it was there when I starting looking that way, and I didn&#39;t see it leave, it was gone when I got back with my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say it was a baloon except for the transparent part at the bottom and the very bright white light at the very bottom. Also, if it were a balloon, how did it disappear so quickly? Even if it burst, it should have been visible falling and I did look for that. It&#39;s really too bad I couldn&#39;t have gotten a pic of it. So there you have it, worthless as a report like this probably it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It didn&#39;t go fast, but changed shapes and disappeared into the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday, April 10th around 1pm I was looking up at the sky and saw what I thought was a white balloon, as I was watching it, it seemed to change shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my friend out to see what I was seeing. This person thought it was a plastic bag, but I pointed out it was up to high. After watching it for a few minutes my friend decided it wasn&#39;t a plastic bag, that maybe it was a weather balloon. I didn&#39;t agree with that either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept watching it and we noticed it was changing shapes and the speed varied, at some points it even seemed like it was staying in one place. It was going towards the sun. We got some binoculars and noticed it had something orange in the middle of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It got closer to the sun and then disappered into the sun but about a minute later returned on the other side of the sun and stayed in one place. I went to get a camera to take a picture and my friend stayed outside to keep watching, when I came back out in less then 30 seconds it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It never reappeared. I don&#39;t know if it was an ufo but don&#39;t know what else it could have been. We called the weather station to see if any weather balloons or anything else was in that area. The answer was no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked on the internet to see if anyone else encountered this but have found nothing. I just wanted to share it with someone. It was the most bizarre thing.<n>

When we were laying down we thought we saw a bluish flash a ways behind us off to the east. We didn&#39;t hear any sound correlating to the flash but it seemed close enough that we should have known what caused it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we got up to take a look in that direction. We didn&#39;t have to go very far, just to a clearing. There was a dark mass floating in the air. It&#39;s shape was indistinguishable. It was more or less flat and it seemed round but its entire mass did not move in unison. It sort of rippled but not in any coherent pattern (thus not really like a ripple but similar.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the bottom surface that we could see, there was a constant activity of blue flashes (though not very bright)freckled across the object. We all noticed the air felt very cold and moist and like static.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally some pieces fell off the object. They sprinkled off and shimmered as they fell to the ground. Then the object left slowly. It was hard to tell that it was moving. It got more more distant but the actual movement seemed imperceptable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to<n>

The sky was clear; wind calm and the sun had just set.  The sky was growing darker and darker blue straight above and stars were beginning to show.  The sky was becoming black in the east.  The setting sun was still keeping the western horizon illuminated and indirect lighting from the west made it possible to see my way without a flashlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my .243 Win. Remington 700 varmint rifle of which I am a quite an accomplished shooter.  It is considered a &#34;high-powered&#34; rifle.  I do quite a bit of bench rest competitive shooting with it as well as hunting.  The rifle is set up with a high-tech &#34;Leupold&#34; optical sight, (scope) which is extremely accurate and highly specialized for great light gathering ability and performs best in low light conditions.  It is not what is called a &#34;night vision&#34; sight.  The scope magnifies the target image with great sharpness and definition and the magnification is adjustable from 4.5 to 14 times that of the natural image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon my return to the motor home, I was tired after a long walk.  I had carried quite a bit of equipment with me.  I sat on a chair, took my eyeglasses off and toweled my face as it is already becoming hot in Texas.  While I rested, without my glasses on, I noticed three very &#34;unfocused&#34; lights to my south and these lights were moving toward me.  Immediately I put my glasses back on and saw what I believe was a UFO.   (SEE ATTACHED ANIMATIONS) (a)  Is the appearance of the vehicle without my glasses on and (b) is the view I had with my glasses on.)  (I drew the images on my pc)  The object approached from the south-southwest and while moving north-north east, passed almost directly overhead making no sound whatsoever.  I estimate its altitude to be somewhere about 800 feet and its airspeed speed approximately 30 mph.  It &#34;floated&#34; and did not fly as it obviously had insufficient airspeed to fly.  (I am a Physicist &amp; an FAA Licensed Pilot)  While the sky was almost entirely black behind it, I could clearly see its underside as it was illuminated from the fading sunlight to the west.  I estimate that the machine was about 60 feet wide and 80 feet long and 10 feet thick at the rear.  Under its belly, there was a straight line going from its leading tip toward the center of the aft edge of the fuselage, which was perpendicular to its travel.  This straight edge clearly showed its shape to be three-dimensional.  The straight line showed that its belly was V-shaped, much like the hull of a speedboat.  It was similar to the space shuttle as when viewed from in front and below the shuttle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This machine was directly over me and I was alone in the middle of nowhere, therefore, I felt quite &#34;uneasy.&#34;  It made no threatening moves whatsoever, but I aimed my rifle at it and through the riflescope, which was set on 8.5 power, I could clearly see surface detail in explicit detail.  The machine’s surface detail appeared to be covered with well-fitted tiles, much like the ceramic tiles used on the United States Space Shuttle.  Then in the fading light, I noticed a distinct marking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This marking was absolutely shocking, as I could actually read it!   It was white print outlined in black on a red arrow pointing toward a rectangle of sorts.  The arrow pointed at a something rectangular that I cannot define, but I clearly could read these three words, “EMERGENCY RELEASE and RESCUE.”  In the same place were other words that appeared too fuzzy to read.  I suspect that these words were “PULL FOR...”  Instantly I realized that this was a military machine and no “flying saucer.”  I felt much better as I knew that these were surface details that were intended to help rescue people access and then be able to remove the pilots on board in the event of a crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept the crosshairs on the center of the aircraft as it disappeared into the darkness but as I realized it was “one of ours” and it was not a threat to my own personal safety (I think) I put the rifle safety back on.  I can see however that others may have “defensively” shot at it --- and that may have resulted in a crash of the vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am somewhat “pissed off” at the military as while this area is directly under the Ft. Hood, Texas MOPA and practice flights are flown daily, really - they should not be taking chances like this where someone on the ground could actually be shooting the damned things down!  I am sure that the military pilots (if it even had a crew…) were aware of my presence but they NEVER expected possible “offensive action” to be taken against them on this low level flight.  The last thing I would have ever have wanted would have taken a “defensive” shot and then find American military pilots onboard in the wreckage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((COMMENT FROM ONE OF OUR READERS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> RE: your front page article on a &#34;Peculiar Military Craft&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> FULL ARTICLE:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43465.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> You (or the author of the incident ) probably mean &#34;Sidney&#34;, Texas.

As I was watching this jet, I notice what I first thought were five birds swirling around. It didn&#39;t take me long to realize these were not birds. In fact, they were shinny dots. I thought, &#34;What the heck is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> These things were not moving across the sky, they were staying in one general area. Then they went from this swirling dance into a perfectly straight line. It was at this point that I knew for sure what I was seeing was not balloons or birds or planes or helicopters or anything I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK, now they have my attention. From the straight line one of the dots just vanished. The remaining four spread out across the sky and formed a perfect square and drew the square tighter until they were close to each other again. Then another one of the dots just vanished and the three remaining formed a straight line again. They then spread out across the sky again to form a perfect triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into my house to grab my video camera at this time. I think I was back outside in about 10 seconds. When I returned, they were doing the same thing they did with the square. Going from a large triangle down to a very small one at which time they broke it off and danced around each other again. Then two of the dots vanished. The remaining shiny dot just stayed in position for about 20 seconds, It darted back and forth for a few more seconds and then just took off into oblivion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s what I saw. It was real, it was there and I can&#39;t believe it. I have no explanation for what I saw, but I saw it. I don&#39;t know if I got anything good on video. They were VERY high up and very small. I could not see then in my video camera&#39;s tiny view finder. I am going to watch it today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total event time: about three minutes. I will spend the rest of my days wondering what it was I saw yesterday. I am mystified.<n>

I was with my 13 year old son and his friend, when I happen to look towords the north and noticed a obect traveling east.At first I thought it was some kind of balloon because it was SILENT. The object was the size of a small aircraft approx. 2000-4000&#39;high.It was round with struts (looked like a wagon wheel) with a odd color blue light in the center. The object then banked to the north gained altiude untill we could no longer see it. It did fly under its own power except for the abscent of sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The event was dramatic but brief.  I estimate it lasted approximately 3-5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving I noticed a large neon green light, witha short teardrop tail, traveling at an obviously high rate of speed.  It was descending on a near vertical path.  There was a thin layer of clouds that the meteor appeared to penetrate.  As it penetrated the clouds there was a large flash of light, which eluminated the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The meteor then exploded into numerous and smaller &#34;shooting stars&#34;.  As the meteoriods continued to descend they all winked out prior to striking the ground. Although I feel this sighting is of a natural origin I have had one other sighting that I am not so sure of.  Last fall while outside I witness three pale orange balls of light in the north western sky that appeared to be  slightly ascending slowly disappeared. The lights appeared to be the size of a dime held a arms length. The lights were not blinding bright and were not fireworks.<n>

4/9/05 01:00|Osceola|MO|Fireball|10 or 15 seconds|With a light that lite up the whole sky and land it fell from the southeast and went northwest with a huge tail of colors.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43407.html|245|ndxe200504| With a light that lite up the whole sky and land it fell from the southeast and went northwest with a huge tail of colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night we saw the object the sky was clear and we were in the river on a boat. It was very dark. Suddenly there was a Huge flash of light that lite the whole sky. The flash was similar to that of a flash from a camera on a much larger scale. It lit up the river enough to see the people fishing on the shore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This caused the three of us to look skyward and saw what looked similar to a falling star. It was very obvious that it wasnt a star due to the Huge size of it. It started to leave a trail of several colors. Blue, red yellow and white. I was facing East and my other two friends were facing west. The object traveled from what seemed to be  South East to North West. I have enjoyed sky gazing since I was a youngster and have seen hundreds of Shooting stars in my life This wasnt one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking in the sky in a panoramic view I would say that it traveled accross the whole length of my view of the sky. The object then vanished. As if it had burnt up like a shooting star. It was not more than five minutes later when the three of us heard what sounded like a Boom. Perhaps a sonic boom. It was a very Deep bang. Similar to a blast of dynamite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well that&#39;s it. I was told later that it might have been space junk perhaps.  If thats the case I suppose the Titanic fell out of orbit. Thank You for taking the time to read my story. This was truly a story that I will never forget. The most spectacular light show Ive ever seen. Fourth of july early.<n>

Wasn&#39;t a baloon or a blimp and wasn&#39;t moving. I had her stay focused on it as I was driving and I would glimpse back when I could. We noticed it had gotten smaller out of nowhere, but was still at the same distance. I looked away and then back about a second later to see that it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE STARS (THEY WERE VERY PRETTY) AND SAW A LIGHT MOVING.  I THOUGHT IT COULD BE A SATALLITE BUT THEN I SAW MORE LIGHTS.  I ASKED MY HUSBAND OUR 2 FRIENDS TO LOOK UP AND IF THEY KNEW WHAT THEY COULD BE.  THE LIGHTS WERE MOVING QUITE SWIFTLY AND SEEMED TO BE VERY HIGH UP.  WE CONCLUDED THAT THEY COULDN&#39;T BE PLANES AS THEY WERE TOO CLOSE TO EACH AND CHANGED POSITION SEVERAL TIMES AND THERE WEREN&#39;T ANY FLASHING LIGHTS OR NOISE.  WE THOUGHT THAT THEY MAY BE VERY LARGE WHITE BIRDS (SWANS MIGRATING) AND THAT MAY BE THE ORANGE GLOW FROM STREET LIGHTS MAY BE REFLECTING OFF THEM.  BUT AS THEY GOT FURTHER AWAY THE LIGHT INTENSITY DID NOT CHANGE AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE LIGHTS SEEMED TO BE TOO HIGH FOR US TO HAVE SEEN THE BIRDS.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A few minutes pass and the light moved straight up and slowly started heading toward the hospital.  It was moving so slow that I asked &#34;Is is me, or is that light moving toward us?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> She agreed with me and and it took about 5 minutes for the light to move 3.5 miles. Its movement was a constant speed and the light didn&#39;t change its speed of pulsations. I can&#39;t be sure how fast it was moving, but I can be sure it wasn&#39;t as fast as a helicopter.  The hospital is 8 stories and when it became directly over our heads we could tell it was maybe 50 or 60 more feet high. I was have never experienced something like this before.  I have been around air crafts all my life and it was not a helicopter or an airplane.  It was dead SILENT! We were so freaked out I think we both must have said to each other &#34;noone&#39;s going to believe us&#34; 100 times.  The object continued over the hospital and disapeared.  The whole time it was moving I concentrated on what was surrounding the light. Due to poor lighting however, I couldn&#39;t be sure shape or size.  I could only observe some black construction of an aircraft around the light. I also believe that what ever it was we saw had to be relitivly small.  I don&#39;t know what it was but I don&#39;t think it was military, because there are no military places in hagerstown, and it was too low and silent to be a helicopter.  Im puzzled.<n>
4/8/05 22:00|Jamestown|NY|Unknown|2 HOURS|2 brightly lit hovering a/c spotted in W new york/ nw PA of april 05.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius and Jupiter?  PD))|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43385.html|249|ndxe200504| 2 brightly lit hovering aircraft spotted in western new york/ nw pennsylvania of april 05.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in the city of about 60,000 people and normally cannot see the night sky clearly as the city lights obstruct my view.  But on April 8, 2005, at around 10pm, a bright light in the sky was clearly visible and almost mesmurizing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What at first looked like a very bright star or planet had captured my eye.  After watching for about a minute, I noticed blue, then red, then yellow lights which appeared to be circling the aircraft.  At times the spacecraft would zig then zag, and you could easily see it rising and lowering slightly. I knew this wasn&#39;t a plane or helicoptor, nor was it a star or a planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first called my husband who was travelling home through western Pennsylvania.  He and his coworker were travelling together, and as soon as I mentioned this weird light in the sky, he claimed that they too had seen it.He said they had even stopped to get a better look.  They agree that they saw blue, red, and yellow lights and it was moving in strange directions.  He also stated there was another one that looked identical off towards the east. (I could not see the 2nd one from my window) I made phone calls to various family and friends.  All but one, went outside and witnessed it on the phone with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A relative in Steadman, NY spotted the 2nd one as I was on the phone with him.  He and his nephew watched with binoculars and could clearly see distinction between the red and blue lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light slowly started to fade away at time and then would reappear as bright as ever. I slowly headed off to west by about 11:30pm.  I could still see it out my window, but it was blending in more and more with the other stars and I had to struggle to see it.  At that time I decide to take a drive out into the country where I could get a better view.  But by the time I got onto the highway, the first light had complete gone out of sight and the second was following the same direction.  They were now much farther away then when first spotted.  You could not make out the color changing lights as well, but you could still watch it hovering on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By 1pm, it was completely out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin, in Steadman was measuring it&#39;s location by using the utility pole in his yard.  He could not believe how an object he had watched hovering for so long could move across the sky and out of sight so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was baffled and probably will continued to be.  It was extremely exciting to have witnessed it. I hope to see other stories of last night&#39;s sky show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested more information.  We have requested that the witnesses look again on April 9, to see if they witness the lights again.  We suspect they may be looking at Sirius in the west, and Jupiter, which currently is visible in the eastern sky during the time indicated.  PD))<n>

But there is more to this event than just seeing. I was hoping to see Jupiter, which I heard was going to be visible in the southeast sky this week. When I saw this star (and I am just using the word &#39;star&#39;for reference)I said to my wife, &#34;There&#39;s Jupiter&#34;. The moment I said this the &#39;star suddenly grew in size and brilliance-just as if something turned a light on using a dimmer switch very quickly to its brightest and then slowly dimming it until it completely dissappeared. The size difference-though hard to describe with such a distance-was like first seeing the point of a sharp pencil which then expands to the size of an unsharpened pencil and back to nothing. Both my wife and I asked each other at the same moment &#34;Did you see that?&#34; Object was seen head on and did not move in any direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible Iridium satellite.

I saw a solid flash of red that that went completely around the object and would stay on for about 2 seconds then go off and then come on again after about 2 seconds, I saw this object outside my window, about 50 feet up and 30 feet away from the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the red lights came on I could see the bottom of the object and it was shaped round. When the red lights went off I couldn&#39;t see the object at all, only when the red lights came on, was I able to see it. There was no sound from the object. I have never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I told my husband to pull over, so I could watch it, by the time we got pulled over it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witnesses, and they sounded to us to be quite credible.

Now this light appeared to be blinking off and on.  It was still quite a distance away, but close enough to know that it was blinking and standing still.  I watched it for about five minutes until I went in and brought out the binoculars.  My first thought was lights from a helicopter searching the valley below, but after careful examination of the object I had to rethink this, since there was no searchlight emitting from the object.  Focusing the lenses on the binoculars, I discovered that the blinking lights emitted a read and green hue in color in the center of the object.  The shape of the object appeared to be diamond shape or triangular in dimension; in fact, a faint ray of light came out on three, maybe four areas of the object, which made me think it could be diamond shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was definitely not a plane.  The object made no noise whatsoever.  In fact, a commercial or military passenger jet flew over the house in the same general location as the object, so you could definitely tell the difference in the way the objects moved in the air relative to each other.  Eventually, the object did move very slowly towards the right and up into the night sky.  Sometimes it went back to where it started, but eventually moved away.  Now at the same time this is going on, I saw another non-blinking white light just above the horizon.  It would move upwards and then just as fast as it appeared would disappear.  In addition, there were tiny, faint lights that appeared to be coming from the main object, but would disappear in the night sky.  I watched the main object for about twenty-five minutes before I gave up and went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Mission Range, about 8:30 p.m. it was cloudy weather. The site was south-east, above us paralell to the Missions.  What we both saw was at least 4 large lights, which rather looked like large head lights of a car, tumble through the sky, as if in Leap Frog.  The speed was faster than anything we knew of.  As soon as we saw them, they were gone. As soon as we seen them we both questioned the other &#34;did you just see what I saw?&#34;  Sure enough we both saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiance is Native American Flathead born and raised here.

No man made object could fly like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was sighted from our moving car on US HWY 10 E.  The object was sighted in the southern direction against the sky and some sharp hills (or mountains).  It was dusk so the light was dissapating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we noticed a black spec in the sky miles away that seemed to be moving.  The object would seem to hover, then accelerate at abnormal speed, slow down and would rapidly change direction at high speed. At times it would dissapear, then we would see it again in a different spot, at a different height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then appeared to be silver and more football shaped. The object was literally shape shifting as we watched. We saw tear drop shape, diamond shape, flat shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point the object faded from view and near its previous location we saw small white orbs dashing away from where it was hovering. I saw approx 3 to 4 orbs shoot out.  They kind of fish-tailed around really fast and then faded.  Then the object re-appeared, silver again and blimp shaped.  It was on one side of these sharp hills in the distance and seemed to be dancing around in all directions, like it was teasing us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a while it seemed really close to the hills almost like it was teathered. The hills had to be miles away.  We travelled far enough that we could no longer see the side of the hills that it could have been teathered to and it appeared at the opposite side of these hills.  If this were some sort of blimp teathered to the ground somewhere, it would have been impossible for us to see it from both angles. We video taped the object but because of the color of the sky mixed with us being in a moving car it is almost impossible to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did pull over at a truck stop and I got a picture of it with my digital camera.  At that point the object was fish shaped and did not move. If it were something floating or teathered that high up, surely the wind would have been blowing it around, but it was still, as if posing for us but too far away to see it clearly. After leaving truckstop it did dissapear from view completely as if it stayed near that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Helium-filled heliostat.  The photo shows the object quite clearly.

The sunrise was just begining and Jupiter was to the west.  I looked back at it in a minute and saw a moving star next to it.  I showed that to my wife who observed that the star was moving erractally northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed this for a minute and continued to watch the sunrise.  I then took my binoculars and looked at it.  It was circular and had a faint line that zigzaged through the middle and down to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Keeping my attention on  both the sunrise and the object we now noticed that this object was moving and not the star.  It was moving towards the sunrise and moved probably 25 degrees through the sky.  After 10 minutes I glanced away and looked to the east, but when I looked back it was gone!  I was shocked and both my wife and I scearched the sky for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took my binoculars and saw a darkish spot and we both observed three sparkling pieces of the object as it looked as it blew up.  The three smaller sparkling objects slowly faded out.  And that was it.<n>

Thinking about leaving them out for the night.  When I looked up at the sky to see if it looked like rain.  Something caught my eye, a light.  It was partly cloudy out.  It was as if I was looking at the bottom of a stingray shaped light circling the sky and it was the bottom of the craft. Which was above the clouds.  It was going from a distinct oval shape to a distinct circle.  Around and around, sometimes the circle would get larger then smaller.  It would take approx six seconds to complete the location.  I ran inside and got my two sons.  One was either sceptical or scared and went back in.  The other stayed.  We were on my top deck, it was very dark and we watched a good half hour.  During the sighting we saw twinkles of light coming from the craft, and some time what looked like windows of light. It lasted until we went to bed.  Waiting for the light again tonight, to see if it reappears.  It&#39;s 21:30 clear night nothing yet.......<n> <n><n> <n><n>

4/6/05 21:30|Reno|NV|Light|3.5 hours|Lights north over Reno|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43361.html|264|ndxe200504| Lights north over Reno<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 9:30pm last night... I stepped out on my porch to put a mop into the storage area on my balcony,<n> <n><n> <n><n> facing roughly west (I live on the second floor in my apt complex on the south side of Reno)and I happened to look towards the right (which would have been roughly northwest (towards Northern NV/Northern CA).  To my amazement, I saw what appeared to be dozens of very small dots of light flying extremely rapidly around each other, left to right, horizontally and vertically and moving at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In front, and at about the same height as me, was the rental office roof, so I approximated the objects to be flying anywhere from 10 to 20 degrees above the horizon.  They were so low, in fact, that if you weren&#39;t at least on a second story with a clear view in that direction, you would have missed them altogether. Because they were only pinpoints of light it was very difficult for me to judge their distance... I even jumped in my jeep, camera in hand, and drove to the north end of town to see if I could get a better vantage point to view them, but with no success.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the conditions, they could have been larger but farther away or smaller and closer, it was difficult for me to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived back home, I stepped out on my porch and sure enough, they were still there! By this time, it was around 10:45pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were seemingly just west of incoming air traffic to Reno/Tahoe airport (the commercial air traffic pattern brings them on the runway most of the time in a north to south direction).  It seems that Reno/Tahoe Intl. should have picked these objects up on radar or possibly sighting(s) by commercial airline pilots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat there and exhausted myself for a rational explanation... they dove horizontally and vertically and almost seemed to be &#34;playing&#34;, heading toward each other and then dodging at the last minute, like playing chicken or something, if that makes any sense.  I thought they were perhaps birds, but these objects were self luminous and moving extremely fast (depending on the distance it would have been in the hundreds of miles an hour+ range and besides that it was night time!).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought of bugs or moths flying around a light source, but there was absolutely no light source that close to me, I even took a short walk to check.  Maybe an atmospheric phenomenon, although there isn&#39;t any type of atmospheric anomaly I could think of... it was partly cloudy out, no rain and a slight breeze but no electrical/lightning activity in the area.  I literally stayed up until these objects finally disappeared, which happened not all at once but over the course over an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By 12:45am, there were only a couple left that I could see and then they also disappeared from view.  There were literally dozens of these objects and reminded me of fireflies buzzing around each other when I lived back east.  I checked the local online paper this morning for any unusual reports but nothing at all... which I was slightly disppointed in finding out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is there ANYONE else out there that saw this??  I&#39;d really be interested in knowing.  I&#39;m borrowing some binoculars today in case they reappear this evening.  PS... a couple of days ago I submitted another report about a sighting that I had along with my ex-wife about 10 yrs ago back by Angels Camp, CA.  I also submitted a report from August 23rd of 2003 about objects that myself and a girlfriend had spotted over Reno.  Last night included, this is cumulatively the fourth sighting in my life of something that I could not explain away.  I don&#39;t mind questions via the phone, I&#39;m intrueged but wary about all of this, so if interested, I&#39;d appreciate it if you could contact me through my email first. Thank you.<n>

They were evenly spaced with bright centers and paler halo of orange light around the outside. The overall shape was like a large caterpillar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved from west to east in front of a hill 4 miles away to the northeast. I ran for my automatic digital still camera and set it on (15 second) &#34;video&#34; as I did not want to give my position away by using a flash setting. I just saw the tail end of this object(s) as it turned to the north and then west, around the back of the hill. Orange light was now coming out from both the east and west sides of the hill. Then all went dark. There is a dirt road out there that leads to Superior Valley.<n>

At first I thought it must be a satellite but it then changed direction very rapidly (90 degrees) as it approached our ship at an unknown height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could clearly see it had a boomerang shape and was revolving (with multicoloured lights). It then passed over the top of the ship so we lost sight. I looked at my wife and said &#34;did you see that?&#34; and she confirmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any idea what it could have been?

My exact location and whereabouts are uncertain but I can at least make a general guess that i was somewhere between Bonelli Bay and the Temple Bar Marina in a cove somewhere.  As the evening drew in the drive became hard to see.  I didn&#39;t want to fall into an unseen gully nor did I want to drive over a dried tree stump and get a flat so I decided to just wait out the night.  As it started to rain i felt that the best thing was to just fall asleep in the truck with blankets over me.  I noticed as the night time creept it started to get very dark and all the crickets and bugs around my truck started to get fiercely loud and active.  I was staring into the night sky sitting behind the steering wheel when I noticed a few bright white lights in a V formation head toward my direction.  At first I thought that they were interestingly playful because they would fly together and then the leader or point light would leave the other two and head closer in towards my way.  It was obviously not an airplane because they would stop and then proceed in alternating speeds.  I had a great view of them especially because it was so dark where i was parked there were no signs of obstructive clouds in their range.  I remember it being very cold and sort of windy.  As I watched these lights come in and move out I tried to listen to them in order to determine if they were helicopters or military style aircraft.  It was very interesting to watch them move, stop and then forward heading in a direction towards the Hoover dam area or Boulder City.  Over a couple of hours these lights were playing in the midnight sky but never seemed to make any noise or any sudden moves other than great speeds as they were darting in the sky.  After a few hours there were lower flying helicopters circling the area with what had appeared to be flood lights grooming the area.  But, the helicopters were distinctly recognizable compared to the playful lights in the sky as you could hear their blades cutting through the wind.  At one time you could see a wide panoramic view of airlines on route, helicopters and these UNKNOWN solid white lights moving high and stopping in an orderly fashion as to be watching me watch them hover and dart to the west.  It also appeared as if a light would stop and then another light would break off from its original making two independent solid white lights. They were actually fun to watch. By the morning I decided to leave and head to Las Vegas, Nevada.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It resembled the type of light seen when say you see a streetlight, or other singular point through the mist/cloud.  I thought it was a low flying light aircraft until i realised that there was no noise, and or cloud cover.  I could see the stars clearly in the sky and thought it was strange.  The light faded in, after a second, and what had looked like 200m travelled, it faded out.  It was kind of like a meteor, but was much much larger as i have seen many meteors.<n>

The pattern was symetrical and I thought it looked like an advertising plane with lights on the wing. Only problem was that it was too large and silent. Only the single points of light in formation were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then around 10.30-10.35 there was a skalene triangle formation of 3 lights flying across the sky in a southward direction. They looked like fighter jets in formation from the apparent speed and distance. The span of the formation was about 1 inch at arms lenth.  There was some other normal air traffic, but on the aircraft you could make out multiple lights as well as the body of the plane. The light formations observed were white and single points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw a linear formation of 3 lights head north. A little while later a single light head south. That was the last one I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the lights were too far apart to be a single airplane, although they kept perfect formation. Straight line travel,  no turns that I saw. From the way they faded when heading toward the horizon I would guess they were quite high. Too fast for a satelite, plus this was downtown and a satelite would be too dim. I estimate they were traveling 30 degrees of arc in 5 second when overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I heard an prop driven aircraft and began to look for it (as I am an aviation buff). I spotted the plane heading south to north at about 3000 feet above ground level. We are about 4100 feet above sea level. As the aircraft passed overhead, I noticed another object moving north to south. I called my wife&#39;s attention to the object as well. The object looked metalic (silver and reflective)and resembled the shape of the early flying wings. My best estimation is that the object was 30 - 40 ft across and traveling at an altitude of 15,000 - 20,000 feet. There were no visible lights or strobes. It was higher than the aircraft we spotted, But lower than a jet that left a contrail a few moments before. The object was moving much faster than the jet and made no sound. It continued in a staight line until out of sight (about 30 seconds). We continued looking up while discussing what the object may have been. After about one and a half minutes we noticed two more objects of the same shape and configuration flying in the same direction as the first. They were at about the same altitude and speed. They flew parallel to each other about 800 ft apart. Again no sound and were visible for the same duration. We continued to look in the direction that the objects came from. After about another minute or so another object was spotted. It continued overhead as the others had done. However, at about 30 degrees past directly overhead the object appeared to perform a single roll or steep bank which showed a distict reflective property. The object continued on for a short distance then veered off to the left then veered back to it&#39;s original path until out of sight. The prevailing wind at the surface was from the south west. The clouds and contrails were drifiting in a north easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have invited the witnesses to submit illustrations of what they observed.  PD))<n>

I was going from Pomfret to Dayville, CT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:45 p.m., I noticed an extremely bright white light in the northest sky. This white light had a small red light on the left, and a small green light on the right. None of the lights were blinking. This object appeared to be maybe 2,000 feet in the sky, and it was moving very slowly in a southerly direction. I watched it for about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, the white light, which was much brighter that anything else in the sky on this clear evening, faded out. The two colored lights remained lit, and the object continued to move in a southerly direction. At this time, I saw another object pass under it by a few hundred feet. This second object had a series of smaller, duller white lights which formed a semi-circle and strobed. The first object&#39;s remaining lights went out at this point. I continued traveling east on rte. 101 for another 5 minutes, still observing the second object, which was moving in a northeasterly direction rather slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed this object for a total of 10 minutes, at which time it disappeared behind a treeline.<n>

The light was so dim it was barly visable and at first I thought it eas a large white bird and the light was a reflection off the wings. Then as I focused better I noticed it was not a bird but a craft of some kind. The craft moved silently out of sight heading north northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I haven&#39;t seen a shooting star since I was really young and my memory was them appearing much smaller and obvious that they were far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I was smoking a cigarette leaning against the trunk of my car in the parking lot of my apartment complex about 10 miles south of downtown Nashville, TN at about 4am.  I was sort of looking up and relaxing (getting my mind off my work, as I work from home on my computer.)  I noticed the normal few stars you can see here with the naked eye (nothing like you can in rural areas, like Vermont where I&#39;m from.)  So I noticed the couple brighter ones, but not knowing much about them I can&#39;t tell you if the particularly bright one is Mars or the North Star or whatever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I glanced down as I flicked ashes but at that moment a flash in my peripheral or something caused me to look up to my left...  But it was sort of in a way that you might look at a lower flying plane (we see them all the time because the airport is kind of close.  They aren&#39;t low enough to be really loud, just enough to spot their lights if you&#39;re out driving in the area, etc.)  Anyway, I sort of casually looked over.  And focused on a light which may or may not have been stationary when I first saw it (hard to remember this all happend in a matter of less than 5 seconds.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I realized in like a milisecond that it wasn&#39;t a plane because it was to far off, but at the same time didn&#39;t see to be &#34;in space.&#34;  It was sort of like a star&#39;s light, only softer if that makes sense.  Anyway, by the time I focused on it it shot acrossed a good percentage of the sky ridiculously fast parallel to the ground (from my vantage point.)  It&#39;s still hard to picture it moving that fast again, but I do recall somewhat of a &#34;streak.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all in those same couple seconds it disappeard.  But didn&#39;t fissle out, it looked as if it dissappeard behind a wall.  I also don&#39;t know if it was my imagination but the light seemd to be almost a soft white/blue color.  Not where you&#39;d be like &#34;wow that&#39;s flourescent blue&#34;, but I think you know what I mean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, my thought was, for it to have moved acrossed that much sky, as far out as space, it would have to have been moving ridiculously fast.  Obviously the closer an object would be, it move acrossed a &#34;chunk&#34; of sky more quickly.  Not sure which scientific law that is, but it&#39;s common sense anyway.<n>

It seems that someone did see this fireball in Nashville, TN the same night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in a rural area about 50 miles west of St. Louis. I am 55 years old and a bookkeeper for my husband&#39;s business.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not real sure about the time, I know my clock said 3:00 am but I can&#39;t remember if I had turned the clock forward in my bedroom since daylight savings time started that previous Saturday. I know it was a couple of nights before I remembered to change it. (One of the advantages to working from your home, I am not chained to my clock.)  I was having a hard time getting to sleep that night and was laying facing my window which faces the South. I saw a large blue/white streak going parallel to the horizon traveling through the sky from the East to the West at about the 2 o&#39;clock position.  The Nashville report did not state the direction the object was traveling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen many meteor showers before and this was quite different. It didn&#39;t travel in a completely straight path - seemed so sort of &#34;wiggle&#34; slightly up and down and get slightly thinner and fatter along its path. It almost looked like it was an object tumbling slightly along. The width of the streak was quite a bit wider than the width of a normal meteor shower streak. (Maybe about the width of a pencil at arm&#39;s length.)  The object traveled very fast. It was only in the view of my window for approximately 2 to 3 seconds, but was so bright that it left a glowing blue trail behind it. I can remember seeing the entire length of its path, including its slight up and down movements for a second or two after it passed by. Normal meteors fade almost as quickly as they are seen. Unusual also was the fact that I don&#39;t recall seeing a meteor travel almost perfectly parallel to the horizon like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My feeling is it was probably something like space junk re-entering the atmosphere. Hopefully that would be something easily checked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It first caught my attention moving backward down too the treeline again.  I started looking, following it with my unaided eye it came back up to the same spot about 10 degrees over the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then moved left to me, a southwardly direction, 10-15 degrees.  This was the point where I started wondering and got binoculars (16x32 power).  It was triangular with blue lights, my hands were not steady enough to tell then where the lights would be on the object.  It looked like a stealth bomber the best I could tell at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I really wanted to know what it was out there.  I had my telescope by the door because I had planned on using it tonight.  It is a 130mm reflector, with a 25mm eyepiece in when I grabbed it.  I got it out and on the object.  It was an isosceles triangle with blue lights on what would be the sides of the wings if it was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I got the scope on it, I had to follow it back to the tree line.  The scope was set at 2 arch seconds at first, and that was not fast enough.  I had to change the speed of the scope, but I had lost it below the treeline before I changed the speed on the scopes mount.<n>

Observing the night sky I noticed a light about the intensity of an average star moving from north to south at about one inch per second at arms lenght.  Then the object made an eliptical loop that would approximate the outline of my thumb at arms lenght.  At the end of the loop the object stopped, increased in intensity and size to about 4 times the size of venus with a brilliant white light forming a beam towards earth. The object did not move for 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object decreased it&#39;s intensity incrementatlly until it vanished.  I watched the same spot in the sky for 15 minutes and it did not appear.  There were no aircraft strobes visible and the weird flight pattern, sudden stop, no noise and disappearnce rules out aircraft or ballon etc.  The objects illumination would be about like that of a airliner&#39;s landing light at about 3000 feet which I see frequently.  The behavior pattern did not fit that of any meteor I am aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound associated with this and I would estaimate the altitude to be in excess of 10,000 and more likly 30,000 or higher.<n>

Everyone looked and sais it was the Little Dipper constellation. I said that you don&#39;t see stars in the daytime, much less one constellation. The 11 ( I think) &#34;stars&#34; were very bright and 80 deg. north of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in to get my binoculars, and in the 30 seconds it took me to get back outside, some had disappeared and others were moving. I followed 2 heading southeast and saw a fuzzy capsule shaped object- still very bright. In the binoculars, it looked like it was &#34;bouncing&#34; and I told our guest so and she said it looked to her like it was going in a straight line. Another thing I noticed was that the sky around it was a deeper blue.<n>

They were a shiny and white, however they were disappeing and reappering in diffrent spots in front of us in the sky. The seemed to be flying almost in a pattern. Then as suddenly as they had appeared they dissappered. They were traviling as fast as my car, around 70 mph or faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were on a flat roof changing out several Air Conditioning Systems. I went down my ladder to get a tool off of my truck and started back to the ladder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After climbing a few steps up the ladder I spoted something that I knew was not normal, so when I got to the top of my ladder I called out to my nephew and brother &#34; What&#39;s That&#34; they both turned to look where I was pointing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I rememberd that I had my Kodak EasyShare DX4900 Digtal 4.0 MEGA PIXELS camera, so I started back down the ladder to get it out of my truck where I just had placed it from taking photos of our work for the web page.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tell you what, this thing was standing still just hovering over us untill I started taking photos at which time it started to move away and starting climbing higher, I know this thing knew I was taking photos of it. It looked like a stare then it looked like something else not sure what shape to call it but it was changing all the time we were looking at it, but most of the time it looked like a star really bright at times and then not so bright I managed to take 3 photos of this thing before it got out of sight.  What a day<n>

This night was clear and calm, no really windy or anything.  It is too early in spring for there to be crickets or frogs or any other night noise.  Now I have lived in this area for 30 years and know what all the military planes, helicopters, stealth bombers and tilt rotors look like and sound like when flying.  I can just about tell you what is flying by the sound it makes without looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And this made no sound.  It was just sheer luck that I saw it when I did.  It was just this huge black chevron.  No lights, no sound, nothing.  Huge.  I couldn&#39;t even begin to describe how big it was or how high.  It was flying at about the height military planes fly when there is cloud cover and they have to fly low.  Except with military planes my windows usually rattle when they fly low.  But it was huge.  Bigger than anything I have ever seen flying.  And quite.  I just stood there and staired at it until it was out of my range because of trees.  Now I will be out there every night looking for this thing again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The conditions were windy and very thick snowfall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I peered outside, the night lit up blue as our household power went out. This happened several times in the course of maybe five minutes. As soon as the light went out, power was restored.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The duration of the blue light was maybe 1 to 2 seconds. It was similar to lightning, except blue &amp; intermittent with our electricity loss. I was looking out towards the power lines about 20 yards in front of the house and there was no arcing. The light seemed to be coming from above the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have inground power lines to the house. I went outside to get a better vantage point but by then it had stopped. My wife phoned the power co. they said they had no reported power outages.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning i spoke with my neighbor who slept through it but said his son saw the same thing. His son lives about 150 yards up the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in a rural area with no high tension power lines around. The post from North of Akron on 4/2/05 caught my eye since that incident occurred 6 or 7 hours earlier and about 70-80? miles away.<n>

The bright flash of green light lit up the whole sky like a green sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My one friend and I both had our eyes closed in the back-seat when we were both startled by a bright green flash that shined through our eyelids like a flashlight. When we opened our eyes we saw the green sky and we both saw a white floating ball (light?) cross the road several hundred feet in front our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other 3 passengers (including the driver) saw the bright green light. The light lit up the inside of the car so much that the driver couldn&#39;t even see his dash lights. The passengers that had their eyes open the entire time didn&#39;t see the white object moving across the road because they were all temperally moon-blinded from it going from the bright green to the black sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event only lasted 3-5 seconds, and afterward several of us had felt our hair standing on end for a couple minutes afterward. We didn&#39;t see any more flashes during the rest of the drive.<n>

The object moved north, turned east, then west in what looked to us like a 3/4 box turn.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking in the day looking over a field from the golf course on Aviano AB, Italy, when suddenly an object appeared to be hovering at approximately 200 feet in the air. I would estimate the distance to be about 2 to 3 miles away, between the base and the town of Pordenone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was slightly triangular to diamond shaped on top, with a cylindrical extension coming from the bottom. It almost had the appearance of a very rounded, exaggerated arrow. The top portion consisted of distinctly separate tubes or cylindrical elements connected together, and rounded on the ends. The color was off white, like a white car that hadn&#39;t been washed in a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to shimmer in the sky like heat waves coming off of a hot road would shimmer. Size wise, it was if I was looking at a traffic cone in the sky. I have no idea how this relates to the actual size of the object in relation to the distance I presumed I was observiting it at, but that is the closest comparison I can make.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so amazed by what I saw, and was so intent on capturing as much detail in my mind as possible that I neglected to alert anyone in my group as to what I was witnessing. After what seemdd like 5 to 7 seconds, it simply vanished, and I had not looked away from the object even for a split second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The day was sunny with near perfect visibility, the temperature was near 60 degrees F.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your quick response. I actually ((athletic activity deleted for anonymity sake)) with someone who works in the tower, and sort of tried to ask in a roundabout way if he had heard of any strange blips on the screen lately, but he said no. I mentioned my sighting to a few folks, and I can understand why so many people are hesitant to report their sightings, and especially those that feel they may have experienced abduction. I must say, it was infuriating and embarrassing at the same time listening to them make jokes about it. I dare say they<n> <n><n> would change their tune if they had seen what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I read about a very dramatic UFO event here in Aviano which occurred in 1977. Is that the one you are referring to? Supposedly all the power on base got knocked out for about an hour until the craft slowly crept away over the mountains. There were both American and Italian witnesses. I read it in a<n> <n><n> big blue book about UFO&#39;s and an alleged worldwide governmental cover-up (Goodwin as the author, maybe?). There are some amazing stories in that book. I also read the book about the incident at Bentwaters, and many others on the subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I experienced one other sighting which I believe is worth mentioning. Would you like me to describe it in a reply E-mail, or would you like me to submit it on the website again? Also, I would have no problem with being contacted by the retired officer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sir, my wife and I are both keenly interested in the UFO phenomenon.

I was looking at some stars to he right of me, and out of the corner of my eye I notice moving light. I focused on it and it wasn&#39;t one, but three its! Moving from my right to left (directly in front of me, but way off in the distance). I could clearly see three dim red lights flying equidistance apart. They weren&#39;t flying directly behind each other, but as if you turned a straight line at maybe a 45 degree angle. After they caught my eye and I quickly realized what I was seeing, I immediately sat up and and said out loud, &#34;Oh my ((deleted)) god.&#34; Shortly after I said this, they disappered. I don&#39;t know if they flew away at an insane speed, or if I just couldn&#39;t see them anymore because of a street light that was then blocking my view. I&#39;ve believed in UFO&#39;s for a while but never saw any. Now I have! There is no doubt in my mind that what I saw was proof of E.T.&#39;s!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>

The sky was clear with no clouds. It was circular and was a white/blue color like that of a star. There were no flashing lights on the object and was at an extreme altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I decided before going into town I would camp one last night and so I pulled off the main road onto a dirt road and headed in the vicinity of Lake Las Vegas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I was alone I had no time frames to head into Vegas that night.  I ended up in the middle of this marshy dry desert creek bed in my Ford Explorer.   As the nighttime came around I could see the lights of the jet airliners from McCarran Airport trail off towards the East.  As I was looking in a Southerly direction I noticed this star like light getting brighter and brighter as it was headed towards me from the South.  This light was very peculiar as I watched it get brighter and larger at first it looked like a star but after about 10 minutes I could tell this light was entering the atmosphere.   I then noticed that this light broke off into two other lights and they came down towards me in a triangle formation.  Three lights in a perfect triangle formation way above the jet airliner trail path in the distance.  I realized that there was another star coming down the same way as the first and it broke off into 3 lights flying in the same triangle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this for about 20 minutes and it seemed as if these two triangle formations were comprised as of 6 total lights.   They rotated and came closer down towards my way as I was fascinated watching this distinctively from just outside of my SUV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t remember falling asleep after that spectacle but I woke up in the driver’s seat of my white Ford Explorer with my hands gripping on the front steering wheel. After I woke up I felt a little surprised and started the car and left for Las Vegas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the truth to the best of my knowledge and I was not under any influence of alcohol nor drugs during my vacation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Two of them are a couple and the third is an old friend of mine who comes to visit me regularly. The couple decided on their second or third night visiting that they would like to go camping somewhere nearby. The boyfriend had never been to Sedona, and was taken away by its beauty. He talked the whole visit about what he wanted to see in the area while he was there and his desire to explore the metaphysical aspects to Sedona. After the couple came back from their hike that day, they were ready to go on the camping expedition. My other friend from California and I took them out to a spot we knew on a big, tall hill just outside the Village of Oak Creek near Sedona, just off of Beaverhead Flat or &#34;Seven Mile&#34; Road. My friend was tired, so she decided to stay asleep in the passenger seat of her truck, which we had used to lead the couple in their truck. It was about 2100 hours when we arrived at the campsite, I believe; I can&#39;t be sure. However, the three of us cracked a Beck&#39;s Beer each and started shooting the breeze. About an hour or hour and a half later was when the sighting occured. The couple and I were standing an equal disctance from each other around the campfire, talking. Somehow, the subject of UFOs came up in the course of conversation, and the boyfriend casually mentioned his desire to see one while in Sedona. The girlfriend confirmed, saying that he basically wouldn&#39;t shut up about it on their hike earlier in the day. No more than two minutes passed when, in the middle of a sentence while speaking to me, the girlfriend broke off and said, &#34;Is that a UFO?&#34; She didn&#39;t point, but her eyes looked so wide they were about to burst out, and she was looking directly over my shoulder. I turned around, and without skipping a beat, I said: &#34;Yes, it is.&#34; The boyfriend&#39;s eyes were transfixed in the same direction, his mouth hanging open like a Looney Tunes cartoon. What I saw was just above the horizon to the West: Three lights, in a perfect triangle (I don&#39;t rightly remember the orientation), maintaining their position. The lights were brighter than any other object in the sky, even with this being a clear, starry night, but they were so far away they looked to be in space, not in the atmosphere. Immediately after confirming the girlfriend&#39;s sighting, I yelled to the boyfriend to grab the camera. &#34;John*, grab the camera!&#34; He just sat there staring. I looked back at the lights. They started to ever so slowly move over to the right; almost imperceptably. &#34;John*, get the f*cking camera! Now! Go!&#34; I yelled. He started to run around frantically, looking for the camera that he hadn&#39;t even unpacked yet, while not taking his eyes off the lights. He tripped over several objects. I knew where my friend&#39;s camera was, so I ran back to her truck, the girlfriend in tow (scared out of her wits, screaming), and threw open the driver door. The girlfriend cowered behind me. I yelled at my friend while grabbing around frantically in the dark truck for the camera. &#34;Sarah*! Wake up wake up! Look!&#34; I pointed out her window, in the direction the lights had been. She turned and looked. &#34;What?&#34; She said. &#34;It&#39;s gone?!&#34; I yelled. I looked over at the boyfriend, who was now holding his camera in his limp right arm, looking more disappointed than I&#39;ve ever seen a soul. He told me what happened: &#34;Dude, it moved over to the right all fast, and then it was just gone.&#34; I asked him if he got a picture, and he said he didn&#39;t find the camera in time. My friend never got to see it, but the other three of us have never seen more proof-positive evidence as to the existence of UFOs. We are all true believers now. The boyfriend kept muttering that he had had a life-changing experience, and how he would think differently about everything now. I tried to use humor to make myself feel more comfortable out in the wilderness. The girlfriend was very scared, but expressed a willingness to remain in the wilderness with her boyfriend, who was now stating his want to be abducted. And my friend was scared silly by the looks on the rest of our faces, and wanted to get out of there. We left, wishing the couple good luck on their possible abduction, and high-tailed it out of there as fast as we possibly could. We asked the couple in the morning if anything else had occured, and they said nothing after we left. I wish we had a picture, so we wouldn&#39;t sound crazy, but we&#39;ll all take a lie detector test any day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *I changed these names.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.

Iam writing this because Iam not sure what to do here. I was flying back via Blyth to eagle airfield in my cherokee, the enging started to make a rough sound and that got my attention, when I looked to the right at my oil temp and fuel guages I caught a glimps of a dull looking object out the right window. I looked down at my gps and noticed I needed to steer right to get back on course. After turning right a couple of degrees I saw this dull grey object on my right again, I turned further to the right and this object turned with me. I could see it was circular and a dull grey color and it looked like it was rotating. I did not see any lights on it. The object was about a block away from my plane, I continued to make a right turn to get a better look at it, as I turned furthur it decended out of sight. At this point I got back on course and notice I had lost about 1500 feet, so I climbed back up to 8500 feet after getting back at 8500 feet I had to correct course again, I had to turn left a little, I looked out the right window to see if I could see this thing again and it was gone. I looked out my side on the left and noticed the circular thing was on the ground, I made a left turn and decended down to 2000 feet when I got closer I could tell it was sitting on the ground, I wanted to see what exactly was this thing. I climed back up to about 7500 feet and proceeded back on course to eagle. I have not said nothing about this to anyone..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I was very scared because they were so calm! I decided to see what they were seing so i looked at the sky ut didn&#39;t see anything but tried looking harder when i saw it it was very far, my first thought was maybe its a bag, but there was no wind i tried thinking what it can be then, it started to move back and forth then stop in mid air! At that moment i thought this is not a plane it can&#39;t be, after looking at it for 10 minutes it moved east very fast i ran inside to the front when i looked i could bearly se it. I decided to tell my sisters and my councelor who was working with us because we were going through rouge times. They didn&#39;t believe me!

It was a clear night, temperature near 5C or 40F and calm winds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For about 3 seconds, while facing NW I heard a muffled yet steady low-pitched humming noise approach me from the SW. I turned and scanned the sky to identify its source. Unable to see anything I returned my sight to the NW and suddenly saw a single point of pale blue light perhaps 35-40 degrees from the horizon at a distance of what I approximate to be 1/2 a mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light moved suddenly and appeared to be ascending in the sky as it retreated. It did not blink, change intensity or change in size. I lost sight of it behind a tree but it did not reappear on the other side. My entire experience lasted less than 10 seconds. I was frozen in fear for a few minutes (there were no noticeable effects on my dog&#39;s behaviour) as I tried to comprehend how what I had initially heard had traveled from behind me to 1/2 a mile in the opposite direction in only a few seconds without my seeing it overhead. It must have been moving incredibly fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live 6 miles from the local airport and it is not uncommon to see aircraft ranging from single prop recreational planes to business jets to air ambulance helicopters or an occasional military aircraft. I know what I saw was not an aircraft.<n>

All of sudden 6 bright white lights turned on in the sky directly above me.  I was maybe 30 feet from being directly underneath it.  It just floated and made no noise at all and i was very scared.  Then a min into it a red light started going around the disk in a counter clockwise motion, every second, all the way around on the part of disk that goes from the bottom part up. This totally freaked me out and I ran inside to get my mom to show her.  When we got outside....1 min later...it had to be 20 miles away headed towards Frayser (memphis area) but still very visible in plain view and mother saw it and ran inside scared.....this object was as big as 3 planes probably.  Then later on during the night i heard a high pitched ZzZzZzZ noise in my head and just knew the thing was back, but i was to scared to go outside. I ran around the house knowing it was out there.   The noise reoccured at on other point during the night. I got up both times it happened. The sheets were sticking to me cause of all the sweating i was doing.  The last time i was up i had a lighter than air feeling occur to me, really hard to explain.  Then after a few days i completly pushed it out of my memmory untill recently.  I could never convince anyone about what i saw except my mom cause she saw it.  I have never seen anything before and doubt i will again.
