Object made no sound and floated perfectly still for around four minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a Police Officer for the North Little Rock Police Department I once held a part time security job for a large apartment complex on the North side of town.  I was compensated with a free apartment and was required to secure three different one-level professional buildings  as one would occasionally be accidently left unlocked. In July of 1996 my wife accompanied me to help check the doors, shortening my required walk.  Coming upon the last building my wife and I again met up at which time we noticed an unusual type of light reflecting on the pavement 50-100 yards in every direction.  The light closely resembled the light emitted from late model Lincoln headlights  (a new type of halogen bulb) and had sort of a purple tint.  In total amazement we both looked up to observe some sort of craft hovering in total silence  around 300 feet over our heads.  The craft had very bright white lights placed in a triangle and no other lighting.  The brightness did not seem to correspond to the level of light hitting the ground as if it were diffused on its way down.  The craft remained motionless until we could get to our apartment (approx. 1 block) in an attempt to get my binoculars.  We observed the craft the entire way to the apartment and actually began to feel uneasy about the ships presence. Unfortunately the ship was gone when we came out of the house with the binoculars and we were never able to observe the ship moving. I grew up within a mile of an airport and have seen every type of aircraft and its lights and this was not a conventional aircraft of any sort.<n>

However, it was the summer (approximately July or August) of 1995 or 1996 and took place in Crestview, Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the backyard with my grandson when I looked up and saw an object in the sky.  It was solid white (at least I don’t remember any markings or lights) and triangular in shape.  It was long and narrow, looking about the shape of the long paper airplanes we made as kids.  It was moving very slowly and completely silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for a moment and then looked down to tell my grandson to look up.  When we both looked up, the object was gone.  It was broad daylight and the sky was completely clear with no clouds into which it could have disappeared.  I could not have taken my eyes off of it for more than a few seconds.  It would have had to move at a tremendous speed to disappear in that time.  I’ll never forgive myself for looking away and not seeing how it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later a small aircraft flew over at approximately the same height as the object (maybe a bit lower), and I could clearly hear the airplane engines.  The object had made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven’t mentioned this incident to anyone but my family, and my grandson was much too young to remember it.  I was afraid to be labeled a kook because of the many “sightings” that have been reported in Gulf Breeze, Florida, over the years.  Gulf Breeze is only about 20 miles from Crestview as the crow flies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven’t read or seen any accounts of objects that were shaped exactly like the one I saw.  If you have had reports of anything like it, I would greatly appreciate your letting me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

7/30/96 11:00|Gilroy|CA|Light|8minutes approx|Gilroy California|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38465.html|4|ndxe199607| Gilroy California<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reference the forwarded photograph taken at the end of July first week of August 1996 time frame. I recently came across this photograph again and scanned it in to my computer, something I did not own when I first arrived in Gilroy; enlarging it for a better view I was intrigued by what I was looking at particularly the straight angular bar at the bottom. I believed that there was a seperation between the two objects in the photo but on showing it to a couple of friends they suggested it was connected, the blue in the middle was the sky reflecting on to what must be a very shiny side of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the more intriguing, as this was not what I had taken a picture of. I had been working in my kitchen when from outside a white flash caught the corner of my eye turning to see what it was I noticed what I at first thought was a white plastic bag that the sun was giving a brightness to as it was being carried by the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no wind this is July/ August in Gilroy Calfornia, as I stood watching trying to figure out what it could be this brilliant white object hovered for a few seconds maybe as long as thirty seconds at times then it would all of a sudden be in a different place in the sky, skipping in zig-zag fashion extremely fast, impossible for anything I had previously believed could travel at such a rate. It would be in one position then literally in a flash a position distant to its original.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this erratic zig-zaging and hovering for maybe six minutes. The object seemed to be getting closer as it appeared to be getting a little larger each time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to get my camera, returning the object was closer and larger that any time previous and just hovering. I quickly aimed my camera and hoped I had captured something the object simultaneously disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As you can see there was no no expanse of brilliant white light but the object you see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

7/30/96 01:30|Winona (about 30 miles NW of)|MN|Flash|1-2 min|The lights followed alongside the car|2/22/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41863.html|5|ndxe199607| The lights followed alongside the car<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom just introduced me to this web site yesterday and I wanted to post my experience because it was so strange. It was near the end of July in 1996, Myself (20yrs old) and 3 friends (ages 17-19)were driving from Minneapolis to Winona in the middle of the night. We wanted to be in Winona at the scenic overlook by sunrise. I had made this trip one other time before. I was driving an old 2 door Ford Escort, and my friend (who is now my husband) was in the passenger seat, and another couple were in the back seat. It was sometime between 1 am and 3 am, (not sure of exact time) it was a clear night, not very cloudy at all, we were the only car on the road and we hadn&#39;t seen another car for about 30 minutes, the other couple with us had fallen asleep in the car. All of a sudden without any warning there were 9 large, bright, flashing lights out my driverside window, now my friend on the passenger side only saw one of the lights out the windshield (in the top corner on the driverside). The lights were in three rows of three, and the rows were staggered (will email drawing)The best way to describe the lights is like a set of stadium lights, like at a baseball field, when they turn on you can here the flash as the electricity runs to the bulbs. Thats how all 9 lights looked, and they all flashed at the same time, but not in a pattern just random. The lights lit up the other lane on the highway and the ditch. There was nothing but open field in this area, and the lights were very bright I was yelling at my friend &#34;What is that, Do you see that&#34; and he just staired out the windshield and was absolutely quite through this, and the two people sleeping in the back seat didn&#39;t wake up as I was yelling at my friend to answer me. Now, i&#39;m not saying there was something wrong with him he was just shocked at what we were seeing and didn&#39;t know how to respond to me. I was driving about 60 mph when these lights appeared, and they kept pace with the car for at least 30-40 seconds, they remained out my driverside window, flashing, they didn&#39;t change color but I would say they had some color. I don&#39;t know if the lights had color or if it was my eyes messing with me, it was like stairing at the sun, you get some spects of color in your view when you look away. They were very bright white just like stadium lights. I would say the bottom row of lights were 10 feet or so above the ground, just on the other side of the ditch. I had to look up out of the window to see the top row. I asked my friend if I should stop the car, I got no response, I kept yelling what the ---- is that, I was really freaked out. I deceided to keep driving, still a speed of about 60-65 mph, and then the lights drifted just behind my window, and I looked back and they were just out the little side window in the rear for about 2-3 seconds, and then they disapeared just like that. No sound, no trails of light, nothing. It was like someone just flipped off the light switch. Then my friend looked at me and said &#34;that was crazy&#34; and then my other two friends woke up and we told them what happened and they didn&#39;t believe us of course. I don&#39;t know what it was that I saw, all I know is the lights were not there before, I didn&#39;t see the road lit up or anything and then WAM there they are, and the fact that they stayed with the car while I was driving! Stationary lights that are on a pole or something don&#39;t keep up with a car going 60, and they lit up the road so much I would have seen it on approach. Then to just disapear, it was crazy. The other weird thing was that my two friends in the back could sleep through me yelling. I just don&#39;t get it. We told everyone we knew about it when we got back and only a few believed us. Now, we were all older teens at the time but credible people, we weren&#39;t drinking or anything the night this happened. I tried for a long time to find a reasonable explination, but I can&#39;t. I could say that the lights themselves could have been some kind of stadium lights because they looked just like that, but I can&#39;t explain why they would have been in the middle of no where and how they would have turned on all of a sudden and then traveled alongside the car. And then GONE just like that. If someone has a suggestion of what it might have been please share it with me, I am open to hear anything that might explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

About 01:30 we decided to call it a night and started walking back to our tent which was across a hay field from the woods we were in.  As we got to the tent I turned and looked to the east and saw what I thought were aircraft wingtip strobes out about 2-3 miles.  I didn&#39;t think much of it at the time so we went about getting the rifles cleaned and put away for the night.  For some reason I looked back in that same direction about 5 minutes later and the lights were still there.  I brought this to my girlfriends attention and had her hand me my rifle scope.  I removed the red dot sight, attached the scope to the rifle, and set the bipod on the car roof to get a steady look at this strange set of lights.  When I got the scope on the lights the were not in fact sitting still but moving very slightly from side to side.  I thought that could be from my breathing but then remembered that I had set the bipod.  I told her it must be a helicopter just hovering out there for some reason and put the rifle away. As we turned back to watch it some more, it moved about a half mile from it&#39;s original position and then started west.  I told her, I guess now we&#39;ll find out what it is.  Whatever it was passed about a quarter mile to the north of us in just a few seconds, and it made no sound at all, no rotor noise, no engine noise.  We looked at each other and I asked if she&#39;d heard anything and she said no.  Well, we both got the willies and decided that we were definatly calling it a night and went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that I would share this with you because I just read the report from Amityville, NY.  We weren&#39;t able to see a shape but I don&#39;t know of any aircraft military or civilian that can move that fast without any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was about half way around it when a HUGE brilliant white/blue light with a long trail (Comet like)came shooting across the sky. The light was so bright that the inside of my car was completely illuminated and I actually squinted my eyes while looking at it. The object was at least the size of 10 houses with a tail of about 100-200 yards long. The ball passed behind a mountain range that was in the valley where I was located. It appeared to have crashed because it sent a triple flash of the equivalent bright light across the entire valley and skyline of the mountain range as far as I could see. The mountain that it passed behind is uninhabbited with no known roads. I have not heard of any other witnesses but there are other houses next to and in the field that I was passing. I know what I saw was definitely from another lifeforce.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The direction that the &#34;UFO&#34; came from was NE to SW. It was on my left side and went from behind me to  infront of me. I was on the edge of the field on the road, it was over the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the date, I really wish I would have written it down. It was the summer of 96 between June and August of my Junior to Senior year of highschool. I seem to remember it being in mid-July.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Metalline Falls is a very unpopulated area and no we don&#39;t have a local paper for about 50 miles. There were no other known sightings of it from anyone that my family or I have found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The picture is still very vivid in my mind eventhough it happened in 1996.

I noticed an elongated bright yellow/white object (football field size) moving East at approx. Moving 350-400 MPH.  Altitude was approx. 40-50,000 FT, 20-30 miles South West of the Ottawa Airport. I stared at the object for approx. 30-40 seconds then I stood to get a better view from the balcony. When I looked up it was gone and it never appeared again.<n>

They flew over the district at fantastic speed, and I hurried out the backyard to investigate. To my amazment, above my neighbours house were two egg-shaped looking craft. They were red at first, and then orange the moment after. I hurried into the house, where I awoke my son. We were only quick enough to get outside to witness the craft, flying away toward the mountain again at fantastic speed. It made a whirling noise as it flew off north toward the mountain.<n>

That was the last that I saw of it.<n>
7/20/96 22:00|Clear Lake|TX|Teardrop|5 minutes or so|It shorted out the lights as it flew over , without making a sound!|1/22/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34564.html|16|ndxe199607| It shorted out the lights as it flew over , without making a sound!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I were walking our dogs around 9:30pm or so.  We were walking in an area called Clearlake located in Houston,Tx  which is very close to a military base called Ellington field. As we were walking down the street, I noticed a white light in the distance above the tennis courts,  it seemed to be very bright, too bright for the street lamp I mistook it for originally. I said to my sister that I did not remember seeing that&#34;street light &#34; before, she agreed. As we both were looking at the light (which at that point was stationary) it started to move toward us over the tennis courts. As the light moved over,the tennis court lights went out, the courts were completely dark.  My sister and I were at first, completely stunned that when this apparent &#34;airplane thing&#34; flew over,the lights went off.  What a coinsidence,I thought. This light that is moving slowly,shorted out the lights. Weird! I thought it must be a plane it was of course moving, slow moving but moving.  We were near a military base so I at first thought it was one of those&#34;secret weapons&#34; untill it flew over my head and I got a good look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing that I noticed about it was,that it did not make a sound!  It was gliding very low, as it rose in to the clouds.It looked almost amber colored and it was shaped like a goldfish sort of, almost like a 1950&#39;s rocket shape. We watched it as long as we could untill it disapeared in to the atmosphere,just gliding slowly up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dismissed it as a military &#34;secret weapon&#34; or possibly a balloon. Mostly the latter because of the lack of engine noise. I dismissed the idea of it,not because I did not belive in UFO&#39;s ( I always wanted to see one) but because it did not fit my idea of one. It did not change shape or go fast or even flash colored lights and it did not help that we were near Ellington field.  I just plain dismissed it as an unidentifiable flying object not a green martian space ship. I only wanted to tell my story because I heard somone else describe an amber colored light on a Art Bell episode, so I wanted to know what you may have heard about other people seeing this .<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a very clear night. As a looked around I saw 2 round shaped objects. They both had yellow,red and another color circling around them. I watched they would move back and forth across the sky in a straight line. Then they started to move up and down, somewhat like a pattern of a diamond shape. One object dropped suddenly down, then it seemed to be hovering. The other oject darted off very quickly in a &#34;V&#34; shaped pattern and the disappeared.  As the other craft was still hovering you could really see the lights. Nothing like this have I ever seen before. The object hovered lower to the ground, but didn&#39;t touch. I was NOW becoming very scared. But I stilled watched. The object still had the lights circling around the bottom and it began to move one way and the another straight line back and forth, and the made a &#34;L&#34; shaped design and up it went very fast and then disappered. I did live near a local airport and called them to see if there were any planes coming into the area. They stated &#34;NO&#34;  I am KNOW a BELIEVER!!!!!   Judi Wright  Northampton, PA<n>

It was moving very quickly all over the sky, interesting before each rapid burst of speed it seemed to emit a greenish heatwave/shockwave of some sort. It constantly moved forwards then backwards so fast we lost track of it several times, but each time appearing in another part of the sky in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be following our bus from a distance i am not sure, At one point it swooped down to tree level and back into the air.  It was travelling in a southernly direction. I have no idea what it was or why it was showing off and flying like it was. either it was trying to get noticed, the pilot was crazy or it was a probe of some sort. This triangle was not giant like the one most people describe i cannot recall seeing any lights but this was in the day time between 3:50 to 4:10pm. I only remember the time as that is the time i normally use to get home, My friend is also a whitness.There is no mistaking this was a triangular spacecraft of some sort as it was there for 10 whole minutes and doing manuvers so fast it was definately no plane, unless planes can travel warp speed,all this in broad Day Light On a clear hot sunny day means there was no mistakeing what so ever of what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My older brother and his friend also saw a black triangle at quite close range fly over them coming home from soccer one evening in the early 90&#39;S. They saw this in the east coast Lincolnshire town of Sutton on Sea not too far from Mablethorpe. This object flew in a easterly direction towards Belgium. It had 3 lights on it all yellowy,orange i assumed like the belgium ufo. However my brother has resently told me he only remembers 2 of the lights colours which were green and red. one in each corner and this sighting was at nighttime. Interestingly this object was reported all over the news in belgium the same week so that can narrow down the date better. Thanks for listening :) My email is GangstardannyBoy@hotmail.com if you have can shed any more light on these sightings and ufos similar to them or help me see if anyone else whitnessed green shockwaves coming from these triangles before sudden bursts of speed id like to hear from you. Thanks again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

7/17/96 20:45|Saline/Bridgewater|MI|Other|fifteen minutes|Bright light in sky transforms into barbell-shaped craft, descends and rotates silently overhead.|5/10/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36783.html|20|ndxe199607| Bright light in sky transforms into barbell-shaped craft, descends and rotates silently overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of July 17, 1996 I was travelling by car from Ann Arbor, MI to Saline, MI when I spied a bright white light under the low cloud cover to the south at about twenty degrees latitude.  I had the am radio tuned in to 760 WJR (Detroit, MI) to listen to the breaking news reports of the TWA 800 crash off of Long Island, NY.  This light was much larger and brighter than the landing lights on the passenger jets which continually fly in and out of Willow Run Airport (Ypsilanti, MI).  Two night previous (July 15th) I had witnessed a large circular array of lights float over my car from east to west in the same area at about the same time of night.  I wondered if I was witnessing a routine flight out of Willow Run Airport of an unconventional aircraft.  I felt somewhat agitated at the sight of this bright light, yet, drawn to it.  I turned my car onto a series of sideroads in order to get closer look at it.  After five or so minutes the light was much larger in size and was about sixty degrees in latitude.  I was on the northern outskirts of the tiny town of Bridgewater, MI when I stopped my car, exited it to see the huge bright light descend out of the sky toward my position.  The light dimmed dramatically to reveal a barbell-shaped craft comprised of two internally-lit, milky white spheres connected by a thin bar which had two, evenly spaced, bright bluish-white blinking lights.  These lights blinked in unison at regular intervals much the way that aircraft strobes blink.  The craft was huge.  It revolved horizontally on an axis and was completely silent.  I measured the craft to be the size of a large canteloupe or human head at arm&#39;s length.  At this time I noticed that several cars were passing by, both on the road which I was parked on the shoulder of as well as a nearby state highway that ran through Bridgewater.  Not a single car seemed to stop or notice this object.  I attempted to motion down a passing truck with one hand while pointing to the object with the other but the d! river seemed to not see me.  The craft continued to revolve and occasionally one of the internally-lit spheres would slowly extinguish its light and after a few seconds it would re-illuminate.  Each time that this occurred I felt a flood of anxiety.  Finally, after about five or so minutes of this dramatic display, the craft slowly ascended into the sky, became a bright single white light and moved off to the south east at a slow rate.  I felt as if this sighting was meant solely for me.  I did not notice any EM problems related to my vehicle or static on the AM radio through the duration of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was doing 65 in a 70 mph, and a line of cars was trying to pass me on a small rise, but the lead car in the passing lane was unable to overtake me (it was an older late 60&#39;s rambler) so there were three cars behind the rambler pushing it down the road trying to get passed us. As we are driving neck and neck, with the couple seemingly unable to pass me, off to the left in a field, about 60 yards beyond the fenceline, three shiny diamond shape lights doing erratic swirling motions were visible to me. I notice that the elderly couple next to me is also watching the lights. This caused a noticeable reaction in all four cars as our spped was momentarily reduced to see what was causing it, and then the speed was stepped back up. The passenger was an elderly woman with horn-rimmed spectacles, and an elderly man who I assumed was her husband was driving. I look back at the road and these 3 diamond-shaped lights are now at about 10 o&#39;clock towards the east as we are driving south. The lights would move from a triangular formation, break away and do some fast manuevers, and then regroup. This went on for a few minutes. The next manuever placed them fifty feet off to the left of the roadside, where they regrouped and instead of the diamonds revovling as they had done previously while in formation, they now deliberately and simultaneously reflected our headlights back at us, nearly blinding us. I look to my left, and the elderly couple looks back at me as if pleading me to let them over, but I continue to hold the gas pedal to the floor and maintain my speed. I loo at the cars behind them and I can see that their interiors are lit up so brightly I can make out the drivers blue shirt and red tie in the car behind the elderly couple in the rambler. I turn back and look at the three lights and say to myself, &#34;who are you?&#34; I then had the prescience to think they may be reading mymind, so I beg! an to chant &#34;No, NO, NO!&#34; The elderly couple was obviously scared and wanted over, but I continued forward at the same rate of speed. The lights grew so bright that I was blinded and could no longer see the road at all. This lasted five to ten seconds, after which the lights disappeared, the cars behind me roared by, and I found myself alone, still driving on the highway. I pulled over at the very next exit, maintaining my gaze on the three diamond shaped lights as they sped up into the sky in a rotating circle around each other until they blended into the night sky. At this point I awoke my then girlfriend and asked her if she could see the three lights spinning like a top up in the starfield. She very annoyedly said, &#34;that&#39;s a helicopter, stupid!&#34; and just as she said that it streaked across the entire visible mountain range to the horizon as fast as I could wave my arm. I said to her, &#34;OK, so was THAT a helicopter?&#39; She started yelling at me for waking her up, etc.. I told her to go ahead and go back to sleep, that I just needed her reassurance that I was not seeing things. We made it back home to Tucson, AZ. I tried to tell a few people about it, but they became very uncomfortable, and I quit telling the story. I have since travelled back through the area, and although it has been some time, I still can remember it all like it was yesterday. The most eery feeling I got upon revisiting it was I began to wonder what happened to the elderly couple who was unable to overtake my VW that night, and why they had suddenly left my field of vision so suddenly. I began to have the suspicion that they may have been abducted, because there was no physical way they could have pulled away like that with the pack of cars, otherwise they would have done just that, only much sooner, considering their obvious fright. I know the other cars in the passing lane trying to pass me witnessed the entire event. Like I said, I could see what they were wearing, as there cars interiors were also illuminated from the back reflecti! on of our headlights being shined back at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the summer that 4th of July came out and the people I told this story to thought I was acting out a fantasy from the movie, but I hadn&#39;t even seen the movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also did not believe in UFO&#39;s before that experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We do not know location of sighting in Alberta.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Low flying craft with VERY unusual strobe pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a lowing flying craft, spotted approx 1:00 am - 1:30 am in the morning.  I am the son of a private pilot, and know enough myself that small aircraft do not fly approx 300-500 feet above the ground at night unless approaching a lighted airport. There is no such airport for at least 25 miles, which is just a rural airstrip, with the ground lights activated via keying the radio mike (no need for landing lights). The craft had strobes that did flash, HOWEVER there were two things unusual about this.  First, the strobes were white (there were two strobes for sure, but possibly a third, they blinked so erratically that it was hard to tell), not normal for Canadian aircraft (standard is red and blue), second, they did not blink at normal intervals, they blinked randomly. (note: it is possible the pilot was flying without his nav strobes and was blinking landing lights, but they seemed of the strobe nature, not of aircaft landing lights.)  The lights passed over the road in an east-southeast direction, being nearly directly above my vehicle as it passed over the road.  Believe me, it scared me half silly.  It is worthy to note that two years (this summer) within 4 miles of spotting these lights there was a suspected cattle mutilation.  Of that I do have pictures which I took myself.  If you so desire I could get them to you within a couple weeks (I&#39;m away at University right now, but will be going home in a couple weeks and could scan them.)<n>

I live at the border of the city Antwerp, Belgium. I was in the garden in front of our house. It was allmost midnight and was giving water to the flowers at the front-door. I had my face to the door, as my brains suddenly &#34;noticed&#34; that there was something to see at my left side, because there was light shining in my left-eye. So I directly looked at the left, and I still don&#39;t know what I saw... There were three lights, in the formation of a triangle, they did NOT chance their colours, and there was NO light in the middle of those three other lights. When I looked at those lights, it was like th u.f.o. &#34;noticed&#34; that, because the three lights were turning like a circle and was moving slow to the right. After let&#39;s say 2-3 seconds they slowly dissapeared, I don&#39;t know the Enlgish word for that: they were just suddenly gone, like a candle that goes out... It was really weird, because it seemed like the lights just strted to move as I looked, and even mor weird is, suppose that that is the fact, the lights were approximately 30 - 40 houses further... I remember that I slept with a knife in bed for several weeks... I was really scared at the beginning, but now not anymore, if it really was extraterrestial life that&#39;s intelligent, then they wanted that they were spot... That&#39;s what I think... I know it&#39;s a long time ago for me, but I know what I saw, I&#39;m not the person that reads a lot of u.f.o. books and stuff and I&#39;ve got a normal life...

I was out with my neighbor looking at the sky that night(it was perfectly clear with no clouds) and I was looking off to the east when my neighbor called to my attention an object flying silently over us heading east.  He said he saw it when it was at mid-sky and from then on we both saw it head west.  We could not make out any shape, but it had four distinct, orange lights that made a diamond shape.  The way the lights were positioned and the fact that none of them were blinking made me want to rule out the fact that it might be an airplane, because to my knowledge, I don’t know of any planes that don’t have blinking beacon lights on the tail, wing, or somewhere. 	The lights were of an orange color and didn’t move, blink, or change color the whole time the craft passed over(it took about 8 seconds for it to get from mid-sky to over the tree tops where we couldn’t see it).  The craft flew silently over us, and we could here no noise what so ever.  The object made no noise; so, if it would have been a small airplane, much less a jet, we would have surely heard it, because it was not very high up.(between 600 and 700 ft.) 	After we watched it pass over, I ran in the house to tell my brother(who, unfortunately had gonet in the house ten minutes earlier) what we had saw. He was disappointed and we both went outside again.  Once we were out, my neighbor told me he had seen another one, in the same position and place, and heading in the same direction.  I’m not sure whether or not he actually did see another one(or the same one again), but I do know what I saw, and I’ll bet money it wasn’t an airplane.<n>

It was at night, fairly nice weather.  I am driving and I see three glowing lights hovering about 50ft from my car.  I couldn&#39;t tell if it was one craft or three.  There were 3 lights that were hoveing and were making a triangular shape.  I turned to my girlfriend and asked her what it was.  She replied with &#34;Whats what?&#34;.  I asked her again and she did not see it.  I kept asking her if she could see the craft and made sure she did not see anything.  Very odd experience.  Her friend in the back seat was wondering what we were talking about and she said she didn&#39;t see anything either.  This really was insane.  It was very obvious that there were three triangular lights hovering above.  Why the two girls in my car could not see it I have no idea.  The lights stayed in one spot and I kept driving and they did not follow.  I wasn&#39;t sure what to think.  I was not on any drugs nor was I drinking.  I decided to keep my mouth shut due to that fact the others didn&#39;t see it and it would just be a silly thing for people to beleive but about a week later my girlfriend asked me what that night was all about.

I don&#39;t think the possibility can be ruled out that the organizers of the concert might have arranged some type of light show to correspond with the lyrics of the songs sung, but that is only pure conjecture.

7/15/96 17:15|Sussex|NJ|Triangle|5 minutes|triangular shaped object seen on separate occasions in different states|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28134.html|33|ndxe199607| triangular shaped object seen on separate occasions in different states<n> <n><n> <n><n> Greetings Mr. Davenport, I came upon your site and reviewed the accounts reported of sitings in various states on the Eastern Seaboard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My accounts of sitings have never been made public, but after reviewing the reports, I feel that I ought to go public with what I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first account I wish to report, was in Bloomingburg, NY.  It was July 1988, the 2nd to last wednesday of that month.  Around 6:30 pm, I was putting a full teapot of water on my stove when I looked up, out the window that faced Rt. 17M.  I lived next to a white victorian home across from the cemetary, in a little rental bungalow.  It had been raining and as I looked out the window, above the telephone and electrical wires was a slow moving triangular shaped object with yellow, green and white lights in each corner of the object.  I dropped the teapot, tore open the kitchen door and ran out in my socks across the front lawn.  The object disappeared behind the victorian house and in the few seconds it took me to race to the edge of the shoulder of the road, the object disappeared.  My fiance at the time, had come outdoors behind me, questioning what I had been doing....and I told him.  About a minute later, to the east of us (towards Middletown, NY) there was a bright flash of light that seemed to have come from the behind the mountain to our right...a few miles down Rt. 17M.   There was not a sound around, everything was silent, not the sound of crickets or anything and the air felt strange, almost electrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside the house, and called the Middletown State Police Barracks, Troop F and reported the siting.  The officer who answered the telephone explained that he had already received several phone calls reporting the same siting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, as I went to work at George&#39;s Deli (now VEO mart) in Bullville, I opened the store as the a.m. opening shift, at 5:30 am.  The Times Herald Record, for Thursday morning, had a front page article on the siting, stating that a little over 250 telephone calls had come in the previous night, reporting the siting.  Stuart Airport was said to have sent out a flight test mission of 7 fighter planes practicing, yet it was not accurate, because Stuart Airport was known, for years, to have done test missions on the last Thursday of the month.  This was just one object that was reported and for a government airplane, which makes a great deal of noise, it was not of our making, that I am sure.  ( I had seen a triangular shaped object 2 years prior, while hanging out with a friend at cowhill in Chester/Sugarloaf, NY about a 30 minute drive east of Middletown).  My friend and I watched this object from the mountain top for 15 minutes, it did not move when suddenly it just shot off in an upward direction and disappeared.  We chalked it up to an LSD flashback from our partying days as we had both watched it but thought we had both seen something that did not exist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second incident that I would like to report, occurred in Sussex, NJ on July 15, 1995.  I had been heading towards Newton, NJ, to attend classes at Sussex County Community College.  I was driving my vehicle on Rt. 23, about 1/4 mile passed the Sussex County Airport.  The time was about 5:15 p.m.  To my right, above the trees was a triangular shaped object moving a bit faster than my speed of 45 m.p.h.  It was a dark colored object, dull in texture.  There was no sound coming from the object as it stayed approximately 2 car lengths ahead of me to the right.  I sped up to try to get even with it, but to no avail, I could not.  When I reached the intersection that led to Space Farms, to my right (I have been out of NJ now since September, 1996 and I do not remember the name of that road), the object suddenly took off at a speed I had witnessed before in Chester/Sugarloaf, NY.  In a blink of an eye, it disappeared, in the direction of Newton, NJ (it passed over the Sussex County Fair Grounds where I noticed a similar report had been made regarding the witnesses at the rodeo) and was gone.  Amazed, I stopped at a friend&#39;s place in Newton, a block before the community college to tell her and her husband about it (her husband is retired Air force officer), she told me she too saw the same object only moments before I arrived, and that it too had disappeared...she explained, over the college towards Port Jervis, NY direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had other unexplainable incidents in my childhood, yet as an adult, I have also seen many, sometimes alone and other times, with witnesses.  I would like to explain the other details of other events, if you are interested, please contact me at email address provided in form and I would be more than happy to divulge the information, times, dates and accounts as well as witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will encourage the witness to resubmit her reports, using one Online Report Form per incident, so that they sort according to their respective dates.  PD))<n>

It appeared to be just west of the rest area and just above the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I expected to see a fireball on the south side of the roadway a second or two after I saw the object, but this did not happen.  I looked at the occupants of several eastbound vehicles knowing they had to have seen the plane pass in front of them, but nobody seemed at all bothered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I scanned the sky with my eyes in the direction of travel, thinking I would spot the aircraft, but saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It then suddenly took off to the east at extreme velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went out to look at some real estate just east of town on a clear summer afternoon. My wife, brother-in-law and sister were there. We had just finished looking at this home and were outside looking up at a lot of gnats just twenty feet in the air, when my brother-in-law said look! I said yeah I see the gnats, but he said no, farther up in the sky. Then I focused my eyes much farther up and saw a small silver sphere which hovered in one spot. As we (my wife, brother-in-law and myself) were watching, this small sphere suddenly at break-neck speed moved in a staight line towards the east of the valley. It was as though as soon as we noticed this thing, it decided to leave! I am a medical technologist and also an Army reservist. My wife is a homemaker and my brother-in-law is a disabled veteran. We are all in our forties and have never witnessed anything like this before. There was no exhaust trail or flashing lights. We didn&#39;t see any other spheres or aircraft in the sky . There was no sound. I initially thought maybe it was a silver birthday balloon, but what I don&#39;t understand is why it stood directly overhead and didn&#39;t move, then all of a sudden moved at an extreme velocity in a straight line and was out of sight in about 3 seconds. We didn&#39;t report the sighting to authorities because we were still wondering about it. I did tell some of my co-workers friends and relatives about what we saw. We didn&#39;t have a camera or video camera at the time of the sighting.<n>

It covered the complete sky at a speed slightly slower than a falling star.. but this was not a falling star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were floating on rafts on Pickeral lake not too far from Sprinkle Road and Kilgore.. by a Winery in Climax Scotts.  We were just relaxing on the lake, it was quiet on the lake and were were anckored down so we wouldn&#39;t move.  The night was slightly chilly so we didn&#39;t go swimming like usual, but the stars were very clear, and everything was rather calm.  I saw something moving very fast across the sky at first I thought it was a shooting star because I have seen a number of them at that lake, but this did not dissipate like meteors do.  Then I noticed that it was making strange and sharp turns and jumps side to side, I alerted my friend who then quickly picked up on the sight.  He saw the strange jigs and jumps it was making and the speed at which it was traveling.  We were both amazed because we had never seen anything like that before.  We have told a couple of people but most just say &#34;Oh.. that&#39;s nice.&#34;<n>

I was only five years old at this time.  My window was open in my bedroom on the first floor of my house, facing towards the backyard.  I had abruptly awoken to a loud humming sound coming from outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds, I noticed a blue light that seemed to be coming from my open window.  At first, it was very faint and hardly noticeable; but after the course of a few minutes (three to five), the blue light had become so bright that it covered everything in my field of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to go and get my parents, but I was paralyzed, either out of shock from the event or from an unknown force.  All of the sudden, I felt a presence in the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I was scared, but then I felt a strong reassurance that the presence was not there to harm me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, with an overwhelming flash of white light, the buzzing sound stopped and the blue light disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this, I was able to move, and went to the windows to see what had happened.  I looked out into the lawn, and everything looked eerily still.  The trees weren’t moving, the grass wasn’t waving, and there wasn’t a single ripple in the pool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that day, I have never seen that blue light again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

7/15/96 00:35|Bountiful|UT|Triangle|20 seconds|Witnessed A Black Triangle Craft Over Utah|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63626.html|38|ndxe199607| Witnessed A Black Triangle Craft Over Utah<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello Peter:  In the mid summer of 1996 &amp; 1997 I witnessed three separate sittings of a Black Triangle Craft above my home town of Bountiful, which is ten miles north of Salt Lake City, Utah.  A large Air Force Base (Hill Field), is located just fifteen miles North of Bountiful City, and another fourth-five miles West of Salt Lake (Dugway Proving Grounds), although I’ve never thought these facilitys were related to the sittings,  The first sitting was approximately around the middle of July in 1996, at about 12:35am MST.  I was twenty years old at the time, standing outside my family’s home in Bountiful in the company of three friends socializing.  As an avid star gaze in the hot summer nights, I took a short moment to gaze up at the stars, when my eyes had caught the attention of something out of place.  Looking around I notice an object blacking out the night sky.  After a few seconds my eyes were able to adjust and focus to the description of a Black Triangle Craft.  The Craft was traveling in a South direction taking it right over the Utah State Capital Building and Down Town Salt Lake City Area.  The altitude here in Bountiful is approximately 4,500 ft above sea level, and the Black Triangle Craft appeared to be another 2,000 ft above ground level, thus easily clearing the small mountain range that separated Bountiful from the down town Salt Lake City area.   Although this Craft could have been at a much higher altitude thus causing me to have a limited ability to give a true description of size, it appeared to have a wing span greater of 200 yards.   I was however able to see the bottom of this Craft was flat, and it appeared to have some unknown design or odd markings that spread over the entire surface.  There was no lights that could be seen, for this Craft was completely black and passed right over the top of me without ever making a sound.  The Black Triangle Craft seemed to glide across the midnight sky, and gave a real strange feeling of something foreign to this world and the technologies we posses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

7/15/96 00:00|Sawerville (Canada)|QC|Light|5 minutes|Small dim light in Southern Quebec connects all the dots of Big Dipper after we spoke about Dipper|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57624.html|39|ndxe199607| Small dim light in Southern Quebec connects all the dots of Big Dipper after we spoke about Dipper<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were five of us sitting around a campfire under a dark clear sky in Quebec&#39;s &#34;Eastern Townships&#34;. Being miles from any major town, like Sherbrooke, the night stars were very bright and numerous. None one was under the influence of any drugs, and a few people in the group had shared one or two bottles of wine after dinner. I personally had not had any wine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden a woman in our group exclaimed, &#34;Look, there&#39;s a UFO !!!&#34;  Everyone could see a small distant round white light gliding across the arc of the night sky, no faster than a plane, but not as bright as plane lights. It eventually just gradually faded out till we couldn&#39;t see it anymore. I told the lady that I&#39;d seen objects like that a lot and it was probably a satellite or a weather balloon. No one else commented.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we all began looking at the Big Dipper and talked about what it is called in other languages. In french it is &#34;L&#39;Ours&#34; (sp?), the Bear, and someone said what the Dipper was called in Spanish. Then the same woman piped up, &#34;Look there it is again, the UFO&#34;. I restrained my self from remarking it was just another satellite, but seconds later this small dim light had glided up into the &#34;kite&#34; area of the Dipper then up to the very top star and stopped on it. It then flew over to the next star, and so on until it had connected all the dots as if to show us it knew we had been talking about the Big Dipper. I don&#39;t really remember which stars it flew to and in which configuration but it touched every star on the kite part, then it exited the kite and zipped down the &#34;tail&#34; seemingly increasing velocity, then it faded out as it had done the first time. All five of us were in awe. But no one really spoke about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a guitar there and I began playing guitar and singing, so unfortunately I missed the fleeting reappearance of the object, to which everyone exclaimed &#34;Wow!!!&#34;. No one told me what they saw and I never asked which is another strange thing about this experience. I think it might have been a magnificent flare up, I&#39;m not sure but seemed this object made it&#39;s final exit with a major exclamation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved away from Quebec to Maryland weeks after this sighting and have never seen or spoke to any of these people since, but I will go back and find the man I knew at the campfire, who will still be living in Sawyerville. He will definitely remember all this event. He has seen many UFO&#39;s out there since the late sixties, and I believe that because of the telepathic nature this object exhibited, that this man probably had some psychic or spiritual connection to these Beings or Intelligences<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

7/14/96 14:00|Pensacola Beach|FL|Sphere|1 minutes|Blue Angles interupted by UFO/F-16 Crashes in area same Day|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17490.html|40|ndxe199607| Blue Angles interupted by UFO/F-16 Crashes in area same Day<n> <n><n> <n><n> Listeing to Peter on Jeff Rense, made me remember this sighting. To quickly summerize myself, at the time I was in college and was in the Marines. In the Marines my duties included calling Close Air Support and artillery as a &#34;spotter&#34;. I have since been able to identify US and NATO aircraft by sight and sometimes sound. I can also identify some &#34;Eastern Block&#34; aircraft. (we had flash cards of aircraft in silloette). During the annual Blue Angels Show at Pensacola Beach, I wittnessed a Chrome Sphere hovering over the Santa Rosa Sound, (the body of water the separates Gulf breeze from Pensacola Beach). At the time I was working at the beach as a lifeguard so I had seen the Blue Angels show all week as they practiced. On the final show, (a Saturday), the sky was clear and the beach was crowded. I had &#34;Dune Duty&#34;, which meant that I was to stand on a tall sand dune next to our &#34;shack&#34; in case I had to administer first aid to someone. Now, I&#39;m faceing south, as is the airshow guests as the Blue Angels are flying over the Gulf of Mexico at Pensacola Beach. So keep in mind that people are not generally going to be looking behind them to Santa Rosa Sound to the North. Seeing the Angels all week made me notice that they were &#34;off a bit&#39; this day. Their Friday show was much cleaner than today. The Diamond formation looked sloppy and other details were picked up by me and the other guards. In the middle of the show the Angels anouncer stated that the show would be delayed because someone was in their airspace. I followed one of the jets with my eye as it broke from the diamond and he went out over &#34;the sound&#34;. I was now faceing North. Then I saw a glint and it was a chrome sphere hovering over &#34;the sound.&#34; The F-18 closed on it and came right at the sphere, in a blur the Sphere was gone. It seemed to &#34;disapear&#34;, but I saw a blur above where it was and think that it must of climbed rapidly in the direction of the blur. Later that day on the evening news, a F-16 was reported to have crashed in a neighborhood in Pensacola. That Neighborhood where the crash occured is close to Escambia Bay. The only thing that separates Escambia Bay from Santa Rosa Sound, is a thin Penensula known as Gulf Breeze. I remember thinking that the F-16 crash, the UFO and the stoppage of the Blue Angels Show, were connected. (an airshow stoppage which I&#39;ve never seen growing up in Pensacola and having seen the Angels several times). As far as I know I am the only witness. This sighting had the potential for 1000s of witnesses. But I have never heard anyone with a story like this. I may have been the only wittness. I don&#39;t have the exact date correct. But I know it was the Blue Angels show at pensacola beach in 1996.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will attempt to confirm the date, which should not be too difficult, given that the date of Blue Angel performances is published.  Also, the date of the F-16 crash should be easy to establish from newspaper records.  If anyone can help with the exact date, we would be grateful.  PD))<n>

I was down by Southport Beach, on the shorelines of Lake Michigan.  It&#39;s a city beach in Kenosha, so i was there after curfew (10:00pm).  I liked going down there to gaze at the stars on clear warm nights in the Summer.  I was looking up at the Summer constellations toward the Eastern horizon over Lake Michigan.  The sky was absolutley clear, and hardly any humidity and no clouds that night.  I was staring at a section of sky just about 20 degrees downward from Polaris toward the Eastern horizon.....maybe where Casseopia&#39;s located.....when all of the sudden......DIRECTLY whithin my line of vision......this object appeared into my view...and quietly sailed across a section of the dark sky about 30 degrees in distance from my vantage point....how many miles in distance...I don&#39;t really know.....how high up in the air.....good question, since I really couldn&#39;t make out the size of the object.  This this appeared, then dis-appeared as fast as it was into view!  It made no sound....TOTALLY silent.  It was no meteorite, or shooting star.  I know what those look like in all of their many visits and forms.  This thing was definitely something from an &#34;intelligent&#34; source.  It was like it appeared in our three-dimensional realm then exited it just as fast. It was not in my peripheral vision, but I was lucky enough to view it directly, as fast as it happened.  I do not do drugs, nor have I ever. i don not consume alcohol, nor was I under the influence of any prescription medication.  I was as stone cold sober as a judge that evening. There were NO stores or restaurants having any &#34;Grand Openings&#34; in the surrounding area beaming huge floodlights into the sky, or anything like that.  Nor were there any clouds for light to relfect off of.....no aircraft of any sort in the area either.  It ABSOLUTELY defied any logic that I know of.  No &#34;aurora borealis&#34; phenomena scheduled that far south that time.  It was bizarre.  It was amber to orange colored....solid, yet defined and fuzzy edges ou! tlining the form/s. It was three oblong shaped forms, like three hot dogs right next to each other....or ONE object separated by two black lines, I don&#39;t know....they all travelled together, in unison with each other in the short time it appeared, then disappeared.  After I saw it....I was dumbfounded for a few moments....Like, &#34;What in the HELL was that??&#34;  Then I got into my car, and drove home and told my mother she, was like. &#34;Huh?&#34;.........then I just wrote the whole thing off after awhile....but it will always stay with my, because it NEVER seemed like one of those situations when you  &#34;see&#34; something out of the corner of your eye, but you&#39;re not really sure a few moments afterward if you really even SEEN something, but perhaps just some figment of the imagination, or some typical fleeting natural neurological phenomena....like seeing quick flashes out of the corner of your eye, when you move your head too quickly.  It NEVER seemed like anything like that.  It was TOO direct and straight within my line of vision, and it lasted AT LEAST two seconds long.  I don&#39;t know....you tell me.  There were no other people or cars anywhere near me either.  Now it&#39;s just a weird memory in the back of my mind.  I also have no history of neurological disorders, either.  Just thought I&#39;d clear any doubts up.  Anyway.........that&#39;s my story. I&#39;m 37 yrs. old now (Jan. 2002)........it was the first and last time I ever seen anything like that in my whole entire life.  I&#39;ve told some freinds of mine a few years afterward, but they all looked at me like I was a crackpot.  So I tell no one anymore.  We all see what we want, or would like to see in life, but lewt me tell you......I was NEVER looking for something like that, EVER.  I&#39;m not some UFO buff to begin with, yet now I&#39;ve joined the ranks of those who have seen one.   Take care.....and thanks for reading about my story (situation?).    ...........((name and e-address deleted))<n>

The object was as bright as a welder&#39;s arc, and remained stationary for almost half an hour. Occasionally the object would disappear, and reappear in the exact spot. The clouds surrounding the object had dozens of lights &#34;swimming&#34; through them.  The lights looked like the end of a Hollywood searchlight, were not coming from the ground, and seemed to be inside the clouds.  The lights followed the boundaries of the clouds, and when they would travel from one cloud to the next, the would disappear until they reached the next cloud. These lights darted about like fish in water, and seemed to have some sort of repetitive pattern to their movement. We called the St. Louis Police Department and several news stations, but the incident was brushed off as &#34;probably just lights coming from the airport&#34;. Well, the airport is 25 miles from the location at which we observed the object and lights, and we could not imagine how the airport could have been &#34;beaming&#34; lights of this nature to this location.  Nor would it explain the triangular shaped object, which appeared and disappeared in the same spot in the sky several times in the half hour we watched it.  This object was not a faint glow, it was extrememly distinct and bright. I have included an animated rendering of what we saw in an e-mail I sent to you.  To save file size, I did not include as many lights as we actually observed.  In truth, the entire cloud covering was saturated with these &#34;swimming&#34; lights.<n>

West of Brinnon. I was hired as a carpenter to complete an octagon cabin to be used as a Lama pack base camp. That night about 11:00pm. as I was getting ready to retire in my tent, I looked up to notice a strange light moving through the trees. I was looking South and could see Mt. Jupiter in the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was glowing with a Yellow/White light and appeared to be moving in a Northeast direction, straight towards Bangor Wa. It was a quiet still night in mid Summer as this strange object made no sound or noise and appeared to be floating over the ground at a steady speed I can only guess at, maybe 100- 150 mi./hr.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was gone from my sight in about 15 sec. It was not enough time to arouse my friend out of his tent to witness it. I sighed and thought to myself, no one is going to believe me! The object had no other identifying lights on it as navigation or strobes. We were located near some power lines and I thought about some phenomena that would involve    high voltage electricity. I have heard of all the different phenomena of Earth lights and ball lightning. Neither of these seem to match as an explanation. I have sailed on several ocean voyages and have experienced lightning, St. Elmo&#39;s fire and phosphorescence, but this was really weird! If I held up my fingers at arms length, the object appeared to be the size of my first two joints of my little finger. I can only guess it was flying at about 50-100 ft. in elevation. The trees were silhouetted in front of the object with the mountain in the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We first saw a stationary orange rectangle on a ridge line about a quarter mile away.  As we drove along the base of the ridge about 20 seconds later we noticed an orange reflection in the windshield, and at that point I rolled down the window and stuck my head out the door to look straight up.  What  I saw at that point was a pair of rectangular orange panels moving in sync directly above our vehicle, just above the treetops, mirroring our path along the winding road.  This conitnued for about two miles.  The objects made no noise, and there was no wash of air hitting us from above.  I believe the panels were part of one object, located at the rear of it.  I kept my eyes fixed on it the entire time and when we came to a stop sign I jumped out of the vehicle and it shot straight away from us, slightly gaining altitude, but made no noise.  It did not disappear over a horizon line, but disappeared from view in the distance in less than two seconds.  I estimate each orange rectangle to have been about 15 by 20 feet and about 20 feet apart, with the outer edges angled slightly forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At arms length,they were about the size of a dime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I nudged my wife and showed her what I was looking at.  At the same time some other people around us were looking and pointing at them also. They moved at a steady rate of speed to the west til out of sight.

The object was pulsating from a bright cream colour to a lesser degree of intesity. It was round in shape, alone and very hard to relocate once I had looked down to instruct others to look at what I was seeing. My eyesight is 20:20 and I have in my experience a trained eye as this phenomena grabbed my tension at an early age. I relocated the object but my associates could not see it due to it simply being a spot in an occean of blue, unfortunatly I was propelled to get the binoculas and on my return I could not find it. The object was distinct and was in no way associated with the plane that had now long gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the witness means 1:30 p.m..  PD))<n>

It seem to be traveling at a slow rate of speed and at tree level. Object was round with bright orange glow, as if it was on fire. Had sparks falling from the rear or off of it. At first I thought it was a rescue flare but was too small. We watched for about 10 min. No sound, No other lights. 3 more objects followed the path in the same course as the first. If the first slowed the others followed. I saw these several times during a month in diffrent formations from diffrent directions. There was up to 5 but no less than three.My parents, my brother, and my neighbors all saw them. I am sure that someone else in Oak Hill or surrounding area did too. I have kept looking for them but I havn&#39;t seen them since that year. I still have no answer to what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After about 30 second, the lights faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the beach late on July 4th (the year Independance Day came out - everyone laughed when they heard my story) I love to look at the stars, and I had been looking at the sky for a few minuits when I saw a group of lights. They were all tiny pinpricks of light, like a satellite, but moving together in a V-shape, like birds. They all followed their own individual paths, but didn&#39;t break the V formation. The V shape also moved across the sky at a constant velocity. I am an astronomy and physics major, and I can&#39;t think of anything that can explain what I saw.<n>

My wife and I were stargazing on a beautiful clear night when we spotted a red triangle flying almost straight above us, running silently and parallel to the shoreline. It was softly and evenly glowing red all over and it was about the shape of a classic paper airplane, longer than it was wide. It would have been about as long as your pinky nail is wide held at arms length. It might have been at 15 thousand feet above us-only a rough guess and it seemed to be going about 300 miles per hour. We watched it fly smoothly out of sight in maybe 40 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shocked and fascinated to see something so strange but my wife thought it was just some kind of military plane. At that time I believed there could not be such things as ET craft, decided she must be right about it being a plane and mostly forgot about it. I always felt that was quite an under reaction on her part. I trust my own judgment now and I just wanted to share my sighting with other people in the hope they will come forward to tell their stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

As we headed into the woods we noticed a light about 100 yards in front of us, and we thought someone was being stupid and shooting stuff off in the woods so we moved that way.  As we approached, this is what we saw: Three triangular shaped craft were sitting in a break in the trees.  Lights were pointing down off each point of the trianles and were pointing towards the ground.  The strange beings that piloted these ships were conferencing outside.  They were tall and had very thick hair that covered their body, and seemed to speak tonally.  As we approached they smelled the air and glared in our direction.  Although, they never saw us, they sensed and smelled danger, and quickly ran to there ships and exploded into the night.  I use the word explosion, but there really wasn&#39;t any sound.  It was just a instant burst of light and then we were knocked to the ground.  But I got a glimpse of the crafts as they spead from sight, and they seemed to elongate as they accelerated.  We kept the encounter to ourselves and have rarely spoken of it.<n>

Actually it was at Pine Bar, behind the town of Cottonwood.  We were sitting around the camp fire talking, when we noticed a very large bright red ball of light fly over the top the the ridge.  It seemed to be keeping an exactly parallel distance from the landscape, because it moved up and down as if following every contour of the land.  It never touch the ground, but seemed to stay exact an approx. distance of 100 feet or more from the ground. It swiftly came over the ridge and down the hill, across the river and up the other side.  Once it went over the ridge we lost sight of it.  The bright red glowing ball was followed or being chased very closely by two black helicopters.  I was surprised that I couldn&#39;t hear the helicopters until they came over the ridge.  The Red ball made no noise.  The boys and I were shocked and surprised by what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

No I didn&#39;t contact the authorities here, I was quite a ways from the nearest town, and it was late at night.  I will contact my son to have him make a report.  We haven&#39;t talked about it for years, so it will be interesting to hear what he remembers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also tried to make a report about an incident years ago when I witnessed a bright light above the town of Culdesac, Idaho.  It was approximately around April or May of 1996, I would have to double check, because I am sure that I wrote it down.  The amazing thing was that a few days later I read in the Lewiston Morning Tribune (LMT)as ad asking for anyone who witnessed  something over the town of Culdesac to phone a certain phone number.  I again didn&#39;t call or report this.  Chicken I guess. At that time, I was working as a ((title deleted--public employee)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I witnessed the bright light, I at first thought that it was an airplane just reflecting the sunshine, but I realized that it was just way too bright to be an airplane.  I then noted that it wasn&#39;t moving, it seemed to be positioned in one place high above the town. I was driving home from work, and was actually looking at a double rainbow in the sky when I seen the bright light.  Another thought....I remember seeing a picture of that same rainbow in the LMT the next day.  The bright white light seemed to be totally still, then after 5 or 6 minutes, it appeared to be falling straight down for a distance, then zipped off at a 45% angle in a western direction. It was immediately out of sight.  There was a car in front of me, and I did see that they were also watching the rainbows. I wonder if they also seen the bright light, or could have reported it.  Thank you for your time!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

I have a 4 year college degree (crammed into 5 1/2 years of school) and I work with a local school.  I was driving to the Hoh Rain Forest with my fiance and cousin (not the same person, LOL). It was about 10 AM with a clear blue sky when I turned off Hwy 101 to go up the Hoh.  I was looking at the tops of the trees when I saw a silver disk about 100 yards away just above tree top level.  It was moving very slow in the opposite direction (east to west).  The sun reflected off the craft.  It was a silver disk with a round dome on top and bottom.  The top dome was bigger than the bottom one.  My guess is that it was maybe 30 feet wide.  I watched it for a few seconds (ten at the most) before I lost sight of it through the trees.  I though about stopping to get out but I thought that I&#39;d be able to get a better vantage point and look down across the area from a clear cut (logged off area).  One never came up.  We stopped at a store about 15 minutes up the road. When we got out of the car, two low flying military jets flew over head in the direction we had just come from.  When I saw it, I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  At first I told myself it was an airplane but there were no wings.  It just didn&#39;t belong in the picture. My fiance (now wife) and cousin did not see it.  They noticed that I was looking at something as I drove but they told me that they figured I was looking at a bird or something.  I didn&#39;t say anything to them until afterward (&#34;I just saw a flying saucer.&#34;) because I wasn&#39;t sure of what I was looking at.  I know it was a flying saucer but I couldn&#39;t say if it was one of ours or theirs.<n>

I was driving down 67th avenue, going towards lakewood, when I saw this big fireball type object in the sky.  There were many cars on the road and they all slowed to about 5 mph gazing at the sky.  The object resembled a type of firework, yet much much much larger, about as big, lengthwise as two 747&#39;s, and as wide as two of the bodies.  the fireball was by and large all red and went down towards the ground very slowly.  At this point I thought it was a crashing plane or some new spectacular firework.  My view changed when the fireball suddenly began to rise again almost like a dragon during the celebration of the chinese new year.  A week later a person that I worked with explained that he had seen the same thing while working that evening and nobody believed him.  This is an extremely likel;y scenario because i had seen the object over fircrest golf club, where we both were employed at the time.  He said nobody else saw it because they were emptying the trash during the sighting, and during the summer months, the trash is done right around 10pm.  The sighting left me speechless, although I do doubt that it was an alien craft because it seemed to be ablaze, and totally unfit for life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC:  A sighting somewhat reminiscent of this report was reported to us regarding an incident on 04JL98.  In the latter case, the report was accompanied by a video of the phenomenon.  In the latter case, the peculiar &#34;stream of fire&#34; turned out to be a helicopter with a type of sparkler, or spark generator, attached to it, and it was doing abrupt, aerobatic-style maneuvers.  It leaves the viewer with an impression of a cascade of sparks.  This explanation is only conjecture.))<n>

We had come in from fishing like we do almost every night while on vacation at canadotha lake. We have seen the small disk shaped ones here often, for years. These ones never seemed like such a big deal, they fly 10-15 times faster than an air plane and 5-7 times faster than a jet, they stop on a dime, turn while moving in any direction. We were use to these they almost call you in your brain when there around to get you to look up to see them. [sounds a little crazy,I know],but this is the true. But on this night,I ended up feeling as though the human race is very primitive as far as tecnolegy is concerned.I have waited this long [7 yrs.]why I dont know ,to report this I guess I feel it doesent matter one way or another if you report or not.Well! We went and sat by bon fire, the fire had gone down there was not very much flame left just a lot of rea coal.It was a little chilly so I put the front legs of my chair on the big rocks so my legs would hang over the coals, we were talking low but not real low he was telling me some secrets about my daughter and I was asking questions.out of the conor of my eye about a mile to a mile and a half across the lake and up the hill I noticed a green flash so I turned my head to look at what caught my eye by then it flashed on again and again each time it had come a quater mile closer on for 2 seconds and off for 2 seconds about 6 times in all. by this time it was about 50 yards away, and only 50 feet above the ground. I said some what loudly to my friend [what the fuck is that?]It was a very long,rectangular shaped about the lenth of a foot ball field and about quater in width the front of it was longer on the bottom than on top [about a yard or so],like a sameri sward or something.[now this is the part that concerned me]! When I said what I said to my friend, the object reacted! the front10 or 15 yards of it turned like a check mark [right and down] and looked at me!.then as the part that looked at me started to grow comming towa! rds me,as the front was getting longer the back was getting shorter at the exact point that the first part turned.staying lit now the whole time.When the front of it got right above us, a small ball of light formed,the whole object went in, as it was going in, the ball was growing bigger and bigger, until the ball was all there was [as big as a sports arena].at first I was in amaizment! then at some point I felt as if danger should be setting in and starting thinking maybe I might want to get the hell out of here!Then I realized that my feet are hanging about 2 feet above the ground,knew that I was not going to get out of this chair super fast to run in to my cottage Imoved my feet around tring to get an angle to get up and run,Ifelt as if I had to do this fast but new it wae going to be a blunder and also my friend being left there also entered my mind.but to bad I was going to go for it anyway.Just as I got an angle with my feet that I felt I had a shot.I cant explain it but I felt something say [not with my ears,I know this might sound stupid but kind of in my brain] we cant take them with out taking the fire to.[not in words but in meaning] so just for a second or two I hesatated and believe it or not it started going upward slow at first then faster,itwas out of vision in about 7 to 10 seconds.I use to feel privilged when we along with family and friends would see the small ones,but after this Ifeel kind of a lower form of spicies like we are so far behind,millions of years behind!it is some what a little depressing, one that I only at that time only 37-38 years old will never get to expereance in my life the expereances that they get to!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It stood out to me because it was a brilliant blue daytime sky at the time I first saw it. At first I dismissed it thinking it was a planet, but my eyes kept being drawn to the light throughout the day.  Later that evening around 11 p.m. I was alone on the dock and still looking at the light. I remember thinking that it was so strange that it was still in the same exact spot and still the brightest object in the sky. Then, as I watched, it started moving westward, towards me, in an erratic fashion. It seemed to zig-zag rapidly back and forth, still just a bright white light in the sky (or, possibly alternating blinking lights at either side of a wing?). After about 20 seconds of rapid zig-zagging, it shot off in a straight northwest direction and disappeared behind the tree line.  I always suspected it was an odd aircraft on route to the Madison Airport, but I always look to the sky hoping for a repeat performance or for proof it was an airplane. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I thought that it might be because I was going around a bend and it was an optical illusion until I hit a straightaway and was able to see it.  It was a Saucer shape and was hovering.  I pulled off the road into a parkinglot and got out of my car and watched it for about 5 min.  It would hoover then shoot straight up, stop, shoot to the right, stop, shoot to the left, and so on. The craft had one steady red light and one single white light that faded from bright to dim. It was probabaly half a mile or so away to the north and about 300 ft in the air of so.  I remember thinking if these people that I saw were seeing it to cause to the north of the parking lot there was a trailor park and one trailor had a bunch of people on the deck and I could hear them chattering about something.  I decided to take off and get a closer view of the object.  So I got in my car and went north to the point were I thought the object was only to find out it disappeared.  The next day I was going to work and I saw a fighter jet go over the same area flying low which is wierd cause it was the first fighter jet I have ever seen.  They just dont fly around low where you can see the camo paint job.  Another wierd point that I discovered was that it could of been hovering over an electric sub-station for Consumers Energy.<n>

We were sober, not under the influence of our previous conversation or any kind of drug i can assure you. This craft was aprox. 35 to 40 yards wide, 8 to 12 yards from top to bottom, Circular shaped. It was hovering with almost no sound right above this old abandoned house with pecan trees around it. The craft had to be right at treetop level. coming up to this craft i seen it had two visible red lights, one at each end in the center of top and bottom. upon getting closer, i realized that the red lights were revolving around the craft at some speed, only the ones at each end would be at an angle for them to be seen from any standing point. There was a great white/off white light beaming down directly from the bottom all the way to the ground, almost like it was pulsing very quickly. by this time i was only about 30 yards from the craft, and i was proceeding directly under it almost to the left side of it. i looked out my window, stopped, the light underneath it shut off, and it began slowly moving off to the north-east, I got a birds eye view of the bottom of this thing. Its very hard to explain, i could draw it better, but ill try anyway, It was! circular, but underneath, it had the shape of a spiter, six to eight large steel looking arms extending from the middle to the edges, like a star shape from the bottom of it, there was very little sound, and my car was almost directly underneath this thing, it was only probubly 30 feet in the sky above me, in these spiter like legs, they were turning at what looked like a high speed, i seen heat vapors coming from under it, like when you look on top of a hot black top road, you see the blur of the heat rising. the outside edge that held the red lights was spinning, it was night, i did not get a perfect look at the thing, but i got a real good look at the bottom of it and sides. no flying craft that i know of consist of a 40 yard wide circle, that can hover above your head at 30 feet, make no noise hardly, and drift off like that, once it moved up over the trees about 200 yards away, it was like it just vanished, no sound, no light, the moment it went over the trees out of my sight, it was like it was long gone, it must have picked up some serious speed, but i did not see it. whatever was inside had to have seen me, cause i stood out in the road with a big mag light lookin at the bottom as it passed almost directly over us. it felt as if i caught it off guard when i came around the curve, cause i was going over 90 mph, i snuck up on it, the big white light underneath cut off, and then it started movin off, and thats when i seen the bottom of it. The reason for me not telling anyone about this until years later,...well i didnt know who to tell lol. Aint never really thought of tellin my story, but i figured some people might find it useful. since ive been watching on tv, and ive seen where people drawed what they seen and it looks almost exacally what ive seen, actually i could add to their drawing the missing pieces. I have no reason to file a hoax, Im not lookin for anyone to say anything back to me, or for anyone to post this, but feel free to if you want. Ive yet to see anything suspicious in stewart ! county since 1996.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I had received a call from my fiance at the dispatch room of the Harris Cnty Sheriffs Dept that they had received hundreds of calls from deputies and civilians alike about the crafts in the sky.  Deputies were screaming over the radio...scared for their like.  I went out and looked since the calls said it was near my house.  I saw three crafts in the sky.  Two small ones flanking an absolutely enormous mothership.  They were approximately 5 miles from me just above the horizon.  They were diamond shaped.  All had 3 lights:  One on top and one on either side.  The mothership was different though.  The light on her top was the biggest brightest beacon light I&#39;d ever seen.  Around her middle were red and possibly green lights chasing each other.  After I watched it for some time I heard the sound of helicopters and all of a sudden there were anywhere from 15 - 20 helicopters swarming these things like tiny gnats.  I could hear the helicopters but not the crafts.  They chased the crafts from their current position of due West to a direction of Southwest.  The crafts had been sitting above the area of Grand Parkway and I-10 in Katy and moved towards Fulshear/Brookshire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the alleged event is approximate.

At least 7 of us saw it. it was probably within a mile of us at just a few hundred feet above the ground heading Northeast at a very fast pace, probably several hundred miles per hour, what I remeber most aside from the 5 lights on it was the loud rumbling sound it made.  It was constant but incredibly loud for how far it was from us.  We never saw a body shape of the craft, but the evening was pretty clear, but it seemed to have a mist around it almost like fog ( I do not think it was emitting this mist). At any rate it seemed to accelerate and then just disapear into the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A few miles east of Bovina, we saw blue and white flashing lights in the trees of the town.  We thought there had been a wreck or a policeman had someone pulled over.  But the lights rose above the trees, hovered for a few seconds, then streaked towards us.  The lights were too low to be that of a plane and moved too quickly to be a helicopter.  The lights continued to move through the sky and disappeared into the horizon.  My sister has no memory of this.  I recently watched a UFO program on the History channel; there was a segment about 2 airline pilots who saw similar lights in the same location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I remember it was quite warm.  One of us looked over to the west and saw an object flying across the sky, north to south.  It was at about a 50 degree angle from the ground.  The object had an oval, egg shape.  It looked white and had no appendages (wings, etc.) that we could see.  There were no other details or colors that were apparent on the outside of it.  It wasn&#39;t too far into the sky so that we were missing details or anything.  It was close enough to the ground so that we could see it clearly.  It had a faint hint of a contrail coming out of the end of it but it disappeared almost as soon as it came out.  It wasn&#39;t rushing but moved at a steady pace until it it disappeared from view to the south of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Finally one object moved directly overhead and began to shine very very bright and stood still, motionless.Others were still on the horizon in small groups.Had to leave finally.Ihave seen the same before on the east coast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.

My then girlfriend and I were driving southwest from Houston, Texas, to Corpus Christi, Texas.  We were in a remote area, probably 25 miles North of the small town of Refugio, Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed what appeared to be a star at approximately 45 degrees above the horizon, almost directly in front of me, but slightly to the left, but not quite at 11 o’clock.  We kept observing the bright white/yellow light as we drove.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing the light for 10 minutes, it began to move more towards the east, placing it at 10 o’clock.  Then over a period of 5 minutes the light seemed to becoming closer.  The light did not appear to be in the Earth’s atmosphere at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light kept kept getting bigger and bigger until it looked like a small moon.  We were concerned that the world was about to end.  Honestly it looked like a small moon coming toward the Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For perhaps 5 minutes or so, while the object appeared at it’s largest size we could see texture on the object.  We focused on the object to try and make out what we were seeing on the surface of the object.  But couldn’t make out the details, just patches of grey on the white circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then very abruptly the object “zoomed” back out and appeared as a star again.  Then just as quickly, “zipped” from 10 o’clock to 2 o’clock and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/1/96 03:00|Lake George|NY|Light|1 or more hours|Small points of light moving randomly|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51594.html|77|ndxe199607| Small points of light moving randomly<n> <n><n> <n><n> While vacationing at Lake George, NY about 10 years ago, a small group of friends and I went for a walk by the lake around 3:00 AM.  It was a very clear, star-lit night, and we were all clear-headed (none of us use alcohol or drugs). Over the space of an hour or so, we observed one or more single points of white light, about the same size and brightness as a dim star or a man-made satelite, moving randomly in a small area of the sky, almost directly overhead, high above the earth. I would have guessed that they were man-made satelites, but they didn&#39;t travel in a continuous straight line across the sky, and they moved slower than satelites.  I would also have guessed that they were extremely high-flying aircraft, but their movements were not like aircraft--they would move slowly in a straight line for a while, then make turns that were too sudden for an aircraft, sometimes at angles close to 90 degrees. I don&#39;t recall seeing more than one in motion at a time.  If we stared at the area of the sky in which these objects were appearing, it would appear as though one of the stars would begin to move, and then for the next several minues, we would watch it move randomly as I described above. I never reported this, but I talk about it with my friends from time to time. We ask one another, as we did that night, &#34;Did I really see that?&#34; and the answer is, &#34;Yes.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We were making small talk and I was checking out the stars because we both have a fascination with the universe. I was watching a satellite hover by across the sky when I noticed a bright light like a star(but brighter) hovering back and forth. I asked her if she could see it but she couldn&#39;t quite point out where I was looking cause there were so many stars out that night.I watched it for about 30 more seconds and the light took off in a zig zag formation. After that I freaked out cause I know that satellites and planes DO NOT DO THAT!! I will never forget the experience! THEY R OUT THERE!!<n>
