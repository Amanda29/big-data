(Battle Of LA/bombardment of UFO)|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46451.html|1|ndxe194202| February 25, 1942.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I as 3 years old when this occured, and I remember it as if it was yesterday  Battle Of LA UFO  I was living with my grand parents in Highland Park, just outside LA when this occurred. Most people would say I was too young to remember, but when we heard sirens, (and) guns firing, it left an indelible mark in my memory:  I remember hearing sirens, gun fire and lots of lights. Surprisingly, I don&#39;t remember being scared. Maybe because I didn&#39;t understand what was going on. I do remember my grand parents saying it was an &#34;Air Raid&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  There are many articles in the Los Angeles Times about this incident.  It was very dramatic, and several people died as either a direct, or indirect, effect of the anti-aircraft bombardment.  PD))<n>

US ARMY HAVE SEVERAL MILITARY BASES IN PANAMA. AFTER DEC. 7 WE WERE SENT INTO BLACK OUT REGULATIONS AND THE ALL CITY WAS UNDER TREMEOUS PANIC ATTITUDE.   I USE TO WORK IN A 4 STORY HIGH BUILDING. ONE DAY IN FEB. 1942, I SAW MANY PEOPLE IN THE STREETS LOOKING UP IN THE SKY. MEMBERS OF OUR OFFICE RAN TO THE ROOF TO SEE.  VERY HIGH WAS A UNNOWNG OBJECT THAT LOOKED LIKE A DOLLAR USA MONEY. SHINNING IN THE SUMMER MORNING.  THIS THING WAS SAW ALSO BY HUNDRED OF AMERICANS LIVING VERY NEAR TO PANAMA CITY. FROM MY OFFICE A WALK OF 500 HUNDREDS METERS AND YOU WERE INSIDE THE PANAMA CANAL ZONE. THESE SIGTHINGS LASTED SEVERAL DAYS. THE OBJECT USED TO STAY STANDING STILL FOR MAYBE AN HOUR OR TWO, THEN MOVING VERY FAST FROM A POSITION EAST WEST INSIDE THE PERIMETER OF THE CANAL ZONE WERE THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS WERE SECURING THE LOCKS OF THE PANAMA CANAL.  ALL THESE YEARS I HAVE READ ABOUT UFO. NO ONE OF THE THOUNSANS OF CIVILIANS AND ARMY PEOPLE EVER HAVE MENTION THIS INCIDENT.  I ALWAYS THOUGH IT WAS A BALLON HOLDING A PLANE AT HIGH ALTITUDE AND LETTING THE PLANE LEAVE IT IN FAST FLIGHT.  OTHERS PEOPLE THOUGT IT WAS A SECRET AMERICAN FLYING PLANE.  THIS IS A TRUE HISORY.   SACRAMENTO<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have requested that the witness attempt to locate other witnesses.  PD))<n>
