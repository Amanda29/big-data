I look up to see it and there is no shooting star. Then I look a little to the left and there is a huge &#34;V&#34; shape craft with five lights on either side of the &#34;V&#34;. The research I have done on this craft resembles the one seen over mountains in Las Vegas I belive. If not Las Vegas, they were seen somewhere in California over mountains. The craft I saw was identical to the one if the video of the one over the mountains accept the one I saw was slow moving, then all of the sudden tilted and flew until I could not see it; a building was then blocking my move. I know 100% that this was not a known craft. At least the &#34;people&#34; do not know what it is. Whether it is a government craft or a space craft I will not know for the time being. This was a great experience for me, but will keep me wondering for awhile. Also, this would have been a very clear video if I would have pulled out my camera in time. This was a very quick event. I am hoping to have more experiences like this in my life time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/31/91 13:30|Boulder (10 miles west)|CO|Circle|30 to 45 seconds|Two glowing translucent spheres chasing and playing "tag" in the trees, one landed, one flew away.|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60754.html|2|ndxe199110| Two glowing translucent spheres chasing and playing &#34;tag&#34; in the trees, one landed, one flew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stumbled on your web site tonight, January 9 2008, and noticed that you accept UFO sighting reports. I&#39;ve told many people about my sighting, which was several years ago, but never reported it to an organization that collects UFO reports.  And since I don&#39;t spend much time reading or researching UFO reports that other&#39;s have written, I&#39;m not sure if what I saw is common or not or relevant to your collection of reports. I thought it might be helpful however to document my sighting so that other people can compare it with what they have seen.  Let me say however that I didn&#39;t believe in UFOs until my experience. Frankly I find &#34;UFO people&#34; at bit odd and I&#39;ve always distrusted them- still do. To this day, I believe most people are lying about seeing UFOs. It&#39;s as if they want to believe in them. Now that I&#39;ve seen a UFO, I have no choice but to believe that there is something to this phenomenon which can&#39;t be explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The day was October 31 (1991?) . It was a warm sunny day in the mountains in an area a few miles West of Boulder Colorado near Sugarloaf Mountain. I was standing on a path which I had been on hundreds of times before. There are a few houses around and the area has a lot of people during the Summer months. In October, traffic drops considerably. On this day, I was alone for several hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While standing on the path, I looked Northeast toward  a thicket of pine trees about a thousand feet away and slightly higher than my elevation. I noticed a round reflection of light moving around on the limbs of the trees as if someone was using a round mirror to reflect sunlight (about a yard in diameter). It had a very pale yellowish orange glow much like reflected sunlight on a surface and I could see the trees through it. At first I thought it was from a mirror on a moving car which was reflecting light in the trees. I looked for a car under the reflection but there wasn&#39;t one so I looked back up at the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What struck me was the way that the reflection was moving so smoothly through the trees. Light, dancing off of a mirror from a moving car, would have a jerky motion but this did not. Normally a light reflection would change in size when it hits a tree that is closer than one in the distance but this was not the case either. A piece of tumble weed, blown up from a dirt devil, would have snagged in the thick trees. There was no dust or pieces of debris with it. On that day, the air was completely still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized a few seconds later that it was not a reflection because it moved higher in the sky above the trees and there was nothing behind for it to reflect off of except blue sky. It remained translucent against the sky but a little less bright. While it circled above the tree tops a second one came up from behind the trees and followed it. The original one dropped back into the trees and the second one followed. It was as if they were playing with each other. Almost like a game of tag. At times they would chase each other in the sky and then they would drop into trees and maneuver smoothly through them. This went on for about 30 seconds and they would take turns chasing each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of them darted from low in the trees and shot up back into the sky  behind the trees and out of view. The other one followed. After about 10 seconds, one of them rose up from behind the trees, flew around in a circular pattern and slowly descended to the ground at the base of a tree. It remained there motionless. The other one never returned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around hoping to find someone who saw what I had just witnessed but there was no one. I decided to hike over to the tree and check it out. I don&#39;t know why I wasn&#39;t frightened except that I suppose it was just too fascinating. I made a point to keep my eyes fixed on it as much as possible as I hiked nearer to it&#39;s location. There were times when I had to look down to check my footing. The closer I got to it the dimmer it became. I&#39;m guessing that I was within 500 feet when the glow became so faint  that I couldn&#39;t see it anymore and I couldn&#39;t spot the exact location where I thought it landed. It was private property so I didn&#39;t go all the way into the trees. When I returned to the area of the path where I first sighted the object (about 5 minutes later) the object was no longer visible under the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, that&#39;s it. It&#39;s not a very exciting story  and most people find it kind of boring. I can tell you however that it&#39;s exciting to me and I&#39;ll never forget that day and how it changed my view of things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have some additional observations about this incident which I haven&#39;t included but may have some scientific relevance if anyone is interested. Someone can contact me from the NUFORC if they like. I realize it was a long time ago but I&#39;m interested if other&#39;s have seen the same thing and what they or you think it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had just finished reading a book and prepared for going to bed, I turned the light off, opened the window for a while and looked outside. Suddenly I saw some unusual light in the sky shining through branches of trees growing in front of our house. It moved very quickly, quicker than any airplane I&#39;ve ever seen. Soon it got closer to me, from my point of view, above the trees, so I could see it all. It was a yellow lightening sphere of a size of the full moon, absolutelly symmetrical and firm object, but the light was duller, not as sharp as the lights of airplanes. On the top of this yellow sphere there was another sphere, red one, about 1/3 size of the yellow one which was blinking- mostly it shined but in turned off for short times in periodic intervals. The object flew across all the sky in about 10 seconds and got behind a house so I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. High constant speed, straight direction from SW to NE and horizontal direction, it made no sounds at all, no other changes except the blinking of the red sphere. It is very hard to guess the height above the ground, but it seemed to me it could be 300-400 metres above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just as we were passing the Carlingford road, in the upper right hand portion of my windshield, I saw this huge reddish-orange spherical object 1/3  bigger than a full moon.  It came seemingly out of nowhere,seemed to stop and hang briefly,2-3 seconds, rotating slightly maybe 30 degrees clockwise then the object zipped off across the St.John river to the east and disappeared behind the trees.  It gave off no glow nor did it cast a beam it seemed to be illuminated from the inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly asked the girls in the back seat, &#34;Did You see that?&#34;  To which they both replied in unison, &#34;See what?&#34;  They were both fully absorbed in the details of the nights high-school dance that they never even noticed a thing and after all the sighting lasted less than 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

It hovered/moved very slowly over gas plant, but the distance it covered it must have been faster than I thought. I didn&#39;t hear any sounds, and nothing out of the ordinary happened at the gas plant. I watched it for about 5 minutes before it dissapeared suddenly, As it was moving, I called another co-worker at the water station, but he didn&#39;t notice it. It was travelling from west- northwest to south south-east direction. It dissapeared just when it passed over my head. It was a dark night, no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Its something I have been wondering about for a long time. Do you have any record of this that covers the period somewhere between 1990 to 1992. It was during the month of Sept., Oct.,or Nov..I can&#39;t recall the exact date. Well anyway, a friend and I were outside our place of work talking about the beautiful night and all the stars you could see. It was one of those cold and clear fall nights with no moon or clouds in the sky.I said to my friend, &#34;What in the hell is that?-Do you see that?&#34;. She was just as amazed as I was! I thought I was seeing things, but the objects were so defined, distinct and visibly clear. They were triangular shaped with a strange bluish color on each of its three perimeters, and dark in the interior area space.We did not hear any sound. They were seemingly at a very high altitude and moving in very random and rapid directions, with instantaneous change in directions. Almost like they were playing some sort of game or something? I have no idea what they were? I&#39;ve told several people over the years and of course they think I&#39;m nuts. That never bothered me because I would&#39;ve thought the same of someone else, if I had never experienced what I saw. So I figured its our own little secret. I&#39;m no UFO nut or anything, but every now and then I go check out some web-sites because of my curiosity. What I am seeing is more and more depictions of sightings that are very similar to what we saw that one evening.Which makes me feel better and somewhat in AWE! So I came upon your web-site today and decided to send this in to see if you have any record of other witnesses with similar reports from that time period. Or if you do not, is there any other organization or site where I could research this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Looking at them with binoculars, they appeared to have green, red, and blue lights.<n>

The two closest to the horizon were red in color and unmoving.  Above and to the right of the red lights was a bright white light which was moving toward me until it winked out.  A second white light was to the left of the red ones and moving to the left.  I pulled over to the side of the road to get a better view, and as I came to a stop I noticed a deer directly in font of and not more than three feet from my van, standing in the beam of my headlights.&#34;  Oddly enough, all other details of this sighting are missing from my memory.  I don&#39;t remember how the lights disappeared or how long they were visible, or what happened to the deer.  Virginia Dale is a deer crossing, but having one so close is strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I will state for the record that the date of the sighting is an extreme guess and I did not review my report to MUFON to make sure both dates matched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on the front porch facing South. As I glanced upward I saw a craft moving North to South. The craft was triangular, but with smoothed &#34;corners&#34;.The underside was in three segments of different colors. There was absolutely no sound. As for the size, I am not astute at gaging distances and sizes.The object was either very large or quite low.I have thought about this a lot and my personal conclusion is that the object was quite &#34;high&#34; and large. As I sit on the poarch quite often,I see a lot of military and civilian aircraft moving between Chattanooga and Atlanta. This object was moving too SLOW to be a jet or airplane. A helicopter is ruled out for reasons mentioned earlier. The craft seemed to float almost like a blimp. I watched the craft for approximately 7 minutes float? in a straight line. At that time, a small white globe? descended from underneath the craft. The globe? stayed close to the larger craft and seemed to &#34;play&#34; around it. This was the point I became a little nervous, because this action reminded me of  animal behavior, like a bear cub frolics aroud its&#39; mother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two crafts then turned (not sharply, but in a long, slow arc) and retraced the exact path the larger craft had used.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never seen anything unusual beforehand and have not since.

I was walking my dog on a clear dark night where I live on the north west side of Las Vegas. I happen to look up and I saw a large long massive cigar shaped object. This was &#34;not&#34; a plane and larger than a 747. There was &#34;no&#34; noise. Both ends of the craft appeared to be tapered or blunted. No lights and the altitude of the craft was approximately 4000 to 7000 feet. It wasn&#39;t a bright metallic object but a metallic flat color. Possibly a dull greenish color. All of a sudden this object took off slightly to the north or north east at a tremendous speed when it must of realized that I got a fast good look at it. The speed for an object this large was initially moving very slow for its size and weight. I would say less than 90 knots! It was just crusin at the time. When I visited the little Alein Bar near Rachael, Nv., I saw a picture of the the craft on the wall. I then knew I wasn&#39;t seeing things.<n>

The area is rural but has scattered houses and farms.I was coming home from college. It was about 8:30 or 9:00 and I saw something moving downward at approximately a 45 degree angle at a pretty good speed. It was in the distance in front of me and I thought that it was a plane that was going to crash. As I drove on, it slowed its downward movement and leveled off. I could not figure out what it was. As I kept going I came over a hill and there it was, hovering in the sky off to my right, over a field. It was not very high up, I could see it very well. It was shaped like a saucer, the traditional flying saucer, with blue, red, and green lights that flashed back and forth on the bottom. It made no noise at all. It just hovered there approximately 100&#39; up in the air. It was a warm clear night and I just stopped my car and watched it. It eased across the road and hovered there on the driver side out over another field very close. I rolled down my windows to try to see if it was making any noise and it wasn&#39;t. It baffled me. What could it be? I looked from every angle I could think of, watched it and could come up with no answers. It finally began to move and it eased off to the east and went down behind an old barn. I decided I had seen enough and went on home. I am a college graduate, hold a graduate degree, and pastor a church, but I still can&#39;t believe what I saw that night. I wish someone could explain it to me. I have told only a few people and my wife and kids always tease me about it, but hey, I still never go by that field today that I don&#39;t relive that night. It wasn&#39;t scary. It was just a mystery that I guess I will have to wait and let God explain to me. The bible says that &#34; I have sheep in other pastures that you no not of&#34; maybe that scripture applies to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

10/1/91 19:00|Fort Lee|NJ|Unknown|5 minutes|A blimp shaped object with low lighting or shimmering effect outline hovering next to the G. W. Bridge over the Hudson River.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45382.html|13|ndxe199110| A blimp shaped object with low lighting or shimmering effect outline hovering next to the G. W. Bridge over the Hudson River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were &#34;power walking&#34; around the park opposite Med North in Fort Lee, NJ.  As soon as we made the turn heading East - facing the G. W. Bridge - I saw a bullet shaped (I only saw one end of it) object right next to the South side of the bridge.  Which meant that it would have been hovering over the Hudson River.  It would have been invisible to us except that there was some low lighting or shimmering effect outling the object from our vantage point.  It seemed huge.  I was still trying to figure out what it was that I was looking at, and hadn&#39;t yet mentioned it to my friend when she shreiked &#34;what is it?&#34;. (We were still walking the whole time.) She was an hysterical person by nature and was getting a little frantic (still walking). It looked so much like the Goodyear Blimp that I assumed that is what it had to be.  It had to be right? If that is what the Blimp looked like with no lights except for the outline.  I assured my friend it was just the blimp and we made the turn and walked to the car and left the area.  I figured that if it was anything else, there were enough people with terraces in the many high rise apartment buildings overlooking the bridge and the river - someone else would have seen it.  There was no report of anything strange that I heard or read about so I assumed it was the blimp after all on a joy ride.  I did think it was pretty dangerous and I&#39;m not sure if the blimp could hover in one place and not move. I put it out of my mind and some time later had the occassion to actually see the Goodyear blimp near the G. W. Bridge.  The size was all wrong.  It was tiny compared to what we saw that night.  I only wish we would have continued to walk towards the bridge and not left the area.  I do feel a little silly reporting this.  I guess I have always been waiting to hear about someone else reporting this incident. I&#39;m not sure of the date and time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was dark.  I was driving north on a 4 lane hwy with a large grass median in between and up ahead of me there appeared to be a 747 (my impression) coming towards me about to land on the freeway.  What I saw was a triangular arrangement of lights covering the expanse of the freeway slowly floating down towards the road, about half a mile ahead.  My impression was this was a landing aircraft with its nose in the air, coming directly towards me.  As it got closer it moved off to the side of the road and as I crossed the Arkansas river, it had stopped over the dam to my right and was just sitting there.  All I could see was three bright lights that weren&#39;t really illuminating anything.  About this time, all these cars around me lit up with these strange red lights in their dashboards - they didn&#39;t go round and round like a normal emergency light, they went side to side, were all red, and were i! n MANY cars ( don&#39;t know an exact number ) coming the other way and even driving right next to me, in front of me and behind me.  They all sped off the freeway on the dam exit towards where this thing was floating, probably ten cars in total.  Before the red lights turned on, on these cars, I had slowed down and rolled the windows down and couldn&#39;t hear a thing coming from whatever this thing was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never heard a word about it from anyone, not in the news or television.  Years later I was watching a Discover channel UFO special about events in Belgium in 1989-1991 and there it was, exactly what I saw.  Granted, I never saw a distinct outline but if they said all this happened the night I saw what I saw, I would say, &amp;quot;I saw that too&amp;quot;.<n>

It definitely had a solid form to it and reflected the sunlight slightly with the clouds around having a orangish sunset coloration while the object was silver but did reflect some tinge of the same orangish color.  It moved in and out of the clouds very slowly.  It is a very distinct memory in my mind.  I cannot remember exactly how long it was there but definitely seemed fairly large due to the distance away and was definitely not a blimp to my recollection.  I also cannot remember it leaving the area specifically and I do not believe my grandmother spotted it as I cannot remember talking with her specifically about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Still moving in a straight line heading north-west, again observed two smaller disks emerging from the second trailing circular object.  The two new smaller objects then moved to the back left and back right of the second trailing circular disk.

My mom picked me up from school one day and as we were driving home, I noticed a black object hovering in the sky.  At first I thought it might be a balloon, but as we pulled into our driveway, it looked more like a hockey-puck turned on its side.  It was maybe 200 feet above the ground (without knowing its actual size, it&#39;s hard to know exactly how high it was) and was spinning counter-clockwise relatively to the ground at maybe 45 rpm.  I can&#39;t remember what day it was, but I can remember what it looked like exactly.  It was black, not entirely shiny, but not flat, either.  After about fifteen minutes, it finally began ascending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
