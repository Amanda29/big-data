I was about to get into a taxi cab, just scanned the sky because it was so clear. Suddenly, one single dark gray puffy cloud appeared, &#39;scurrying&#39; very fast with the high winds. Just as suddenly, a bar of lights appeared out of the front of the cloud, looking much like a photographer&#39;s light bar, with extremely brilliant lights. It almost emerged out of the cloud so that I just had an impression of a dark gray &#39;metal&#39; in between the lights. I pointed u at it and told the taxi man, &#39;look at that&#39;.. but in those few seconds, it covered itself again with cloud. The taxi man didn&#39;t catch it so I just shook my head in wonder, didn&#39;t explain what I saw or ask him if he saw anything other than the one cloud. No other clouds appeared any where in the sky during the next half hour it took to reach my destination. There was no sound from the shrouded object other than the very strong wind in my ears and whipping through the trees. I did recount it to a local radio talk show host once, date uncertain perhaps 1 to 10 years later, whose subject was UFO&#39;s. The exact year of sighting is not remembered. I was on my way to a bowling banquet so for important studies, I think this could be researched from records of the lodge hall where the banquet was held, if their records are still intact.<n>

I don&#39;t know if I can do this. I am very,very worried what will happen if anyone ever believes me.  I have stayed hidden under the radar in plain sight.  Meaning I am labeled a crazy,so no one takes me seriously.  Facts, though,speak volumes.  I have a year of missing time from 5-60 until 4-61.  I have  no second grade,no memory,except I went to sleep when I was just 7 and I&#39;m already 8.  I missed my birthday!   When it happened I was the only one awake.  I had woke up in the morning with a bloody nose.  I ran to the bathroom to get cold water to restrict the blood flow and that&#39;s when I noticed I was the only one awake.  It was a school day! When I left the bathroom I realized it was night in the front of the house.  That&#39;s why everyone&#39;s asleep! In the backyard it was daytime!  As I stood in the kitchen I could see the darkness and the daytime by turning my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly it was like a bomb going off.  The kitchen door flew open and I ran to wake up everybody.  Strange, I&#39;m yelling at the top of my lungs,and no one is coming to save me!  Here come the tears,and the pressure on my heart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They caught me right quick,and calmed me with their thoughts. They carried me out of the house 4 on each side.  The real nightmare didn&#39;t begin until I got back home,a year later.   There is so much more in my unconscious.I am too afraid to face them alone,again.  This just hurts.  I can&#39;t stop the tears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date probably is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/1/60 20:00|Tucson|AZ|Light|4-5 minutes|Lights only, no sound, moving across the night sky, then making a series of perfect right angle turns, like plowing a field.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45914.html|3|ndxe196005| Lights only, no sound, moving across the night sky, then making a series of perfect right angle turns, like plowing a field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening in the Spring of 1960, a friend and I were sitting at a softball field.  We were both 11 yrs old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked up in the sky and both observed a pulsing light that was moving south across the desert sky. It was totally silent.  It would cross from left to right, then make a perfect right angle turn, go a short distance away from us and make another 90 degree turn to go across the sky to the left. Then it would make another right angled turn away from us, go a short distance and turn again to the right and go across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This pattern, as if the light was plowing the sky, the way a tractor would plow a field, continued for several minutes until it disappeared in the distance. The next morning I went back to that ball field just to look around and found some pieces of official looking paper, like government letterhead, on the infield dirt.  I could see where it said US Air Force at the top in a blue ink. There were burn marks on the paper. That&#39;s all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
