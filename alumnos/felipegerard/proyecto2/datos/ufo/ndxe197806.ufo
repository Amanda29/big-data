I looked out of my bedroom window that faced south toward the Rockaways and saw this huge saucer about 100 feet from me hovering over my neighbors house.  I was twelve at the time and thought I was going nuts, but I could not move I was totally entranced and woke up the next day like a had the most surreal dream I have ever had in my life.  I did not tell my parents or my sister Lucille I just let it go, I figured they would all just laugh.  On 7/1 I was awoken again but when I heard the noise I ran to Lucille&#39;s room so I had a witness.  She thought I was nuts, but when she looked she stood there in amazement and just like me she woke up and told me her dream.  I said that was no dream that was for real.  We told our parents who called us nuts and checked us to see if we were green.  To date that is one thing me and her hold sacred, we may fight and not speak, but we never will deny the proof of UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was a|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63276.html|2|ndxe197806| Hello. I am a 37 year old female. I have seen UFO’s two times in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time I saw a UFO I was around 1978 or 1979. I was around age 7 to 10 years old. I honestly don’t remember what year exactly because I have some memory loss.  I was in Piscataway, N.J. at my grandmother’s house.  We were all together. It was my Grandmother, her boyfriend, and my aunt who was just a couple of years older than me when this incident first occurred.  My Grandmother lived on Stelton Road in Piscataway and there were lots of woody fields and a huge farm with lots of acres in her backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we sat at her dining room table, outside the dining room window, we saw a bright light up in the sky. The light got closer and closer.  It looked like it was landing in the back of her house in the yard.   We jumped up from the table and were all very afraid because the light became so bright that the whole house was illuminated.  I remember us all running into the back bedrooms and the last thing I saw was a shadow of a cowboy hat (that’s what I remember it looking like) at the bedroom window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day when I woke up, I had tiny holes in my t-shirt. I don’t remember us talking about the incident the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Grandmother and her boyfriend have since passed (in the 90’s) but my aunt and I have spoken about the incident. We don’t know what occurred that night. We just know we saw a very massive unidentified flying object that appeared to land in the backyard that night. My aunt also remembers the tiny holes that were on my t-shirt in the morning we all awoke. We laugh about it because we just can’t explain it but we know it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time I saw a saucer-like object in the sky while I was driving down the highway by myself. It was like a shiny glare in the sky and it moved smoothly and super fast. Then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A third time, I was with my cousin. I was driving down Easton Avenue in Somerset, NJ and she was a passenger. We both looked up and saw the same saucer-like object way up in the sky. I said, “Look, it looks like it’s following us!” My cousin and I were hung-over from partying the night before but we knew we were not seeing things. I told here no one will believe us but I told her that I’ve seen this flying shiny thing before and I knew we were seeing a UFO. She thought the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son was visited by some type of alien/entity back in 2001. He said the little boy-like “thing” was walking around his play pen. My son said his eyes looked red and he frightened my son. When my son got out of his bed and ran into my room to me. I quickly woke up and shouted, “Leave him alone!”  I actually saw the little boy-like “thing” behind my son. As I sat up in the bed, the “thing” ran through my son and me and it just disappeared. It was so weird yet it happened. My son still talks about that incident from time to time. We know there our “others” with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

They were in formation---three together, and two together.   They seemed to be stationery, but could have been moving (they were very high).   We watched for a few minutes, amazed, then turned the light on in the boat.  Suddenly, two disappeared... then the other three!  It seemed as though they had noticed that we were there, watching them, and decided to take  off.   But they didn&#39;t seem to fly off----the  round lights just totally disappeared.    This account is my best recollection.   I was in my late teens, I believe.  We were not under the influence of any alcohol or drugs.   I am sorry--I do not know the exact year, or time of night (I only approximated.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

My grandpa was in our backyard with the dog taking her to the bathroom before he went to bed. I was in my room watching TV and my mom was doing the same in her room.  My grandpa ran in the house and yelled for my mom and I to get outside.  When we got out there there was a craft that looked exactly like the drawing Kris made.  The three of us stood there and stared at the craft for probably close to five minutes as it went over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft itself was triangular with a white light at each corner with a red light in the center, we couldn&#39;t see any details besides the light, it just looked like this pitch black void in the sky. The red light was, I would guess to be about twenty to thirty feet wide, and the white lights looks more like they were running lights of an airplane.  At the time, we guessed it was 200-300 feet per side. The craft was moving so slow that we couldn&#39;t understand how it could stay in the air, and it was no more than a a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet off the ground.  As the craft went over, we heard this very faint droning, the only thing I can really compare it to was like the hum of a turbine in a dam.  A ways behind the large craft was three white lights that were in a triangular pattern, we couldn&#39;t tell if it was one craft or three, but it was completely silent and looked like it kept a steady distance behind the big craft.  I would venture to guess it was about a tenth of the main craft, if that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crafts traveled from east/north east and moved west/south west over the city of Lake Havasu towards California.  We all went inside sufficiently weirded out by what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later I got a call from one of my friends who asked if I saw the thing in the sky.  He lived about about two miles north east of where I did and was out with his dog.  My aunt and uncle were on their patio that night on the north west side of town and they saw it.  I can&#39;t remember dates, but, my aunt told me they&#39;ve seen the same craft, but without the three lights following it) on several other occasions. In talking to some friends of theirs, they also saw the craft the night we all did, and one other time.  I&#39;ve got a friend online that I&#39;ve known since 1997, he at the time lived in Ohio, he said that he saw this same craft as well several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Whole neighborhood was outside watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Spotlight was moving around on the houses.  Multi-colored pulsing lights between bottom edge and fullsize windows around whole curcumference of the craft.   Felt no heat and craft was directly above my house and me.  Presence of Airforce arriving and observing the craft must have caused the craft to leave and the Airforce tried to follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Craft left what seemed like instanly without sound or heat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend who was staying the night went home terrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I could see no other lights, just a bright white light.  I had always wanted to see a UFO so was really quite excited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about 5 miles from the base when it took off and came over my car and headed into Mexico in nothing flat.  I had managed to stick my head out the driver door and could only see a vague shape, but definitley oval shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was huge and it was so quiet and so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was out of sight in an instant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked the airman at the gate if he had seen something, but when I drove up, he had been on the phone laughing and giggling and he had been facing towards the front, while the runway was behind him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband poopooed the notion, but later that week a small story appeared of ufo sightings in Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope it was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This was on the corner of Elmbridge Drive and Browndeer Lane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Parents were inside a  home there at a dinner party.  We thought one of them had played a trick on us, but none were around.  The color was similar to some police car lights.  No sounds once this happened in air or in street.  Was a still night.  No breeze. No sound from air, or street.  We had seen the Good Year Blimp many times in the area over the years but this was not it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two or three bluish lights or flashes, all encompassing flashes, seemed to illuminate the whole street and side of houses and trees across Browndeer lane.  Silent flashes like an electrical event but no clouds or wind.  No power lines either in this area.

I was in the back seat and looking up I saw a checker board of lights on the bottpm of the craft. The lights were square. The cars on the interstate saw it also and pulled off to the side of the road. Other cars slowed down to a crawl to look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then rose high in the sky and the bottom lights shut off.

I was picking up rocks and hitting them with a beat-up baseball bat. I bent over to pick up a rock and I noticed a shadow moving directly between my legs. It was a triangular formation of 6 perfectly round circles moving at about 5 mph. Shocked to see such a shadow, I looked up to see what was in the sky above me. There was nothing (no birds, no clouds, no planes; the sky was all blue and they weren&#39;t sunspots because I was not looking up until that point). I started to follow the shadow, looking back &amp; forth from ground to sky. I followed it for about 20 yards until the end of the property. This was not my imagination, nor was I under any influence. These objects were casting a perfect shadow on the ground, but were totally invisible to the naked eye. I felt it was important to send you this because I&#39;ve never heard of anyone reporting such an occurance, although I have heard speculations &amp; reports on UFOs disappearing and then reappearing in a different spot.<n>

The craft was white inside every corner rounded off. He freaked out when he saw the greys and ran into another room on the craft to get away from them. He started pullin wires and almost yanked out a box in this engine room. One of the greys spoke in his mind telling him if you rip that box object out the ship will go down!! My dads said what one of you greys said that?? One raised his hand and walked up to my father and took his hand. He took my father in a room wwith a floating table and strapped him down with a sheet that sucked his body tight onto this table. Two shinny needles come out of the ceiling and go directly under each of his eyes. They tolk him they can take his soul out of his body and pute it into another body. He awoke on the ground on a ladies lawn. The u.f.o he was on floating above him unti! ll he got up in left. The aria is rural packed with woods. The lady came out asking what happened to him. I saw recently 3 huge orange shaped round objects I know you see many. I also used to get paralized while living with my dad. I also think I have a chip in my leg.<n>

I called the other military policeman at the admin gate so he could see it...I was so overcome that I climed up on the sand bags that surrounded my gate shack and up on the gate shack itself just to get closer to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ufo stopped dead still then tilted to the right, it held that position for just a few seconds then straightened back up and then left at a high rate of speed that I have never imagined, it was out of sight in an instant and thats when the F-15s flew over and that was the first time that I had seen them fly at night and they came right over my gate shack at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Lt and Sgt of the guard were notified and they stopped at the generator shop, then my gate shack then the admin gate shack.

I would often speak on the radio pretending to be a space captain traveling the universe searching for life forms to form a galactic community.  The night became quite dark and I eventually crawled in through my bedroom window and went to sleep.  I awoke later that night at 1:00 am and looked at my clock to see what time it was and quickly noticed a light growing brighter outside my window.  I could see a glowing orb of light outside the window before the foot of my bed, from the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it might have been my grandfather; but, I knew my window was too high from the ground to be able to see that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cleared my eyes and was able to see beyond the windows that this light was moving closer to the window and noticed that the air (the space) within my room appeared to increasingly ripple in place as this orb passed through the wall and stopped before the foot of my bed.  Sitting up in my bed I could see the rippling space move closer to my body and enter, passing through me.  At that moment I felt very week, and I passed out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following morning I awoke to find myself paralyzed and was not until nearly an hour was I able to move and slowly crawl down the hallway to the living room and climbed up on the couch.  I was not sure what had happened, thinking I might be sick.  I was supposed to have a sleep over at a friend’s house that night and decided not to tell my mother what happened.  Later, as I was spending the night at my friend’s house I began to draw/color with crayons, pictures of what I thought the future would be like.  My friend was very into a particular science fiction film and had nearly all of the figurine toys of the movie characters and play sets.  I then began to draw pictur! es of the future films that were to come, explaining how certa! in characters would do things and new creatures we both had never seen. He disbelieved me of course; but, several years later I see the next two releases of this film and everything I drew came true.  Creative coincidence or did the incident the prior night have anything to do with it?  I have had many more experiences since that night over the past 30 years.  Something happened; but, not sure if it was an alien, time traveler, spiritual experience or just sleep paralysis as I have often been told.  If I could ever find that boy from 1978 I am sure he would remember that night and recall his own account of the drawings and story I had told him that night.<n>

As I usually did, I looked out my bedroom window to check on the weather. As I was looking out I saw an orange fireball rise out of the back yard of the house across the street. It rose from behind a fence, hovered briefly and then shot off into the sky. The thing that made the biggest impression on me at the time was the palpable sense of evil I got from the orb. It was &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot;. So bad, in fact, that I ducked down so it wouldn&#39;t &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; me. I haven&#39;t encountered anything like it before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I read a short article in the local news paper that claimed that 2 individuals recently witnessed a UFO event up the local mountain near a forest fire tower. Everyone was familiar with this area, and it was a nice night out, so we decided to go up there for a few beers and who knows, maybe we would see something. We were there for maybe an hour or so, and noticed lights shining upon the fire tower. It kind of looked like a spotlight, or maybe a cars headlights. Nothing unusual, so we weren&#39;t scared and we climbed the fire tower to get a better look. When we got up near the top, we looked over in the nearby valley, and a yellow glowing ball just floated up from down within the valley, no sounds. Just a very erie looking glowing ball. And then it hovered there for a few minutes as me and my friend were amazed by this. I would estimate the object to have been about 3/4 of a mile away, hard to comment on it&#39;s size at that range. It could have been 10 ft across... could have been larger 20-30 ft maybe. The interesting thing was that we knew exactly where it was...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since we know the area so well.  It came up with the mountain behind it, so it was not some very distant plane or star being mistaken.  You could clearly see it hovering there with the mountain behind it, less than a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Down in that valley is an old abandoned strip mine that is flooded with water to the top.  Anyway, after a few minutes we noticed the flashing lights again, coming from behind us.  And in the distance we could see what looked like some sort of plane coming in towards us.. very fast, with blinking lights.  We were directly between the glowing ball &amp; the plane, so it was coming right at us at low altitude.  Within a few seconds what appeared to be a triangular shaped jet passed right overhead maybe 200 ft above us, and towards the glowing sphere, and we ran down the steps of the fire tower scared to hell.  We got into our vehicles and got out of there pronto, a little shaken and amazed at what we just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would be interesting to see if anyone else comes forward that witnessed this back then, as apparently there were other sightings here at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There were branches blown down from trees.  We were traveling south from Houtzdale to Madera on Route 53.  We were below a plateau where a cow farm with a silo for cows is located.  We both saw an orange-yellow ball of light hovering above a silo at the cow farm.  He said to me, do you see that light?  What is it?  I began to speed up.  The sphere has stationary.  As we approached the top of plateau, the light took off fast on north course toward Madera.  I sped up to over 90 MPH and the light kept moving away. I began to flash my headlights and beep the horn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light source went to the horizon.  Normally, at that speed, it should have vanished over the horizon.  But the light source stayed at the horizon and seemed to have waited for us to cross the plateau and decend into the valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went up on to the next hillside where we lost contact.  There was an eerie glow in the area and my brother was deathy scared and did not want me to exit the car.  I exited the car but did not see anything.

It was particularly dark that night, no moon or new moon.  The atmosphere was especially clear and the stars were brilliant from horizon to horizon. Many of the neighborhood kids were congregated in the road in front of our home talking when I noticed that all of the stars on the eastern horizon began to &#39;wink&#39; out.  Thinking it might be a cloud system moving in, I continued watching.  The object was moving slowly yet too quickly to be a cloudbank.  There was no wind or breeze.  As it approached overhead, we could make out only five, dim white lights stretching out north to south along the bottom of the craft.  It passed overhead, silently and steadily, and continued until it disappeared over the western horizon. The entire incident took maybe five minutes.  We were all asking each other if we could make out a shape, but because of the inky black sky, none us could make out any perceptible shape.  It was enormous however, based on the large expanse of starlit sky that it covered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There was a breeze coming in the side window of the car.  The radio was on, the key was in the accessory position.  I think the Steve Miller Band was on the radio at the time.  I was sitting back with my feet on the dash, so I had a good view of the sky.   The car was facing west, on the two track road behind the house in the field.  I saw a light that looked like a bright star, far off toward the northwest.  The light got brighter, as it zig-zagged downward in a pattern.  It stopped every few seconds and just froze there for a second or two before moving again.  It got larger as it came down, and I said, &#34;((name deleted)), what the hell is that?&#34;.  I sat up straight in the seat and by then the UFO was directly in front of the car to the west.  The windows were down on the car, and I heard a very loud deep humming noise that I still remember to this day. I will never forget that sound!   I would guess it was about 300 yards in front of us and about 200 feet in the air (?).  At that time the radio went dead.  I could see colors rotating around the UFO around the very edge of the craft.  I saw greenish, blue and white colors.  I began to get scared, and told ((name deleted)), &#34;Lets go back to the house and get ((name deleted--witness #3))!&#34;  ((name deleted)) tried to start the car, and it only clicked when he turned the key on.  It was the first time that car ever didn&#39;t start!!  We opened both doors and RAN back to the house, scared to death!  We went in the back door and started to tell ((name deleted--witness #3/male)) and ((name deleted--witness #4/female)) to come outside quick!  I said, &#34;Something is bizarre outside in the sky!!&#34;  We all went outside, and stood near the little shed in the backyard.  ((name deleted--witness #4)) stood on the step of the shed, and ((name deleted--witness #3)) told us, &#34;Feel the building!  There is vibration going through it!&#34;  The sound was so loud that we could feel the vibration inside our bodies.  We just stood there, and I remember saying something about, &#34;We should tell ((name deleted--individual #5)) about this&#34;.  (He was a man in Central Lake who studied UFOs and had a large antenna in his yard).  The UFO was shaped like a pie-plate.  It stayed there and hummed for about 10 minutes and then slowly drifted off toward the southwest.  I remember all the crickets and grasshoppers quit making any sound.  It was totally silent after the UFO left.  We stood there at least another five minutes and ((name deleted)) and I were too scared to go and get the car.  We left it in the field all night, and when we went back the next morning, it started right up!  All of the details were kiind of like a faded dream even right after that.

Black in color. Saw rivets where different sheets of metal put together much like on a jets wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the back deck of my apartment looking for UFO&#39;s as there had been a rash of sightings in Chattanooga sometime in the late 70&#39;s. Not sure of date. Try and check there newspaper records from 75-79 and I think you will find it very interesting. Many newspaper reports with the mayor and chief of police chasing them in their cars one night and having a saucer land on a school playground and takeoff when they approached. Anyway, that&#39;s why I was on my deck. It was a bright clear moonlit night. I had been there maybe 15 minutes when a large black, saucer shaped object was coming directly at my face, 150 feet high. Was 150-200 feet in diameter. I yelled at my brother and girlfriend to come look. They laughed, didn&#39;t take me seriously so I was the only witness. I saw the bottom of the ship only but saw several pieces of metal with what looked like rivets, like on an airplanes wing, holding the pieces of metal together. It was slow moving. My guess 15 to 20 mph. No lights, no sound. Went over my head and over apartment. Ran to front door and watched it disappear over other apartments and trees. Always screaming for brother and his girlfriend to come look. Never did. I&#39;ve told my other brother this story and my wife and children. My brother that was at the event I never told because he would still think I was nuts. These are the only people I&#39;ve ever told until this letter to you.<n>
6/15/78 21:00|Stanwood|WA|Other|five seconds|Low level, high speed flyby|6/12/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22937.html|34|ndxe197806| Low level, high speed flyby<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were driving down the West side of Camano Island on SW Camano Drive. Approximatly one mile South of the Elger Bay grocery store, an object crossed above the road at a height of no more than 50 feet above the treetops at a distance of about 300 yds in front of us. The object was low enough that I was only able to view it in profile. It had a wedge-shaped profile with a pointed nose. The object glowed with the luminous intensity of a fluorescent light. I was able to observe a glow on the trees and ground that helped me identify the distance as the object passed over. The object did not emit any sound that I detected. The size of the object appeared to be a wedge about 80 feet long and 20 feet high at the tail, viewed in profile. There was a small dark area about fifteen feet behind the pointed nose that may have been a window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a helicopter pilot in Vietnam, I had developed the habit of taking a mental snapshot of an event, then analyzing it during the following moments, even while engaged in other activities. Due to this habit, I was able to compare its speed to my memory of a Phantom F-4 that I knew was flying at 600 knots at a similar range. Based on this comparison, I would estimate the speed of the object to be three times that of the F-4, or about 1800 knots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will invite the witness to try to establish the exact date of the sighting.  PD))<n>
6/15/78 21:00|Mancelona|MI|Disk|10 minutes|We thought our foster daughter was kidding us, until we saw the metallic saucer shaped object humming loudly over the Michigan farmland|6/3/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29019.html|35|ndxe197806| We thought our foster daughter was kidding us, until we saw the metallic saucer shaped object humming loudly over the Michigan farmland<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived in a farmhouse on the edge of a rural town of about 1,000 people.  Our backyard was actually 80 acres of grass field, former farmland left unfarmed for mamy years.  There was an old two-track road which extended from our driveway out into the &#34;back 80&#34;... past the barn and out into the grass field.  It was a warm early-summer evening, the skies were clear, and we were inside watching TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our foster-daughter burst into the back door.  &#34;Come Look!  Quick!  There is SOMETHING in the SKY out in the back field!&#34;  We kind of laughed at her, thinking she was being melodromatic, or attempting an attention-getting move or perhaps even hoaxing us... but when she repeated what she had said, the second time more insistant than the first... well, we saw something in her eyes that said there might be something wrong... if you are a parent, you know the feeling!  (It seems that she and her boyfriend were unknown to us at the time, &#34;parking&#34; on the two-track dirt road which ran through the grass field behind our house.  The radio went out on their car as soon as they saw the object... then they both made it back to the house to let us know about the UFO...thats when she ran in the door!).<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we went out the backdoor and into the yard, listening to our foster-daughter babble about, &#34;it went down this way and then up twice as far this way, like a pattern...&#34;  when I looked up and saw the object, hovering, over the field behind our house.  I estimate it was no farther than 250 yards away from me, hovering about 200 to 300 feet in the air.  It was metallic and disk-shaped...and all along the rim it exhibited colors changing from red-orange-white-blue (there were four of us there in all, 2 people also saw a greenish tint).  But, what made me stand there slack-jawed was the SOUND the darn thing was making... it was a loud-vibrating-humming low pitched tone... and it vibrated into and through everything!  I was standing adjacent to an old out-building in the backyard, and the siding on the building was actually rattling/humming from the noise!  I reached out my hand and touched the building and it literally was vibrating!  (I have since estimated the &#34;humming/vibrating&#34; to have been very near 39 to 40 Hertz).<n> <n><n> <n><n> And, as unbelievable as this sounds, and it makes me realize why there aren&#39;t more good-quality pictures/videos taken of UFOs... I had a brand new Nikon F camera in my house and didn&#39;t even THINK of going in and getting it.  The four of us stood there, slack-jawed... me, my wife, my foster-daughter, and her boyfriend... and none of us said a word for 10 minutes.  We just stared, transfixed at this &#34;thing&#34; in the backyard that just sat there humming.  It finally, about 10 minutes later very slowly (maybe 20 MPH?) drifted off to the southeast, toward a very sparsely populated rural area of our county.  I lost sight of it in the street lights when it went across the sky.  We all went inside and recounted to each other what we saw, felt, and heard.  And I really think that is when we all just shut up about it and none of us has said a word to anyone (except very good friends) until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time has come for an explanation from someone... from our government, or whoever the powers-that-be are in this country.  What the hell did we see in the sky behind my house?  I have had several college-level astronomy courses.  I know the difference between an anomaly and an ordinary occurence.  I did not see &#34;Venus, Swamp Gas, or a Weather Balloon&#34;.  I used to be a UFO skeptic... and I have purposefully left the term &#34;extraterrestrial&#34; out of the account as I saw no evidence of &#34;life&#34; or &#34;intelligent maneuvering of the object&#34;. BUT, I can say with 100% assuredness that there was something &#34;unexplained&#34; in the skies over Mancelona, Michigan in the summer of 1978.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness also provides a graphic image of what the alleged saucer looked like.   Please see the report from the wife, for the same date and location.  PD))<n>
6/15/78 20:30|Baton Rouge|LA|Oval|5 minutes|HUGE oval craft  hovering over the treetops follows our car.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65670.html|36|ndxe197806| HUGE oval craft  hovering over the treetops follows our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know the exact day. I am positive that it was the summer of 1978. I was 11 years old. My father was stationed in Baton Rouge for one year working with the National Guard. He was in Engineering. I had the luxury of flying all over Europe with him since the age of 5. I had been exposed to aircraft of all types. Years later, I joined the Air Force and compared all of the aircraft that I saw daily with what I saw back in 1978. I know that I saw a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother, father and I had gone to a carnival. We were on our way back home. The entrance to our neighborhood was a long wide tree lined street. There were no tall buildings. We lived in a quiet suburban middle class neighborhood. My father drove a golden 1978 Cutlass Supreme. I sat on the back right passenger side behind my mother. There was absolutely no noise. No radio on. No one was talking. I was an only child.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I do not know why I looked out of the rectangular window. The one thing that I clearly remember was that,although it was dark,there was a large moon and the sky was absolutely clear with no clouds. I looked out and up. I watched the biggest craft I have ever seen in my life hovering just above the tree tops. The craft was following our car! I remember bein astounded by the fact that there was NO SOUND! I had ridden on airplanes. I had watched hot air balloons take off. I had been on the ground when airplanes fly low over a parade. The sound should have been deafening. All I could hear was myself breathing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was oval. The top was rounded. For approximately 4 minutes there were no lights. Just before the craft flew away a row of lights came on along the outermost edge of the widest part of the oval. I remember red and cream colored lights. They were not blinking like a turn signal. They slowly faded in an out. And they did not all come on at the same time. It seemed systematic from front to back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the craft follow our car for about 1 minute. It took me that long to find my voice. I said &#34;Look!&#34; My dad was driving and could not look. I said &#34;Somebody! Look!&#34; Instead of looking out the side window my mom said &#34;What do you want us to look at?&#34; I was so frustrated because I could not formulate the descriptive words necesary. My mother was being stubborn and did not look in any direction on purpose. I said &#34;Dad! Please look!&#34; He tried to look. To this day, this memory brings tears to my eyes because he tried to look. He could not see from where he sat. During the entire conversation I never took my eyes off of the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened next confirmed my belief that this was a UFO. By now, we have travelled at least a mile down the road. The craft had followed our car the entire time. Once the lights came on, the craft simply did a right angle and flew away in an straight line so fast it was unbelievable. The craft did NOT BANK right. I followed it with my eyes as long as I could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole event took between 5-7 minutes. I remember thinking that the craft had to be as tall as a 6 story building. Maybe taller. I think that it was as long as a couple of football stadiums. The bottom of the craft was flat. I did not see any windows. I felt that the color of the object was greyish. It was definitely a matte finish. Not metallic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was in a state of awe as I watched sun coloured torpedo like thing go across the sky.I also noticed that it was silent,no motorized noise or any sound whatsoever.My awe soon turned to panic after the thing passed beyond my sight.I telephoned my mother,who was doing laundry @ my grandmother&#39;s condo next door to the building I was in.She noted the distress in my voice and tried to comfort me.I had just had a close encounter of the first kind,as I found out when I went to my second grade school&#39;s library and looked for books about ufos,the book:UFOs and IFOs showed an artists drawing of the hot-dog shape I had seen and thought might have been a flying sub-marine.I was aware then that other people around the world and throughout history have seen the same thing I saw.<n>

I quickly followed her out to the back of the house. I saw an object hovering in the sky nearby. I was amazed because i had never seen anything like this. It was saucer shaped and had lights that were rotating around the edge of the object. It was emitting a deep humming noise that remins in my memory to this day. It vibrated the ground and surrounding buildings. I was not frightened but more awestruck at what I was wittnessing. It remained for quite some time and we stayed and watched it. But the thing that my ex husband didnt remember was that it flew off about a half mile away and began flying in an erratic fashion, that no man made object could match. It was almost a zig zag, back and forth, up and down motion. It was like a housefly moves. It went in this fashion very quickly and erratically. A few minutes later the object left our sight hurriedly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, i hope this helps you, as i was amazed to hear of your interest in what we saw so many years ago. I feel very special to have been visited by something unexplainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other report from the husband for the same location and date.  PD))<n>

There was no sound. It was quickly above my home. A rounded triangular shape that hovered above my home, almost as if it knew that I had seen it. I yelled for my grandmother to come out and see it, though I was paralized with fear. She was washing dishes and thought I was seeing a low flying jet but I knew that jets just didn&#39;t hover and were not as huge. I watched the objet move over an island on the lake that we lived on. It paused over that land and then went off into space in a blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

She lived in Hoopa, a sort of Indian resevation in northern California right near the Trinity River. At around midnight she looked out her bedroom window and saw tinkling lights in the shape of an oval just hovering near the western ridge of the valley. At first she thought it was some type of helicopter but she didn&#39;t hear the pounding sound that usually accompanies one. All her other family was asleep so one else witnessed the event. She layed in her bed and watched the craft just hover for 45 minutes but then she fell asleep.<n>

My mother must have been around 43 years old, my older sister 14, I was 11 years old and my younger brother was 6 year old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting on the roof of the first floor facing the hill gazing the stars. It was a clear summer night with very few clouds and it was full moon. We could see the houses on the hills across our house and the clear moonlit sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at the horizon we noticed an aircraft aproachig. I was excited as I always been fascinated by airplanes and I though it was going to be a nice fly by. As it got near we noticed it was flying very low for an airplane so we thought it could be a helicopter. It was flying between the hills and as it flew it lit up the sides of the hills with a white light to the point you could clearly see the foliage beneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer we saw it was not helicopter. It was a long cigar shape craft around 40 feet long and also by the way and speed if was flying. As the object was cruising in between the hills it passed right in front our house about 500 feet away. We could clearly see a white glow or aura around it, and a thin lime or ligth green colored light coming from the back of it like some kind of exhaust or propulsion. It was amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all looked at each other in disbelief as this thing flew by right in front of us making absolutely not sound, no noice, whistle or wind noise. It was as if it was floating not flying. It kept on cruising in between the hills lighting everything in its path until it went out sight in the horizon. My brothers and mother still talk about this to this date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have decised to report this now after 30 years because I think it is very important people know we are not alone and I believe very much goverments of the world a very aware of UFO&#39;s and do not come forward to avoid world wide system disruptions and cultural upheavals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Do you see that little golden thing up there?&#34; He said &#34;yes, I see it!&#34; It was about the size of a golf ball,gold in color with a glow or haze and it just hovered motionless about 2 feet above our heads. It made no noise. I tried to grab it and it moved so fast to avoid me you couldn&#39;t see it. Then it hovered again seeemingly just watching us. So I tried a couple more times to catch it and it kept moving away then it would stop and hover as if it was a game. Then after about 5 minutes it took off straight up and out of our sight. We agreed not to tell anyone about this. But my friend died in a bad car accident and I can&#39;t keep this a secret anymore .<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was summer i think, certainly a clear night and not cold. In the early hours one night our gran woke us and said we should come and &#39;see something&#39;. We followed her to her room, where our grandad was at the window looking out &amp; up. He was looking at a bright light, or close collection of lights, which was stationary in the sky outside, at a guess about 2-300 feet up. No exact shape was discernable, only bright lights cycling through red, green, yellow &amp; possibly blue or white. I clearly recall looking to my side at some point and seeing our grandparents and my brother lit by the coloured lights. My brother &amp; i only began to recall this in our twenties(i&#39;m now 35).We don&#39;t recall the duration or conclusion, sadly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The neighbors horses were running and rearing.  I awoke everyone in the house so that they could see it.  I was sure glad that it was still there.  My family acted so srange.  They were mad for being awoken. Everyone got extemely tired and went back to bed.  I stayed up and watched it for as long as I could.  I fell asleep at the window.  I woke up before daylight and it was gone.  Years later as an adult it haunts me.  I saw the neighbor lady one time while taking the kids to visit my mom.  I risked humiliation by telling her that I saw it. She lit up like a switch and told me that I was not crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

It was almost new and he had arranged for a custom plowing job to be done at a neighbors property.  I agreed to do the work and he would pay me some of the earnings.  I was on the last field and nearing completion.  It was probably nearly 1 AM in the morning.  It was a clear night and no rain as best I recall.  While heading in a Southerly direction with the plow in the ground, I saw a light far off in the distance moving my way at an astonishing speed.  It was low on the horizon but definitely in the sky.  It captured my vision as I was headed directly toward it.  As it moved toward me it consumed the entire sky and eventually lit up the entire area around the tractor as fa! r as I could see as bright as daytime.

The tractor was a diesel model and would die only if fuel flow was stopped to the engine but it had fuel flow solenoid.  As rapidly as the flash of light appeared it disappeared.  The entire time of the event was only a second or two.  It scared me because I thought perhaps lightening had hit the tractor.  As the light left the tractor immediately started again.  Remember this is a diesel tractor with a plow in the ground so the tractor would not start on its on like an automobile going down the highway.  It would have to be taken out of gear and the starter engaged.  But, because of my fear, I immediately lifted the plow thinking if I don&#39;t I will be electrocuted.

So, I put the tractor into reverse and backed up to where the plow had been pulled out of the ground and finished plowing to the end of the field still at an unease.  By now, I had processed the event and made my mind up to go ahead and stop for the night.  I asked questions of my uncle and aunt as well as other local community members and found out that others had sightings that were similar although I didn&#39;t commit to seeing anything.

One of the kids whose place we were at called his parents attention, at first just the Mother come out and looked, then she yelled for her husband to come and look.  I still remember one of them going back inside and grabbing binoculars or a camera (binocs I&#39;m sure) and standing on the porch looking at it.  From what I recall,the first one went in an arc (they both did) and disappeared behind the horizon of trees,the second one followed the same path except it (or the first one) stopped in the middle of it&#39;s arch and shone down a beam of light n followed same path.

He was playing his guitar and I was lying on the hood a car staring up at the stars.  The first unusual thing to happen was a meteor that curved as it entered the atmosphere.  I mentoned this to my friend.  Then about 5 min. later I was still looking up when an object appeared.  It was moving across the sky in a perfect straight line directly over us.  It was an elongated oval shape.  It had no color and made no sound.  There were no lights.  It was difficult to tell how high or how large it was but if I had to guess I would say about 50 feet long.  It moved sideways and stayed on a perfect line until it disappeared into the horizon.  It was traveling mabye at 100 mph.  But again it was difficult to judge speed or size.  The thing that sticks in my mind is that we could see the object very clearly.  It was directly overhead and the lights of the city seemed to illuminate the bottom. It was a dark object. We got a very good long look and talked to each other about it as it passed overhead.  The next day I called the local airport and asked if any reports were called in or any balloon type craft were in the area at that time.  None were reported.  My friend and I lost contact with each other shortly after the sighting and have never spoken about this.  I understand that a weather station somewhere in south Texas used to lose balloons occasionally and this could be a possibility but I have never seen one of these balloons to compare, but the object I saw appeared solid and did not rotate or change attitude or altitude as I would think a balloon would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was very very dark, little traffic and the sky was clear with lots of stars. My friend and I decided, out of boredom to watch the sky for shooting stars (meteorites).  We saw an occasional plane or airliner with their blinking lights traveling across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point I was watching one of these &#34;planes&#34; (no blinking lights) when all of a sudden it took off like a shooting star . So that got my attention.  But it never went out of sight.  Instead it stopped  &#34;shooting&#34; and continued at a regular speed like a plane.  At this point, I called everyone’s attention to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it shot across the sky again then stopped  and did it again. It was moving in irregular patterns one way then another. We were all just amazed and could not take our eyes off of it, just watching it zig zag around at different speeds.  It seemed like it went on for such a long time. My dad was having a hard time keeping his eyes on the road and on the object too but he didn’t stop, he just slowed down. We were all trying to guess what the heck it could be because we knew it was not a shooting star or a plane. We do have a lot of military Air Force bases down in the Keys but I don’t even think the stealth bomber was in existence or even being tested at that time. I don’t think there was any aircraft at that time that was capable of this kind of movement. We continued to watch it as its movements seemed to take up the whole sky, when suddenly it stopped and just slowly faded out. It looked as if it went straight out into space at a very very high rate of speed until it was just gone from sight. We still talk about it to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It must have been summer and we both believe it was 1978 as we have a tragedy as a point of reference. We saw an orange/red colored saucer shaped object in the sky which appeared to hover for a few minutes. Then it began moving side to side and up and down then paused there. I stayed in the sky for what seemed like 10 or 15 minutes. Then it shot off into the western horizon.As the object moved into the horizon it looked like sunset for a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My sis and bro looked thru binoculars and saw they were disk shaped with multi-colored lights.  They hovered a bit, moved around a bit, then in a blink of the eye shot straight up and disappeared.  Later that evening while getting ready for bed, I looked out my window to look at the sky again and saw a floating, red, glowing ball move slowly from the woods to right outside my window and then float away down the street.  I called my sister into my room and she witnessed it just as it was moving away.  When I saw the movie &#34;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&#34; they showed almost the exact same type of orbs moving with the UFOs.  Anyway, we all asked our friends the next day if they saw the lights and no one we knew saw them.  It was incredible and I wish I could remember more about that night but I know what I saw and I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were saucer or disc shaped with multi-colored lights.  There must have been at least 50, maybe more.  The night was clear and calm.  I can&#39;t remember what time of night or even the time of year it was.  That data I gave is all approximation.  My sister first observed them while walking home.  They were moving around quite a bit apparantly.  She came in the house and got my brother and both went outside and looked through binoculars.  They kept yelling for me to come outside and look but I was on the phone.  Finally, I hung up and looked and it was the most incredible thing I&#39;ve ever seen.  I couldn&#39;t look through the binoculars because I was wearing glasses and it was difficult to focus.  We watched for quite a while it seemed.  They descended slowing towards the ground in no particular formation spread throughout a portion of the sky just northwest of our neighborhood.  There could have been a hundred of them, I really can&#39;t remember and couldn&#39;t tell at the time.  There were many.  We determined that they weren&#39;t airplanes because airplanes can&#39;t hover and they weren&#39;t helicopters because they can&#39;t move that fast.  When they left it was so fast and sudden.<n>

We were sitting there parked along the side of a dirt road when there was a terrific white light that flashed at us like a rotating beacon at an airport.  A green beacon type light immediately followed this.  (Chanute AFB&#39;s runway was closed since the 1960&#39;s and the nearest Airport was many miles away)  The eerie thing about the incident is there was absolutely no noise.  If this was an aircraft with lights that bright we should have heard noise, felt vibration or something.  I thought I had imagined the lights when a guy in the back seat said, &#34;did you see that&#34;?  I do not remember the names of the people in the car other than they were people stationed at the base.  I know this is not much to go on but the incident stayed in my mind for many months after it happened.

Still, to this day I am fully aware of what myself and four friends had seen. It was a warm, clear summer nigh&#39;s sky, no clouds or haze.  My friends and I were sitting in an area of a local cemetery, which borders a one-block area of homes, and then another cemetery.  We were sitting approximately 100 yards behind the cemetery fence at the entrance to a Family Mausoleum when I noticed a slowly moving, (almost hovering) object which appeared at what seemed to be directly over the fence of the other cemetery.  At first I thought the object was a helicopter slowly moving from right to left along the approximate fence area of the adjacent cemetery.  However, I then realized that there were no flashing (strobe) lights, nor was they&#39;re any sound at all.  Although, there was a very bright light (white/purple) at the center of object and one smaller illuminating light on each side of the center light. (At this time, no shape could be determined) We, at this time, moved to the fence area of the cemetery in which we were sitting.  By this time the object had moved slowly to about half way down the adjacent cemetery fence.  We all then realized that this was not a known aircraft of any sort.  The object was no more than 500 feet away from us at an approximate altitude of 75 feet in the air.  This was most apparent from the scaling of the homes that were between the cemetery, which we were in, and the cemetery fence, which the object was apparently following, and the tree line of the adjacent cemetery.  It was at this time I could just make out an outline of the object.  (The lights were so bright, that it was most difficult to see thru them).  I also realized that there was still no sound whatsoever. At this time, we all &#34;jumped&#34; the cemetery fence and ran as fast as possible around the end of the Block, (approximately 10 seconds) so that we could get even closer, if not under the object.  When we arrived, it was gone!  I visually searched the Sky and realized that there was nothing in sight, not even a distant airplane; the entire sky was void of craft.  Yet, it was clear starry night! I have created a digital rendering of what myself and my friends had seen that night which gives a good scale to go by.  A fist would have covered the object and one half at arms length when first viewed.

My mother and I were walking to the Falls along with dozens of other people and directly above us we witnessed a hovering  object, It appeared round from our view with circling lights on the bottom. It s hard to say how high it was but my mother and I and a crowd of people including a police officer who shined his spotlight on the object stood there spellbound for at least 2 full minutes until it slowly drifted off to the side and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is an entry for a sighting in Paterson in 1980 and it sounds very similar,  I have always wondered if anyone still remembers that night.

It had a smaller circular top.  We observed this object hovering over the tree line and were very disturbed by this since it was very different.  I don&#39;t remember what happened afterwards; I think it slowly drifted away.  At the same time (not sure if it was the same day) I was walking up some stairs and observed 2-3 bright spheres out the window making a pass over our house.  NO sounds were ever made by any of these objects.  I have heard other reports that these spheres have been seen entering and/or leaving a large craft like the one I described before.  Any other reports of these incidents at the time?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Approximate date.  It is very difficult to report to a witness if anything similar was reported, unless an accurate time and date is known.  The time and date of an event are very important for comparison of possibly related events.  PD))<n>

These were first noted as one could see the other side of the marsh through the trees prior to the Marina at the bridge to James Island.  These lights hovered and followed along side the car at a distance through-out the time it took to travel the road to Marina/Marsh Bridge.  Driving towards James Island they were on the left. This was a long time ago, this was a very isolated area, with few businesses, few residential areas.  At first I could not believe what I was seeing &amp; being alone in this area, I found this disturbing. This would indicate the lights were more closely located to the far side of the Marsh, along the Ashely River. By the time I hit the bridge to James Island at the Marina Inlet -they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

One does not easily forget something like that.   We were out fishing at one of the neighbors ponds and it was getting pretty dark so we decided to head back to my uncle&#39;s house.  When we got to the location where the truck was parked, somebody pointed out several small lights that seemed to be traveling in a criss-cross pattern back and forth across the moon.  We started back home - I think we were traveling on Fox Run Road.  My cousins, brother and I were all in the back of the truck and it seemed like the lights were following us.  When we got to the house, we noticed a single bright light moving slowly from left to right just above the horizon and across the road from the house.  It was probably a few miles in the distance.  The light stopped and hovered for less than a minute.  Then it got very bright and in a flash it was gone.  We could not detect any sounds.  If there were any we should have been able to hear them in such a remote and quiet place.  I remember my cousins talking about reported cattle mutilations the next day and how somebody had found branches with flies burned into them.  That&#39;s all I can recall clearly.  There may have been some helicopters flying over the area shortly after we saw the lights but that part I&#39;m not 100% sure of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report taken by Missouri Investigators Group - B.Becker ufomig@yahoo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to the MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP, and to its Director, BARBARA BECKER, for their having shared this report with our Center.

6/1/78 20:00|Philadelphia|PA|Other|1 hour|Smaller craft came out of a slit in the sky above the roof tops in a residential neighborhood.  It was a darker brushed metal color.|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87995.html|67|ndxe197806| Smaller craft came out of a slit in the sky above the roof tops in a residential neighborhood.  It was a darker brushed metal color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because it was such a long time ago, I am not quite sure the month of my siting, but I was with my girlfriend and it was the spring/summer of 1978.  We were starting 9th grade in the fall.  The location was northeast Philadelphia around the neighborhood of Tacony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somewhere in between our two houses we were walking and saw an unusual light in the sky.  It wasn’t a star or a plane because it was moving erratically but was controlled.  For example the light moved from right to left a distance of several blocks in a second.  Then we saw it move north to south in a distance of several blocks in a second.  And so on.  We started running around the neighborhood following it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somehow we found ourselves quite a distance from our houses, we were standing by a neighborhood school near Vandyke Street in Philadelphia.  It was a catholic school I believe.  We were looking up in the sky and we lost sight of it.  Suddenly, the craft came out of an invisible slit in the sky if that makes any sense.  The entire thing didn’t appear at once, it was as if there was an invisible door or envelope in the sky and something was coming through it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, it was not far up in the sky, it was about equal to the second floor of a row house.  Right above the roofs.  I did not find the shape described in the form that you have.  The best way I can describe it is if you put your two thumbs together and your index fingers together.  It’s sort of a square shape that was sanded down at the edges to make it more rounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the metal was something I had never seen before, the best way I can describe the color is like a brushed metal, not shiny.  It was a darker color.  There were no lights on the craft at this time.  When we saw it in the sky it was a light.   There was also no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I saw it coming out of the invisible slit in the sky I took off running behind the school building after I picked my bottom jaw up off the ground &amp;#61514;  My friend stood frozen and just stared up at it.  I was peeking around the building looking at her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t remember much after that except we walked home.  I was very late coming home.  It only seemed like an hour but I cannot remember what time I got home.  My mother was extremely angry with me especially when I insisted for days that I saw an unusual object in the sky which I followed and that was the reason I was late.  Actually for years after I insisted but everyone just laughed at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is strange but my friend and I never talked about what we saw after that.  You would think we would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not remember having any contact with any type of being.  I moved out of Philadelphia later that summer to another state but have since moved back to Pennsylvania but not Philadelphia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my thirties, sometime late 1990s or 2000, I was home alone and I woke up, saw what looked like a strange being with a big head standing in my bedroom door way staring at me, I started screaming and then must have fallen back to sleep.  I’m not sure if I was dreaming or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never reported this at the time of my siting because I was young, and no one believed me.  I listened to you on Coast to Coast and you mentioned that you would welcome reports of sitings despite how long ago it may have happened.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was riding bikes around 8:00pm on the Ocean City, NJ boardwalk with a friend.  There were about 20 other people walking on the boardwalk.  At about 4th street, we all stopped to look at some extremely bright lights out in the ocean near Atlantic City.  In a matter of seconds, the lights were directly above the condominium complex at 4th Street and the boardwalk in Ocean City.  They were three lights in a triangle shape.  There was absolutely no sound.  We all just stood there in shock, looking up at the lights, trying to discern a craft or something.  The lights hovered there for about 10 minutes  Suddenly, the lights took off at an incredible speed in a southwest direction.  No one said anything - there was nothing to say because it was unexplainable.  I wish someone could explain this experience to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The time was 7:45pm. She was in her car traveling home on Protection Ave, towards home. When suddenly in the distance she could see a craft(UFO) was approaching her car, It did not turn towards the small local airpot but instead came  right at her car. it did have very bright light and was sphere shapped. She stopped her car the next instant the UFO was on her left side hovering over a very large elm tree it made no noise. She was so frightened she slammed on the gas and drove home (2miles) and almost hit our house with her car, she came screeming saying she just seen a UFO and go get the bonoculers and look out back she was shaking she was so scarred, but we did not see a thing. she called the local airport and police to report the sighting and the next day there was an artical in the local papaer about the sighting and it reported 8 other people seeing the object that day, also the large elm tree did die after the sighting<n>

We were heading East to Santa Rosa County. The sun had gone down as we traveled on Interstate 10. As I was driving, I was close to the water tower that is on the interstate which is just before the bridge going over Escambia Bay.  All of a sudden and out of nowhere, a space ship was suspended over the interstate before the bridge. There was no sound eminating from the spacecraft however, it was extremely large; almost covering the width of the interstate.  Also, it was vast in height in comparison to a five or six-story building.  Underneath the craft, the structure seemed to be comprised of steel girders with a circular area in the middle of the bottom of the spacecraft. It was lit up so that one could see the structural design of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main superstructure was very large with colored panels lighting up at times. I recall a red, blue or green, and yellow panel lit up as if the space craft was tying to communicate something using color and the sequence of when the panels lit up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound coming from this sighting. It was just suspended in space. It was so close to my friend and me. Then all of a sudden the lights went out and in total darkness and without sound, the craft moved over the water tower. It was hovering over the tower when out of the circular area located at the bottom of the craft, a light shown down on the water tower. It was as if the light was searching the tower and nearby land where the tower was built. Again, the lights went out and without and trace of sound, the spacecraft moved a little west and farther into the sky. Again, it was suspended in the sky and the only lights eminating from it were white lights. If I am not mistaken, the lights seemed to be outlining the perimeter of the spacecraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been several years since my friend and I saw this sighting. If I am not mistaken, once the craft had allowed us to see the white lights surrounding the perimeter, it fled in an amazing speed towards the southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was an incredible evening for both my friend and me. Once arriving to my home, excitedly, he and I ran into the house sharing this information with my parents. I called the local newspaper and radio station(s) explaining what we had seen and asked if anyone had seen the same thing to please get in touch with me. However, as was in a lot of cases back in the 70&#39;s, the receiver(s) of my inquiries laughed in unbelief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today, I know this sighting was real. I don&#39;t have to prove anything to anyone to the reality of this matter because I, as well as my friend, know what we saw was truth. I only wish I could have communicated with the intellectuality of the spacecraft to understand more. But yet, maybe another time will take place so that intelligence can share and learn from other sources within the universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We had planned to go to the movies that evening. We were going to the 7:00 show. We set off in her car when  she looked down and descovered that the car was on empty. We drove back to her house and she was filling up the car with gas when I looked up to the sky and saw a bright light reflecting silver/white glow. Just for fun I yelled &#34;Hey look at the ufo.&#34; She looked up and saw it then all of a sudden it zipped across the sky so fast our eyes had to re adjust and relocate the object. This was in the eastern sky it had been it the south. I was more impressed with this than my friend, she wanted to get to the movies. I was saying..&#34;Did you see that!?&#34; She nodded and said lets go. I was still staring at the light and it shot way up in the sky in a straight line the back to where it had been ,then it shot directly down in a straight line .stoped then shot back up to the middle where it first was. I told my friend to go and get her dads binoculars. We both walked out of the drive way..to the fence that surrounded their chicken coop by the barn. We were still looking at the object. I said to her ..Go get the binoculars so we can see this thing better. To my surprise.. she handed over the binoculars and I looked at her and said,Where did you get those?&#34; She said,&#34;IN the house.&#34; I asked How, you never left to go get them? She said yes she did and it took her a while because she had to find the keys to get in...I had never heard of lost time during a ufo encounter untill years later. I just thought it was strange. so did she. We started watching the ufo again and as it moved slowly now we walked along to get a better view of it. Through the binoculars it was just to bright. We decided to climb over the fence to go into the field. I remember putting my hand on the post to climb then next thing I knew we both were in the fiedl aprox 400feet away form the fence! We looked at each other and I said,How did we get here?&#34; She and I both were getting scared and started t! o run fo r the fence back to the barn..the light still in the sky tree top level .The next thing we knew we were standing in the middle of the driveway at the end of it next to the blacktop. We were both facing west side by side. We both turned at the same time to look at each other and both said at the same time,&#34;How did we get here?&#34; Just then a bright light caught both our eyes over our sholders and up in the sky south of us. It was huge white ball ..it swooped down outa the sky headed directly for us we both ducked down and it went over our heads comming within inches of the driveway in front of us then shooting directly up into the sky outa sight leaving a white trail that also vaiished. We ran into the house,called my sister whow lived not far away told her what happened and she said she beleived me and told me she&#39;d seen something strange not long ago. My friend said , WE&#39;d better hurry if we wanted to see the movie. I l;ooked up at clock above the telephone on the wall and said ,&#34;WHAT!WHAT happened ! Look AT THE TIME!!!! It was 10:30! My sister was still on the phone with me and she you have missed the movie. I said I had to go. My friend and I really were scared now and ran in her room and were trying to figure out where all the time went..4 hours had passed and it seemed to us that it had only been at the most 15 mins. of time that the whole thing had happened. It has been 24 years gone by now and it still puzzles me as to what happened. Over the years I would try to get my friend to talk about that night and she wouldn&#39;t untille about 8 years after it happened finally we talked again about it,and how we felt about it then never again have we mentioned it. I have told several people and most think we are crazy. But this did happen to the both of us and I don&#39;t care if noone beleives me. The whole time this object made no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Couple this with the large amount of media coverage which occurred which means this event is researchable &amp; verifiable....AND yet...it has never been properly reported!! I distinctly recall the Radio station I was listening to receiving streams of excited callers and it took over discussion for quite some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Papers and TV also covered it however within a few days it had been &#34;explained away&#34; as &#39;reflections of a fishing fleet at sea&#39; or parts of &#39;skylab&#39; or &#39;venus&#39; etc Description of event: At dusk a &#39;mothercraft&#39; (2-3 football fields in size) flew over the city at a very low altitude as a very large dark shape with long trailing arms on either side, set against the fading light of an early evening sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed it with a girlfriend and actually stopped the car in a suburban street to watch it in awe. Reminiscent of the opening of the original Star Wars 1 movie without all the craft detail. The following night (Sunday) the hills where swarming with people (I estimate 30-40 groups of 3-5 people) waiting for it (with Binocs etc) to return. It could easily have been a scene out of a Spielberg movie! What makes my role in this a bit unique was that the night before (Friday) I had sat on the bonnet of my car for 15 mins and studied a smaller 3 tiered space craft (Clearly visible windows on each level, not dissimilar to NZ&#39;s Parliament &#39;Beehive&#39;) hover on the outskirts of the city approx 200 feet away across a field and just above some poplar trees (75-100 feet above the ground). Although I studied the windows intently there was no sign of life or movement at all. There was also no missing time or anything like that either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then proceeded to fly slowly over the western edge of the city in the exact opposite direction than that of the &#39;mothercraft&#39; the following Sat night. I was in visual contact with it for over an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a large artists impression (a quite accurate representation) of this smaller craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In short an event at least as big as any of the major UFO sightings worldwide and it has never made it into the annals of UFOlogy.....and it deserves to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be very interested to hear if anyone else has or does report this event. My bet is that given the numbers who witnessed the large craft a researcher would be able to uncover many of them with some publicity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We would welcome reports from the other witnesses.  An investigator could try to locate those witnesses, but it is easier if they simply come forward and record the sighting, as they remember it.

6/1/78 14:00|Georgia coast (90 miles off shore)|GA|Diamond|2 hours|1978 Atlantic Ocean Sighting|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55863.html|75|ndxe197806| 1978 Atlantic Ocean Sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;While around 90 miles off the eastern coast of Georgia on board a military vessle that was stationary in the water giving a foreign freighter needed fuel, a contact appeared on the radar scope that was verified as a &#34;true echo&#34; as well as not a craft that is from the United States or an allied nation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This echo was showing up at 900 feet altitude which is the exact height that the surface search radar ends &amp; the air search radar begins. As the echo faded from the surface search radar it began appearing brilliantly on the air-search radar, then vise versa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10 minutes later, upon exiting the radar room to go outside for a possible visual, it was immediately noticed that it had become quite foggy outside! Visibility was less than 50 feet! Yet, the last weather observation was low humidity, 74 degrees and calm wind!  It was at that point that previous books read pertaining to U.F.O.&#39;s, sightings, abductions, etc. became the thinking while going to the port-side of the ship.( In one abduction case written about, the author had written about how aliens went about preparing the abductees for viewing what was to be a sort of weather show that the aliens were about to conduct).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon arriving to the port side of the ship &amp; looking upward about 45 degrees towards the baring the echo showed on the radars, it was witnessed that within the fog was a diamond shaped object that was showing various colors like that of a gem was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound whatsoever coming from the object, nor was it moving. Once atop the bridge (called flying bridge), a &#39;bolted-to-the-deck&#39; double lens telescope was swung towards the objects direction. Once focused onto the object, one could see what was the outline of what appeared to be the window area of a saucer or ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The various lights emitted from this craft seemed to come from all areas except for the windows area. The windows area appeared as a dark tinted set of windows, and that there seemed to be motions coing from inside the glass though one couldn&#39;t get a very clear view through the tinted glass along with the fog that was drifting past the windows in waves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The windows area appeared to be angling downward towards the ship, the bottom pointed end of the craft appeared to be slanted back while the pointed top appeared to be pointing forward as was the tinted windows just below the top point of this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was decided to go back to the radar room to attempt to get further data established without alerting any officer or crewmate. Once back inside the radarroom, the echo was still appearing on either the surface search or the air search radars. It was then that it was decided that this craft is aware of the radars antenna&#39;s &#39;beamwidths&#39;!  The width between the two antennas is mere feet but enough that if a craft has the ability to trace the ships electrical output from those antennas that craft could in fact hide between the two radar antennas without being detected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The good thing was that this craft was not completely successful in hiding itself completely either with the heavy fog nor between the beam-widths of the two antennas. As minutes passed, it was noticed that this echo began to move!  This echo was plotted during 3 complete sweeps from the air-search radar (set at 350 miles). After the 3rd sweep  the echo disappeared completely off the radar screen! The results of the 3 plotted marks were; 1. Altitude 1000 feet, speed 400 knots, 2. altitude over 15,000 feet, speed est. near 800 knots, 3. Altitude surpassing 50,000 feet, speed est. over 5000 knots!   It was then decided to go back outside for any further visual possible. Once outside, there was no fog whatsoever present, the sky was completely clear with the sun shining which was the precise weather just before the contact had first appeared on either radar screen!   As for the name of the military vessle, any other witnesses, etc., it has been kept annonymous. Though noone on board the ship was alerted to this sighting, others did notice and it was talked about by fellow radar operators, crewmates, etc. for days to come afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above information is of fact to the best of ones knowledge, and is in no way a hoax or the like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, this report is not the 1st sighting ever seen by oneself. Another sighting can be traced back to either 1966 or 1967 during the summer which was located 60 miles north of Albany NY &amp; was printed in a small column in the local newspaper there (Post Star).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Footnote; there are other details of the ocean sighting that were omitted due to protecting witnesses as well as oneself.

It did not seem too high (maybe 200 to 300 feet) and it appeared to be 8 to 10 feet in diameter.  It was definitely metalic with no seams or rivets..<n> <n><n> <n><n> totally smooth skinned.  As it approached my neighbor and me overhead it suddenly stopped for a moment and then it changed direction taking a 90 degree turn and it slowly moved away out of sight.   This was not a ballon or anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was in the late seventies so the subbarbs were new and butted into cow pasture and old 1800&#39;s barns and forest. The craft was all white and was about as long as a football field and appeared to be made of like steel girder looking material painted white. No windows or people seen. It just hoovered there about 100ft. above me and my elementery school friend make no noise whatsoever. Even though I was in first grade, I knew what ufo&#39;s were from watching Project Blue Book television show.  We both immediately thought it was strange that something soo big made no noise and was able to hoover like that. We ran back to my house to get my camera, but upon returning five minutes later, it was gone. I can still see the craft vividly in my head as it etched itself into my memory as a child. I had a later ufo exp. in 1993 at holland, mi state park at the summit of the tallest dune there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1978 is approximate.  PD))<n>

There were no blinking lights on it. It made no noise , and left no &#34;tail&#34; I can&#39;t tell how big it was, but it was over MT. Pleasant in Lancaster Ohio , and looked to be about the size of a basketball. I lived about 1 mile from the Mountain. So this could have been VERY big. This has been bothering  me for almost 20 years , and is tho only time I ever saw a u.f.O  If it was a meteorite , I would have thought it wouldhave left a tail , or changed color as the different meteals burned off.  The only other person who saw this was my best friend at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  We do not know what the witness means by &#34;27:00&#34; hours.

6/1/78 00:30|Grand Saline|TX|Light|15 seconds|Blinding white light over my pickup then suddenly I'm outside of my truck looking in an empty sky.|4/12/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96607.html|83|ndxe197806| Blinding white light over my pickup then suddenly I&#39;m outside of my truck looking in an empty sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from a friends house in my pickup traveling North on FM1652 in Grand Saline, TX, when a bright white light shown down over my truck.  It was so bright that I couldn&#39;t see beyond where the light was shining approximately 30 to 40 feet in front of my pickup.  I pulled over and stopped and tried to see if I could see what it was shining down on my truck by leaning forward and looking up toward the light.  There was no sound associated with the light either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I start to look up, suddenly I&#39;m outside of my truck on the drivers side leaning forward on the bed, holding the top portion of the fleet side bed, and looking up into a clear starry night.  There was nothing in sight.  I looked toward the cab of my truck and the drivers side door was open, the motor was off and the park lights were on.  I never stopped the motor or turned the lights off that I know of.  I told this to no one for many years fearing being labeled as crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The people I did tell of this are ones that first told me of experiencing sightings of unknown origins or something similar.  I&#39;ve tried to dismiss this by researching what it might have been.  Most recently, was seeing the meteor that flew over Russia and how bright it made the sky.  However, the light I saw was from a fixed position and came on like someone flipped a switch.  I&#39;ve thought “Police Helicopter”, but there are none in that rural area, there was no sound, and it still doesn&#39;t account for my lapse of time from being in my truck to being outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve struggled with this phenomena from that moment on wondering what it was and have yet to discover any information that could make sense of this event.  I sincerely hope you contact me with some resources that may help me unravel this mystery.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Approx.|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05705.html|84|ndxe197806| Object landed on corner of street.  Stayed there approx. 2 hours.  Had red, blue, yellow, green lights along middle that spun.  Approx. 10-15 yards from where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of my friends and I were sleeping outside in the front yard in the summer.  We were 7, 10 and 8 years of age at the time.  One of my friends sat up and start crying and pointing to the end of the driveway.  My other friend and I looked up and saw an object that looked like two bowls on top of each other with lights and gray squares (windows???) in the middle.  The lights spun around the object.  There was a very low hum coming from it.  We went into a panic and started trying to get into the house but it was locked because my friends parents were gone for the night.  So, we tried to think of a plan to get around the craft so that we could run down the street to my house which was two houses down.  But, we were to scared so we just climbed back into our sleeping bags and pulled it over our heads.  The dogs were going crazy in the house.  One kept on trying to jump through the window.  We stared at it for quite awhile.  It finally started hovering about 5 feet from the ground and slowly took off and hovered above the house across the street for about 10 minutes then it just took off so fast that we had a hard time following it with our eyes.  It went over the horizon and we booked it over to my house and never did sleep outside again that summer.  Too bad I didn&#39;t have a camera it would have been the best view and the closest of a ufo ever taken.<n>
