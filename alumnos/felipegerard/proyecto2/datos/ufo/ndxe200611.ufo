When we stopped, we heard the sounds of jets and we supposed that the white lights were in fact the jets, [and] the amber lights disappeared after a couple of minutes.  The airplanes were searching all over the sky but nothing appeared; suddenly in the sky, right in the middle of the jets, 3 immense amber lights reappeared.  And the &#34;game&#34; began between these lights and the planes, and after 4 minutes, they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, when we were about 20 miles from Why, AZ, the group of lights appeared again over the place called Ajo, above a butte, two of them, and they stayed there for about 5 minutes.  My companion stopped the car and I began shooting with a Cybershot camera, and after a few moments, more lights began to come out of the light on the right side.  In the video, you really can&#39;t see it well, but these lights left a sort of gray trail against the black night sky when they moved around.   When my companion turned off the headlights, at that moment the three lights began to disappear, and the group of aircraft, probably military, began arriving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then when we headed from Why to Lukeville, one could see on the horizon in the direction of Ajo that the lights were hidden behind a butte.  But when we passed Sonoita, Sonora, Mexico, headed for Puerto Penasco, the lights still could be seen for another 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone knows or has an explanation for this, I would like to know what it was, because to me it seemed extremely strange and upsetting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Translation of other report, by Tom Bowden, MUFON State Director, Oregon.

I immediately was what I thought was Jupiter, but very bright and larger than ususal. Then I though, wait a minute, Jupiter should be in the east. The moon was out 2/3 full to the left/east of this light. A jetliner was passing to the left of the moon and the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light/large star continued to just be there for a minute or so. Then all of a sudden it started to grow large, very large, about 1/3 the size of the moon. Very,very bright. The brightest white light I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind was racing looking for any other lights around it-like landing lights-or sound, no sound, it was dead silent.

On the night of November 30, midnight to be exact.  We were travelling from Tucson to Rocky Point.  After we pass Sells, AZ, we started to see a pair of very bright amber lights and around them 4 white bright intermintent lights that seem to be from airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we stopped, we were able to hear noise from military jets, then we assumed it came from the white lights.  The amber lights desapeared after two minutes.  The jets appeared to be looking for them but could not find anything; suddenly, in the middle of the jets, three huge amber lights reappeared, and a cat and mouse game between the amber lights and the military jets started, 4 minutes later all lights desappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued our trip and when we were 20 miles from Why, AZ, the amber lights appeared over a mountain close to Ajo; they were in the for about 5 minutes.  My friend stopped the car and I stepped out of the car to record with a small digital camera; a few minutes later, another light appeared next to the one on the right side.  When the lights were changing direction in the sky they were leaving a gray streak behind them but it&#39;s not appreciated in the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend shut off the car, and the lights started to fade, at that moment the military jets (I suppose) reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later when we were travelling from Why to Lukeville, we still could notice that the lights were behind the mountains near Ajo; furthermore, when we passed Sonoita, already in the Mexican side and we were travelling to Rocky Point, we could still the lights for 5 more minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The amber lights always faded when the military jets approached them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If someone knows the answer to this event, I&#39;d like to know what it is, because it seemed very strange and thrilling at the same time.<n>

The Object was spotted at 5:00 in the morning from our bedroom window (sliding glass door) when I woke-up and noticed the object was 1st Stationary, 2nd began to slowly descend STRAIGHT DOWN.  I could not longer see it as our Tall backyard Trees caused me to loose view of the Object.  At that moment I noticed the neighbors backyard lights start to FLICKER OFF AND ON.  Then I ran down the hall to the Kitchen to see if I could get a view of the object.  But it was not in view any longer.  However, at that moment I also noticed the other neighbors home from our Kitchen View Window their lights began to FLICKER OFF AND ON.   (Then later that same day the town experianced an unusual type of EARTHQUAKE)as noted in the below article in the newspaper.  Yes, this area is prone to Earthquakes but this one was UN-USUAL than all the others as indicated clearly im the article you can read.  At one time SETI wanted to put their Scientific Instruments near the Pinnacle National Monument area. SETI trys to make other planetary contact with other planets.  What is odd is that their was reports of local boys in the Pinnacles area that even reported seeing UFOS in that area.  And as for me this is the 4th Object I have witnessed over the years in this same area in the same location more or less.  I have even seen them when we lived on an old Ranch in a secluded area. Hollister Free-Lance Newspaper Small Quake Rattles Hollister-  Thursday, November 30, 2006 Hollister - Hollister residents received a jolt Wednesday afternoon when a mostly harmless 4.0 earthquake struck the county, followed by two smaller quakes. &#34;Of course, in San Benito County you get so many earthquakes,&#34; said Steve Walter, a seismologist with the United States Geological Survey. &#34;But this one was a little unusual.&#34;  The quake struck at 1:20pm, with its epicenter located near the intersection of Freitas and Mitchell roads, roughly three miles west of Hollister and five miles east of San Juan Bautista. It was ranked as a 4.0 or &#34;light&#34; earthquake on the Richter scale, with a 1.0 being a microquake and a 10 being a quake of awesome force. The quake originated 1.9 miles below the surface of the earth.  This was followed by a microquake ranking 2.8 at 1:38pm. A third, even smaller microquake may have occurred afterward but was not confirmed by the USGS by press time.  Neither the Hollister Police Department or San Benito County Sheriff&#39;s Department received any calls reporting damage.  The quake was unusual for two reasons, said. San Benito County quakes most often originate from the San Andreas Fault area, or the Calaveras Fault. This one took place from a point between the two and cannot be confirmed to have originated from either.   It was the first 4.0 or greater quake to have occurred in the area between the faults since at least 2000, according to the USGS.  Also, most local earthquakes are characterized by horizontal motion, as the earth&#39;s plates move past one another. This quake, however, moved in a vertical fashion.  &#34;There were elements of horizontal motion, but most of it was vertical, and that&#39;s rare (in the area),&#34; said.  The quake could have been felt as far north as Pleasanton and as far south as Monterey, said. One quake report on the USGS Web site came from San Diego, but said it was highly unlikely.  &#34;Sometimes people hear there was an earthquake and think, &#39;Oh, that was what I felt,&#39;&#34; he said. &#34;When usually it&#39;s just something like a truck going by.&#34;<n>

To my surprise, I noticed an aircraft flying slower than any other aircraft I had ever seen. This aircraft was black, had aircraft marker lights that were not bright.  The lights were red and blue colored.  I also noticed in the rear bottom of the aircraft there was what I can describe as what looked like a vent.  It was a dull silver color.  What really distinguished this aircraft was that it flew completely silent. It was no more than 100 ft. above my home and there was absolutely no noise. I went back inside to get my wife to show her. When we both stepped outside it was gone. I was the only one to witness this to my knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we crossed paths, I saw that they were transporting only one thing.  It was acorn shaped with only a tarp and straps to hold it in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe that my sighting is related with this UFO crash in Columbus, GA.  The night before, I heard on the radio from a CNN news update that a plane crashed near Macon Rd. earlier that day.  At the time, I did not link the two because they had reported it as a &#34;plane&#34;.  I did some private investigating into this UFO crash after finding out that it wasn&#39;t a plane about 6 months after it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m really sorry to the readers that I didn&#39;t submit my report sooner and didn&#39;t get any pictures of the acorn shaped object, but I&#39;ve met up with a key witness and I do believe I&#39;ve located the crash site. The key witness saw the metallic object in the air and then saw it crash.  He thought it was a plane crashing even though he didn&#39;t see any wings.  There is a crater about 40 feet wide there at the crash site.<n>
11/29/06 16:00|Columbus|GA|Fireball|unknown|On the afternoon of 28 November, 2006, according to the Fire and Police Chief of Columbus, Georgia, "several credible witnesses" stated|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53706.html|21|ndxe200611| On the afternoon of 28 November, 2006, according to the Fire and Police Chief of Columbus, Georgia, &#34;several credible witnesses&#34; stated that they saw &#34;something shiny and bright crash into a wooded area directly behind the Pratt &amp; Whitney plant just off US 80 (Macon Rd)&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Scores of police, fire and at least one FAA official raced to the scene. (This account can be seen on the WTVM Channel 9 Columbus, Georgia website)  The &#34;search&#34; was joined by &#34;personnel from Fort Benning, Georgia, the Georgia State Patrol and several &#34;unidentified&#34; personnel&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to the officals, &#34;...after searching for over 5 hours (including the use of helicopters) NOTHING was found&#34;.   In addition, the fire chief made a statement to a local news crew (on film) that...&#34;sometimes people see what they think is something and it really is nothing....&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several large tractor trailers were seen going into the area which had been contained by police.  According to the local press, the witnesses (which are suppose to have been &#34;interviewed&#34; by the local Police on Wednesday the next day) all stated that something &#34;crashed&#34; and it appeared to be a bring, shiny object travelling at high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly, the police, fire and FAA offical stated on the next day that &#34;neither the local Columbus Metropolitan Airport or Fort Benning Lawson Army Airfield radar had shown NO sign of ANY craft or object on radar at the supposed time of impact.  BUT I spoke to the head weather reporter for a local TV station who told me that his station has thier OWN RADAR and they showed &#34;something&#34; striking the area at the approximate time given.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Further, I and another professional educator (with both hold Phd&#39;s) were travelling next to the Columbus Metro Airport at approximately 1:00 PM on Weds (the next day)   NOTE: THE Airport is LESS than 3 miles from the supposed crash site when both I and the other professor saw a COMPLETELY UNMARKED, White, 727 Jet land at the Columbus Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the plane taxied by us (we were NO more than 100 feet from the! plane which was slightly above us at an angle moving towards the main compound) my companions vehicle, lost all power, all gauges went dead, power steering, engine, everything and we guilded to a stop.  We both existed the vehicle thinking something mechanically major had gone wrong with his vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment the plane began to slowly pass us as it was taxing from the main runway.  I picked up my cell phone to call a mechanic and found my cell phone to be dead.  My companions cell phone was also dead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both watched the plane as it went by us.  Both of us are veterans and have travelled MANY times on 727&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost at the same moment, we both spoke because we noticed that the plane had NO MARKINGS OF ANY KIND...no tail numbers, nothing.  The plane had a strange finish and almost looked (excuse the obvious pun) whitewashed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the plane got approximately 100 feet FROM us, my companions car RESTARTED with no apparent reason, or damage of any kind.   In addition, both my and my companions cell phone came back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both academic professors and are empiricists.  We have NEVER been involved in ANY such thing before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediatally attempted to call the airport to inquire about the plane. I was connected (I dont know why to this number) the fire/police crash station.  I started to ask the man who answered about the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He ruded cut me off and stated, &#34;that is a private plane, thank you&#34; and hung up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 30 minutes later I arrived home and I decided to try and call the local aviation company which sells fuel and such and is next to the main terminal.   I called CSG Aviation.  I young woman answered and I inquired about the plane.  She was obviously very young and most likely, simple desk help.  I asked about the 727 &#34;private plane&#34; at which time she CORRECTED ME and told me &#34;Oh no, that was a GOVERNMENT PLANE&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked how she knew that and she said that &#34;It had picked up SOMETHING which it loaded into its rear section and it also refueled, a man in a coat and tie came from the plane and PAID for the fuel with a credit card which had US Treasury and an account number on it.&#34;  She said thats how she knew it was a &#34;government plane&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An additional call to the Airport admin office confused me further.  At that time I was now told that, &#34; I was mistaken, that NO PLANE, much less a 727, had landed or taken off during the time period I gave&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my wife got home, I told her of my encounter and SHE INFORMED ME about the &#34;crash&#34; the say before.   I had not been feeling well and  had not read the paper or seen the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, this revelation absoluted stunned me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am trying to get the &#34;witnesses statements&#34; from the police.  I FIRMLY believe that SOMETHING WAS FOUND AND RECOVERED and that it was taken from Columbus the next day in the STRANGE and unexplained &#34;ghost plane&#34; my friend and I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have a huge military base here with its own airport.  Logic states that if this was something military, they would of taken it to Fort Benning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was also told that during the same period that &#34;debris&#34; was reported striking areas around Montgomery, Alabama which is appoximately 100 miles from here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have NEVER been involved or even interested in anything like this but circumstances has changed that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with the source of this report, and he impressed us with his sincerity, and with the volume of information he had collected about the incident.  He asserts that members of the Georgia State Police, the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, members of the military, and employees of the FAA were on site, at the time that the area was closed off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have requested that he provide more information about the incident, and that he have the other witness to the 727 landing also submit a report of his recollection of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PD))<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Inquiry into alleged crash of unknown aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Joint Investigation by NUFORC and MUFON of Georgia, Fireball, Columbus Georgia  Occurred : 11/29/2006 16:00 (Entered as : 11292006 16:00) Reported: 11/30/2006 5:27:48 AM 05:27 Posted: 12/7/2006 Location: Columbus, GA Shape: Fireball Duration: Unknown  (NOTE:  Readers, for a full understanding of the following described inquiry, please see full original witness account at NUFORC; Columbus Georgia, Fireball, Posted 12/7/2006).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recap-  A resident of Columbus Georgia, a retired educator holding a PhD, was reportedly ill on 28Nov06 and did not follow the normal local news of the day.  The next day, on 29Nov06, he discovered the circumstances of the 28Nov06 Columbus suspected &#39;airplane crash&#39; as covered by the local TV station and newspaper.  At that point, he was mystified by certain events that had occurred earlier that day (29th) in relation to the Columbus Airport, said area which he had driven past in his automobile.  These unusual events described by the witness at the airport involved an alleged unmarked 727 that was taxied close to the adjacent roadway, and was suspected of causing the witness&#39; passing vehicle to stall, as if some unknown electronic device was in operation from within the craft. Other unusual circumstances relating to this are described in the original account. The below described inquiry attempted to sort out all of the matters described by the witness in his NUFORC statement, which basically alleged that something unknown was recovered and then secretly removed from Columbus Georgia by agencies unknown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  On Thursday evening, 7Dec06, Peter Davenport, the Director of the National UFO Reporting Center, contacted this writer and described the account posted by the witness in this case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An agreement was reached to further scrutinize the situation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unavoidable events then occurred which delayed movement on this investigation in the desired prompt manner.  This writer was in the process of returning to MUFON after a 2+ year absence, and was in a transitional phase.  Furthermore the MUFON representative in Columbus Georgia had suffered an extreme medical condition which left him permanently disabled, and no other FIs were in close proximity.  This writer lives some 75 miles north of Columbus. Then during the first phases of the investigation, this FI developed an extreme case of the flu and bronchitis, with pneumonia, which lasted several weeks, most of which I was unable to speak properly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This writer contacted the witness by both phone and email and further discussed the account.  He was asked, and stated he would inquire, if his associate PhD, his passenger on 29Nov06, would also submit an account.  (This account was never produced).<n> <n><n> <n><n> During these conversations, the witness stated that the local TV meteorologist (name on file) had stated that he had noticed a return on his Doppler radar unit about the time of the purported &#39;plane crash&#39; on 28Nov06, and that he had spoken to this meteorologist.  This writer identified the meteorologist and placed repeated phone calls to him which were NEVER returned.  An email also went UNANSWERED, as did a letter posted to him at the TV station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness had also described a quickly formed task force of search personnel that had been formed on 28Nov06 shortly after a &#39;crash witness&#39; had phoned 911.  This search party consisting of Columbus Police and Fire/Rescue, FAA, and soldiers from the adjacent massive Fort Benning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (NOTE: Sidebar-  This writer recalls seeing this large search operation covered by the local Atlanta TV stations, and the Columbus authorities stating, at sometime prior to 11:00PM, that no downed aircraft had been found).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area of the suspected downed aircraft, vicinity of 8801 Macon Road, is the location of the Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft facility. Furthermore said Macon Rd. actually forms part of the northern perimeter of the Fort Benning Army Base.  From past experience, this writer is aware that any major public safety emergency IMMEDIATELY outside of the base has been responded to by Army emergency personnel due to the the possible effects on the base itself and due to the Army being a &#39;good neighbor&#39; to the local Columbus authorities.  Thus a response by the Army Military Police, Provost, or base public safety personnel, is not unusual in a case such as a possible downed aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In this same vein, this writer contacted the Director of Security for the Pratt &amp; Whitney facility (name on file).  He stated that he recalled the afternoon of the event.  The police had sent an officer out ahead to check on conditions as the search was organized and deployed.  He spoke to the officer, but could report nothing vital.  The DirSec&#39;s office is elevated, and he stated that it overlooks most of the area in question in a panoramic view, and that he had noticed nothing extraordinary such as a crashing aircraft or similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This writer also contacted the Columbus Police i.e. 911 Center to locate records of the initial emergency call and the original &#39;plane crash&#39; witness.  This writer was bounced around to different divisions, and generally ignored for days on end.  Past professional contacts in that agency maintained when this writer was a Chief of Police had been transferred or also retired.  This investigator then filed a request for records under the &#39;Georgia Open Records Act&#39;, a state law similar to the FOIA.  This produced what was described as the only record relating to the event (since they maintain that nothing was found), a 911 dispatch card.  It listed the original caller&#39;s name and not much else.  The nature of the &#39;call&#39; was described as &#34;Caller sts seen a plane go down north east of Pratt Whitney&#34;.  Time received 15:56:14; Time dispatched 15:56:19; Time arrived 16:08:52.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This writer phoned the name listed as the original 911 witness, with NO response.  A complete letter of explanation of our needs, insuring confidentiality, and a SASE, was then mailed to the witness, again with NO response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This writer also filed detailed FOIA covering all aspects of this matter to the FAA.  On 30March07, the FAA responded stating that &#34;........searched our files........could NOT find any records responsive to your request....&#34;  During this inquiry, the writer earlier contacted a journalist with the largest Columbus newspaper (organ and name on file).  This individual had demonstrated in past years that he was a friend of Ufology, of MUFON of Georgia and ISUR in particular.  All aspects were explained to him as well as request for informational help through his various contacts among the local government and community.  He agreed to &#39;make some calls&#39; and pass any info to this writer.  This individual developed nothing more than what was already known about the search for a downed aircraft, which he had monitored on his public safety scanner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also contacted was the Air Force Space Command.  This writer sent a request to Lieutenant ______ ______, USAF (name on file) explaining what information we sought  regarding returning space junk and re-entering debris.  The answer came on 5Jan07, indicating that the 1st Space Command Control Squadron at Cheyenne Mountain AF Station confirmed that there was NO returning orbital debris being tracked in the vicinity of the southeastern USA at the times in question.  Likewise the Joint Space Operations Center Weather Flight that there were no unusual space or terrestrial weather phenomena observed during the same time period.  A note added, in order to discuss meteors, refer to NASA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following data highlights should be noted, as it was taken directly from the data base of NUFORC, regarding the following states in the southeastern USA;  28Nov06, between 4:00PM  and 9:00PM and later;  Georgia- EST zone- Dacula, 7PM, Bright green object like shooting star, seemed to stop....moved on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nahunta, 7PM, fireball observed, no color given. Dalton, 7PM, fireball observed, long tail, shooting across sky, changing pink and green, broke into 2-3 pieces, vanished.  Rome 6:35PM, fireball glowing green, NW to south, broke up into several pieces, appeared to strike earth, witness suspected space debris or meteor. Lawrenceville 6:30PM, very bright green light &#39;eyebrow shape&#39;, silent, very high-speed. Rising Fawn, 6:15PM, 2 round green lights falling toward horizon, aqua-green, no tail, like pencil erasure held AAL, witness later heard Chattanooga weather report of fireball meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Alabama- CST zone- Birmingham, 1st, 5:30PM, Blu-grn ball of light; 2nd, 5:30PM, green light streaking across sky, thicker tail than meteor, seemed close to ground, went over a &#39;mountain&#39;, gone; 3rd, 5:30PM, large round bright green circle, WNW to ESE, seemed to be meteor; 4th, brilliant green light to NE, quicker than a plane, 45 degree angle to earth, lost behind trees; 5th, 5:30PM, large green fireball, W to E, surrounded by glowing white light, tail like a comet, next day news said NASA had no meteor reports, news called it a &#39;UFO&#34;.  Pinson, 5:35PM, fireball, white then turned green, vanished behind trees....said landed 2 miles away. Huntsville, 5:30PM, bright green light, traveled east over Chapman Mountain, very fast, wife saw same from different location miles away, like Roman Candle. Bremen, 5:30PM, bright green fireball, falling, resembled fire works display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (NOTE: Alabama Sidebar--The &#39;Decatur Alabama Daily News&#39; ran a story in their 29Nov06 edition.  &#34;Lights in Sky Probably Space Junk or Meteor&#34;.  Thumbnail--The 911 Center in Morgan County began receiving calls at 5:28PM CST on 28Nov06, that a brilliant lime-green light had appeared and the callers were claiming it was a &#39;downed aircraft&#39;.  A multi-agency public safety search effort was mounted in the area and no downed aircraft was found.  Local astronomers went on to describe space junk, and so forth.  Including that lime-green would be consistent with burning aluminum re-entering the earth&#39;s atmosphere. A University of Alabama astronomer stated the &#34;sightings were too late to be explained by the meteor shower that took  place last week&#34;.  (Leonids).  Article went on to discuss bolides, the differences in the way the human eye perceives color and a recent golf shot made by a Russian cosmonaut that hit a golf ball into orbit to become &#39;space junk&#39;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tennessee, split into EST and CST zones- Knoxville, 1st, 10:45PM, 8-10 blu-grn lights, very bright, circular, largest like 1/2 moon, others smaller, E to SE, seemed 60-100mph, large aircraft like a &#39;tanker&#39; seen following behind; 2nd, 6:30PM, 5 very bright blue lights, silent, passed overhead, vanished, distant boom then heard, 5 minutes another boom; 3rd, 6:30PM, large blue fireball, moving east, unlike &#39;shooting star&#39;, traveled 180 degrees, broke into 2-3 pieces, reminded witness of shuttle breakup. Chattanooga, 6:30PM, bright green light, silent, as if 100 feet above ground, intense light, looked as if had 2 parts, shot forward then gone, policeman stopped, got out and looked.  Soddy Daisy, 6:30PM, 2 bright green lights close to horizon, falling at angle, witness says could make out a cylinder or cigar shape from which lights seem to come.....vanished.....neighbor saw same driving miles away. Oliver Springs, fireball, streak of light, NW to ESE, saw 4-5 balls develop from it, burned, went dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kentucky, split into EST and CST zones. Stanford, 6:30PM, very fast green light, W to E, strange shade of green.  Hyden, 5:00PM, 7-8 blu-grn lights, appeared far away, detected circular motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> North Carolina, EST zone.  Marshall, 7:00PM, green light, too fast for an aircraft, S to N, seemed 5 inches off horizon AAL.  Marble, 6:50PM, bright green light, silent, illuminated clouds, moving to NE, seemed 3000-4000 feet, 200-400 mph.  Boone, 6:40PM, fireball, large, bright green, poorly defined edges, clouds glowing green, changed direction slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Franklin, 6:25PM, 2 green lights, very fast, down then upwards, silent, one ahead of the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While there is a difference in times, directions, and exact descriptions, there is enough probable cause therein to indicate there was in fact something afoot in the SE skies of the USA the evening of 28Nob06.  TOO MANY similarities not to have been connected to the same, or a series of, related aerial event(s).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s obvious from past investigations that a bolide, fireball, large meteor, or huge returning space junk, can be seen by ground observers MANY hundreds of miles apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Likewise large meteor showers.  Past investigations have found CREDIBLE witnesses that all believed the light/object/fireball observed went to ground nearby when it actually traveled over the horizon, sometimes into another state.  A good example of this was a SC police helicopter pilot who made such an observation on the Ga/SC state line.  He was preparing to call out the search parties for a downed aircraft and actually landed his chopper to refuel so as to cross into Georgia to assist.  The object observed on that occasion was later tracked by citizen&#39;s reports across Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and on into Arkansas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the course of this investigation, it was found that the previously orbiting Russian reconnaissance satellite Cosmos 2423 was launched on 14Sept06 and it&#39;s orbit began to decay before completion of it&#39;s expected appx. 120 day mission (possible mechanical malfunction).  Various sources indicated that the breakup began on or about 17-18November 2006 and the satellite was then destroyed at some point by ground command to better control any resulting impact damage and to prevent &#39;foreign&#39; intelligence services&#39; from retrieving any possible surviving components.  The U.S. Space Command indicated that Cosmos 2423 generated 28 cataloged fragments, NORAD catalog numbers 29604-29631.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional speculation is that the now smaller Cosmos 2423 fragments might have taken as long as 30 days to re-enter the atmosphere, which puts the 28Nov06 date well within that window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One would like to think that the US Space Command would not be intentionally deceitful to the American public regarding requests for information, but in matters dealing with intelligence about reconnaissance efforts of a potential future foe, I&#39;m not so sure.  In fact, in such a case, I would fully EXPECT such matters to remain confidential within our military and intelligence community.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional speculation on my part is that IF anything HAD been recovered during the Columbus Georgia &#39;downed aircraft search&#39;, and it rose to the level of requiring the find to remain secret or confidential, the Columbus Municipal Airport would be the last place used to remove it from the local scene.  The Columbus Airport is only some 4+ miles from the Ft. Benning base perimeter, and the location of the &#39;search&#39; area is practically atop the base&#39;s northern property line (Macon Road vicinity).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fort Benning Georgia is IMMEDIATELY adjacent the City of Columbus.  This fort is one of the largest U.S. Army installations in the world, and is the home of the Army&#39;s Airborne School, the Headquarters of the 75th Ranger Regiment, and the Infantry School. Official records indicate that Fort Benning, and it&#39;s various training commands, is serviced from within by Lawson Army Airfield which is capable of, and does, land the largest aircraft owned by the U.S. Government; the C-5, C-17, C-141, C-130 and others.  It is this writer&#39;s opinion that anything requiring such secrecy as described by the witness would have been flown out of Lawson Army Airfield.  Doing so would give TOTAL and COMPLETE control and security to such a confidential process.  Such security would be marginal, or non-existent, at a civilian municipal airport.  This is not to say that such a municipal airport has not been used during certain government projects, but again, anything arising to such a confidential level would be routed through a government installation if at all possible.......there is no doubt in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Under such conditions it would be difficult indeed to prove for certain that anything clandestine took place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As to the circumstances of the event occurring on the airport access road i.e. the witness unexplained stalled vehicle near a 727 aircraft.  Over the course of this inquiry, the writer has touched base with various former and retired persons with a background in military intelligence and other electronic &#39;specialists&#39;.  Speculations vary, but in the opinion of one &#39;specialist&#39;, an electronic system that might cloak or disrupt the outside monitoring of the aircraft systems or communications........&#34;I would not be surprised if such devices exist.  But effecting nearby electronic components?  Likely not&#34;.  He went on to describe the need for this that some military aircraft might have......Air Force One, but such system would have to be discrete, being vital that it NOT affect other systems........further describing sound cancellation devices........additionally, the one successfully used with some Black Hawk helicopters and similar techniques used in our submarines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s apparent that the Georgia &#39;downed aircraft witness&#39; saw something that led to notifying the authorities.  So did the witnesses in Decatur/Morgan County Alabama, both events leading to an official ground search.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did pieces of Russian Cosmos 2423 or some other satellite or space junk come down in the southeastern USA?  Not according to the USAF Space Command.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did the southeastern skies experience the &#39;Green Fireball&#39; phenomenon as have other parts of the USA in the past?

I sleep facing the sliding door where I can look out into our backyard at our tall Trees, Fence, Hot Tub, Birdbath area and all the Stars at night.  I wake-up early to feed our Tabby Cats.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happen to open my eyes and could see out of the bedroom window a large ROUND/CIRCULAR looking ORANGE Glowing BALL literally coming from the Sky slowly DOWN-WARD and on the left side of the Globe was a small white light that was in the shape of a Straight Line.  It was not a big straight line but was attached to the ORANGE CIRCULAR object.  I leaped out of bed to get a closer look but it went down fast enough that I lost view of it because our TALL TREES blocked the view.  It looked to be distant enough from our home that it had to be near the outskirts of the Golf Course and near Tres Pinos a really small town that adjoins Hollister.  Further out that way is Pinnacles National  Monument area.  NOTE:  What is odd about it is that I left all the lights out in our house when this occured.  And when the object went down my neighbors behind our home - their lights in their house started to FLICKER off and on as if someone in their house turned the lights on to look out and then turn them off.  They flickered the lights several times.  Then the house opposite our Kitchen Window that neighbor on that side of the house also had their lights FLICKER on and off.   (I thought it odd that at the same time-frame I saw the Object that the Neighbors all had their lights Flicker off and on then off.  This all happened at 5:00 in the morning as I looked at our Digital Clock in our bedroom nightstand to verify the time this took place.   NOTE:  Then that afternoon there was a EARTHQUAKE here in Hollister.  It literally rattled and shook the DOORS and Fans above the Ceiling.  (I have seen shooting stars before and orange bright stars burning out.  This thing was differant.  It did not fall from the sky.  It was statinary for a few seconds then descending DOWN.  ! **This i s the FOURTH time now in several years of seeing objects in this same area more or less within the vacinity.

Not like a searchlight they were like sheets of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be motionless or very very slow moving for some seconds then it moved in a North Easterly direction towards my home.  As it came nearer i saw a wide trail of soft misty white light trail behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went in to my home quickly and obtained my binoculars and using them saw a huge black triangular craft with a small white light on each corner glowing with a large red light in the centre pulsating.   As it flew overhead i suddenly realised there was absolutely no sound and it flew by as if gliding at a very low speed.I believe it was about two thousand feet high and it was huge blocking out groups of stars as it passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed as it flew away the rear edge seemed to give off a strange moving glow that really defies description. This glow appeared to create the light trail behind. The light trail was more like a whispy mist effect like you see when the suns rays penetrate trees in a forest. This light trail was almost ghostly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dark red light seemed to shimmer like a mirage in the desert it was unlike any light effect i have ever seen.  I noted as it flew by there was no sound at all and although huge in size it appeared very flat like a board.  I felt mesmerised looking at it amazed by its size and the complete absence of any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father was in the Air Force for many years and i have lived near air bases my entire life.  I am familiar with aircraft and a military airbase is located one mile from me.  I know what i saw is far bigger than any aircraft i have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am fifty five years old and for the first time in my life i can say i have seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a genuine report but if anyone cares not to believe me it does not matter i know what i saw.I am hoping other people witnessed it also.<n>

They were amber, not green. One appeared, then as the next one appeared right beside it, the first one burned out, until four lights in a line appeared and burned out. Not disappeared; appeared to fade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The phenomenon happened again just a short distance away.

I then saw a cigar shaped craft. I did not know if it was an alien craft or a new air craft made by the U.S.A because it was fallowed by a helicopter.

I looked up and noticed several (about 8 or 10 all in a row) bluish-green lights, circular in shape and very bright, just over the clouds.  I thought they were fireworks or a bomb at first but the lights never faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were 1,000 to 2,000 feet high in a partly-cloudy sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw them for about 12 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light in front was the largest.  It appeared the size of a half-moon; the lights following behind it were just a bit smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were almost directly above us. They started in the west and were headed east to south-east at about 60-100 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an amazing spectacle and very pretty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it had passed, I noticed one of the TN Air National Guard refueling planes following behind.

One bright light, then it faded, another one appeared to the right and it faded, and the last bright light appeared again to the right all in a straight line.  I traveled approximately 4 more miles and I again saw just one bright light in a large cotton field.  I drove to my house to get my son just 1/4 mile away, we went back to the field, stopped the car and got out, but the light was gone.  I pointed in the exact spot where I saw it for the second time, but it wasn&#39;t there.  We both began looking around to see if it went somewhere else, but I returned to the same location and there it was again.  However, when I said there it is again, my son wasn&#39;t looking and missed it.  I was very upset because I knew that no one would ever believe what I had seen, so my son agreed to sit on the bumper of my car and wait a few minutes.  After about 5 minutes I told him we could leave and turned to get in the car when he said there it is!  One light appeared again, but this time whatever it was put on a light show!  The bright light in the middle appeared, then one by one 4 lights faded in and out to the left, the 4 lights faded in and out to the right in the same sequence, time, and horizontally.  Then bright lights appeared at the top, bottom repeating like a &#34;V&#34; shape.  And, within seconds it was gone.  It was very close to the ground because we did not have to bend our necks to look up, we just looked straight ahead and watched the show.  The only thing that I believe in that I can not see is God...it&#39;s very hard to convince me otherwise.  However, I will never laugh or call anyone stupid again that says they&#39;ve had an encounter.  What my son and I saw was unexplainable.  It definately was not an airplane, hot air balloon, weather balloon, flares of any kind...I&#39;m still in shock and really can&#39;t forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light passed in and out of the clouds as it flew by, illuminating the clouds with a green glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have a small airport in nearby Andrews, so I&#39;ve seen plenty of small planes with there lights. The light we saw was much brighter and flew at a faster speed. I would estimate the light to fly at about 3,000 to 4,000 feet and was traveling steadily northeast at about 200 to 400 miles per hour.<n>

It rose slowly and appeared to be hovering or moving in the direction that the vehicle was.  It changed direction slowly and moved a short distance to the right and extremely rapidly moved into and above a cloud making the entire cloud glow green and it was no longer visible.  Of note, there was a major traffic accident at the bottom of the mountain but this in no way was a medivac or plane!  I&#39;m well versed on both and can attest to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As it became visible the object took on a flaming/glowing green hue, indicating a high metal content. The object was then visible in the sky for about 5 seconds which gave all witnesses a excellent view of its descent. This object, at the end of its descent broke up into several smaller objects and appeared to strike the earth. In my opinion, this object was no more than space debris or a meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My daughter and I both saw two bright green lights that appeared to be falling at an angle towards the earth.  They lights were equidistant and moved together in a perfect line.  They appeared to be close on the horizon, no more than a mile or two overhead, the conditions were very cloudy but these lights were clear and bright and did not dim at all as they travelled.  We could barely make out a cylinder, tubular, or cigar shaped object which the lights appeared to come from.  The lights did not fade, but rather they suddenly disappeared.  Two neighbors confirmed that they saw the exact same thing at the same time.  They were also travelling in their car about 3-5 miles away from where we saw the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There are two houses being built beside us, so I thought that maybe a car or someone at one of the houses had turned on very bright lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was quickly processing this info, I happened to look up and saw five very bright blue lights absolutely zoom across the night sky, in single file formation, without making a sound.  When I noticed the lights, they were almost directly overhead, perhaps a few thousand feet in the air, and they disappeared after only a few seconds, as they vanished into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not tell whether they simply flew out of view, or actually turned off, but they had obviously been visible before I noticed them overhead, as their light was so bright that, in the few seconds before I looked up, I had felt their light all the way down to ground level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time, a neighbor across the street was out on her porch, calling her dogs in, and after they disappeared from view, I asked her if she had seen the same thing I had just witnessed.  She said that she had.  I asked her what she thought it was, and she had no idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1 minute after the lights disappeared, a very distant boom could be heard, almost like a sonic boom from miles and miles away, but without any visible signs.  About 5 minutes later, another boom was heard, again without any visual cues to what was going on, and then nothing more happened the rest of the night.<n>

We were driving NE towards Huntsville, AL.  It was going the same direction to the left of us along interstate 565.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were really low clouds that night and the object came down from the clouds, flew about 5 seconds, and went back up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never seen anything fly this fast in my life.  I couldn’t get a really good look at the shape, but it was glowing green.  It did not have a green streak behind it either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying too low to be a meteor or “space junk” as it was reported here in the Decatur Daily.<n>

My boyfriend pointed to the red light that we thought was the jet and i noticed to more red lights next to it. The lights seemed to have another color behind them, other than the darkish sky. As we stood there we saw the lights move in a slow steady pace. The were formed in a triangular shape and slowly moved into a rounded half circle and then into a perfectly straight angled line that ended in a perfectly straight line that was 90 degrees from the ground. We watched until they quickley disapeared. When the lights moved they moved smoothley and perfectly, but we saw one kind of jerk back and forth and return to formation. As the were disapearring we saw a white light (a plane?) intersect their path but at a different direction and I don&#39;t know how close it was to them. If this wasn&#39;t an alien spacecraft than it was some crazy government fighter plane. I still cant believe we both witnessed this. I had goosebumps for the next 5 minutes and when I explain it to people I still get the chills.<n>

When I neared the top of Chapman Mountain, I saw one or two bright green lights in the sky.  The object moved very fast toward the east and looked like it might have also been descending.  I watched it move through the sky until it disappeared from my sight.  It kind of looked like one shot from a roman candle firework, so I almost dismissed it as such.  Then, my wife, who took a different route home, told me that saw the same object from a good distance north of me on Chase Road.  From her description, it seemed that she had an even better view of the object than I did, which makes me question whether it was a firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It came from the west and was heading eastward.  It was not very high in the sky, maybe a mile up, and it was much larger than a plane.  It was round, light green in color and surrounded with a glowing white light.  It had a tail similar to that of a comet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled at a very slow speed and it never burned out (we thought it might be a shooting star).  It kept flying eastward.  We watched it about 30 seconds until it flew over the tree line.  Later that night I heard on the news that it was a meteor but the next day the local news called it a UFO becuase they were not sure what it was.  The news said NASA had no signs of meteors in our area when this object was spotted.  The news said that many people saw it in our area.<n>

I assure you that this is in no way a hoax.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were leaving a detention session at a high school about 30 minutes before this happened.  I was waiting to get picked up by my parents (my friend and I were the only ones left waiting to be picked up). I was staring up into the sky, lost in thought, when a light caught my attention. It was a bluish-green light that travelled from one side of the sky to the other in about 10, maybe 12 seconds. It looked like it was surrounded by a kind of haze or aura.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my eyes tried to focus on it, it disappeared behind a cloud bank and vanished from my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to be emitting sparks and left a trail, almost like the haze emitted by jet aircraft flying at a low level. After I saw it, I only had to wait about 3 seconds before I heard a very odd noise, which sounded like a car backfiring, with a whistling noise that followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> am telling this event to the best of my recollection and testify that is 100% true to the letter.<n>

The light had the same look of a planes light, but a little bigger and much softer. It was slowly pulsing and traveling at an amazing speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed it was traveling at led me to believe it was at a low altitude.  It was completely silent, except for a faint noise of some kind of engine, barely audible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, just as it passed the moon, it vanished, and there was no trace of anything out of the ordinary once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The street i was on was completely empty, and it was almost pitch black outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first i thought  this was a shooting star or a plane, but everything seemed wrong about it.  There might have been a plane nearby, which would explain the sound, but this thing was extremely fast and out-of-the-ordinary.  It was a completely clear sky outside, and the object seemed to be traveling to the chugach mountains, and definitely crossed over south anchorage.<n>

It did not happen again though we were looking for it through the windows and moonroof. The sky was clear and we were both lucid, having just stopped for coffee.

The object was above this layer and I attribute its hazy appearance to that fact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light moved rapidly from a higher to lower altitude and seemed to follow a trajectory that made an angle of about 30 degrees with the ground.  From my vantage point at approximately 1250 feet in elevation, it appeared that the object was about 5 miles, or so, distant, and located over the Redstone Arsenal.  The object covered a large arc of sky in the very short time in which I viewed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object gave the impression it would impact the ground somwhere south of my location.  I can see about 40 miles due to my mountain-top location.  I waited for several minutes for a sign of impact, but saw none.  The Alabama counties in which an impact could have taken place are Morgan and Marshall.  No sound from the object was audible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had attributed my sighting to a meteor, until a local newspaper ran an article about a similar sounding object that was seen a day later at a much earlier time (11/28/06 at 17:28).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Search lights, flares, rockets, missiles, and aitcraft are unlikely explanations for this object.  Humidity in the air would make search light beams visible and the shape of the spot on the clouds would have changed due to the angle of the light source.  The object maintained constant shape.  The apparent altitude and angle of sky covered would likely indicate supersonic velocity and probably a sonic boom, especially if the object had to avaoid collision with the ground.  The sudden appearance and disappearance of the object, and its constant luminance would also help rule out the other possibilities I mentioned.<n>

I hovered there for about a minute and then started to follow his truck. it was a triangle with 4 lights on it. one in each corner and one in the middle. while he observed the object he noticed strange things happening to his radio and vehicle like th lights would flicker. by th time he reached rich creek boat ramp the object had dissappeared.<n>

When I looked up, it looked like at first it was a small plane duing a 45 degree turn.  We both noticed it was moving to slow to be a plane.  At that time it was difficult to see an exact shape.  It remined me of an old american car.  It moved slow,  and a  very even movement. It went around Downtown Bellevue and stoped. At that time I noticed a light coming from the front , like a spot light. It was at an aproxoite 35-40 degree angle. I looked at the shape, it was flat on the bottom, with a hump in the back and a hump in the front. Like I said an old American car. It just sat there, did not move. I put my window down and did not hear anything except cars. Then it started in what looked like a circular drive around the city, which is only a few blocks in either direction. This time it went around and never came back. I know it was not a plane. It was not a chopper, did not see any moving parts. It was twice as high as the tallest building in Bellevue, which is 44 stories. It seemed quite large like a big rig truck, but much thiner. It had at least one light on the back hump which was on all the time.<n>
11/27/06 14:15|Tempe|AZ|Disk|20 minutes|Numerous incidents over the last few months occuring over Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, AZ|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54486.html|76|ndxe200611| Numerous incidents over the last few months occuring over Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, AZ<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this incident to MUFON at the time of the occurance on November 27th, 2006...I am re reporting here in leiu of the Chicago O&#39;Hare airport story. I work on the Tempe/ Phoenix line at the corner of Priest and Washington Streets. This location is approximatley 3-4 miles East Northeast of Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix. My office and viewing location are directly under the landing flight path of westbound landing flights at Skyharbor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular occurance is a repeat and has been repeated for a total of at least 10-12 occurances at this location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this day at approximatley 2:15 pm I was in my car in my parking lot at work. I was skywatching as I have been seeing various orbs ( black and white ), strobing cylinders , and one saucer like object for the previous 2 months. When I say 2 months that is only when I started looking at this location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object was a definite saucer shape..white on top and black on the bottom. The object drifted and wobbled Northeast for about 10-12 minutes at a fairly slow clip before it faded away in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sooner had the first object faded away when it was followed by a larger, white orb which was traveling slightly faster going more due east, vs northeast as the first object was going. Due to the clear sky and no reference objects in the sky..ie other planes or clouds..I could not judge the distance of the objects. They are either quite large and quite high up, or relatively small at low altitudes. They produce no noise. The are very similiar to the objects seen in CNUFOS.COM..which is done by local Phoenix resident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had at least 10 days observing these objects over a course of a few months. This is only given that I go out and watch one hour and day at the same time of day and even then I don&#39;t go watch every day. On any given day I will see one to three objects within a few minutes of each other. I have not seen any travel together or tandem.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since these events occur so very close to the flight paths..either takeoff or landing at one of the nations busiest airports, I am surprised there is not more investigation from local FAA authorities simply for the sake of passenger safety alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I make no claim that these objects are extraterristial, however they do not appear to resemble any manmade objects that I am familiar seeing. Even in the event that these objects are simply &#34; balloons &#34; ..the frequency and proximity to a major US airport should alert someone in a position of authority to keep an active watch on the skies to avoid a potential air tragedy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this summary is helpful to other residents or aviators in the area, either on the basis of interest in the subject or minimally for air safety as a precaution.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

THE BRILLIANCE WAS STARTLING AND WHEN I PARKED MY TRUCK I JUMPED OUT TO SEE WHERE IT HAD GONE, BUT IT VANISHED.<n>
11/27/06 00:30|Las Vegas|NV|Sphere|1 hour|Blue Orb sighted from Las Vegas, over Area 51 Mountain Range, traveling at incredible speeds.|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53647.html|79|ndxe200611| Blue Orb sighted from Las Vegas, over Area 51 Mountain Range, traveling at incredible speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I consider myself a sane, common knowledged person, with some experience in aviation and military aircraft.  I fly often and have seen every commercial aircraft as well.  I have witnessed flares used in military training exercises, I have seen reflections of lights off clouds and windows (glass). I was an amateur astronomer and have seen everything from meteorites to the space shuttle in orbit. I have seen hundreds of satellites.  While I have witnessed other very impressive UFO&#39;s with multiple witnesses, this was different from all the rest. I have never officially reported a UFO Sighting until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking from the 20th floor of the Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas towards the direction of Area  51. I was also overlooking the Las Vegas Airport late at night, as I usually do when I visit that city. Suddenly out in the distance, beyond the mountain range a &#34;BLUE ORB&#34; rose into the sky at an unbelievable speed, it did not travel in a straight direction at any time, it continued to fly erratically throughout the hour I stayed awake to watch it. This BLUE ORB would rise to, my guess 50,000 feet, and dive back behind the mountain range within seconds. The speed of this object far exceeded any military plane I have ever seen and could not begin to imagine that it was a manned vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did appear to fly within a limited range and distance, as it did not approach the city, nor did it seem to fly far into the distance, but rather kept its location above and beyond the Nevada mountain range. Furthermore, as planes could be seen approaching from the distance, this BLUE ORB would disappear behind the mountains. I felt as if &#34;it&#34; was being tested with caution. What I mean is the orb would disappear when a commercial airplane was near and the orb would reappear when the skies were clear of visible traffic. I&#39;m confident the skies above our US testing sights are secure, and air traffic above them is forbidden.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object had no defined shape other than a Blue Ball of Light. It did not flash, it did not change color, it made no noise I could hear, IT DID FLY AT INCREDIBLE SPEEDS. IT MOVED BOTH IN &#34;S&#34; PATTERNS AS WELL AS STRIGHT AND ERRATIC. IT WOULD SOMETIMES STOP SUDDENLY, HOVER AND DIVE, AND SOMETIMES IT JUST DARTED AROUND SOMEWHAT UNCONTROLLABLY. WHILE I WAS FASCINATED, THIS ORB WAS COMING NO CLOSER AND I FELT THAT WHAT I SAW WAS ALL I WOULD SEE. I DID CONTACT HOTEL SECURITY IN THE MORNING AND THEY TOLD ME THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course, I did not have my video camera and I stand alone as an Eye Witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for listening.<n>
11/26/06 23:30|Hervery Bay (Australia)||Unknown|3 Seconds|Extremely Bright Flash Of light at night|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68764.html|80|ndxe200611| Extremely Bright Flash Of light at night<n> <n><n> <n><n> While living in Hervey Bay Queensland, Australia at approximately 11:30 pm during late November of 2006, I went outside to the back yard of our house to have a cigarette. As I was standing there a bright flash lit up the night sky. The flash lasted only for two or three seconds. It was a clear night there were no clouds in the sky, this was not lightning. It was as if suddenly it was daytime for a few seconds and then night time again. The source of the flash seemed to come from behind me and my house which would have been to the north west. At the time of the flash I noticed my shadow pointing away from me and this is how I determined the direction of the source of the light. I checked the skies in all directions after the flash and saw nothing. I have never experienced such a bright flash of light before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were standing out there talking and I saw a blue light relfecting off of me, thinking it was a firework or something I turned and looked up in the sky.  I saw this object go shooting across the sky faster than I&#39;ve ever seen anything move and it was a distinct blue color.  I&#39;ve seen a shooting star and meteorite before and it defintly didn&#39;t look like that, or just dissapear like that either.  My sister saw it too, and my other friends didn&#39;t turn in time but saw me completely lit up in a blue color.  I have no idea what I saw but it was one of the weirdest things I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Although we don&#39;t know if this is related there was a flash of white light either outside or from a lamp bulb.  It was to quick to tell. the power went out in the neighborhood right after for about 10 seconds and then came back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we sat there and talked about it I rememered I needed something at the store and on my way out to the car I saw a spotlight searching over houses.  I was pretty sure this was a power truck looking for a blown box but I don&#39;t think they saw any because they drove off a minute later.  I then looked into the sky to see the little dipper and a few other stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I a;ways see one or 2 stars that look like they&#39;re gleaming but I noticed one tonight that was not gleaming but was actually blinking.  Sometimes I know the gases in the air can make star look another color but this one was literally blinking red, green and blue.  I called my wife out who is very closeminded to these things but admitted &#39;that&#39;s not a plane.&#34;  Now I know planes move at high altitudes and sometimes apear not to be moving but they wouldn&#39;t be using those light schemes especially that high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light stayed stationary for about 5 minutes as we watched but as soon as my wife went in to get the camera it moved up and to the right. I took about 6 pictures at 5 mega pixels and large format but it was pretty dark in the sky so the pics do show the color and in a few it looks as though the object is 2 pieces but you can&#39;t make out a shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know much about image construction so all i can really do is increase the size to see the colors but I can&#39;t figure out a shape.

11/26/06 22:05|Sanford|NC|Changing|10 minutes|Golden orange quarter moon shaped-object hovers at tree line for ten minutes before developing an orb and disappearing in Sanford, NC.|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53637.html|85|ndxe200611| Golden orange quarter moon shaped-object hovers at tree line for ten minutes before developing an orb and disappearing in Sanford, NC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:05 pm my husband and I observed a quarter-moon shaped, golden object at the tree line due west from the front porch of our home. The object was shaped so much like the moon and was so close in size, too, that at first we thought it was just some sort of atmospheric condition causing an odd colored moon. It was sunset colored &#34;golden orange.&#34; Then we realized that not only was the sky perfectly clear (we could see all of the stars; no clouds), but this &#34;moon&#34; was in the wrong position in the sky; it is always above the tree line and to the east at that time of night. We immediately began watching the object, discussing what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the course of 2-3 minutes, we both noted that the object began twinkling on the lower side, almost like some object lit with Christmas lights. The thought that it could be some sort of Christmas decoration entered our discussion, but our location is in the country in a wooded, secluded area; we cannot see any other houses from our home, and this object was not in a direction where any houses exist. Over the next few minutes, the entire object began dimming so that it was hard to see through the trees. It was almost as if clouds were passing over it and blocking it from view, even though there were no clouds anywhere; something seemed to be obstructing our view, and the object itself seemed to be changing positions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We changed positions, trying to keep an eye on the object. It developed an orangey-red, fire colored orb over its top center area, and the entire object grew brighter momentarily. We almost called 911. We thought maybe there was a large fire in the woods. However, before we could do anything, the body of the object dimmed again. Over the next few minutes the orb grew smaller and smaller as if moving away from us. Then it just disappeared completely from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a beeping sound that we noticed as soon as we’d gone outdoors, and this sound continued after the object disappeared. The beeping repetition and sound was similar to that of a house fire alarm, but it sounded, then paused for a few seconds, then sounded again, over and over. We’d never noticed that sound before the incident, and it stopped after a few hours. We’re not sure if it’s related or not, but since we both heard it, I thought we should mention it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background on us: I’m a published writer and photographer (and didn’t take photos!! I couldn’t seem to tear myself away long enough to get the camera), and I hold an Associate in the Arts. Currently I’m working toward a BA in English. My husband is a housing contractor. He also runs a small business building custom guitars.<n>
11/26/06 21:25|Olympia|WA|Light|3 seconds|Low, quick light seen over Olympia, Washington, neighborhood.|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53632.html|86|ndxe200611| Low, quick light seen over Olympia, Washington, neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking in my neighborhood and something caught my eye overhead. I looked up and saw a light move very quickly then disappear. The direction was northerly, in a straight line, no quick stops or turns. The light was steady white, not flashing, and no shape could be discerned. There was no sound at all either before or after I saw the light. There was no &#39;tail&#39; or appearance of fire or dust like might be expected if it was a meteor. After only seconds, I could no longer see the light. It did not go behind trees or any obstruction, it did not appear to hit the ground, it was just suddenly no longer visible. The light appeared to me to be low in the sky, lower than the numerous commercial airlines I see and hear regularly. I have never seen anything like this before, and I regularly look at the sky in the evening, as my husband and I enjoy looking at stars and planets through a telescope. We have seen satellites - this was not one. We have seen shooting stars - this was not one. We have seen commercial airlines - this was not one. Most peculiar to me, was the fact there was absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was flying over the Catalina Mountain Range.  This is a high aircraft traffic area but I could not identify it as and aircraft or ballon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object mut have been several miles away. It was traveling fairly rapid maybe faster than a commercial jet but not too much faster than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be highly polished or reflective.  The very bright silver flash from the object is what first caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I (and my wife) that it might have been flying parelel to the ground adjusting it flight patteren every second or so causing the silvery flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The directon of travel was east to west.  I watched it til I could not see it any more.  However my wife said before it disapeared from veiw it shot up then vanished.  I have seen flashes from aircraft landing but this flash was diffrently colored than those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have worked around aricraft for over 18 years and I could not match this with military or civilian aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also It was mostly clear skies and around 65-70 degrees at ground level and I did&#39;nt see a contrail.<n>

I kept looking at the object as I was driving and I was trying to look for wings to establish it was a passenger aircraft or something of that sort. I eventually stopped the car not far from my home in craig-y-don only to realise that the craft was not moving or &#39;&#39;FLYING&#39;&#39; as a normal plane would be it was moving in a North to South direction very slowly over the nant-y-gammer hill range. To scale it looked the size of a very low flying pAasenger jet but with no wings like a cigar shape with a very shiny silver body the sun was glaring at one point of the craft but I did notice a dark surface/object in the centre of the craft, There were two other aircraft in the area at the time one normal passenger plane at normal altititude like im used two seeing and another light aircraft that I have seen many times before but not so common to the area, however this object was like nothing ive ever seen before. Ive lived in this town for 22 years and am fully aware of the air traffic that travells over here and have never seen any aircraft like it, very strange. By the time i had driven home the object had disapered even though the same area of sky was still clearly visable. I have read up about &#39;&#39;silver shaped cigar objects&#39;&#39; since and read a fair few articles describing almost a submarine shape craft and most sightings seem to be near water or on the coastlines very starnge if you ask me!<n>
11/26/06 14:30|Long Beach|CA|Circle|5-6 minutes|Let me first say that I have been a pilot since I was 17 years old, flew helicopters in the Army and logged over 3600 hours of flight t|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53677.html|89|ndxe200611| Let me first say that I have been a pilot since I was 17 years old, flew helicopters in the Army and logged over 3600 hours of flight time.  I have very good depth perception and can judge altitudes pretty accurately.  This particular incident is the second unexplained sighting I have had in 40 plus years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 2 children, 12 and 8 years old, and I were sitting on a grassy knoll in a local park watching radio controlled gliders.  I heard an approaching airplane and layed on my back to looked up at the sky to watch the plane begin its&#39; landing approach to the local airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed overhead I noticed a small round, very bright, solid white object at a very high altitude, directly above me.  It was slowly moving westward when it stopped.  When this happened, I asked my 12 year old if she could see the object.  She said she did and asked what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then asked my 8 year old if he could see it.  After 5 seconds or so, he also saw it.  Just as my 8 year old spotted the object, it slowly started to move in a north direction for maybe 10 seconds, then stopped.  Within a few more seconds, it changed direction and moved south east to a spot directly over us again.  The white round object had completed a triangle pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 3 or 4 minutes, we saw the object seem to tilt down towards the east and it now appeared to have a faint outline of chrome or silver to it.  It stayed like this for only 3 or 4 seconds, then appeared to rotate back up to its&#39; original horizontal (?) position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This day was fairly windy - 10-15 mph surface winds with a much faster high altitude wind due to a cold front system moving in.  The white object never gained altitude or drifted in any direction other than the original 3 directions mentioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My estimate was that it was at or above 40k feet as there were 2 high altitude jets passing through the area that created vapor trails and the white object appeared at this altitude or higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My children and I watched this object for over five minutes - I had checked my watch.<n>

The sky was crystal clear and no visible clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I waited, I noticed a cylindrical object that was high in the northern sky.  I thought that it was a balloon, but noticed that it seemed motionless.  I would guess that it was well above 5,000 feet in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was whitish/ silver and seemed to be the size of an airliner, but it was difficult to judge, since it was so high up and there was no other reference points in the clear blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object stayed in the same location for about 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was distracted briefly by a phone call and when I returned to the sky, I noticed that the object had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I searched the sky and there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed two high flying jets and their contrails, their flightpath took them directly through the same area where the object was hovering previously.<n>

It has a fluctuating Green/blue/red/white luminosity and varies in intensity almost like a brightly twinkling star, except that no matter what tie o evening or early morning, it doesn&#39;t traverse the sky like the rest of the planets and stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to several other people who dismissed it as an approaching plane, however it hasn&#39;t changed position on the night I have noticed it. I did not notic it befoe a week ago. It is positioned over south toward Fort Walton, and westward over the Gulf of Mexico. I thought perhaps it miht be a helicopter, howver it doesn&#39;t move at all, or fade. The lights are flashing, much like an aircraft. I may be wrong, but thought to report it... as everyone else has dismissed it as a star or plane without another thought. I am intrigued by how many people take for granted what is in the sky and aren&#39;t interested in even giving a second glance. Makes me wonder how much we actually are ginorant of and miss above us...very few people I know are willing to entertain the idea there might be something more in the nighht sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of Sirius, we suspect, or of some other star.

From where we live ( 6,000 feetup)we can see alot of stars. We were both looking up and saw a bright green light. It looked a little larger then a star and it was levatating inone spot. Then it got brighter as it elivated straight up thousands of feet. As it went up another red blinking light came from the west straight right towards the green light and they almost hit. As soon as this happened the red light was gone and the green light changed multi color and started moving towars us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now it had been about 10 sec. The  light ( probly 10,000 feet up ) got very large and moved acros the sky south to north ( taking a right turn after levatating) at this time we were tripin and then it turned into a f***in&#39; triangle with green lights and yellow. It had about 6 lights it total. I  couldnt belive i could everseesomething like this. it stayed as a triagnle for like 8 sec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it apperaed to change shape ( which i couldnt make out) and all i could see was two red lights on top ofeach other. After it took this shape it went faster and lokked as it zoomed out of our atmosphere. I tried to take a picture of it with my cell phone but it didnthave a flas so it didnt catch it. Me and my boyfriend wereso amazed to see anything like it. One of ourneighbors i didnt know was in the parkinglot too and 5 sec before it dissapered i caught his attention and he saw the last of it. This crazy experince proves to me and my boyfriend that there is aliens. Now i findmyself wanting to look at the stars more often.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I called for him to come back out and we watched it move closer for a short period of time.  He than returned inside and the light kept moving towards me until it passed my house.

I thought it might of been planes from the airforce base about 15 mins away but some were silent but than a plane did come across because i heard the engine except it was different from the other moving objects which were completly silent and I didn&#39;t understand why I spoted about 8 military aircrafts than 2 which could of only been about 400-500 feet about my house THAT USED PROPELLER ENGINES?!?!?!  Also it was an outdated plane from what I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More of what appeared to be UFO&#39;s than appeared and this continued for about 10-15 before I went in figuring there must be a reason for this and maybe just the other planes were quiet<n>

I was holding the ladder while he was securing the lights on the gutter around his front door. The sky was clear except for a few high level clouds.  I heard a passenger jet flying overhead and looked up to see it pass.  The part of the sky I was looking at was &#34;framed&#34; by the house structure so when I looked up I only had a brief sighting of the jet but my eye suddenly caught the outline of some other kind of craft that appeared to be much higher than the jet I had just seen.  I looked at it for a second not knowing what it was but trying to identify it.  As I was watching it, it remained stationary but appeared to rotate or move constantly in one place.  As it moved or rotated I could see that it was triangular, in appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my son if he saw it and he said yes.  He, at first, thought it was a satellite, star or a planet but after watching it for awhile, we both noticed it wasn&#39;t moving across the sky.  Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t have any binoculars or other means to view it any closer. I asked him how he would describe it and he said it looked either triangular or rectangular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both looked away for a few minutes to gather some other lights to hang on the house and when we looked up to view the object again, it had vanished.  We could not locate the object again.  I remember commenting to my son that if it had been a satellite or planet, it wouldn&#39;t have simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It&#39;s shape resembled something similar to a cheveron, which is what led me to believe an airplane had it&#39;s wings on fire.  There was still a firey haze engulfing the full circumference, but it was brightest on the outer sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was almost coming down completely vertically, but was offset about 15 degrees; say about 255 degrees if a circle was used as a reference in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It burned for about 4-5 seconds, and then disappeared when it was about 3 seconds from impact with the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t disappear into the horizon; there was still room left in the sky for it to descend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no audible sound in the sky (I took my headphones off in awe after seeing it for the first couple seconds) and there was no impact sound or feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Truely amazing.<n>

The Sun was still rising on the right side of the vehicle, so both the yellow sphere of light and the sun were in view.  The object was roughly 10-15 miles ahead of me, and from that distance, it appeared slightly larger than the appearance of the Sun, so I would estimate it was about 1-1 1/2 miles in diameter.  I kept the object in sight until I went around a curve, then I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 2:30-3:00am when we were going down 248 when my one friend sitting up front passenger side is staring up in the sky and ask me and my friend who is driving, &amp;quot;what the hell is that?&amp;quot; I did not thing much of it because he is known to joke a lot.  But after repeating it again with alertness in his voice i finally lean forward in between the front seats and see this massive disk flying low probably about 100-200ft from the tree line on the mountain right near the radio tower on top of the mountain. I would say this craft was about 50-100 yards in diameter. These were not only strange lights i saw, but i saw the whole undercarriage in detail due to the light that reflected from the treeline onto the bottom of the ship.  this ufo honestly was not of this world and seemed as if it was crashing due to a flame behind it a! nd its angle which seemed as if it would crash over this mountain next to 248. the craft seemed to be malfunctioning due to the fact that it would be flying along at an angle towards the ground, Completely vanish, then reappear in its normal path.  I could see the treeline on top of the mountain glow green from the underside of this craft which was emitting this light. On the underside there was inner rotating multiple lights with a big round light in the middle. picture a wide hulla hoop going clockwise and another hulla hoop going counter clockwise but with different colored lights.  I never had a feeling like that before and i will never forget what i saw. we were so convinced the craft crashed over the mountain we went searching for it but came up empty handed because we could not find the radio station where the craft was near. After this experience i could not keep my eyes out of the sky. for weeks after this sighting i noticed a large increase in helicopters around t! hat area which is uncommon because it is not a heavily populat! ed area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i would say about 10 helicopters patrolling this small area which struck me as very odd considering what i saw. i did not contact police because i knew they would just shrug off my call as a hoax, nor did i even know that i should contact anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I would willingly testify under oath that the following information is true, correct and complete:  At approximately 3am CST, while driving Eastbound on Interstate 70, at approximately milepost 129 (within the jurisdiction of Trego County, Kansas), an object which I can best describe as two spheres about 20 feet or so in diameter, connected to each other by some type of rectangular device, dimensions unknown.  The object had no discernable color, and my high beam headlights seemed to partially become obsorbed by the craft and part of the white headlight field simply illuminated the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my very brief encounter, all told about 6 seconds, I could also not visualize any portholes, antennas, doors or other openings or protrusions.  My bearing to the craft I am estimating to be 35 feet AGL (above ground level) and about 35 to 50 feet horizontally from my vehicle.  My angle of view out of the windshild was between 30 and 45 degrees upon initial visual contact and, of course, became markedly closer, as I estimate our closing speed to be around 175 mph...I was driving 75 mph and I believe the craft to be crusing at around 100 mph (this is a purely conjectural guess on my part).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note that the very first thing I did was to telephone the McConnell AFB Command Post (located in Wichita, KS), and inquire as to any Military air traffic of any kind in this area, such as Medivac flights, other Helos or fixed wing aircraft of any sort in the known military inventory.  The Airman I spoke to at the Command Post also volunteered that no Civilian Air Traffic was aloft at that time, at my location, either.  I also spoke with a Sgt.**** at the Trego County Kansas Sheriff&#39;s department, who checked the comm traffic logs from that time and found no other reports.  He WAS, however, very interested, and did not believe I was anything but honest, truthful and forthcoming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is varied.  I worked for one year as a NASA contractor, on the CCMS program (Checkout, Control and Monitoring Subsystems) in the very early 80&#39;s, for the Space Shuttle Mobile Launch Pad, where we designed and tested cutting edge electronics for the Mobile Launch Pad...equipment which handled all data from the Orbiter and Astronauts, and sent that data to both Mission Control and to the Firing Room at the Cape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assisted in some elementary designs, and built, along with the other Techs in the lab, the initial prototypes of all the equipment for CCMS, and then, working with the design Engineer, debugged the equipment and finally produced wiring and assembly lists of instructions for the production department.  Note that a good deal of our Prototype Equipment went into use  without building other production models.  My last assignment was to completely revise the &#34;Approved Parts List&#34;, actually consisting of two seperate released engineering documments...one containing all mechanical hardware (such as nuts, bolts, etc) and the other containing all electronic parts approved for use in the program.  These docs went to all NASA facilities working with CCMS/Orbiter projects, and finally to other contractors and subcontractors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE Note that I have an Electronics background, first as an Electronics Technician,  and then later migrating to Field Service/Engineering for a large electronics firm, working in both the US and Canada. I am also an Amateur (Ham) radio operator and I am an Ordained Minister possessing a Doctor of Divinity Degree. I am also a &#34;backyard&#34; astronomy buff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, Whatever this object was, I have no clue, neither do the Air Force folks or the local law enforcement personnel I spoke with (from two Kansas Counties) before writing this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Respectfully Submitted.  All data in this report is true and correct to the best of my recollection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at some length via telephone, and we were impressed with his sincerity and credibility as a witness.

My oldest was sleeping and we didn’t want to wake her up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had shut off the headlights and was trying to figure out how to dim the radio lights when out of my peripheral vision, I saw what I thought was an airplane streak from my front left to front right, almost above my vehicle.  This craft was flying very quickly at cloud level and could be seen in between two puffs of clouds on a partly cloudy night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had only briefly locked into the object when it entered into another big cloud and that was all I saw. This happened very quickly, a second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it didn’t register as anything unusual since my immediate focus was elsewhere.  Since my wife was talking with her brother, I was able to think about what I had seen. I’d spent my first three years in the Army at Fort Bragg, next to Pope AFB, where a lot of F-16s,  A-10s, and cargo planes such as the C-5 and then the new C-17 flew.  I had spent some time at Seymour Johnson AFB guarding cargo next to its runway and had intimate understanding how loud F-15s were.  When I was a kid growing up in Southern Wisconsin, C-130s flew over our house nap of the earth and so I knew how loud they were, what sound they made, and how much slower they were than fighter jets.  I spent a lot of time in C-130s and C-141s at Bragg as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I realized was that at that low of an altitude and at that speed, the only thing it could have been was a fighter jet hauling butt.  However, I know that fighter jets are not allowed to fly so low at those speeds over populated areas.  It was much too fast to be a C-130 or similar type of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the most distinctive fact that struck me, was that when this object flew over, it made no sound. Even in a minivan with engine running, the sound of a fighter jet going that fast that low would have been deafening.  I would have just heard it approach before seeing it, and heard it even longer after it passed over.  Instead, nothing at all.  No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then realized that I might have seen a UFO.  I couldn’t have been sure in the moment, but after analyzing all the facts, it couldn’t have been any known aircraft.  It wasn’t a satellite because they don’t fly under the clouds.  I thought it might have been a meteor, but this flew at a straight horizontal path.  I’m no meteor expert, but the ones I’d seen always came at some angle to the horizon, are usually higher up in the sky, and appear whitish, not the orange light I’d seen.  If it were that close, wouldn’t I have heard something?<n> <n><n> <n><n> FYI, I spent 13 total years in the Army, about half on active and half in the Guard.  I started as ranger qualified paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne (11B) and finished as a Signal Corps officer within V Corps with one tour in Iraq.  I was with the 32nd Infantry BDE WIARNG between those two Active Duty stints.  I am currently a small business owner in a small MN town and only talk about my UFO sightings with people I trust or if someone else admits they saw one, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw my first UFO sighting as a young teen and posted that experience in the WI area.  I grew up in a fundamental Christian home, so this is not something I&#39;m suppose to believe in.  However, I can&#39;t deny and can&#39;t explain what I&#39;ve seen.<n>

The rate of speed, if a jet would have made this object low enough to make quite profound engine noise.

They were blinking as two different lights one after the other making it look like two helicopters or planes moving together. But the time was 7:00 pm and it was dark as night so i realised there cant be some air show etc. After crossing baranala city and travelling almost 20 km from initial place of sighting. I could see those lights were not only one . So we pulled over near the village of sherpur and came out to see the lights clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights now were sufficiently apart. And suddenly i realised there was another 2 lights  placed somewhere between those two lights which blinked in a non orderly fashion. As we were watching two passing by persons also stopped to look at what we were pointing at. And also made me notice there was another red light which was further away from both almost in centre . And than another light started to blink which seemed to be on the opposite of the two. Making it look like a triangular shaped thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to stress as we could see it from far away it was very very high and it should have been no less than a 1km long plane. And when i observed that with moving from one place to another while watching these lights , i clearly saw that the part between these three rectangularly placed lights i couldnt see background stars!! So it was something solid like a plaine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And above all i couldnt believe why i did not stay there to watch it go . We saw for 15 minutes it was standing still. Than we kept on going on the road and from 20 kms i kept on looking behind till i could see them no more. I couldnt believe what i saw and i couldnt believe that how could i move from that place even when it was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a army air divcision in that area and it was almost exactly over that. Still i dont claim to know why it was there. But as i saw it  ibelieve in it. And i will now on keep a camera but i doubt if i will ever get a chance to record it .The sighting lasted for almost 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am waiting for news paper tommorow lets see if we get any news on that i will scan that send you. Thanks! I am now convinced these things are not only in America but in India and perhaps every part of the world. It is so foolish to see that developed countries and its people believe less in them. And there is nothing that can describe or make u imagine. But once you do look in skies and one day find out you will know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was at about a 45 degree point in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i watched it appear suddenly, remain stationary for a few seconds, then zip up and over a few hundred yards, then again the other direction. It disappeared suddenly, then reappeared further away, just left of it&#39;s previous position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved/reappeared, i photographed it.  It is clearly visible. It appears smaller when it is further away, and is fairly horizontal most of the time, then diagonal at one point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun had just set, it was not the sun, or the moon (the moon is visible in the photos, barely a crescent, NOT an oval, not like the object=NOT a camera reflection).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very familiar with lens flare and camera reflection, and it is neither.  I watched the object with my own eyes, between photographing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appears on the photos, 35mm, and negatives, very clearly, and is not a camera or developing error.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location was the beach at Moss Landing, near the Monterey Research Institute, a large power plant, and marina.  When the object was over the ocean, I was facing with my back to the facilities. It was not a reflection or anomilie from either one. At times it appeared to change shape within itself, becoming a sphere within an oval, but it was always a white light, from what I could see, and photographed. There was no noticable sound.<n>

The object had bright white lights, and also had red and blue lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object stayed in the NW sky, but I saw it move sideways, not like a plane.  I ran in the house and got my camera and took some pictures.  The object stayed in approximately the same place for an hour or so.<n>

The jet was flying at an altitude that still allowed its shape to be discernable.  I am not sure if it was a commercial or military jet.<n> <n><n> The jet was laying out quite a good con-trail, (that&#39;s what caught my attention.) The jet was traveling from east to west/southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed the object. It appeared to be at the approximate same altitude as the jet, and perhaps within a quarter of a mile from the jet. Its relative position to the jet was rearward and to the left, (from my perspective). I brought it to the attention of the other two people with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be stationary. It was round in shape, metallic. It was very silvery and shiny. It remained stationary, and then after a short time, it began to pace the aircraft.  But, the jet slowly gained distance, as the UFO was traveling at a slower speed.  It remained off to one side and rearward of the aircraft as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had enough time to gain access to my garage and retrieve a pair of binoculars.  I observed the object through binoculars for perhaps 30 seconds. It was definately round, perhaps &#34;ball-like&#34;.  I was able to definately observe that there were no wings or other protrusions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On what would appear to be the bottom were two lights.  One was large and white and very bright.  I mean very bright! The other was much smaller and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was very discernable through the binoculars, and WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE OR JET!,  It was round.  It could have been a disc, but it really seemed to be ball-like orb...at least from my viewing position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total time viewed was at least two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it was no longer in sight.  I cannot describe its departure.  We could just no longer find it in the sky.<n>

It was a clear sunny day.  I was facing East and thought I saw a flock of birds. They were in the North East travelling South West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned South to face towards Sydney and realised the objects were not flapping and were travelling too fast to be birds. They were some distance away but I would estimate them to be approximately 25 feet in diameter each.  I already had my camera raised and took a photograph.  Other than that motion I seemed to be paralysed with wonder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I recovered sufficently to call out to other beachgoers, the objects had vanished in the direction of Umina.  By the time I reached home I decided I had imagined the objects but when I looked at my photographs for the day I found the photograph of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The colour of the objects was a dark grey or black.  Their shape was similar to a cigar shape.  I would estimate them to be approximately 25 feet in diameter each.  They were utterly silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The height of the objects was perhaps a little lower than 100 feet.  Their speed was 90 to 100 kilometres per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work at management level in the government.<n>

I walked down the steps of the lodge (the wilds) and saw something in the sky.  I asked my brother and his girlfriend if they saw the same thing, they did.  We watched for 45 mins before deciding to get someone else. But we did we got other people with binoculars and even ones with cameras.  (funny how the ones with cameras and night time vision sudendly didn&#39;t work, but when they were inside they did...hmmm)  Anyway, we ALL saw something in the sky that was flashing red green and white lights. It was not like an airplane at all because it was staying in the same spot, sometimes moving up or down in weird pusulations, and then they looked like they were doing figure eights, but in the same spot.  It moved in such a  way that i can not describe in words, I know what I saw.  The next night my brother tried to tell me that it was Juipter and blah blah blah.  But when I looked at Juipter, it did not have the same thing going at all as the night before.  i know what I saw, and I have other people that will admit it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of Sirius, we suspect.

At first sight I thought of  an antenna light, but this light was much too bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached the end of the road I was on I realized that the light was very close. I was at a &#34;T&#34; section where the road I was on ended at a small county road. There’s a house directly across from where I was stopped at the stop sign.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light looked to be directly over the house. I thought it looked kind of like the house owners had installed a flood light on an antenna, but the light was much too bright it looked as if it were a couple hundred feet above the house at most.. I got out of my car to study the light. The light the slowly rose maybe another hundred feet or so stopped climbing and began to move forward towards me at a very slow rate. As the light passed directly over me I could make out the shape, it had 3 points that I could make out (like a 3 point star) with a few dimmer lights on the underside of it. The bright light that I had been seeing seemed to be on the front side of the object pointing straight ahead. The object was only a few hundred feet above me at most. There was absolutely no sound what so ever from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued on its course for about a minute when it suddenly changed direction and speed away at a very high rate of speed. It was out of my sight in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very familiar with civilian aircraft as well as many military aircraft.

The separated objects would also blink in unison with each other.  After only about a second at the most these separated objects would then instantaneously combine back into one object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as that one was gone we both sighted another object similar to the last one, only this object was much higher in to sky and we were unable to see much detail.  This object was also blinking and was not moving.  After we passed this object we sighted another one, and continued sighting more as we moved along the freeway.  I&#39;m guessing that we sighted around 10 of these objects, but it could have been more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not take a picture of the first object, but my friend did get some pictures of the other objects.

It was angled straight up and down. And no streaks or movement at all.   It hung, a rectangle, above the far hill.  It sparkled like a rhinestone rectangle.  Just hung there sparkling with a perfect perimeter of a rectangle.  Neat as if you had drawn in with a ruler. Bright.  Sparkling. White.  Rectangle.  Fatter than the width of a falling star. It was higher than a house above the far hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wanted to bring my husband from another room but afraid it would be gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not diminish in brightness, size.  It did not waver, wiggle.  After about 20 or 30 seconds it vanished.  Instantly.  Was there, one split second it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Ohio State Patrol, the Lisbon Police Offrice, the Columbiana Sherriff&#39;s department.  They all had no reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where I saw it was just about where I see the plume of exhaust in the daytime from Shipping Port Nuclear Plant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later, in morning, maybe about 7am or so there was a strange light trail (up from the ground I thought) near that area.   Right then, there were a lot of calls in to radio station by respectable people who had seemed to see it from the sky downward, I think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

They were hovering.  Hovering right before our eyes.  They looked like little sad teardrops that the moon had just recently cried.  Like he had just got dumped by his girlfriend venus.  We suddenly panicked and ran around screaming.  My husband ran into our barn wall, broke his femur, and peed his pants.

I figured it was one of those.  Its light was certainly too bright to be an airplane, and it was instant-on, instant-off like an LED, but really bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was bluish-white much like an LED flashlight.  It was probably as bright as the water tower flasher in Seneca Falls… but this was no water tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flash was moving westbound above the interstate.  Within a four or five flashes,  probably five seconds (it wasn’t flashing quite every second) it was passing over us.  It must have been a bit north of the thruway because I could see it by looking out of the driver’s window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights reflected off of some type of metallic silver body of the craft, but I was unable to get a good grasp of shape or size.  My eyes were confused just looking at it.  It seemed to be triangular with two lights at each point of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Leaning towards the window and looking straight up, I was hardly watching the road at this point.  Good thing there wasn’t a lot of traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not any passenger airplane, that’s for sure.

I saw red and white lights in the sky.  They looked like radio towers or cell towers but they were too high to be either.  At first I thought, &#34;how in the world could they have put up radio or cell towers sudddenly without my noticing it?&#34;  I walked quickly to try to see where they were really located, knowing there were no hills or mountains around where they could be mounted upon.  The morning was foggy and cold, not sure what the temperature was but there was frost on windshields so I&#39;d guess maybe 30 degrees.  I wondered if cold fog could create mirages where objects looked displaced from their actual physical location.  As I walked further east, trying to get a good look at them without bare trees in the way they were always behind the trees, meaning that they moved to the north slightly as I walked.  I can&#39;t remember for sure but it seemed like maybe 3 red lights and one white light with what looked like tower structures below them (beams?).  I headed south trying to get a look at them without bare trees in the way andd as I walked south they were still behind the trees, maybe 10-15 degrees above the horizon.  When I finally got to a point where I should have had a good view of them they disappeared.  As I drove to work I looked to see if there were any mountains or hills in the area where radio/cell towers would have been mounted just to check to make sure.  There were none.  As I said, it was a foggy morning since the Yakima River has fog over it on cold mornings this time of the year.  But the light/towers were well above the the height of the fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Follow up on report about red and white lights on what looked like radio towers; they were radio towers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The report I filed yesterday on the red and white lights turned out to actually be radio towers.  The fog must have played tricks with these making them appear much higher in the sky.  Apologies for reporting something that turned out to be simply radio towers.<n>

I took the pic and when I enhanced it. It looks somewhat like lighting. BUt there was none. When I put the camera back to the sky to have another look though the lens I could see something moving. Up and down with great speed. I started to duck because it looked as if it were getting closer. I sent the pics to national tv and to some friends and here.

House faces the Rio Grande river and I saw lights that went up and down behind the mountain to the east. At first it looked like a series of white tubes or tiny flourescent lights. Woke my wife for her to have a look and she said get the camera. I got the digital camera but I could not see the lights in it. I asked my wife to come outside and verify what I was seeing. She did and it was still there. Then I got binoculars and went out on the dock for a look. I could see an array of colors which resembled a 4th of July sparkler. The UFO was surrounded in a cloud or mist. Very different from a star and the sky was cloudless. Getting cold, I went back inside and moved a chair to the window and kept watching for at least 45 minutes, going outside twice for a better look and observing another UFO, not quite as bright to the north. Initially I saw this one with the other when I took pictures. I kept watching to see what would happen and kept the binoculars as steady as possible observing that I had to adjust when the craft moved up or to the side which it did quite often. Many colors were visible including blue, red, green, yellow and white. It would move further away from me toward the east then come back and then white lights became more visible within this cloud or mist in which it was travelling. The other craft was similar but smaller and was not as dominant so I paid less attention to it. The land across the Rio Grande is private and there is a road where I sometimes see a car but this UFO was above the mountains. It was larger than any star, much different and had colored lights appearing to me to be circular. Also at times it displayed very erratic movement, zig-zagging across the sky. I kept expecting it to disappear or move off at the speed of light but it did not and the display became quite monotonous.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am used to observing satellites with the naked eye (it’s pretty rural out here on this island)  and had it not been for seeing the three appear in roughly the same point in the sky and then begin to zigzag across the sky in three completely different directions, flashing brightly as they moved... I might have thought nothing of it.  I suppose they could have been satellites, they could have been reflecting the sun... I don&#39;t know about the zigzagging and originating in the same place and moving opposite though.... sure was strange.  These were high in the sky, not a chance they were aircraft. They were definitely not meteors either…  Weird stuff.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were going over the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan and about half way over the bridge we saw a flash in the sky at about the 2 o&#39;clock position in the sky facing east. The closest thing I can think of describing this is a flash of lightning. It was almost like a flash from a camera comming from the middle of the night sky. There were no clouds in te sky, there was no rain or thunder and was&#39;nt hot enough for heat lightning, being that it was alost Thanksgiving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both saw this and we were both taken back by this. This did&#39;nt happen again on the drive back to Staten Island that night. We kept looking up in the sky to see if we can see it again. The part of the sky we saw this flash in was not obstucted by apartment buildings or any other structures. This was a clear view off the bridge facing south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

You might already know this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently while looking at the night sky I noticed what appeared to be a star fluctuating between red and blue twinkles.  I am no astronomy buff, but I recognize mars and I can recognize a star generally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My and my father&#39;s reaction was alike, we both seemed to notice this &#39;star&#39; on the same night, and notice how it did not appear to have the usual colors of a star, plus its &#39;twinkle&#39; was disproportionate to the other stars in the sky that night, as well as other stars I had seen in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in the Southern sky, at about a 35 degree angle from the ground.  I have noticed a similar object in the eastern sky as well.  Generally these objects tend to be the lowest &#39;star-like&#39; objects in the horizon, which leads me to believe that it IS in fact a star, and that the swirling of the atmosphere appears more intensely upon the starry sky background when it is lower in the horizon, rather than when one looks straight up.  Despite this simple explanation, this object could be easily mistaken for something unusual.  Just thought I&#39;d offer this as a theory in case similar sightings had been reported but not substantiated as having an alien basis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> thanks for reading<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of the star, &#34;Sirius.&#34;  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was a clear night. There was suddenly a bright flash that lit up the whole sky-like lightning, except there were no clouds and no thunder followed. We both looked up in the sky and were searching for the source of the flash, when I saw an object moving slowly in a East-South East direction. To me the object appeared to be see-through, as I could barely tell it was there at first. It seemed to blend in with the dark sky and the stars. But, as it moved there were a few lights on the bottom and I knew I was no longer looking at stars. It was huge (If I hold a ruler 12&#34; from the bridge of my nose, the object would have been at least 4&#34; long x 3&#34; wide.) I asked my husband if he saw it and he said he did. As it moved away from us, it gained in speed and in an instant was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have waited almost 2 months to report this due to the strange weather we&#39;ve been having in the area. My husband and I discussed what to do, and we decided to wait and see if it came back. Shortly after this sighting we were struck with a &#34;freak&#34; snowstorm and internet service was knocked out for 4 days. Then, last month, we had 2 severe wind storms, which we are still dealing with the damage from; and again we lost internet service for 5 days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, thanks to calm weather this week, I am finally able to report what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They looked to be Id guess 10 miles away. Just a guess.Instincts told me instantly that this was strange.Ran as to the house to get daughter to witness but the objects were gone already.Couldnt have been more than 15 or 20 secs.Called the radio station and a lady had just called in wth the same report.Started asking persons I met daily if they saw any lights in the sky around that date.Have to date found 2 other persons that saw them.One said he didnt want to tell anyone about them because of the possible stigma.He was obviously shaken by the event.Only possible explaination was flares from a military aircraft but that would seem a little out of place for them though in this area.Difinetly not meteor.Objects were either still or moving very very slowly.<n>

I saw this ball of light or fire drip a small ball of fire or something.  You can see my report filed on 11-12-06.  Earlier today whole playing baseball I saw an f-15 jet fly pretty low over Long Beach.  I had a feeling something was up.  I had a feeling the last thing I saw was military.  Around 6pm I went out on the balcony to get some fresh air.  I noticed the normal air traffic coming and going near LAX.  I then saw these red lights flashing unlike the other planes.  I called my roommate to take a look and he also agreed that it was not an airplane.  We saw a group of lights moving about the speed of an airplane moving in a NW direction.  It seemed like it was flying along the coastline.  The lights would flash in random intervals. There where no other lights but about 4 red lights.  It could have been one craft, the lights moved as if it where one.  The size would have been huge, maybe miles wide! It was about as wide a 4 finger width, if you put your hand in front of you. We saw this thing continue north and finally disappeared in the horizon.  I went inside for a few minutes.  When I cam back out it had come back a bit like it turned around but was heading in he same direction again.  The lights would flash in random order.  It seems there where two on the outside and two closer to the middle.  The light flash was very bright and precise. These were not normal lights.  I would also guess the craft was in a v shape bcuase of the way the lights moved. I kept looking in the sky after it had gone.  I noticed some flashing lights again but this time it seems like an airplane.  I thought it could have been a military jet because the way the lights flashed where different than the other airplanes.  Later I saw a bright light approaching outside of the normal flight path.  Then the light turned off and I saw the same type of airplane lights that I saw after the red lights passed by.  I really think this was a military jet escorting ! or looki ng fir the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my second sighting of something strange in the sky within 2 weeks.  I have never seen anything strange before in my life.  I am college educated.  I also have really good eyesight.  I am glad my roommate was there.   I think he finally believed me about the thing I saw earlier in the week.  It seems like there has been a lot of activity going on in the LA area recently. I hope other people saw this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I had just stepped out to look at the evening sky, when I noticed the fireball slowly dropping, almost straight down. It did not glitter or fluctuate in intensity like other fireballs and meteors I have seen, nor did it leave any trail that I could determine. Its diameter appeared to be about that of a pea held at arm&#39;s length. It disappeared behind Mt. Rubidoux, which is just west of my location. What seemed odd was the very slow speed of the fireball, the lack of a trail, and the consistency of brightness. It did not resemble any meteor or fireball I have ever seen. It was definitely NOT fireworks of any sort. There were a number of airliners and private planes visible in the sky at the time, most likely there are other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was unusually bright (brighter than an approaching aircraft with landing lights on at several miles distance) and appeared, perhaps, to break apart just as it went out of view behind a tree.  Of the handful of meteors I’ve seen in my life this was the brightest and most impressive, particularly since it was late dusk and the sky was not yet completely dark.  The color appeared to my eye as white and did not change.  The entire time from when I first noticed a bright light in my peripheral vision to when I looked over and watched it as it moved out of my view (behind a tree) was most likely less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After my report on November 18, 2007, of three spheres over the Phoenix skies.  I became exited and intrigued about my coincidential UFOs sighting; thus I started to keep a watchful eye more frequently on the skies.  Also, since my first sighting happened at 3pm during the day, I only watch the sky during the day; not having the need to watch at night, since night observations make easier to confuse ordinary lights with UFOs. ******** SUNDAY NOVEMBER 19, 2006 ********** Still excited about the sighting on the previus day; while my wife and daughter went to church, I stayed home, I went to the backyard around 1pm, at the beginning I didn&#39;t see anything, but after 10 minutes of watching, I could see a white spec to the North at 80°, after a little while it became more visible since it descended more becoming a metallic sphere, the altitude was higher than the flight of a commercial airline plane.  The sphere travelled for 3 minutes Southbound until it dissapeard and it was reflecting the sunligh in flicks giving the impression of being a rotating object... ********* THURSDAY NOVEMBER 23, 2006 ******** We went to Tucson, AZ to spend Thanksgiving with relatives... We arrived to Tucson on Wednesday night, and on Thursday around noon while the Turkey was being prepared I went outside to my relatives&#39; backyard; The house is located in South Tucson close to Irvington Road and Benson Highway... The day was a nice with some light clouds on the skies; and again after watching for a while, I was facing Southwest and I saw this bright metallinc, aluminum like, sphere coming down slowly from the clouds at 60°; I called my cousin&#39;s boyfriend and he put his sunglasses on and we could see the UFO flying high from Southwest to Northeast towards the Catalina mountains until it dissapeared without descending.  We could see this object for around three minutes and again, it appeared to have a rotating motion, since the sunligth w! ould ref lect on its body and flicker once in a while.  ********* SUNDAY DECEMBER 10, 2006 **********  I was in my house, located in West Phoenix, watching TV.  I could hear a helicopter&#39;s noise flying low in the neighborhood; I came outside to the backyard, and noticed that the helicopter was two blocks East of my house; flying in circles; it was giving orders to someone on the ground thru the speakers; then I turn my sight Northeast at 75° and saw this metallic sphere stationary way up there, I went inside to get my wife, but she didn&#39;t want to come out, because she&#39;s tired of me looking for UFOs; when I came outside again, the spehere was not in there anymore, then I turned North-Northwest and I found it at a much lower altitude at 45°, and I definitely could appreciate an oval shape and reflecting sunlight, I ran inside the house to get a videocamera; a cheap Panasonic Mini DV53, when I came outside the UFO wasn&#39;t in there anymore and the helicopter had moved four blocks south of my house and it still was flying in circles.  I look around for a while, and turned my head up 90°, and there it was right above me.  I tried to focuse it with the videocamera but it wasn&#39;t in there anymore; I looked for it and I found it East at 75° and it had ascended; I wasn&#39;t able to get a shot of it, but it definitely was in there; I finally got tired and went back into the house; The event lasted at least 10 minutes....  ********* WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 13, 2006 *********   I went to pick up my 6 years old daughter at school, she gets released at 2:40pm, I always get there 10 to 15 minutes early, and while I wait for her, I scan the skies looking for &#34;my friends&#34;, it was a nice day, sunny with a few light clouds, at 2:39pm, I noticed the metallic sphere appear East-Northeast at 75°; there&#39;s always a bunch of people picking up theird kids, and I watch around to see if anyone notices what I&#39;m watching; noone is watching, I assume noone is into this, noone would care.  The UFO travelled right above us as I picked my daughter, it took ! around t wo minutes since it appeared and dissapeared on its path...  ******** SUNDAY DECEMBER 16, 2006 ********** My brother and his family came to visit, it&#39;s been over a month since I&#39;ve been watching the skies looking and spotting UFOs, and he&#39;s not aware of my activity yet...  He needed some tools because he was going to do some work on his car; I was on the driveway getting tools out of my car; I noticed the UFO East at 80°, my brother came out, then I tell him, about some events over the last month, he scratches his hair, by now the UFO has moved farther East and it&#39;s visible at 45° over my neighbors tree. I didn&#39;t tell him about it, and then he spot it, and he asked &#34;Like that one?&#34;. I just smiled and replied to him, &#34;Yes, just like that one&#34;. ******** I must disclose that since the first sighting I&#39;ve watch similar UFOs in at least 9 different times; however, since the time my brother saw that one, I&#39;m not able to see one more sighting.  Also, I&#39;ve been able to find video of similar sightings...  check them and judge for yourselves....

The lights maintained the same heading and did not break formation or streak like a shooting star.  The lights seemed very far away and were sort of dim, not bright and piercing like plane lights, but more like the glow of a low watt bulb.  Although the lights were travelling at a high altitude, they crossed the sky in seconds.  I did not witness any vapor entrails but it was night and the city lights in the distance did not allow for a good star-watch night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To imagine what the lights look like, make an upside down check mark.  The three points of the check mark would signify a light, but the long side had three lights evenly spaced.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My husband and I were sleeping and awoke suddenly without cause.  Our bedroom was illuminated in a pale blue glow.  For a split second I though our neighbors were outside and heir car lights were on, but he glow was much too bright to have been car lights.  Both my husband and I were unaccountably terrified.  All my hair was standing on end. I was too scared to turn and look out the window, I just felt like something was out there and looking at it would be horrible. we kept hearing a strange sound repeat itself over and over.  It was a high pitched &#34;ping...ping.&#34;   It would echo and fade and then repeat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We finally looked out the window and saw a huge blue orb hovering stationary above the tree line.  He feeling this experience gave us was so extreme.  I really can&#39;t explain it in a way that makes sense.  We knew that the orb was something &#34;other.&#34;  We strongly felt that we were being observed, scru! tinized.  Our skin was tingling all over, vibrating kind of.   We turned away from the window and tried to ignore, but we couldn&#39;t shut our eyes because idea of closing our eyes with that strange light in the room and the orb so close outside was just terrifying eventually the noise stopped and the light faded away.  We turned to look and the orb was gone.   It was totally silent outside.  Our cat would not come in the room and didn&#39;t stop staring at the window for a while.  We have never found out what that orb was but we have spoken to several others who saw it that same night, but at different locations.  His orb was not far out in the atmosphere; it was literally right outside our window, just above the trees.  It was approximately 40 times the size of a basketball.  About a year after that we were walking through a park late in the evening, I don&#39;t remember exactly what time, between 7 and 9.   We saw the orb again but only for a second, then it vanished and there was a loud &#34;boom,&#34; like thunder but it couldn&#39;t have been because it w! as snowi ng.  The power went out immediately after. It was so eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We returned to our patio several times throughtout the night to track it&#39;s movement.  It was clearly not a satelite, due to the fact that it moved in several different directions.

The light was white with some orange. I assumed they were a group (?!) of satellites - but they seemed too bright for this (more like search beams from very high helicopters). There was no noise.

Sky was clear. Facing east and watching for falling stars since meteor shower was suppose to be visible later that night. Off to the left, slightly, there was a boomerang shaped object. It looked mostly gold though it had an almost luminescent quality to it. It reminded me of mylar ballon material. From my point of reference it looked like the size of typical passenger airplane. It moved with no noise toward the south, then seemed to waver (like looking over radiator as heat rises) and disappeared. Whole event lasted 30-60 seconds.

We saw this in an opening in the trees for about 5 seconds.  I think I saw a small light next to it but it may have been a star. I stopped my truck as we both said what the - is that? As I stopped my truck we lost it through the trees.  I backed up but we could not locate it again. We both looked at each other and my wife said lets go to the trailer.  I backed up further (much further than original sighting) but could not locate the lights.  I decided to go to the RV.  I put the kids in the trailer and my wife went in to eat (we went out for food).  I stood outside and looked for the lights.  I felt strange, like I was sure I saw a ufo but like I didn&#39;t care enough to keep looking or something.  I heard and saw the ligths of several jets, the blinking lights of the jets illuminated the trees.  I&#39;m sure they were jets and not large aircraft.  I went in the trailer and ate.  We heard more, or the same jets again and I said to my wife &#39;more jets&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife seemed uncomfortable with what she saw and didn&#39;t say anything.  Before seeing this we had heard several loud (strange) noises in the woods that sounded like an extremly large jackhammer.  They were brief, but loud and powerful, I&#39;ve never heard anything like them.  I don&#39;t know if they were related but we did not hear the noises again after the sighting and we heard it at least 10 times between Friday night and Saturday before the sighting.<n>

We took a blanket with us to spread it on the grass.  There was a lot of people at the park, and we opted for a tree apart from the rest of the people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After having lunch we laid on the blanket facing the blue clear sky.  I started scanning the sky for airplanes, and I noticed a small sphere way up there, too high, for a minute I thought it was a balloon; however, as I saw airplanes flying by, I noticed that the sphere was much higher than the airplanes.  The size of the airplanes was tiny, and I could still see the sphere, so it could not be a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere was stationary for a minute then it started moving slowly North in a straight line, I told my wife about it and she was able to see it too... she said &#34;The air up there is dragging the balloon&#34;; however, after several seconds, the sphere reversed direction, now going South slowly.  I told her about it and she said &#34;Well the air changed course up there&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I kept looking the sphere going South, I noticed another sphere positioned much higher, my wife wasn&#39;t able to see it.  And I started to get excited, &#34;Those are not balloons I told her&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere going south reversed direction again, and this time it moved faster Northbound, as it was moving I look farther ahead of it and I could see another sphere at the same speed ahead of the firt one and I lost them in a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turn my eyes back looking for the sphere that I had noticed on a higher altitude, and I noticed that the sphere had come down because I could see it better. My wife was able to see it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my digital camera and took a picture, when I moved the camera away the sphere was gone, when I got home and downloaded the picture, I only could see the blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object seemed to make an aura around the object, inside the fire ball there seemed to be a black metallic object. That we can barely make out, we had theories of a rocket. to missile, to a burning plane, to meteor, but none of those fit the description we just saw. All what we can tell it was descending at a sustained speed towards the Ocean. I showed the video to other people and there was no real answer. But that one comment was said on U tube, that it could be a Jumbo jet? I called the authorites about, they didn&#39;t care much about it until I I mentioned it was on video, then she was willing to transfer my call to security forces and I hung up.<n>

It was brighter than an airplane. While I was driving it seemed as though I was getting closer to it, and I could see that it was in fact three round, white lights that formed a triangle. It was locked in the sky as though it was stationary, and I wondered if it were a radio tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove closer I could see it better. The three lights made a triangle where the point of the triangle was the top light, and two lights were below it geometrically. The lights were very close to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got even nearer, I noticed that while the sky was black, I could make out a darker black in between and around the lights. The lights were definitely attatched to something that was darker than the night sky, although I couldn&#39;t make out that shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unexpectedly, the three lights seemed to turn off, or go out, or even turn around.  In their place was a single, smaller red light that was not as bright as the white lights. I could still see the darker black form, and it appeared the red light was attatched to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, the light started to move away from me.  It was no longer stationary.  All I could see was the red light, and I watched as it flew away, slightly upwards, growing smaller and smaller until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this lasted about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found her to be exceptionally eloquent, in describing her sighting.  We suspect that she is an exceptionally good witness.  We have corresponded with her, to inquire whether she stopped her car, and was stationary, at any time during her sighting.  PD))<n>

This object was very very bright in contrast to the stars in the sky and much larger, however it appeared to be a &#34;star&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very high in the sky and was stationary.  It hadn&#39;t moved once. The object became very bright and then gradually decreased in brightness.  It eventually turned into a small ball of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object at this point was very faint. It then moved to the right(west) (first sign of movement) and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident lasted for about 30 seconds.  It frightened me. I ran inside and told my manager about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Extra Info) I am an Astronomy buff and I view the night sky regularly.

I used a vhs camera rather than a digital becaues I did not want pixelation to interfere with what I was filming.  Some time later I went and bought a dvd vcr player to transfer the film to dvd so I could view it on High Definition big screen TV. From above the bart station in Pittsburg, the view was over the area where the pittsburg power plant was located.  Behind this some distance away sits the Suisin marsh to the left and to the right the Travis Airforce base.  As before the area observed seemed to be floating above the earth, you could see the thermal windmills beneath it.  It seems to be organic in nature and takes up an immense amount of space.  As sunrise advances you can see the sun rising between the earth and this thing, the sun shining behind the thermal windmills.  This particular morning there appeared to be some sort of accident that kept the thing from cloaking.  Before as the sun came up and started over the horizon, you could only see it while it was just rising, after it got up a bit in the sky, it seemed to cloak itself, I caught this on film in July, as soon as the sun hit a specific point, it dissappeared completely, and looked to be a patch of burn off or smog that never leaves no matter what time of day it is.  just an orangeish smear across the sky until the next sunrise.  At first I thought it might be a hallucination caused by plasma or water in the sky reflecting something that was on the earth somewhere, however I have studied the area, even using satellite images of the entire area and can find nothing that looks similar on the ground in a 50 mile radius.  Anyway on this day, what people tried to convince me was a cloud, had an accident that made impact on this &#34;cloud&#34;.  You could still see the thermal windmills underneath this object, but on top of it was definitely a crash site.  There were two spiraling stacks of smoke coming up from the place where it impacted?  Five of the b! igger cr aft we had seen before were &#34;circled&#34; around the crash site.  It was windy that morning, however nothing in that direction was moving with the wind.  The smoke spirals stayed where they were for quite some time.  The other craft which looked like a measure of &#34;jet stream&#34; except they were luminous, and brightly lit, instead of staying flat horizontal to the earth, were all in the sky above the crash site, bovering in one place sitting dexter and sinister to the earth, tilted diagonally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Smaller craft were seen on the film we took of it after slowing it down  to the slowest point we could without going frame by frame, film taken of these before revealed what we could not see because they moved that fast.  Where I could see sparks showing up in the high sky with the naked eye, slowed down you could see they were some type of flying craft, that would enter and leave the larger craft.  I tried to find any news release about activity that morning for several weeks, and finally found a report where they had reported that a flying craft had crashed into the Suisin marsh.  the area of land where we keep seeing these things, are across the Sacramento River, and there is an area there of swamp and island marsh type land where at one time supposedly toxic waste had been dumped.  Whether or not this is true I dont know, it doesnt look healthy.  However that land is still viewed below where the thermal windmills are located.  And since the sun comes up and can be seen between the thermal windmills and whatever it is that floats out there and cloaks itself at sunrise, I am inclined to believe this is something else entirely, and not only that it appears to be organic in nature.  The film caught in July shows structures built on it, towers with strange large ball shaped things stuck to them, and several craft on platforms that tilt diagonally just before they project themselves into the air at such a velocity, all you can see is an instant of a streak accompanied by what may appear to be a spark when the sunlight shines off their hull.  Recently I finally found someone with a large screen HD TV, (A retired school teacher) and I was able to take the film I had saved to DVD with me to view with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This definitely is not a cloud. And there definitely are structures there, and I dont know about the craft, but they look like flattened pac-men, and appear to be a bit beat up, however that may be a part of their camoflauge.  To glance at them if you dont really LOOK at them I suppose some might try to say they were cloud formations, however each one are identical to the other, and it shows several of them &#34;grounded&#34; and several more that take off or dissappear.  With the wind blowing at the rate it was, which you can see by the swaying trees also in the picture, this &#34;cloud&#34; did not move in July, nor has it moved since.  Its like a cloaked organic structure that is always there, with craft that come and go.  It is not Travis Airforce base, nor is it swampgas.  Its not morning afterburn or fog, and its not in a place where there would be a large amount of fog.  I am surprised after my posts that I have not heard any feedback.  My friend who lives at the house where we shot the film also has a lot of footage of this phenomenon, including the craft that crashed and the five surrounding craft that hovered overhead at diagonal stances.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I looked closer, I noticed that there were many flashing white objects perhaps 8-12.  The Objects appeared to be the size of large stars and were flashing a white lights (much like christmas twinkle lights).  I pulled over to get a better look.  I could not determine a specific shape or formation to the lights, however, as the lights moved, the objects stayed in the same position relative to each other.  There is no way these were normal aircraft, they were too close to each other even though the pattern took up a large portion of the sky above the airport.  I went home to get my camera and head back to the airport.  As I approached the airport from the highway, a truck tore into the main entrance ahead of me at a high rate of speed and sped out to the tower.  When I parked at the airport, I could not find the object, and some low clouds or fog had set in and was covering much of the sky.  I could no longer see the object, and got no pictures.  I noted on &#34;normal aircraft&#34; apparently circling the airport, but that could possibly be a normal training flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was sunny and clear.  I looked to my left and there was an object that appeared to be an airplane, but it was pointed downward at about 120 degree angle.  I was concerned because I did not know of an airstrip nearby and the angle looked too severe to be anything but landing.  As I watched, I noticed that it was not descending, but rather flying in a straight direction roughly parallel to me, maintaining a consistent distance from the tree line below it. At that point, my phone rang and I answered it.  After a minute or so I looked over to see where the object had gone and did not see it immediately.  As I scanned the area I saw a dark dot on the horizon and in the matter of a couple of seconds the &#34;dot&#34; grew into the object, as if it had been a great distance away and then shot back to my location.  It then began to travel parallel to me again at the same unusual angle.  At this time the object seemed to flutter and I was able to briefly see that it was disc shaped, no wings, with a smaller, raised, flat area on top.  I could not tell if this part was also disc shaped, but it definitely was not dome shaped.  Throughout the sighting It seemed like the object was slightly blurry despite the fact that the surrounding area was perfectly clear.  The color was dark and metallic looking. I continued to view it for about a minute until the terrain began to get a little hilly and I lost it behind the tree line.  At no time did I hear any noise.  The distance was difficult to guage, but the trees looked to be about .5 miles away.  It appeared to be about the size of a cessna aircraft.  There were no other aircraft spotted at the time.  I am a 42 y.o. behavior specialist with a master&#39;s degreee in counseling from the U of Dayton.  I have been through FBI profiler training and believe I am a fairly astute observer, and I make my living by being a keen observer and using critical thinking, but this was weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

And to that operator telling me it is impossibled to tell how high something is from the ground? Im not giving you an exact measurement. All I do know is that whatever it was, based on the speed, motion and movement this event was taking place at a distance measured in miles as opposed to feet. And to that rude operator who says UFO&#39;s done leave contrails? If I could identify that flying object I wouldn&#39;t be contacting you would I. If it was a small jet or comercial airline flying at high altitude why was it making such stange movements, why did it appear to explode into a bright white arch, how did it morph into a white sphere then grow into a much larger band of white gas? Oh, wait a minute Mr. operator, I thought it was impossible to determine the altitude of a flying object from the ground? High is right, far is right, very unusual is right. At this time is this a Unidentified Flying Object that left contrails (or maybe vapor trails)? Absolutely! Thats why I am doing this. I just hope there is someone out there that can help me identify this flying object.And mr operator, as for all those hoax phone calls from the (760) area code, THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness was observing contrails, but we cannot be certain.

It is small, but not rural and jets fly in and out as well as small aircraft.  It is also in the flight path to the Dallas airport and the DFW airport.  Those planes fly higher.  Usually there are at least 4 visible aircraft in the area (often more at that time of evening), most flying higher in route to somewhere else.  I am an educated person, employed as a software developer for a medium sized software company.  What I saw was higher than any of the planes and moved faster than any I have seen.  I grew up near an airforce base so I have seen some fast aircraft. (even the stealth bomber when it was still secret).  This seemed to be huge because of the altitude it seemed to be traveling.  Mostly what I saw was an outline, like a shadow moving across the sky.  It was too uniform to be a cloud in a jet stream like one of my friends suggested.  It moved approximately south from one side of the sky to another and dissapeared.  I had been lookng at the big dipper when I noticed it.  about a minute later it appeared again moving in the opposite direction.  The shape made me think of a boat moving fast in the water - the front (based on direction) was shaped like the wake a boat would make; the back was similar shape but smaller. The best way I could describe it was if you were standing on the bottom of a lake and a large ship passed over very fast, that is the shape I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live 2 blocks from the airport. As I got closer to home, the clouds caught my attention because they seemed to be shape-shifting without loosing mass or volume. At one point they almost looked like ancient asian symbols. The firt one I could not make out, the second one looked like a perfect mushroom, and the third one looked like a an ancient writing tablet. But what shocked me the most, was that the 3 clouds became oval shaped again! Getting more and more definition as I shorted the distance ariving at home. But what grabbed me the most, was that once all 3 had good oval definition, and a smaller (but still huge) oval cloud detached from underneath one of the biggest clouds in a perfect round/disk shape opening. It seemed to detach, and re-dock back with the other ship. The clouds disipated a few minutes. I could not believe my eyes. But I try to dismiss it myself as just the weirdest clouds I have ever seen in my life! And that&#39;s why I also thought that it will just get dismissed as clouds by anyone else, so I have never shown anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And here is the kicker: I ran to my back yard, and I got to take some amazing pictures of most of the events!!

My sister was in her back yard when she heard a &#34;whooshing&#34; sound, very loud.  She turned to see the B-2 bomber (Stewart Air Force base is just across the Hudson River from her location, so military planes are not unusual) hovering motionless for at least two minutes.  It was very low (maybe a few hundred feet), had no lights at all, and made a whistling, whooshing sound.  She ran into her house to grab her camera, and when she returned to her yard it could be heard, but not seen.   An hour later she saw it a second time, this time moving unnaturally slowly, but not quite hovering, as it made it&#39;s way east.  She took pictures which are yet to be developed.  Three days later the local newspaper ran a picture of the B-2 supposedly taken over Hyde Park, N.Y. (my sister&#39;s hometown) with a short blurb about the bomber flying over the town.  This is the first I&#39;ve heard of the plane being able to hover.  My sister was absolutely sure of this, as she witnessed the craft at very low altitude, less than quarter mile distant for at least two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The B-2 is exactly the shape as the Hudson Valley U.F.O. from the early 80&#39;s, and is entirely similar to countless reports of boomerang, or chevron shaped sightings.  I believe this is significant.  I have never heard of the B-2 being able to hover, yet my sister is a sober and sane person, I believe her story completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sitting out on my back porch around 1:00 A.M., clear sky.  Out of nowhere a bright white-greenish colored object appeared from my right, traveling East to West.  Cannot be sure as to distance, but it was closer than airplanes travel.  It came from East to West, moving too “quick” to be an airplane or shooting star; then came to sudden stop and hovered in place for about 5-10 seconds as its illumination increased to a brighter green (pulsating to a brighter degree illumination) .  The illumination reduced to the level it was when I first observed it, at which time it traveled very quickly to the right, back to the left, then back to the right in an upward direction – then just disappeared into thin air.  I would describe the way this object “exited” as an extremely quick zigzag motion or Z pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything even close to this before.  I used to be skeptical when I would hear people report things like this – but I know what I saw.  I wanted to report what I saw that very night, but did not know exactly who or where to report this.  I learned about this sight earlier today.  Hopefully, there are others who saw this unmistakable and unforgettable event which occurred in either October or November 2006.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At about 8:30 pm, appx, I was in the area of US 60 and Jomax Rd. There, there was a racetrack off to the west side of US 60. Above the lights of the facility, though probably a mile or two beyond, I observed &#34;dancing&#34; lights, which seemed to move up and down. This motion resembled lightning initially, though the sky was absolutely clear. Then, at the top of the &#34;dancing&#34; lights, 9 horizontal lights appeared, then 9 more lights appeared just to the right of those. The width of these horizontal lights were about as wide as a full moon. After 30 seconds or so, they disappeared, and I did not think too much about them, just appeared to be something odd, but distant. Then, a few minutes later, and a few miles further up US60, the horizontal lights re-appeared on the west side of the Highway. Again, they seemed fairly far away, probably 1-2 miles. This time, however, the horizontal lights would blink from left to right, in rapid succession (one at a time). After all 9 lights blinked on the left, they would blink on another object about 1/3 mile to the east. It gave the appearance that there was only one object, but that it would simply move instantaniously from one location to the other. I got this impression because the lights would not blink simoultaneously, just one object at a time. This went on for 3 minutes or so, long enough for me and the car in front of me to slow down to a crawl, and watch the events occur. Finally, they disappear again, only to reappear a little further north, just before the Morristown overpass. Here the lights reappeared. This time, though, the object was very close, at least it seemed. Now, it was close enough for me to faintly make out a shape amongst the now solid, non-blinking lights. The object appeared, from my angle, to be oval shaped. But, the once vertical lights were now elevated in the center. This gave me the impression that the object was actually flat on top and bottom, and round around the! edges ( Disk chaped), but I was just slightly underneath it. Otherwords, if you were to look at a plate from the side at an equal altitude, it would appear flat and straight. But, looking at it from directly underneath, it would appear perfectly round. My view was something in between. But, this third and final sighting lasted a couple of minutes, and the lights appeared steady, and not blinking. Again, the object would appear on the left, disappear, then reappear on the right (a little further away), never illuminating at the same time. But, the object was still, and I had plenty of time to now count the lights, and there were no flashing beacon lights! None whatsoever! By now, I was alone on the highway, and the car in front of me had long sped off. This last sighting was frightening, since I was now alone, and in the vicinity of the object. The object appeared large to me, maybe the size of a blimp. But, it is hard to tell, since I could not judge its&#39; distance from myself. Maybe it is much smaller, but was also much closer? Honestly, I tried to make a good judgement of distance, but I simply do not know, so I hate to specualte on the actual size. The size of a blimp is just the impression I got, so I will go with that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked exactly like the image submitted to your site by the couple from Hutchinson, KS on 10/30/2006. It was a large silent fast moving formation of large dimmed lights. The object flow almost straight overhead. I live close to the Long Beach airport and I see aircraft all the time. This was not any aircraft I’ve ever seen before nor was it on any normal flight pattern for the airport. I could not tell if it was a solid triangle or a V. Living where I do you can’t really see a lot of stars so as it traveled it didn’t pass in front of anything that would define it as a solid triangle or a V.  But there were around 11 to 13 large lights all the same size, color, and brightness. A single light in front and pairs trailing behind spreading apart to complete the V shape. It’s hard to say how high the object was or how big. But if compared to a normal passenger jet, then it was only a few thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(on Highway 71), an unusually bright single light appeared 50 degrees up from my line of sight, near the top of a cluster of clouds. As it became the total focus of my attention, another light of the same type appeared at its right hand side, and then another, and then finally a fourth, creating a perfect straight line. The four lights were the exact same size, same distance from each other (each void space was equivalent to 5 diameters of one light), and had a delay time of two seconds between new illuminations, and moved in unison, as though attached to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, my mind flashed back to images of the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; witnessed a couple years ago. This grouping looked the suspiciously the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights did not illuminate in an &#34;instant on&#34; fashion. They came into view more like high pressure gas lights -- it was a sudden, almost gaseous, burst of light that took a half second or so to evolve to a 100% brightness. The plane of these lights was diagonally tilted with the left hand side lower, and slowly dipped into the clouds as I drove toward it. Because of the cloud&#39;s interference, I couldn&#39;t determine if there was second side suggesting a shaped outline, a la the Phoenix Lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured the only way I was going to see the configuration as a whole was to race past the cloud bank and hope it would still be there. I misjudged. After driving for several minutes, I realized that the clouds were much farther away than I had estimated. The bar of lights eventually moved completely behind them and disappeared. In retrospect, I should have stopped and exited my vehicle for observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cloud bank distance made me consider how huge these lights must have been for they seemed so large at my viewing distance. Each was several hundred times larger in diameter than the brightest star in the sky. Though much distant commercial flight activity could be seen, there appeared to be no military aircraft in the vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was it a craft? Were they military flares? Who knows. But it was nice to have witnessed such a well known Arizona-style configuration as my first sighting...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Because there were three similar doors along the same wall I decided to see how many were study rooms.   The next door also led to a study room, which was furnished using furniture that seemed identical to the first room; a beautiful new large table and chairs.  Taking a few steps backwards, I looked in the window to the first study room again to see if the furnishings in both rooms were identical.   I also noticed the sign above each of the rooms, &#34;STUDY ROOM.&#34;  The first room was a little smaller though.  I was just about to look in the window to the second study room again, when two people walked into it and at the same time a woman came out of the third door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then asked her how many study rooms that branch of the library has and, nodding towards the first study room, she answered, &#34;only that one.&#34;  I  had looked up at the sign above the second door and the areas above both of the doors each had an identical notice posted, &#34;Study Room.&#34;   The wall in the second room was bare and that room was larger.  I use the past tense because when the library employee looked at the wall where both doors had been, the door only to the second study room vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No spaceship seemed present and there was no unusual noise.    But, from previous my experience,  the second study room at my local library branch has not entirely disappeared, its access is strictly controlled.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Two stationery, white circular lights were also observed hovering nearby. We called a neighbor and he also observed the strange lights that eventually moved north, but we could still see them circling the sky for over 2 hours. There were no indications of ground lights beaming upwards into the sky, and there were no mechanical noises of helicopters or other aircraft heard. I took video footage of the formation, but due to the sky being very dark, I couldn&#39;t tell whether my video camera was picking up the circling lights. I will send the video clip within the next couple of days if usable. I need to upload to my computer to see whether the footage was caught.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pulled over and stopped my car to get a better look.  It didn&#39;t look like an airplane, it seemed to be hovering and not really moving.

Its movement was erratic. It would jump about an inch of the sky at a time and leave a slight trail as it went.  As well when it stopped moving it looked as though it snapped into place.  after second and thrid guessing myself i called for my mother to take a look. She as well saw it and its movement. The light eminating off of it was different than starlight,it had a blueish quality to it, the source of light looked to be rectangular but i cant tell for sure.  After staring at the one for some time i noticed another &#34;moving star&#34; with the same movement and blueish hue. theres not much more i can say about the objects other than they were there for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

If I had to guess the number of lights, I would say about 100 to 200 total. The object&#39;s height from the ground was 50 to 100 meters and it seemed to be following our car as I was driving. I say this because the object was exactly above us and it continued like that (spinning and moving from one side of the road to the other side)  for about 5 more minutes approx. The sky had a mild fog so the only thing we (my wife, my son and myself) could perceive were the lights. The diameter of lights was similar to the huge spotlights that you see at events and fancy clubs. There were no clubs or events around that area (this is a rural - farm town). That was the first thing I checked - I&#39;m a diehard skeptic who never believed any UFO stories). I&#39;m concerned as I&#39;ve never seen anything like it so close to me and it scared my family. Unfortunatelly, I did not have any cameras with me so I have no images to prove this event - just my testimony.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly my daughter sighted this object. It was exactly at the center of the sky. Moving at constant speed, going in north to south direction. It was triangular in shape. Two points of the triangle were leading and one point was trailing. Only some part at the corners of this object were dimly lit. It made no sound of any kind at all. After 15 to 20 seconds this object disappeared. This must be flying at much lower hieght may be 4 to 5 thousand feet. After the incidence we independantly sketched this object and our observation did match with each other. We inquired with local authorities and some astro physisists but nobody could explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And in a continuous move, rock left to right very fluidly.  Our driver drove us out of view before we could observe more.  After discussing this with the other passengers, we all agreed that we could also observe searchlights in the sky around this object as it moved.   While not directly on the object, the searchlights were focused in the area around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up into the sky to look for airplanes. I suddenly saw two bright object , they looked something like the headlights of a car. They shot across the sky towards the mountains perfectly even with each other. The lights then merged into each other and became one light just for a second, then they seperated again away from each other like the top of this Y.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They then rapidly disappeared. The obects appeared to be as high as the jets at 30000 feet(there was one not far away).

Appear to travel at same speed as (and resemble) satellites.  These were two lights in close formation.  Initial thought was that they were military fighters.  However the initial speed across the sky was too fast for that altitude (high altitude guessed due to no noise).  Pair remained in perfect formation until they both moved erraticly first away from and then into each other.  The speeds and accelerations were incredible.  Both objects then disappeared out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was driving on the onramp(exit 42) to get onto I-12 west something caught my eye just over the tree tops alongside of the interstate approx. 1/8 of a mile away.  The object was a black triangular(rounded not pointed) object without any lights.  The object appeared to be moving east at a very slow speed or perhaps even hovering about 150/200ft high. The treeline on the west bound side of I-12 where the object was is about 150/200ft away from the interstate.  When I was at the closest point to the object I thought I was looking at a stealth fighter that had the capability to hover.  There was no sound and no movement in the tree tops. I-12 exit 42 is Airport Rd. The airport is approx. 5 miles from the interstate.  It is a small airport that has an Air National Guard unit there so I thought it may have been some type of military craft.  The incident lasted for 8-12 seconds.<n>

I thought it looked like an airplane at first but then the lights changed colors and started moving back and forth and moving like no airplane we had ever seen all while changing colors every 20 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept watching the lights until we lost them behind some trees on the side of the road. Every once in a while we would catch site of them as the trees cleared and they seemed to be getting closer each time we spotted the object.  Eventually we came to a stop sign and again had a clear view of the object.  It appeared to be at least a mile away and stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the lights for about 15 seconds they started coming towards us at a very rapid speed.  I was starting to get scared so I told my brother to drive.  He made a left turn and I stuck my head out the window to get a better look at the lights and see where they were.  This may have been the scariest moment of my life.  The lights were directly above and behind us maybe 50 feet.  I was too scared to sit there and stare at it so I put my head back in the window.  Meanwhile my brother asked where the lights were and I yelled that they were &#34;right here&#34; and told him to drive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my brother was driving (still accelerating to the speed limit) a green white light shone on our vehicle.  My brother yelled out a curse word which I thought was funny for some reason.  After 2 or 3 seconds the light went out and the object was gone.  I looked for it again about a minute later when I regained my composure but did not see it.<n>

One was tall and slender dressed casually well turned out, neat and clean with an aura that illuminated the room.  He had short neat fair coloured hair and neat light coloured clothing.  He had a nordic appearance.  The light seemed to emanate from behind him and enabled me to see pictures on the wall in a room.  The room was normally pitch black at night with the blind pulled down.  On this beings right was a shorter less visible being who didn&#39;t have a aura and appeared unkempt, not sure because he was less visible.  They were talking to each other as they approached my bed.  As they reached the bed the taller well turned out, neat, clean being turned from the shorter being and spoke to me in calm voice and said, &#34;Where are the stairs?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking to myself, &amp;quot;Where am I or why is there people walking here where I am laying down&amp;quot;.  I tried to assess the situation.  I gestured toward the bedroom door to my left with my left hand in response to his question.  They turned toward the door and walked through the closed door which as they walked through appeared open or see through in the aura light which made even the hallway and stairs visible to me.  They continued talking to each other and walked down the stairs and as they walked their foot steps and voices faded and the light faded until there was complete darkness and silence.  I was left wondering what just happened and wondering if I had left my downstairs house entrance unlocked.  I thought to myself, &amp;quot;Of course I didn&#39;t leave it unlocked&amp;quot; and I thought, &amp;quot;I&#39;m not going downstairs to follow them as I&#39;m a little fearful as I don&#39;t know what these being were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the encounter I didn&#39;t feel scared.  It was only in retropsect I started thinking about what just had happened I became a little spooked, but not enough to stop me from sleeping.  They seem nice not angry or mean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a similar encounter about a year before or after where one of these being came through the closed bedroom window again.  Again I think they wanted to know I think where the stairs were.  As they came through the window they moved they blind aside and popped their head in and looked at me and with recognition smiled and came in.  He approached the bed.  There was only one this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The beings weren&#39;t from another era or didn&#39;t appear to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It was first noticed at the bedroom door and then when the window was aproached it stayed the same width and color until the 20 seconds were gone then it proceded to narrow and disapear over 1 1/2 second span. The color was bright glowing green. It was 3 inches wide with your fingers up in front of you. Our residence is on a hill called Lakloey Hill. Fort Wainright is to the left of the light turning ninety degrees and barely visible through the trees. The end of the base near us is quite clear (unpopulus) since it is the runway entry and exit areas. The light was not between us and the base, there is no base in that direction just a rural flat valley. We are on a hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At 9:45pm, we saw this object hovering in the sky, approximatly 15-20 degrees up from the horizon.  It was triangular shaped, but appeared to be changing shape from triangular to pyramid to rectangular shaped.  This may have been due to the object rotating; I couldn&#39;t tell.  It alternated between hovering like a balloon and moving erratically back and forth.  There was a blue light coming out of the bottom, but the entire object had a blue haze about it, as if it were being backlit by a blue light.  The object was silvery metallic on the outside.  It started moving away from us and went out of view behind a building.  We ran around the building to see it better, but it had disappeared.  As stated above, we were inside Knott&#39;s Berry Farm as they were closing.  There were other people around, but no one seemed to notice it except for us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Tonight I was looking around, and saw a slow moving very bright light in the distance, up in the sky, through the tops of the trees.  Like you can see the moon through the tops of trees sometimes when it is low.  In fact, when I saw it, I thought it was the moon, and tried blow it off.  Then I noticed that it was moving slow, but steady, a little higher into air.  I did the whole blinking thing, and tried to look at it harder, to try to figure out what it was I was seeing.  Now we are about 30 miles from an airport, so planes are around a lot, but this wasn&#39;t a plane.  As a matter of fact, an airplane was flying toward the direction of the triangular object.  The plane was higher than the object, but I was able to see them together, and the plane had the regular blinking light on it, but the object did not!  There were three very bright lights.  Almost the glow of a stadium light.  Not like fire, but like an electric looking white light.  IT sort of glided through the sky, at a fairly low altitude.  I watched it until it was out of sight.  When I told my dad, he though I was crazy, but he asked if the lights were on the front or the back.  That is sort weird when I thought about, because it wasn&#39;t either.  I saw the lights coming and going.  Maybe like they were on the bottom??  Now I must say, that I have never put a whole lot of stock in UFO sightings, or aliens.  Actually I have never really cared, so this is really taking a lot for me to submit this.  I would though like to know if anyone else has seen this before.  Maybe some pictures if anyone has some of these triangular white lighted objects.  Thanks!<n>

My camera was set to 10.2mp quality, 1/250 shutter speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had just finished lunch and I went to the SW corner of the building to take a few photos of the lake and surrounding mountains. I didn&#39;t notice anything unusual going on at the time I took the photo. It was when I got home while looking at the photos I took earlier in the day that I noticed a spec in sky at the far left edge of the photo in question, which was located just above the water line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at the photo in FULL scale mode, for the life of me, I can not identify that circular shaped object in the sky. The object is over the California side of the SW corner of the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I push the photo past FULL SCALE 3x, and even though the photo is somewhat pixilated at that scale, the object is very unusual indeed. This may sound strange but to be perfectly honest with you, I think it takes on the characteristics of one of our lunar landing modules. That&#39;s what it reminds me of anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Para-sailing (sp?) is a popular sport in SLT, but not in November, and besides, there are no boats below or within in a reasonable distance from the object. There is one moving boat way off to the right of the object but it is going in the wrong direction (looking at the boat water trail) to be pulling that object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kind of ruled out a helicopter as the photo was taken at 1/250 of a second and there seems to be no rotor blur above the object. Not even the slightest discoloration shadow of rotor can be noticed. And, for sure, this object does not have a fixed wing set.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am absolutely baffled by this object in the sky, no apparent wings and no apparent rotor set and certainly does not appear to be in tow. What the heck is it?  I will be sending you the image, right from the compact flash card in my camera with full EXIF info in tact.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was not time enough to get the attention of anyone else on the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be slightly less than half distance between our plane and the ground.  I understand commercial aircraft generally travel at 35,000 feet, if this is the case, it would be my estimate that the object was located at about 17,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Visability was perfectly clear. There were no clouds anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot provide a comparison of the object to the sun, since my line of view was from above the object looking downward.

In comparison to objects on the ground, it was bigger than the size of a large house on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite lucid, and emphatic, as to the very real nature of his sighting.

It seemed to be a few hundred feet off the ground, gliding rapidly and completely without sound.  It would seem to me it would have been seen by others, as other aircraft were in the air at the time.

It was fairly low, maybe 500 feet or less in altitude.  The object appeared to be approximately twice as thick, and 25% longer, than a large passenger jet.  It was rush hour, traffic was very fast and heavy, and throughout the sighting I did not feel it was safe to pull over to the narrow left shoulder of the highway.  I was concentrating on watching the object while intermittently making sure I didn’t drive off the road or hit another car.  The object appeared to be hovering in the sky, blimp-like.  The bright morning sun was in the east, and the object was in the west, so it was fully illuminated from my perspective.  Visibility was extremely clear.  An aircraft in that circumstance would appear bright whitish-silver, but this object was dark black.  The edges of the rectangle were fairly sharp and stark, but it is possible that there was some additional dimension at the edges.  After driving for maybe 15-20 seconds, I lost sight of the object behind some trees.  After another 25 seconds or so, I passed the trees and was able to see the object again.  At this point it was maybe two-thirds its original size, and I felt that it was moving to the southwest, perhaps 90 miles an hour or so, roughly keeping pace with me in a southern direction, but moving farther west away from the highway.  It was still starkly black.  I watched it for maybe another 20 seconds, when before my eyes it began to fade.  Within about five seconds, it completely faded out of sight.  My impression was not that it moved rapidly away, although that might be possible.  Rather it seemed to get fuzzy, misty and dimmer, until it just faded out of sight.  Much like a cloaking device was going into effect.  It was an amazing sight.  The highway curved, and I kept looking ou! t in tha t direction.  Maybe 25 seconds later I saw it again, but now it was a whitish color that very much blended in with the sky and made seeing it difficult.  By now it appeared to be even farther southwest, and was maybe half or one-third the size as it was when I first saw it.  After another 10 seconds or so, the highway turned again.  I lost sight of the object and never saw it again.  For comparison, I did observe airplanes in the sky immediately afterward, as they are very common in the area, and they were clearly visible as airplanes, bright silvery-white, not at all black, and very clearly not rectangular.  Living in the Chicago area all my life, I’ve seen thousands and thousands and thousands of airplanes, helicopters, blimps, birds and balloons.  This object was certainly none of these.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/9/06 16:30|Kosse|TX|Cylinder|approx.20 ,min|i saw a pen-shaped or oblong metallic shape puff out a cloud and then try to hide behind it but i could still see it.|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53428.html|311|ndxe200611| Black rectangle further details<n> <n><n> <n><n> I almost fell out of my chair when I read the possible explanation for my black rectangle sighting of Nov 9, 2006.  Still, I appreciate the open and questioning nature of the NUFORC website, and I’d like to respond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all, I am well aware of the planes towing the banners.  Usually they are for the &#34;12 Oaks&#34; Townhouses.  It couldn’t be more obvious that a small plane is towing a white banner with clearly legible type.  Not by any stretch of the imagination is this remotely a possibility for what I saw.  Neither was it a billboard or a streetlight or a street sign.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a smoky matte black rectangle, close enough so that I could see it was quite large, in the same way that you can quickly tell if a nearby airplane is a child’s toy, a small plane like the ones that tow the banners, or a large jumbo jet.  This rectangle was clearly a jumbo.  And it was hanging in the air, moving slowly or possibly not at all when I first sighted it.  It was electrifying to see it, and in one second I ruled out all the usual suspects- a sign, a light, and yes, I even briefly considered a banner as a possibility.  But this was obviously an independent floating or flying craft of some kind, with no supporting poles or strings attached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a very clear and long look at the rectangle in a large open area, above the horizon, with no obscuring foliage, as I continued down the raised highway.  It was one of those things I’ll remember crystal clearly for the rest of my life.  At this point it was evident that yes, the craft was moving, albeit relatively slowly, much slower than even a small airplane would move.  And the edges were distinct and crisp, although there was an unusual, almost ominous tone to the black color.  It was sort of unearthly, actually, a smoky matte black, as I stated earlier.  I felt that it was metallic.  I believe I was looking at a side panel or back panel or front panel of the craft.  At the time, I thought that the rest of the ship was hidden by perspective, but now I tend to think it was camouflaged with the exception of this one panel, for whatever reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My great regret is that I didn’t stop the car and flag down other motorists to be witnesses.  I thought of doing it, but it would have been very dangerous in the rush-hour traffic with a narrow shoulder, with me not wanting to take my eyes off this incredible ship in the sky.  I’m glad I was able to keep looking at it, though, because as I was watching it in this wide-open area it just faded away, or &#34;cloaked out,&#34; before my eyes, as if it realized it was being watched.  Briefly, I could see a diffuse rectangular shape well camouflaged against the blue sky, sort of like a rectangular panel of water hanging in the air might look like from a distance.  The ship definitely disappeared from &#34;cloaking,&#34; as opposed to traveling too quickly to observe.  Absolutely amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then, I’ve researched these types of sightings quite a bit.  The shape I saw is very much like the shape I’ve seen witnesses draw of the sides of &#34;black triangles&#34; or similar craft.  Some people believe these are secret American military craft- perhaps a &#34;stealth blimp&#34;- but I find that very hard to believe.  Reports of these types of sightings go back over half a century, and have become quite common the last decade or so.  These ships, usually seen in heavily populated areas, are sometimes seen to move at incredible, apparently instantaneous-type speeds.  I saw one fade from view right before my eyes.  If we’ve had these ships for half a century, which in itself is ludicrous, we’d have been using them in battle for quite some time now.  I’ve seen a Stealth Bomber flying up close, and as awesome as the Stealth Bomber was, I have to say that the black &#34;rectangle&#34; was a lot more amazing.  An advertising banner?  Absolutely not!<n>

The moon was bright and there were many stars in the sky but this was much brighter then anything else. Its some what hovering but is also moiving sporadically in all directions like jumping around. sometimes its movement is sideways to us and very noticablely in bigger increments. We also could tell it would get further away as it s getting harder to distinguish the seperate lights that made up its shape when we first noticed it. Its still there now as we been watching it for aprox an hour now. we see planes as normal and its not comparable to any of them as we see them at the same time .<n> <n><n> <n><n> its been 90 mins now and the sun is coming up making the stars dim and this thing is still as bright as ever but seems further away or higher........just went back out to see if it was still there.The stars sre gone as the sun is rising but this is still as bright and the only 2 things in the sky, the bright moon and this bright object. seems further away now but i can still tell its seperate lights that make up its shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There is an airport near by and often I see the flashing colors of the Cessna and Pipers coming in for a landing as I throw away the trash at night. Occasionally the Jets may be doing a late practice here by the Air Force base. Tonight was different, there was a solid light that didn&#39;t flicker at all in the east near the moon tonight. This light on this veichle was larger than normal compared to the distance I thought. So I continued to look, having to back up to watch this and get a clear view from the building and lights of the street. This solid light was doing some kind of zigzag like a Z and I stood amused at what could do this. Is this a search light? I saw this go back and forth, drop down in a sway and go forward again. Then it moved on behind the building. I looked around the building and it was gone. That surely put a damper on my depression tonight, now I&#39;m stunned back to reality. Things are always as they seem to appear. Never say never~<n>

We watched as it moved in a north west direction. But as it moved the lights grew brighter then dimmed changing and colors often from white to green, blue and red. Finding this strange we watched even longer. Soon there were clusters of lights that would move from the shape outward, they were a burnt orange color. they would fly around for a couple of minutes then go back to the shape and disappear. We watch this go on for over an hour! At one time it seemed to have moved closer to us but not close enough to make out a definite shape. I am one who has never been a believer of sightings until tonight...if anyone else saw this or knows what this was please let me know!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the star Sirius??

Looking up he saw a green fireball that he descibes as being very low &#34;in the trees&#34; (I have not been able to determine the direction of the fireball&#39;s travel).

I just wanted to add my comments. I am his mother and I can vouvh for how scared he was when he ran in to tell me about what he had seen. I too have seen an object just as he decribed in April 1991 while sitting here on my front porch, it started up from the horizon and looked at first like a falling star but was falling up, came acroos the sky, directly overhead to the opposite horison in approx 15 seconds. When it was overhead it was about the size of a full moon, circular in shapr with a hint of being oglong, and was glowing all white, there were no lights or markings other than entire thing was a solid white glowing ball of light and was gliding fast across the sky. I will never forget it and what my son witnessed last night sounds EXACTLY the same as what I saw except when he saw it , it was about 100 ft off the ground and ion his words &#34;bigger than our house&#34; Our house is 24 ft wide and 28 ft long. I just wanted to add this since I read how alot of &#34;students&#34; were posting fictional reports. He is a student but would NEVER do such a thing and I was the one reporting it as he told me what happened. We were always believers but now we KNOW there is intelligent highly advanced life out there. No one will ever be able to tell us any different. I have told a couple family members and friends about both my experience and his and they laugh and one even said yeah and I saw Elvis last week too. Makes me so mad that people react in that way. I am not crazy, neither is my son, I know what I saw, and while I didnt see what he saw, I did see his face when he ran into the house too tell me and I can tell you this, he was telling me the truth. Its such an exciting and scary thing. Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He gave me a jab and was pointing into the sky. The object he was pointing at appeared to be a little larger than a satellite appears and had a slightly fuzzy yellow light to it. I actually thought it was a satellite until it made a sudden jag from its North/Northeast line of travel to a Northern one. Apx. 10 more seconds into its flight it made a sudden Northwestern zig, maintained this for apx. 5-10 seconds and then made a sharp zig back to the North path again. It was completely silent and it was difficult to determine its height and/or size. Our best estimate is that it was at least 10,000 feet up and probably traveling in the 1,000 mph speed range. My brother in law had already observed it zigging from a Northern course to the Northeasterly path it was on when I first saw it. My brother in law has a hobby of astral photography (time lapse galaxy etc. photos) and I&#39;m pretty familiar with the typical satellite or &#34;shooting star&#34;, but this was none of those, I&#39;m certain.

My first thought was that it was a helicopter and I thought how it was close to the flight pattern of the San Diego Airport and that was pretty dangerous if it was a helicopter.  As I was having this thought my friend who I was talking to on the phone said, &#34;wow, I just saw a shooting star or something&#34; and I of course shreaked and said I saw it too and then we both realized it could not have been a star; it was too low and too fast and too big and it could not have been a helicopter since we saw it almost instantaneously and I don&#39;t think helicopters fly in that area due to the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

She went inside then a ball of light appeared right next to the plane as if it was going along with the plane. I ran inside to get a camera by the time I got out there it was gone. I called my mother out to tell her we saw nothing after that. Then what appeared to be another plane taking the same exact path except this time it was going almost straight up and was leaving an orange trail behind it that wasn&#39;t staying in the sky like most trails it was vanishing as the object was moving. Then as it got closer the ball of light appeared again right next to it and in front of the object that was leaving the orange trail appeared another black object in the sky that was traveling in front of the object leaving the orange trail in the sky. The ball of light then zipped off to the west at pretty fast rate. It got from one end of the sky to the next in a matter of seconds. Then when we went to focus on the other 2 objects they were gone too. About 10 minutes later 2 what I assumed to be military jets appeared way up in the sky following right behind each other in the same general area as the objects were. But I know that pilot of the plane that was up there had to of seen something. It was right beside it very very close to the plane. Was quite a show. Unfortunately I couldnt get the ball of light or the other objects in my camera view. Thanks!<n>

It was silent and reflecting the lights of the parking lot off of the bottom of it.  There really wasn&#39;t a shape to it...it was just a mass moving across the sky reflecting everything that it flew over from the bottom.  We watched it until we could&#39;nt see it any longer.   It continued to reflect items that it flew over until it was out of site.  Very strange...I felt puzzled not frightened, but it struck me as something definitely not of this world.

I was just about to put it out and go inside when she yelled to me and pointed to the north eastern part of the sky. To my amazement I saw what first appeared to be a helicopter but in the seconds there after it was undeniable that this was nothing that I had ever seen before. At first it was an incredibly bright light as if pointing in our direction with a hint of red light with it. The thing I noticed right away was that there was no sound what so ever coming from this thing in the sky. As we watched we saw it grow larger as it came closer and more detail into our line of sight. While it was on the horizon approaching us, it appeared to be the classic saucer shaped object. As it got closer, I could see that it was actually in the shape of a triangle(when viewed from underneath) with rounded edges.  When compared with the size of a large, full moon, it would have been slightly smaller in the sky about 95% of the time we viewed it, except the short time it went almost directly over top of where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t go directly over top of us, however it was very close and as it went over top of us I could see that there was something protruding from the center of the underbelly that had a red light that was in the shape of a sphere. At this point I could tell that it was between eighty five and a hundred and ten feet in the air. The whole time it did not make a sound and the interesting thing that I noticed was that it seemed like every coyotye in ear shot was howling seemingly at whatever we were witnessing. There were other lights around the edges of the craft and they seemed to be a bright white. As we watched it, I saw that it seemed to be going straight up and down five to ten feet in short, quick spurts or jerks similiar to seeing a piece of metal bouncing or being pushed around between two magnets.  After noticing this I was suddenly struck with absolute terror, as it suddenly became clear to me that compared to this, I was nothing more than an ant, to possibly be stepped on at any moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my girlfriend and I were so frightened and overwhelmed that we ran into the house and after a few panicky moments decided to wake my mother.  Soon the three of us were outside attempting to find this thing in the sky again, and to my surprise, in that short period of time, the object had suddenly switched to the opposite corner of the sky(southwest) though still very visible.  We watched it float towards the southwest for anothr minute or two until all of a sudden it just disappeared as if someone flipped a light switch.  That was the last we saw of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We are between the ages of 18-20.  I was actually putting my cigarette out and about to walk inside when she said &#34;What the HELL is that?&#34;.  She was pointing up and when i looked i saw something in the sky.  It made ABSOLUTELY no sound what so ever it just kind of hovered slowly in the air..   it had a red light on the underbelly that was attached to a piece that was protruding towards the ground from the center of the &#34;underbelly.&#34;  There were also bright lights around the edges of the craft.  It appeared to be a triagular shaped object however it also resembled a &#34;saucer&#34; or as my mother put it &#34;A ferris wheel on its side.&#34; After noticing that it was moving toward our direction and that it was almost directly above us at this point, we were so scared that we ran into the house and woke up my mother after a minute of freaking out.  She got out of bed and saw this thing as well.  I would love to speak to someone about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/8/06 04:50|Tucson|AZ|Other|5 min.|A close view from Tucson, AZ|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53344.html|332|ndxe200611| Bright triangle shaped lights over Tucson skies<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 4:50 in the morning on November 8th, my boyfriend - age 20 and myself - age 18 were outside on his back patio while he smoked a cigarette. His house is located on the far north east side of Tucson, off of Catalina highway and it is surrounded by moutains. It was over these moutains that I saw an extremely bright light off in the distance that appeared to be rising at an angle in the sky. At first, I assumed it was a police helicopter shining its spot light in our direction but it was moving at an abnormally fast pace and the light never seemed to shine in any other direction. Planes, as well as helicopters, fly over my boyfriend&#39;s house quite frequently and they both have a very distinct sound. The object I witnessed made no noise what so ever. At this point, I called my boyfriend over to look at it and as we both stood watching it, the object appeared to freeze where it was and simply hover in place. The two of us got the feeling that it was watching us and ran inside of the house to wake up my boyfriend&#39;s mother. We were inside of the house for twenty seconds at the most before returning outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the short period of time that we were inside of the house, the object had made it&#39;s way all of the way over to the other side of the sky and was now gliding slowly towards the city. It was flying incredibly low and from what I could make out, it appeared to be triangle shaped with a bright red light that protruded slightly from the center with three smaller, but incredibly bright white lights at each rounded point. My boyfriend&#39;s mother, who was a skeptic, described it as looking like a ferris wheel turned on it&#39;s side with the red light representing the axis. The three of us watched it in the distance and as we did, it appeared to go straight up in the air, then down at an angle and hover for a moment, then go straight up again and repeat the zig-zag pattern until we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another unusual event had occured a few months prior at the location where I first spotted the object in the sky which I feel is worth mentioning. My boyfriend had been out smoking on the patio around four in the morning in early July when we noticed what appeared to be a vapor trail that was surrounded by different, glowing colors (namely red, purple and green) in the north east area of the sky. It hung in the air for atleast an hour with all other colors but red fading away slowly. The red glow and vapor trail remained until sun rise. Over the following few days after we had witnessed the trail, people were saying that it was a result of missle testing however I have yet to see any images of missle testing that compare to what I saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The four craft came from the East over downtown Denver. They were flying in an eratic formation at first (but still to fast and to presise to be birds, not to mention the fact that they were luminescent). They then made a sharp turn over the Platte River (now flying in a steady horizontal line with even spacing) and continued that way (West) untill they vanished over my building.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I believe this may be an explainable event, however, I do not understand it.  Above you use the word &#34;craft&#34;, which does not apply (that I know, anyway). About 11:30 pm, I was riding my bike on a bike path and saw a blue and green glowing (as on fire, except it was blue green) &#34;patch&#34; or object streak at a low angle.  Let me try to describe it another way.  I would have thought it was a meteor, and in many ways it acted like a meteor, except for the following :  1) The &#34;appearance&#34; or Burn started relatively low in the sky. I do not understand, if it was a meteor why it would be so low before it looked like it began to &#34;burn&#34;.  2) I know it was low in the sky, because the mountains here rise rather abruptly in this area. I was at sea level, and the mountains aer several thousand feet north of where I was - in front of where I was.  I had my bike helmet on, thus further obstructing the amount of overhead sky I could have seen. The object &#34;appeared&#34; - began to &#34;burn&#34; suddenly, as though it was just entering the atmosphere.  I hope this makes sense. However, the thing is, this occurred so low - it didn&#39;t make sense to me.  Also, the color - definitely blue and green.  At first I thought &#34;it must be like I&#39;ve heard of frozen ice falling out of airplans&#34; because this area where I was biking is near the airport and near the flight path.  2) I went back the next night to the same spot to recreate what I would have been able to see from where I was riding, given my helmet, given the mountains, etc. 3) Also, perhaps meteors do this, I don&#39;t know...but it was at almost a horizontal path.  It was on a downward slope, but not a steep one, if this makes sense.  Also it was definitely between me and the mounts, for example. I know this for sure.  It seemed close.  4) Of course, something so unexpected, when time goes by, it&#39;s like you wish you could just rewind time so you could take better notes.   and also 5) it seemed a little too slow to be a meteor, especially one tha! t low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mean, it happened quickly, in some ways, and yet, given how close it seemed, it seems to me if it was a meteor, it should have been moving faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

As a passionate sky watcher, I was looking for Iridium satellite flares and one had been predicted to pass right over the stadium.  I was disappointed to see the parking lot lights on, as it would add to the light pollution… nevertheless, I stayed to watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the satellite flew over, a rectangular shaped object (it was more like a trapezoid with the front narrower than the rear) passed over the parking lot at an altitude of about 100 ft traveling southeast at about 60 mph.  Total distance from me to it was no more than 150 ft (practically flew right over me).  The object was completely black with no markings or lights whatsoever.  It was also completely silent.  The object was slightly larger than a car but very flat (about 2 feet tall).  The only reason I saw it was because some light from the parking lot lights was bounced skyward.  After about 4 seconds, the object was out of reach of the lights and had disappeared from view.  There would have been no way to see such a black and silent object without light pollution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a student of mechanical engineering and a flying enthusiast, I can say without doubt that this object was not a conventional aircraft.  I don’t know whether it was top-secret military or otherwise, but it was traveling towards the I-80 pass which leads to Cheyenne and Warren Air Force Base about 50 miles away.  This is a night that I will vividly remember for the rest of my life.  I’ve read some of the other reports on this website and I was happy to find that I’m not the only person who has seen an object similar to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Dark, very cloudy night. We are driving down the road. I see 3, half moon size circular, yellow orange lights appear out of the clouds not very high in the sky, close together in a horizontal line. They spin slowly left to right counterclockwise. The one on the right would disappear as a new one came on the left. They disappeared as a formation of 4 fast moving planes in a horizontal line,  far apart from each other, crossed right where it was. The planes didnt slow down or anything. The lights then came back with 5 or 6 of them a little farther away in a 45 degree angle. They were circling more rapidly now. My mom saw this, she didn&#39;t see the first set. She pulled the car over so she didn&#39;t crash because her eyes were now fixed on them out the side window. She rolled down the window and there was no noise. We watched them for 30 seconds until they disappeared for about another 30 seconds. They then came back in the horizontal row for about 10 seconds, then disappeared never to be seen again by us. We waited and watched the skies around us for about 10 minutes. We are very used to seeing aircraft as we are in the National Guard flyzone along the Des Moines river. We have never seen anything like it. Mom&#39;s Notes: Location-county blacktop just west of Pilot Mound IA, driving North, appearance was in the western sky, just west of the Pilot Mound Cemetary. The 4 planes (small white blinking lights)flew south at a higher altitude. We ask that if anyone else in Iowa witnessed this, they report it to this center to help validate what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I ran out of my office and saw a relatively small object hovering in place over C17.  The METAR was reporting OVC 1900 and I initially estimated the object hovering at about 1000 feet.  After about a minute, I saw the aircraft zip to the east and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately called our operations center to confirm the sighting and the FAA was contacted while I drove to the other concourse to talk with the witnesses.  I spoke with an employee working that gate who said he was compelled to look straight up for some reason and was startled to see the craft hovering silently.  He then made the radio call and notified the pilots at that gate who opened the front windows and witnessed the object for themselves.  The employee stated the object was 500-1000 feet above the ground, rotating, and metallic in nature with no lights.  He said it looked like a frisbe and was directly above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The FAA reported no radar blips and I believe the TSA was notified.

What I had observed near the old Broadmoor Golf course, Pine Island wooded area sout west of the Erie Lackwanna Bike trail in the woods was utterly fantastic ON 11-07-2006. While I was heading due south on the bike trail I had began to smell static electricity ozone. As I got off my bike I began to wipe myself off and it was as if I had been charged or something but it was the smell that got me, it was just like the smell you get when you pull off a fuzzy sweater over a cotton shirt but it was so strong and popping all over my body even by my ears and hair as the fillings in my mouth felt charged or something ,it was so uncomfortable. As clear as day during my flailing around I glanced over the tree line to my west about 120 yard away and begin to view  a flat circle sitting in the air ! as I am gazing at this thing I&#39;am going through my mind trying to figure out what it is im looking at.  I compare it to looking in a cave in the sky with warm colors swirling in a spiral like pattern , this thing sat still as I back tracked north on the trail to get another perspective on this thing as I saw it go down below the tree line then back up a lil higher than it was when I first saw it.Next then for like 5 seconds it looked like it was leaking molten liquid magma or something(wierd) its perimeter turned really bright like it was being eclipsed than blinked up leaving a streak in the sky . what it was I will never ever know. but this thing was no airplane or bright planet Like Jupiter,Mars or a star . This object had  multiple colors , that emitted something and could move like the light when you wave aroun! d  a fla shlight in the dark.

No sounds what-so-ever; Until the jets arrived. 2 to be exact, about 3 minutes after the passing of the fireball. Appeared to us to be &#34;chasing&#34; the object.  As it neared the moon, the object disappeared and the jets then split off in seperate directions. We would like to know what this was. Thanx.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object looked like a bright planet. It did not move from its spot, but -- using binoculars -- it appeared to have large lights (blue, green, orange) that may or may not have been rotating around the outside. The object seemed to rotate on its axis because those lights would change from a horizontal plane to a vertical plane. Truly one of the most amazing sights in my 52 years! -<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting the star Sirius, we believe.  PD))<n>

They caught my attention because they were pretty bright, they may have been orange (it happend over a week ago...so I&#39;m not 100% on this), but I absolutely remember they were NOT blinking. Most airplanes I&#39;ve seen have blinking lights. I could not see a real shape to the craft, it was very dark and the craft was pretty far away - but the lights were in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assumed that the lights being in a straight line mean that the craft was like a cylindar or cigar shape...with the lights being placed along the side of the ship, atleast one in the front and one in the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on this assumption I noticed something strange: The craft was flying northwest while going higher in the sky. But the light on the front part of the craft was much lower, almost at a 45% angle to the light at the very the back of the craft. Opposite of what you would assume of an airplane, where the &#34;nose&#34; would be higher than the tail. It moved fairly quickly and i was able to watch it fly pretty far away...but the lights NEVER changed angles.  (I also thought that was wierd, and it made me think it those lights were probably not on the wings if it were an airplane).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving and only saw it for a minute or 2. i pulled over for a minute, and drove quickly home (i was only a block away at this point) and ran into the house to get a witness, but ofcourse when i came out it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It really did seem to be pretty close. Around here we have Ohare airport, and a smaller airport for personal and corporate planes called Palwaukee Airport. I often see planes flying near our house, that are pretty low from taking off from either of those locations. This did look like it could have taken off from one of those airports, because it was low to the ground and I see planes flying in that route. But it was absolutely quiet...no sound at all and i did have everything in my car turned off and stopped driving for a minute (like i said). ALso, as i mentioned before, the angle it seemed to be flying was very differnt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being so close to airports, there were ofcourse airplanes flying...but it looked like they were either flying higher or were farther away. Still there were at least 2-3 other airplanes in the same area of the sky that i saw while watchin this object. The object did not look likeit was following them or in anyway flying differently because of those airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I have no clue what it was. I didn&#39;t submit it earlier because I had only seen it for a minute or two...and was unable to discuss any EXTRODINARY details. But after i heard the coast to coast show last night and mentioned my little experiance with a coast 2 coast chat channel i visit, a friend suggested I submit my story to you guys. Maybe I wasn&#39;t the only one to see it? Who knows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Good luck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ps - i&#39;m sorry i cannot give you my true address. i do live in wheeling il, 60090, but in the witness contact information form i gave you US Cellular Field&#39;s information. However, the e-mail address is correct, so if you want to get in touch with me please use my email. I check it very often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to remain in the same location for about 10 minutes. I came home and she told me to take a look at this. I got binoculars and saw a sphere shaped object radiating flashing lights of white, red, and green. At times the sphere seemed to move in sometimes a circle or back and forth. There was some cloud cover and sometimes it could be seen through the clouds, sometimes not. I watched it on and off for about an hour and by then it had moved a little higher and more south. Soon, some air craft (jets?) I could see the contrails headed towards the light. There wear eventually 3-4 jet craft going towards it. The light then disappeared behind some cloud cover. I checked about a half hour later and did not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had my 20X binoculars with me. I saw a very bright light to my right; to the Northwest moving toward the Southeast. I got up from my seat and looked through my binoculars. I saw no strobe lights, or wing lights, nor was there a sound. I figure that the object may have been around 1000 feet or so in altitude. At that altitude sound would have been detectable. The interesting thing about this was the glow around the light --- and I must say, it was very bright. When the object got just about overhead I ran down to the entryway of the building and watched it for a few seconds more. This took about 10 seconds. When the building got in the way again, I ran to the parking lot to the South side of the building to watch it until it disappeared into the high haze in the Southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft was flying at a very low altitude.  I watched it move to the south until it went out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I placed a call to an off-duty policeman that I know to ask if anyone else saw it, or had reported it.

This is when she tells me that for a couple of day her family and herself had been seeing a lot of movement in the sky. She describes it as a star moving in different directions. This when I stop the car and look  out in the sky and that was what I saw, a star moving up and down. This when I suggest going to Kruger field, where we could probably have a clearer view. As we get there I do see it clear but still far a cicular object with purple,red,greenish lights turning. That was really strange, at this moment I am tring to make sense of what I was looking at, but I could not. my friend and I were in shock. I took pictures with my phone but the pictures were not clear. I did call several people and they were as surprised  to see what I saw. After that I tried to watch the news to see if anyone had seen anything, but nothing. A couple of months later as I was searching on the internet I found out that there was a UFO sighting on an airport in Chicago and Houston around the same time we saw this in Laredo. I have heard that several border patrol in Laredo have seen strange things in the sky. Its been 2 years since I saw this and I am very intrigued by the subject on UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides little contact information.

I had a window seat and was very excited about my first overseas trip.  We were approaching Ireland at 33,000 feet, -81 degrees F and going over 600MPH, when I saw what I took to be the northern lights.  I was thrilled and watched the lights for at least 45 minutes.  They looked like 2 vertical parallel streamers.  Sometimes rippling, waving, coiling, and sometimes looking like a shaken carpet rolling from one end to the other.  The 2 streamers remained distinct; they never merged.  They looked like clean straight sheets, which never quite touched.  They were NOT FUZZY or PUFFY in any way, and were almost colorless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 40 minutes or so I noticed the lights got almost firey and looked almost orange.  I looked through the window ahead of mine and saw that the lights ended at perfectly square black object!  This object had a light in each corner; 3 white and one blue.  So much for the northern lights!  The lights faced me-it flew in the same direction as the plane, like a square book propped up on its spine, the title page facing me (with the lights in each corner).  Our speeds were so evenly matched it took almost 10 minutes for the plane to pass the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we landed, I asked a pilot if what I saw were the northern lights.  He said we 2 planes were flying parallel with our plane (who mentioned planes?).  As I turned to go he said it was actually a UFO but he hadn&#39;t wanted to alarm me.  What a character.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After my return home, my son showed me a square UFO on the internet-a perfect match.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We sat trying to figure out what it could be for a matter of moments.We proceeded on Crain Hwy, the lights were visible behind the industrial buildings so it was a pretty large area.While stopping at the gas station on the corner we noticed a few people gassing up their cars were pretty perplexed by the lights as well.After we returned from a near by 24 hour diner the lights were gone, and there was no sign anything had happend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I took a second look and I saw two objects. One was two bright off white lights and the other was a object with many colors. When the lights would go dim I could see two orange lights. I stood on top of my car to see over the fence and just watched it for about 5 minutes and then decided I needed to go for the camera. I went in the house and got my camera and then saw it was moving farther away from me. It was right over Arizona City which is right next to Eloy. I know many people had to see it. I hopped in my SUV and chased it through the desert to get more close to it. I finally got on Batagglia road and chased it for about another 8 miles and caught up to it. I was going 80 MPH and so was the craft. It was located just up and to the left of me in the sky about 200 yards off the ground. I ran out of road and was forced onto a dirt road. I came across a group of horses that seemed to be rather alarmed becuase they were running really fast and sketchy. I drove for about a mile on the dirt road and stopped and opened up my sunroof. I proceeded to film the object in the sky. You can clearly see the orange lights and the spinning lights in the middle of the craft. I saw the object two weeks later but this time my wife was with me. I will email the video clips to Peter.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/5/06 19:55|Dumfries/Galloway (UK/Scotland)||Unknown|30 mins|5TH NOV 2006,  BRIGHT BALL OF LIGHT PROCIDED WITH ANOTHER BALL OF LIGHT FOLLOWING OTHER ONE|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55603.html|364|ndxe200611| 2 amber coloured lights sighted over claycross in the east midlands in england<n> <n><n> <n><n> at around 7:15 pm on sunday night, me, my mum, my dad, my brother and a friend were just ready to pull out of the car park just after seeing a firework display when we saw an amber coloured light in the distance. it was not moving like a plane because it moved to the right and then stopped and then a little more, stopped, and then went virticaly up until it went above the clouds. it was moving fairly slow but it was about 10 miles away in the distance so speed was hard to calculate. a few seconds later after the first one had gone out of site into the clouds, a second one was spotted by my dad. it followed the same flight path as the other and we watched this one really carefully. it was the same colour, size and distance away and was vissible for about 2 mins before it went above the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i think it is very strange how all this happened on bonfire night. maybe al the lights and flashes could be picked up from space by some computer system not known to us and maybe what ever that thing was it may have been curious of what was going on. if i was going to visit i would certainly visit on a night like tonight because of all the cover from fireworks. i am totaly 100% sure it was not a hellicopter because of its height in the sky. the object was extremely high up and did not give off lights like a hellicopter, from a distance it was like the entire thing was glowing. i have no idea what it could have been if it was made by humans and as far as i know there are no millitary bases or airports nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were driving east bound on hwy 60 coming out of Plok count and on my right hand side in the air(south east) about 2 oclock position I observer 3 small round shaped white lights forming a particial circle and a 4th one joining them.I said to my boyfriend look at that. He yelled pull over and grab the recorders. I did just that. we recorded and tried to annilize what was going on. At one point there were too many of these white light spots to count. Some of the lights had green and some had red lights attached. There were smoke trails all over the place as if the were going perfectly up and down. After I called 911 there seemed to be plains following them. This event kept changing. They seem to form a v then you could see them very fast leaving. We were both standing outside our truck and hear a loud but soft and s=distant sound like it could have been an air boat cranking up then shutting off after about 3 to 5 seconds. We both heard this 3 times and captured it on our voice recorder.Sounded like a low frequency almost like a alligator growning but more mechanical. We took pictures with our new camera and also our camcorder.Never did we feel threatened just very excited. I had dialed 911 and the operator said she had another report of this. I called again and the operator said she heard nothing and we kept filming until batteries ran dead. If it was ufo&#39;s I sure would like to know what it was. It was a cloudy night and when these objects seemed to leave the clouds cleared as if a big fan blew the clouds apart. My one thought was a type of small milky wave was coming thru and all the stars togeter formed a shape. It was a crazy night and I will never forget it.I do not belive in ufo&#39;s but now I can be convinced.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sun was bright, the air was somewhat hazy, and while it had been foggy earlier that morning, the sky was fairly clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I were just getting ready to start working on his book report when I received a phone call.  When the call was finished, my son, who has excellent eye site and is well-known in the family for his ability to spot birds and other wildlife, asked me to identify the flying object that he could see from our outdoor third story balcony which faces southwest towards Belvedere Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took me about twenty seconds to see what he was pointing at and, when I did, I could see a black speck that, at first, reminded me of a parachute.  But as I watched the object I noticed that, while it was moving slightly in the sky, it was not losing altitude the way a parachutist naturally would.  We own some fairly high power binoculars so I quickly retrieved them and attempted to fix my gaze on the object in question.  At first it was difficult to see the object because my arms were shaking slightly and the object was moving around in my view.  I then kneeled down on my knees, placed my elbows on the balcony railing so as to provide a stable platform, and then focused the binoculars.  At this point, I could see the object clearly.  It was a perfectly round dark colored disk (flat, no bulges) and it was in constant motion doing gentle and slow “figure eights” tilting and banking and turning slowly.  There were no markings on the exterior, no exhaust ports, no lines or markings of any type. The flying disc stayed in the same small area of the sky, it was in constant motion slowly turning and banking, thus it was not hovering horizontally over a fixed point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live near the Golden Gate Bridge and I just checked online and the main tower of the bridge is about 750 feet high.  I estimate that this object was flying about three to four times higher than the main tower of the Golden Gate Bridge, or about 2,250 to 3,000 feet above sea level.  The disc was flying just south of Belvedere Island (I estimate four miles away), and the object appeared to be about 30 to 50 feet wide.  As mentioned, the flying disc was in constant motion and as it turned and banked slowly in the sky, the sun intermittently reflected off its surface with a very bright slightly golden colored reflection. From this, I guess that the object had a metallic exterior surface.  My son and I took turns looking through the binoculars and when I watched the object with my naked eye, it was difficult to see the small dark speck in the distance; however, as it turned and the sun reflected off its surface, the bright flash was quite noticeable to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a fairy high amount of commercial aviation flights in our area and there is also a sightseeing seaplane that operates out of Sausalito and when these planes fly by, we can hear the noise.  The flying disk made no noise whatsoever that we could hear.  After about five to ten minutes of viewing, I went inside to get my camera, but when I returned, I could no longer see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my girlfriend to report what we had seen and then my son and I started to work on his book report.  After about 20 minutes or so, we heard the very loud and unmistakable sound of military jets flying in our area.  About three weeks earlier we had viewed the Blue Angles (F-18s) during Fleet Week and the sound was much the same, much louder than commercial planes.  We went out to the balcony and observed two military jets circling the area.  This was just after noon or about 12:15 to 12:30 pm.  We presumed that the jets were investigating what we had just seen but, subsequently, I heard that there was a military fly over for the 49er football game at Candlestick Point, so now I am not so sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no question in my mind that we say a flying disc.  My son and I could both see it clearly.  About twenty years ago I worked for a commuter airline at the Sacramento (SMF) Airport and I believe that I am experienced at identifying airplanes in the air.  What we observed was definitely not an airplane, jet, blimp, ultralight, etc.   Given the time of day, the good visibility, and the location over San Francisco Bay, we figure that somebody else must have seen it as well, although I must admit, if not for excellent eye site of my son, I never would have noticed it myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am 44 years old. I was asked to give my credentials and experience with a couple of projects at NASA and Lockheed Martin. I have been a graphics designer for over 20 years and have done several special projects for NASA. One being the Consolidated Space Operations project, CSOC, in the early 90’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I designed and edited the White Sands Missile Range Project proposal, the first full color proposal ever presented to NASA by Lockheed Martin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was educated on space operations, satellites, etc, etc. I was exposed to and had access to many reports about ongoing UFO projects and experiments involving NASA.  I know that I am not an expert but I believe that I know more than the average observer and have a bit more of an open mind to the possibilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, my father is a retired commercial airline pilot and has taught me a lot about space, meteorology and what is and is not ‘possible’.  We have watched many planes in the sky. I consider myself a liberal thinker and am not ignorant nor naive to the possibilities beyond my comprehension. I spend a lot of time outside at night observing the sky and know the difference between airplanes, satellites, stars and ‘flocks of geese’! I was certainly not expecting or looking for what I saw, but I can assure you that it was none of the before mentioned!!  I have never seen what I am about to do my best to explain to you or anything remotely similar and am very interested to know if there were any other reports of the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eighteen year old daughter and I were outside at about 12:30 am that night. The sky was clear, the moon appeared to be full with a large, hazy circle around it and was directly above us, a bit northwest. There were a few clouds and scattered stars. We were looking southeast in the sky and noticed a bright light moving rapidly. It appeared to be at least 40 thousand feet up, perhaps higher. It was moving at a high rate of speed. In less than 5 minutes it had gone from just above the tree line, our horizon line, to directly above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To describe it best is to say that the ones that were closest to us were shaped much like an ant’s body, two parts connected. We first saw one and thought it to be a satellite. I know the basic movements in conjunction with Earth and placement of the satellites and these were much too close in placement to be satellites. I considered the fact that it was much too fast and much too high to be an airplane. As we were looking I noticed another one a little further south, then another further east. There were 4 or 5 all together at about the same height and were spread out across the sky and moving at the same rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching and trying to somehow justify and explain them I noticed just beyond these were another ‘layer’ several thousand feet above them (smaller and dimmer) moving at the same rate of speed and the same direction. As we were watching I noticed another 3 or 4 come out from the tree line into view. They seemed to be following the others…again, at the same rate of speed and closer, as the first 4 or 5. In total there were at least 20, perhaps more in the distance. All moving the same direction, in a wide-spread, horizontal formation and all going the same rate of speed. Within 5 minutes they were all directly above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter became frightened when I was not able to ‘explain’ them to her and went into the house. I watched them for just another minute or so and went in to report them. It was then that I found your website. I made the call the next morning and was called back on Monday, November 6th and asked to give this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I apologize for taking an extra few days to get you my account. I am, however, very interested to know of anyone else that saw them that night or any other night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am encouraging my daughter to put together her own account of what we saw that evening. It has opened her eyes to the possibilities beyond explanation. We have spoken a lot about what we witnessed and are positive it was something worth doing our best to report. Thank you for the work that you are doing.<n>

She pointed out what looked like stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking closely I noticed they were in formation.  A line of 5 across and behind each one was a long and seemingly endless trail of lights. They were spaced out evenly. They were using the clouds to hide behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On occasion one would break out of formation, fly in a circle around another one and then return to its original place. Some would fly and join in a triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as I know we did not have a meteor shower and stars do not behave this way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two that were stationary and waited for the end of the group. They left thier position and joined the group as they finished flying over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think they were like guides or escorts. I have no idea what all of this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very disturbing to me as well as my children.<n>

At first I assumed that it was a plane since I only seen it at a glance and since Ontario Airport is so nearby.  Figured I seen the plane as it was turning and only seen the green and not the red lights to signify port and starboard.  After a brief 1-1.5 seconds the light moved westbound in a quick motion leaving behind a bright green streak of light.  This speed was too fast to be a plane, jet or helicopter.  First assumption than was a shooting star however the fact that it was stationary when first seen and green leads my wife and I to assume it was something else.  Please post any comments if there were other witnesses.  I have seen number shooting stars in the past all were white to a yellowish color this was solid green and the streak left behind was very wide more like a strip.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On closer look there were 3 large red/orange lights in a triangualar formation. The two lights at the back being closer together than than front (I would suggest that ths spacing looked very close to a Star destroyer congiguration that would be seen in star wars (that probable puts pay to any credibility you may think I had).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cam e down the stars and called to my mother to come out into the garden wereby she also confimd what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights stayed perfectly aligned and travelled for approc 30 secs very slowly across the sky. At this time I ran back upsatiars to get a further view but the lights had disappeared. In the mean time my mother had come back into the house to call my father to take a look, when she looked out of the window again she too confirmed that the lights had gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What makes me think this was very odd:  1. We are on the flight path for planes from Heathrow to USA so are used to seeing lights in the sky and am used to determining sizes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. We are very close to FAIRFORD Airbase which over this last few weeks has been staging some sort of Nato Exercise. Local paepr stated that we would be seeing many different sorts of planes (we have, this was no plane).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. Whaen I observed the &#34;Craft&#34; the lights were unusual in that they were reddish/orange slightlt diffused but large. All aircraft that I am familiar with have white strobes and I am used to the sizes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. When glancing up at this object although the only visible signs were the 3 orange/red lights the &#34;body&#34; of the craft blanked out all of the cloud making a very black shape against the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5. When the craft had disappeared the cloud could be seen again, thereby indicating to me that what had been between the 3 lights had infact been a solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6. The configuaration of the lights would suggest to me that this was not 3 helicopters moving slowly in formation (it could not have been an aircraft to be flying so slowly).<n> <n><n> <n><n> What more can I say - I am not crazy, I do not believe in UFO&#39;s- Unless the military operating out of FAIRFORD airbase have got a secret vehicle the size of a star destroyer from the star wars films I have to belive that this is an encounter with something from space.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The part of the road we were on at the time was a couple of miles from the town and was quiet enough apart from the fireworks a couple miles away in the distance. The objects appeared to be travelling int a straight line, one after the other, around 1000 metres from me and were about 3 or 4 hundred metres apart. I would estimate their speed to have been around 150mph and their size around 7-10 metres across. I initially thought they may be fighter craft flying a sortie locally as we have quite a lot of that sort of thing here but there was no engine sound and they were far too slow. I would have had them down as flames from hot air balloons but a) it was dark and b) they were too fast. I stopped the car when I saw the second light and lowered the window &amp; switched off the engine. The third light then flew across my field of vision. As I already stated, there was no engine noise, just the sound of fireworks in the distance, which was strange. Their flight path seemed odd too. They were travelling in a straight line, in single file, yet once they were over the town they elevated by some distance, i would guess perhaps 50 metres and then continued their path north by north east towards the river Humber. I watched them for a few minutes then drove on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects looked bright (orange to red like) balls or masses and were producing no sound. They seemed to travel at exactly the same speed to exactly the same point of the sky, were all quite high up and each one faded and vanished after hovering for at least 2 minutes in the same track. We witnessed at least 4 in an hourly amount of time. After the first hour, to our amazement, we then witnessed 4 objects side by side following exactly the same path, behaviour and speed as the first sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We managed to capture strong evidence on digital camera, and when the images were downloaded to our personal pc, by zooming in you can clearly make out a red UFO like object in all images with what appears to be windows or lights in a Cigar shape.

This was then followed on a regular interval on the same track and stopping at exactly the same position in the skyline. Then approx an hour after this started, we then sighted four of the same objects grouped together and converging in the same area before dissapearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took the photo(s) on a digital camera - we still have the original images on that camera, and the images I will email to you remain unedited. After we downloaded them onto hard drive, we zoomed in to discover that they appear to be a bank of lights surrounded in an orange haze - also some were diamond formation. We also have video footage captured on camcorder (but sadly the viewing quality is not brilliant due to night-time filming - keeps going out of focus).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being bonfire night we appreciate and are open to possible explanations or sceptism, but we certainly have not seen anything like this before - and the images clearly show that the object was not a firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to a relative - their neighbours also sighted this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope you find this interesting and can work out a feasible explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kind Regards  Pete<n>

Directly ahead of us in the night sky I witnessed a bright white light.  The light appeared to stay in exactly the same place in the sky. As we traveled through town I rolled the window down to get a better look at it and to see if I could hear any sound from it. It was at that time we came to a stop light and I was able to point it out to my friend who was driving.  We watched the light together for about 20 seconds and then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I might be able to distinguish some sort of a shape because of the backlight of the moon, but the object was completely gone.

At this point, there were four objects, and they were increasing in brightness and they seemed to be merging, forming one, and then they would separate.  This was about 5 minutes into the occurance when a customer in the car next to me was exiting his vehicle and I asked him to look to see if he was seeing the same thing I was seeing.  When I pointed to the direction of the objects, the gentlemen exclaimed, &#34;yes, I definately see that...but I don&#39;t know what to make of it.&#34;  He continued for a few minutes to watch with me, but then proceeded in to do his shopping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 15 minutes had passed by at this point as I&#39;m still observing, when my wife comes out with my kids to return to the car.  I pointed it out to them, but the event was fading away, because at this point the horizon was succombing to dusk.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stopped at a light, looked up, and saw(at about the 10/11 o&#39;clock position, 500 ft.) an orb. No lights, just had a reflective exterior. It wasn&#39;t really moving, more like hovering. It startled me with its size. Then an identical orb appeared from thin air to the right of the 1st orb. Now I knew something wasn&#39;t right. I tried to get closer to the objects, as the treeline got higher, they became harder to see. Then about 30 seconds later 2 black U.S. Stealth Fighters flew over the top of my car towards the objects. Another two would follow about 10 seconds later. Perhaps chasing the objects or what not. The military fighters stayed in the air and kept making their rounds for a good half hour before they left the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

At first I thought it was just another airplane but then as it approached I noticed that it&#39;s lighting pattern was different. The same exact aircraft over alaska is what I saw. A perfect triangle aircraft with 1 bright light on each tip and a multi color beacon in the middle. The craft was flying below the clouds (low cloud cover because of the cold front so about 5,000 ft) and went from horizon to horizon in about a minute and a half. (From the south to the north parallel to the Rocky Mountains) I got a very good look at the craft and because of the light reflection off the cloud cover I was able to see very good detail. The craft had some kind of Headlight / Spotlight used to see in front of it. The engine was very quiet yet audible (I was in a quiet area) the tone of the engine was unlike any I have heard before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was already pitch black outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we pulled out onto the highway, we saw what appeared to be lights from a large cargo plane flying overhead. It was not unusual for cargo planes to be doing test fights at night in this area, so we ignored it for the most part. 5 minutes before we made it to Millington the &#34;plane&#34; was next to us in the sky to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t think much of it until I realized we were going faster than the plane was. It was following along with us then slowed down to a stand still. I thought it might be a helicopter, but this thing was huge with a wide wingspan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then turned around and headed back towards Munford. Then it again turned around and flew over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shocked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw it go below the tree line and then looked like it was about to crash into the church that was off the highway. It actually landed then took off again from the field. I was thinking it might be a crop duster helicopter, but it was so late and dark. It wasn’t until we got out of are car that I realized it wasn’t a helicopter. We were in the Lowes parking lot and the craft was floating over the highway. It was so close to the ground and so large. I was shocked to hear no sound hardly coming from it. I could hear more of the traffic passing than I could hear the craft. I could only make out the lights from the craft and not the actual craft itself. It had two bright white lights in the nose of the craft, then it seem to have wings which held one bright white light each. Behind the nose and the wings was two red lights and one red light seemed to be on top or near the nose. They blinked in sequence one after the other. The craft turned around again and then landed in the field next to Lowes. I walked over to see it and saw it in the field. I was about 350 yards away from it where I watched as it began to take off again. It took off like a normal airplane but with less runway. It wasn’t! very lo ud either. It had two sounds coming from it. One was a deep low roar, and then a high pitch jet sound. I&#39;m sure it was some sort of Jet hover craft. Obviously man made. I don&#39;t believe it was alien or anything. It was just mysterious and was out of place. We have many aircraft flying around sometimes. Its not uncommon to see a jet fighter fly over you a close range to the ground at extremely high speeds. But this one was just weird. It hovers in mid air, lands in fields, takes off like a plane but shorter runway, extremely quiet. I am sure thousands of people saw this, I saw many people in the parking lot looking up at the sky at it. It was strange. It continued to fly even after we made it back home. It just kept flying back and forth down the highway from Munford to Millington.<n>

Naturally we freaked out thinking we were being nuked when we look up again to see it go up in a zig zag pattern.  It looked massive and I know others on I-10 had to have seen it.  The colors of the trail or whatever it was looked like the colors of the rainbow.  It reappeared but at a further distance away and went from white to red and disapeared.  As far as size, it was about the size of the moon from where we saw it.  It looked as if were going to crash into Indio itself, we were 20 miles outside of Indio, so imagine how big this thing had to be.  I wish I had never seen it....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Upon first appearance, I noticed one trail fall out of the sky from high above, and it appeared to hover in stationary position for a few moments, but then after about one minute, it started falling slowly towards Earth.  Shortly thereafter, the other two orange trails appeared in similar fashion, but only to eventually pass the first one.  After a total time of perhaps two to two-and-half minutes, they disappeared behind the trees and horizon, and I never saw them re-appear.  Don&#39;t know what this was.  Perhaps pieces to a falling meteorite?  I have four photographs I am prepared to send.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live on the second floor of a two story appartment.  I had to smoke a cigarette, so I went to the balcony.  It was november in texas, so the wind was blowing pretty hard.  My balcony faces a large open area where the appartment swimming pool is located.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was lighting my cigarette, I noticed something coming from over the building on my right.  It was only about three or four feet wide and rectangular, almost a perfect square.  It had a dull red appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved by me pretty fast only about twenty or so feet in front of me.  It looked like it came from over the building, it dipped down in front of me, and started rising pretty fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Normally, on a windy texas night i wouldn&#39;t have thought much about that, but it moved in a straight line, and was definately three dimensional.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i mentioned before, it was moving pretty fast and flew by me as i was lighting my cig.  I kept watching it and it changed direction and started going skyward, again it was moving in a completly straight line.  Only once it got some altitude and some distance did it start to get a white glow to it, and i was able to follow it in the sky for quite awhile, definatly longer than i should have for an object of that size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time i was trying to figure out what in Heavens name this thing was.  It couldn&#39;t have been paper, since in the wind paper wouldn&#39;t have kept its shape, and plus it was a complete square.  It couldn&#39;t have been a box, since the wind wasn&#39;t THAT strong, and again it would have been knocked around instead of moving in a straight line.  Plus, boxes don&#39;t glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i mentioned before, i followed it for quite awhile, i smoked the majority of my cigarette watching it, and then it just dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a plane was in the sky on an intercept course to the object, and when it dissapeared, the plane changed course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near an Air Force base and i wonder if the plane was a military plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone has had a similar experiance, I would like to hear about, partly just to confirm my sanity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I looked up into the sky &amp; was shocked when I saw a glowing object moving slowly downward and across the sky. At first I thought it was my first shooting star or comet, but all of a sudden it took a completely different path and curved and went up. It started blinking while still moving fairly slow. Then it started glowing steadily once again. It sped up and began to dim. Then it was gone. I waited to see if it would appear again but it didn&#39;t. Before tonight, I had never believed in UFO&#39;s or weird things going on in the sky like this. But I know I wasn&#39;t just seeing things because when I saw it I yelled to my brother &#39;a shooting star!&#39;, so we were both witnesses. And I noticed it didnt have blue or red or any other color lights like an airplane or other ordinary flying craft. Also, it was flying pretty low, until it went up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>
11/1/06 22:00|Milton|WV|Light||Bright light (no meteor) crossed the sky from horizon to horizon in less than one minute.|3/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55490.html|401|ndxe200611| I saw a large, bright light.  I was talking to my friend on the phone at the time and told her the details as I saw them.  I was on a country road with no traffice and so I stopped the car and rolled down the window.  As the &#34;aircraft&#34; got closer, I heard no sound of an engine, even though it was flying fairly low.  It was shaped like a triangle, from below it reminded me of a fighter jet, but broader.  It had a blue light on one wing and a red light on the other.  It was going very slowly.  The large light was on top and to the front.  The strangest thing that grabbed my attention, was that as it flew overhead, I could see up into it.  Like it had a glass bottom and I could see light coming from inside, which was sectioned off.  Behind the larger aircraft and slightly above, was another much smaller one which looked like it was following the main one.  Then I guess I got a little scared and left. One other strange thing was that when I tried to use my cell phone a few minutes later, it kept beeping back at me even though I had a good signal and when I talked with a friend, it &#34;froze&#34; and wouldn&#39;t let either of us get out of it! I&#39;ve seen them before, but never this close and so I decided to report this one.  I work at a daily newspaper in Hillsdale, Mich in advertising sales.  I had just left choir practice and was on my way home, so no...I wasn&#39;t drinking!<n>

I was sat in the back seat and looking out at the stars as i have an intrest in them. I was looking at one particular star because it was so low down it seemed to be hovering over a smalll estate of houses in the distance but i just asumed that it was a greater distance than the others then something else struck me....was the star moving? I was entranced not to look away, I couldnt decide if it was moving because we were travelling in a car but I suddenly realised it was when it was closer and futher away from the other stars...thats when i realsied it wasn&#39;t a star. I decided it was a plane even though i couldnt see the usual blue and red flashing lights that planes usually have. I still kept watching the star/ball of light and then was it just me or was it gettnig bigger? i watched amoazed, i didnt call my nanna coz i was afraid that when i pionted it out to her that it would disapear. I watched the gettng bigger butit still remained as a ball of light then it began to shrink back down and then disapeard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was thinking about the strange star and gazing across the field out of the window when about 10 minutes later it happened again, i noticed a star that was lower and i again tried to figure out if it were moving but i realised alot fatser that it was when i watcehd as it began to dance around the sky, it was zig zagging and swirlying around and then got bigger..shrank and disaperaed for about 20 minutes after i was still shocked at what i had just seen but carried on looking out to the sky. We driving up towards a groupe of buildings when another star shot up from bhind the closest wharehouse/building and disapeared, it did accurr to me that perhaps the third star was a fire work but when we rounded the corner i saw behind the wharehouse/building was completely desterted then i thought it could of been a firework in the distant...but dont fireworks make noises? and they kind of sizzle out  and leave tiny glints of silver when they shoot up...where as the as the moving stars didnt. I should eb traveling up in that direction in the next past week or so and this time Im taking a camara of some sort even if its my mobile phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These moving stars, where no bigger than normal real stars. They couldnt of been a plaen or helicopter as there was no noise, planes and hellicopters dont zig zag and dance around or get bigger and shrink then disapere. Like i say it was close to bonefire night, but these were certanially no fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were small balls of light that apeared, shrank, grew and finally disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This may have just been one ball of light disapearing and appearing but overall it was really freaky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When i am in the same place again I will take pictures of where I saw the objects and hopefull may be able to film the stars in action if they return. I havnt told anyone in fear of not being believed but this isnt the first time i have seen wierd things in the sky. I will try and send the imges in asap.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two, seemingly credible reports from the same source.  PD))<n>

My property is surrounded by trees, and has a clear sky view, directly above the back garden.  A very fast object travelled from north to south, covering approx 100 degrees of sky, in about 1-2 seconds.  The object was pure white, with a halo type covering, and resembled a cigar type shape. Inside the &#34;halo&#34; there seemed to be a long cylindrical shape, with a rounded front, and no discernable rear.  I have no frame of reference for a dimension, but an estimate would be, width of 2 fingers at arms length, and a length of one fist at arms length.  The altitude was low, and i estimate under 500 feet. There was no noise, or any unusual phenomena.  I would not have written in about this, except for the fact that i have seen this twice now.  The second time was a month later, in mid december 2006, when i was in Tweed Heads, Australia.  I was outside a house, at approx 22:00, with my wife, and we both saw this &#34;object&#34;. This was almost identical to the one i saw in galveston, and the direction of travel was south east, to north east. The details for this second sighting were effectively identical, with very high velocity, white &#34;cigar&#34; and halo, no noise, no associated phenomena. My wife asked me not to repeat what i saw in galveston, as there was only one observer, and no proof of any kind, and i concurred this was correct. However, after the sighting in australia, and its extremely similar description, in 2 very different localities, but with 2 observers, i feel it is reasonable to state that this was not an abberation, atmospheric phenomena, or an isolated incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Shortly after 5 very bright round yellow lights came on in a straight row from right to left sequentially. There was no sound. Then 3 lights came on right to left just beside this. This occured just to the right of Rich&#39;s inletover the ocean almost to Figure Eight island. We could not see a craft of any sort. I grabbed my binoculars and the lights filled the whole frame I could see so I assume this was very large. After about 15 seconds, it just disappeared from the sky. No trail,no sound. Three of us saw this plain as day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was after the sun had gone down and only a little glow was left peeking through the clouds (the light was located quite seperate from the area in which the sun was setting).  The light was moving slowly, down and slightly west, not constant in speed or direction.  It was way too large to be an airplane &amp; was unlike any object either of us have witnessed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then, It suddenly did a sharp turn and followed the road that we were heading on. Then, as we were passing Mt. Olivet cemetery, it rose up to what looked like a star in 1-3 seconds. I didn&#39;t tell my mom at the moment because she doesn&#39;t believe. I only told my best UFO investigator partner buddy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was at least twice perhaps 3 time the height of landing pattern jets I see normally  for Sea-Tac airport. There was time enough to get my binoculars. I was shocked to see the cleariaty and detail of the craft. Not even a hint of doubt that this ws metal like and very starwars or the like fighter type vehicle. Sort of round with gun looking turrits on each side pointing apparently forward. Quick general shape is like at this link. starwarhttp://www.monstersinmotion.com/catalog/images/ships/fmfalcon8.jpg however not so round and the forward extention very much more like weapons guns. the top was not cyliinder but like triangle cylendar one side redish other side greenish. it was silent and was moving in a pattern that of an orbit backside facing in and guns facing out and downward.  only way I can see that it is fake would be someone went to an awful lot of time and expensense to built a metal helieum filled starwars type fighter craft of that size and let it float away.  I hoped I had time to video tape it with my digital cam and rushed in and did get a couple shots of it. It is though similar to other sightings just an object floating around but some detail can be seen. It is only a four seconds long.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The clouds this morning were very low and moving very fast.  As I was watching the sky, very close to the bus, right in front of me , an object that was very thin and metallic flew out of one bigger cloud, and into a smaller cloud then disappeared.  I couldnt see much of the object because it all happened so fast.  I doubt anyone else saw it.  The object my guess was about 15-20 feet long.  Even though I was on the bus, I didn&#39;t hear any sound.  I do know though, that if it were an airplane or a helicopter, it should have reappeared out of the cloud it went into right away and then should have been visible for a very long time.  It was just flying way too low.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looking south east of there towards armour hill I notices a long verticle <n> shape in the sky and mentioned to my friend that it looked odd.  He said that it was probably  &#39;the morning star&#39;  and then we located that in the sky and with cloud passing by we noticed it had gone up higher into the sky.  We really started to notice that it was moving upwards slowly and then it changed to a star type looking shaped and then took off and dissapeared into a pin hole of light and was just gone.  We sat there wondering what we had just seen and really are not sure,  but it really confused us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I turned left (Northern Direction) I saw a large Sphere, moving from east to west in the sky.  The Sphere was very dark blue in color. It looked as if it possibly had electrical properties to it.  Its altitude was approximately 50 to 100 yards (estimated) above the tree line.
