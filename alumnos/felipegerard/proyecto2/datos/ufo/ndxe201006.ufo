6/30/10 23:45|Rotterdam (Netherlands)||Light|2-3 minutes|fast moving "star"?|7/6/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76037.html|1|ndxe201006| fast moving &#34;star&#34;?<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I were on the terrace of our penthouse apt.  I drew my son’s attention to a &#34;moving star.&#34;   It looked like a star but it was much brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came from the northeast traveling across the sky to the southwest.  Hard to estimate the altitude, but it looked pretty high. It was definitely not a plane and went way to fast for a helicopter.  We thought that the speed was not constant (stop and go) but that could be an illusion on our part.  Also, it might have been a satellite.  Or the space shuttle, if one happened to be in operation?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the ISS, except for the perceived direction of flight.  Orbiting bodies traditionally do not have a westerly component to their ground-track.  PD))<n>

It was a steady speed. object disappeared and then re-appeared in its original starting postion and now start to move North at a faster pace at a very straight, almost unnatural, line.  Object then disapeared, blinked out, for good. object glowed light yellowish and had no sound.  Entire episode took about 15 seconds. Very Strange!<n>

I noticed through my blinds in the sky 5 amber lights hovering from my vantage point approximately where the I-75, I -475 interchange occurs.  It disappeared within a minute of me noticing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife did not make it in time to see it.  It really freaked me out, because I know my view from my side of the bed, a whole lot of nothing, no trees, no houses, no anything.<n>
6/30/10 23:00|Sikeston|MO|Unknown|45 minutes|Blue lights scanning the sky line|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76883.html|5|ndxe201006| Blue lights scanning the sky line<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 30, 2010, approximately 11:00pm to 11:45pm central time I witnessed four glowing lights and a partially cloned spacecraft above my neighbors yard, precisely hovering above a dog pin.  Lights where hovering ahead of the craft and ahead of a strange looking cloud, apparently monitor things up ahead.  The lights where circling around  75-100 feet from the ground going southeast in the countryside between the towns of Sikeston and Blodget Missouri.  Four rotating lights going clockwise made a complete revolution, then would come together in the center joining together making a fifth light. Afterwards, the rotating lights moved outwards to make another rotation pattern. This continued patterned  lasted for about 30 minutes. The lights where flat and symmetrical, about 10-15 feet across with no visible source of reference and silenced.   Some times, the rotating pattern got larger and come across our street, and other times it got smaller.  The sky was clea! r from were the lights were dancing around, but behind the lights there were some thin cumulus clouds.  The lights moved with the clouds at a very slow pace, perhaps 1 mph.  The sky was visible through the breaking clouds and at times the stars and the partly full moon was visible.   When the clouds rolled across the highline electrical grid it caused some disturbance and made an object temporary visible though the breaking clouds.  The object that was hiding above (or inside) the clouds was temporary visible until it passed the electrical power lines.    This object was black but it appeared like it was shorting out because there where green flairs sparking around it. The size and shape was not visible on account that it was partially cloned and hidden by the cloud.<n>
6/30/10 23:00|Magnolia Township|MN|Light|5 Minutes|Non-blinking/non-changing orange light moving west to east.|7/19/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76584.html|6|ndxe201006| Non-blinking/non-changing orange light moving west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving westbound on I-90 at about 11pm, when we saw an aircraft in sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sure it was probably just an ordinary airplane, but this one seemed odd, because there was no pulsation or variation of the light at all.  No blinking, no change what-so-ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked similar to the way a satellite looks(only considerably bigger and a different color), but appeared to all of us to be much lower in the sky than a satellite.  It seemed to be at about the same altitude that a small aircraft would fly.  I&#39;d estimate maybe only 4 or 5 thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very deep unchanging orange/reddish color.  It was moving the opposite direction as we were (west to east), and was visible for about 5 minutes before it just kind of blinked out.  It wasn&#39;t moving particularly fast.  I&#39;d say maybe in the 100-125mph range?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said, it was probably just a plane I suppose, but I live near MSP and watch planes come in and out all the time, and this was weird looking because it was just static/unchanging.  It almost seemed kind of ominous.  &#39;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe some sort of balloon or flare caught in a fast moving upper air flow?   Who knows.<n>
6/30/10 22:06|Rochester Hill|MI|Light|15 seconds then 30 minute|Red light West bound to South then stop.  90 degrees total angle of flight|7/6/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76036.html|7|ndxe201006| Red light West bound to South then stop.  90 degrees total angle of flight<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night on June 30th in Rochester Hills Michigan, just after 10 pm-10:06 to be exact, from a very white light to the west came a Red Light the went to the South, it was truely red  it went about 90 degrees to almost due south and then stopped for a maybe just under a minute, disappeared and then came back as a white light and stayed and varied in its brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a cell phone clip and many witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cannnot explain how nor why it did what it did but stayed light for at least 45 minutes,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 49 and have never seen anything like this in my life, have a cell phone pic<n>
6/30/10 22:00|Iloilo (Philippines)||Formation|20-30 seconds|faint-lighted glowing dots in different colors (orange, green, blue-green) in a triangular formation.|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84976.html|8|ndxe201006| It all happened after the day where an earthquake happened her in our province in the Philippines.  I, together with my family, went into a mall.   We are all walking when suddenly I watched the sky (we were still outside the mall and we were still far from it) hoping to see the Big Dipper Constellation  (It was night time of course).<n> <n><n> <n><n> But instead of seeing stars, I saw a faint-lighted glowing dots in different colors (orange, green, blue-green) in a triangular formation.  There were three Triangle formation, but the formation at the center is the biggest, while on the side were smaller one. They were in a moderate speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then as they moved forward, the clouds covered them.  I think I was the only one to see those UFOs.  And I swear I know what&#39;s the difference between artificial lights from the mall and those Flying and Glowing objects in triangular formation.<n>

Another appeared possibly 5 minutes after which I saw.  Saw a white segment moving southwest not very high altitude (10,000 maybe) then it just vanished in fron of my eyes.   Shortly after another appeared at much higher altitude, traveled for a short distance and again just vanished.  This moring saw video of Branson UFO from 2009.  Looks as if could be the same thing.<n>
6/30/10 13:00|Goodyear|AZ|Oval||Small oval shape giving off bright light and slowly fading further into the sky|7/6/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76025.html|11|ndxe201006| Small oval shape giving off bright light and slowly fading further into the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked outside and noticed an odd shape in the sky.  I was shocked at the sighting because this was not the first time. A few months prior to this sighting, I saw the same object.  However, this time the object hovered longer as if it were observing something.  The first time, the strange object quickly zipped across the night sky and disappeared from sight.  This time I saw a bright white flash that came from the high school I am attending.  I noticed the strange object was giving off a bright light and would become dull once more and repeat this cycle.  As minutes stretched by it faded from the sky, as if leaving earth.  The shape is oval and the object fades from a musty brown back to a blinding white. I am a young person and not very skeptical.  I&#39;m a see to believe it kind of person.  I just don&#39;t believe in the super natural world but seeing this twice give&#39;s me the chills.  I am fascinated by its mystery but frightening by the unknown.  I want someone to look ! at me and say, your not crazy.<n>

The subject came up of whether or not we had ever seen anything that could be construed as a UFO.  Collectively the both of us have been flying over 60 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The both of us flew full careers in the U.S. Navy and both of us have flown with the U.S. Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, The Blue Angels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend, when asked the question, said that he and his First Officer witnessed something flying over Almaty, Kazakstan.  He was the Captain of a FEDEX MD-11 aircraft, flying between Paris and Hong Kong at an altitude of 34,000 feet.  He and the First Officer witnessed the object together and was able to take several photographs of the object from the cockpit.  Those photos will be e-mailed separately.  He stated that the object was powered and moving at a speed twice that of any aircraft he had seen.<n>
6/30/10 12:00|Glacier National Park (??)|MT|||unknown footage|5/29/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81304.html|13|ndxe201006| unknown footage<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a filmmaker.  I bought a used mini dv camcorder from a pawn shop (at least i think it was from a pawn shop - read on) several years ago and there was a used mini DV tape inside.  I don&#39;t really care to see people&#39;s home movies so I didn&#39;t look at the tape until much later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was importing my own old footage into the computer when I rediscovered this tape.  There was some scenery shots on the tape as well as a shot of the Glacier National Park sign on the tape.  There was only about 3 minutes of footage on the tape and there wasn&#39;t any candid shots of people - just scenery.  It may have been a new tape for the shooters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The tape ends with a shot of some glowing lights zooming through a huge canyon (presumably in GNP?).  I don&#39;t know if it is fake or not...looks real - and if it is faked then how did footage end up on a physical tape inside a camera?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways...I would like to find the people who shot this.  I have purchased sooo many used cameras for shoots throughout the years that I honestly cannot determine when or where I bought this cam with its mysterious tape inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I posted the &#34;ufo&#34; clip on youtube -<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/user/SuperNoneyo?feature=mhee<n> <n><n> <n><n> check it out.

I and another witness were traveling on Old Highway 112 between Cameron and Poteau, Oklahoma, just west of of Gilmore when we saw a shadow in the atmosphere.  The shadow covered thin width and stretched horizontally across half the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I exclaimed, &#34;What the heck is that?&#34;  The other witness said, &#34;What&#34;?  I showed her the shadow and she could not believe what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it must be an atmospheric disturbance of some sort and after about a minute the shadow began to fade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 2 minutes the shadow was gone but a faint smell of smoke was noticed in the air which lasted a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon afterwards where the shadow had been in the sky a wide contrail took its place......<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure what to make of this.......<n>

It seemed to be going very fast but actually vey slowly as if it was going against the grain of our atmosphere.  It made a very loud engine noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had anther ufo sighting in the same area about two weeks later where a two bright lights hovered for around 45 minutes below the clouds the light was a very bright white and blinding on the eyes very slightly if you looked towards its centre it was about 5-7 pm on a light evening they were about a mile away from the previous sighting to the left heading down the hill but closer to the train track past the car park<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I came out to my balcony to smoke a cigarette I was just about to light it when for some reason i turned around, keep in mind im on the second floor when over the roof of my apartments from a distance i saw wat it appeared to be a pyramid shaped object resembling the pyramids of egypt it wasnt as big but i can say it was as big as a two story house but obviously in the shape of a pyramid.  Wat blew my mind tho was the fact that it was a shinning golden pyramid, I could clearly see the lines that outlined each block massive blocks of gold and at the bottom of the pyramid i could see wat was 3 circles positioned as a triangle where fire was coming out of them.  The same thing you see when you look at a back of a fighter jet.   And at the same time it was flying it was spining inot to fast not to slow and it flew at a steady pace, I managed to see it as it was coming when it past right over me thats how! i could see the fire coming out the bottom and still saw as it kept going out of my sight of view i can say the object wast about 3 or 4 stories above me. I would also like to put down that im not trying to get anything out of this no fame no money im just trying to describe wat i saw. It will help me from not going crazy since i really cant tell nobody else thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was with my boyfriend and my best friend one night, and we were being loud in my parents house, so we got in my car, and drove a couple of streets away to a remote street.  I parked, turned off the car and started my iPod.  Maybe 4 minutes go by and we all see this big orange ball of dim light float slowly down from the sky.  It was round.  When it stopped very close, it released an identical ball, only smaller, and it floated off to the right (N), then a second to the left (S), and finally a third, straight below, and it seemed to not know where it was going.  It went to the right, left, right, then went straight down to earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I freaked out thinking it would find us or it was a bomb.  Then the big ball went slowly back up into the sky until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started the car and left.  We all saw it.

I couldn&#39;t get to sleep, and I couldn&#39;t understand why.  The forest around me was very very quiet, which was very unusual. You almost alwaays hear crickets and owls.  I couldn&#39;t sleep and suddenly I heard a hum, and all the hair on my body stood up.  In front of me the scenery became like a sheet of glass. And then that sheet of glass started to ripple.  Just like on the TV show Star Gate 1.  And - it looked just like that; and all of a sudden two alien type creatures walked right past me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They walked right by me, and so close to me that I could feel a breeze as they walked by. I was in shock.  And then as quickly as it started it was over.  They walked through another portal and were gone.  What impressed me was how they walked out of nowhere walked a few yards and disappeared - through the same type of SG1 portal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like reality started to ripple and became a sheet of glass.  I did not &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; a UFO. But I saw aliens!! They didn&#39;t seem to care about me, but later that night I woke up barefooted three hundred yards from my camp, and had no idea how I had gotten there. What I noticed at that time was that the normal sounds of the forest had returned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

So we continued to stare at this object it was bright and just as big as north star from were i stood,so still like a ball of magnesium,very strange because to our left a incoming plane was com! ing in,to land at manchester airport and within seconds this ball of light vanished horizontally to our left leaving a slight trail like moving from A TO B at high speed past this plane but the funny thing about this,nothing on this planet can move like that,like speed of light,it was there clear as day within seconds it shot off i was amazed my cigarette fell out of my mouth i was gobsmacked i laughed and said to brother did i just see that and the speed it left this atmosphere he said yes and i think the plane did too,cos it circled within the same area for almost 30 mins before it flew towards airport.I believe it was a UFO there is no other explanation i also believe they seem too appear in well open terriotories these sighting or places of lesser population,to this day i still think of that night pity i live in more urban enviroment now,i like answers like why was it so still and then left so quickly and why wasnt this mentioned and kept hush hush, which is wrong cause! its interesting and if thier was an invasion thats big if peo! ple shou ld prepare and be told of such things more publically,the amount of destruction and mayhem this earth as sustained its no wonder we get sneak peeks of UFO&#39;s because even they are not stupid enough to stay and land lol<n>

Then the really strange things happened.   A plane entered into the sky and the &#34;light&#34; went out.  After the plane was gone, the light came back on.  This happened 4 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter got her 10X optical zoom, 40X digital zoom camera and started taking pictures and got a very good and clear shot of the 3 light triangular pattern,as well as a short video.

6/29/10 23:30|Salina|KS|Light|1 hour|Flashing red light in south western sky emits light orbs and is seemingly pursued by a fightert. ((NUFORC Note:  Celestial body?  PD))|7/6/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76023.html|25|ndxe201006| Flashing red light in south western sky emits light orbs and is seemingly pursued by a fighter jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 11:30pm central and I was outside in my backyard on the phone with a friend, looking at the stars as I frequently do when I&#39;m outside, and I notice a flashing red light sitting in the sky to the south west.  I continue on with my conversation just watching it when it starts to move east still flashing. I ask my friend who lives about 7 blocks north of me to go outside and look, he sees it as well but dismissed it since he has work in the morning. So we get off the phone and I continue watching it, it then changes direction from moving east to moving west immediately without slowing and appeared to continue at the same speed it had been going, which is when I decided to go inside and tell my Father to come out and look.  So we go to our back yard and continue observing it, it then starts moving from west to north.  We watch it for a little while, every now and then the light would just stop then resume 10-20 seconds later, not in sequence, just at random times this would happen.  It continued doing strange maneuvers such as ascending and descending quickly, changing direction without slowing, sometimes stopping altogether, and changing speed sporadically from very slow to fast. It stays in about the same general area, to the south and to the west turning, moving back and forth up and down over that area.  We were already amazed by how it was changing direction immediately with no change of speed, it didn&#39;t slow down it simply started moving the opposite direction in an instant, and did that numerous times.  After a while of this it is in the same area, still south west but slightly more west, and it stops as it had done a few times before.  This next part happens over the span of 3-4 seconds:  When it stops the light goes off, also as it had done numerous times beforehand, and suddenly emits a very very bright white orb of light about twice the size of the initial flashing red object we had been observing, and I&#39;m talking ! really bright, this white orb seemingly splits into 2 orbs of ! light, o ne descending and one ascending which both dim and go out very quickly. As I said that happened over the course of 3-4 seconds, and was quite extraordinary. The object then resumes moving, and is heading west to a point where the tree line behind our house was blocking our view so we couldn&#39;t see it. Over the course of the next 10 or more minutes we would see it over the tree line a few times, moving south, sometimes north, and still flashing. At a few points in time over the course of the whole observation when the blinking would cease, rather than us not seeing it which had happened a few times, it would appear as just a solid red light moving, then continue flashing. The flashes were slow the whole time they were happening, not in perfect sequence but each was about one second apart, sometimes slightly faster sometimes slightly slower. So at this point we&#39;re only seeing it every now and then over the treeline, until it moves farther west to the point where we don&#39;t see it! at all for about 5 minutes. It had never made any noise. There are many fighter jets at our airport currently, they fly over many times a day, they are much louder and fly much lower than the commercial planes that fly over town do, about the same altitude the propeller planes fly at. One takes off from the airport which is about 1 1/2 miles west of our house, we saw it ascend from the area of the airport, it was flying low, looped around east over the very edge of town not far from our house with all of it&#39;s lights on, and as it turned south west the engines got much louder, and took off fast in the direction of the object we had been observing until it too moved far enough that the tree line prevented us from seeing it. We continued watching  for a while and neither returned. It was right about 12:25am when we decided to go in since it was late and the event appeared to be over. I&#39;ve returned outside numerous times over the course of the night and it has not returned, an! d obviously decided it was worth reporting, in hopes somebody ! else may have seen this. It has inspired me to buy a high definition video camera, it would have been amazing to have recorded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Celestial body?  PD))<n>

It was crazy, the sky turned purple, the wind picked up, it got cold, I thought there was going to be a tornado for sure.  Well upon inspection of the photo the next morning, there is something else in the picture.  At first I attributed it to the zoom and me moving a little bit, but I can tell that I wasn&#39;t moving that much because you can tell by looking at the Kroger and Starbucks signage.  Look above the Starbucks sign, in the darker purple area just above the lighter purple, there are 3 green lights.  You cant miss them.  It&#39;s not a glare, because I was standing outside and there was not a car driving toward me.  Anyway, I&#39;m not saying it was a UFO, but I am saying it is weird!<n>

As the object came closer to being directly over us, it turned red and disappeared.  About one hour later (give or take), another object appeared and disappeared.  The second object did not turn red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The conditions were a clear night, normal starry night.  The airplane traffic was normal for the time of evening and is always to the south of us.  The objects came from the west going east.  We were on the north side of our home.  There was no aircraft in pursuit or near the objects.  No missing time, strange happenings etc.<n>

This time though, I saw an orange light almost directly above my house, in east Lincoln.  It was a little bigger than a star and moving very slowly.  It took approximately 8 minutes for it to get 2 houses down from mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after, it seemed to move directly away from me very quickly as I could see the light getting smaller and fading out.  It didn’t blink like the lights on a plane, nor did it move like a plane or helicopter.  It also made no sound.<n>

We got out all of our flashlights and a high powered green laser pointer which we preceded to shine/flash at the craft.  It slowly turned to the east and passed out of sight.  About 10 minutes later at 11:03 p.m. est, it came back overhead very slowly from the southeast.  There was ABSOLUTELY no noise emitted from the craft throughout the entire experience.  We all stood up to get a better look at the brilliant ball of light when what I can only describe as a porthole of intensely bright white light opened up from the mid/bottom part of the visible area on the craft and shined us back as we had shined it.  This porthole then closed again and the craft went back to its original level of brightness.  It continued to fly over us at a constant slow speed and altitude.  After it passed over us it sped up and! disappeared into the night sky over Lake Michigan heading Northwest.  No loss of time was experienced during or after the sighting.<n>

We were staring up at the stars and discussing this and that as far as astrology and things of that nature when I noticed a ball of light moving across the sky.  I immediately told my Mom and pointed it out for her to locate as it continued across the night sky.  It looked very similar to a star but as it got to be directly over head it went from a star like glow to a much more intense brightness that I could almost characterize as gleaming.  As the object moved off in a North Western direction it&#39;s intesity lessened and then in a blink of an eye it just disappeared.  There were no beacon lights as if on airplanes blinking or otherwise.  There is no way this could have been mistaken for a regular commercial airliner.  I know this because we sat out for another hour after this sighting identifying actual airplanes and making sure they loo! ked nothing like what we had just witnessed. (10 Minutes before this sighting I witnessed something very similar and also pointed this out to my Mom but it was much dimmer and less noticable in the night sky.)<n>

We were taking a final look at the stars before going to bed, and I noticed a bright red and orange light below the moon.  I pointed it out to my fiancé, and just as he saw it too, another blinked on diagonally above the first, followed by another, forming a small arc of red and orange lights.  They hovered there without movement or sound for about thirty seconds before they all disappeared together.  I ran inside to get my camera, but they never returned.<n>

Maybe about the diameter of a teaspoon when held at arm&#39;s length when directly above me, growing smaller as it grew more distant.  I compared what I was seeing to several airplanes I could see in the sky at various distances and traveling in various directions.  Looked nothing like them.

There appeared to be beams emitting from the craft every three minutes or so.  It appeared spherical at first,orb-shaped,but then would morph into a diamond shape,and the bluish-white light would pulsate.It changed from spherical to diamond shaped about four times during this period.  Finally,it gained altitude and moved south,towards the coast.this was seen by myself and many others.<n>

I saw something reflecting in the sky that caught my attention and pointed it out to my husband.  It was traveling from East to West, was silver, and cigar or oval shape.  We kept discussing what we thought it could be, since we were intrigued by this &#34;thing&#34; in the sky.  There was no contrail from a jet/airplane and it seemed to be hovering at times, so we ruled out that option.  My husband then thought it could be the Space Station reflecting off the sun, so we called a friend who then went to the Space Station Tracking site.  He called us back and said the Space Station was not in our area at that particular time and the Space Station only travels from West to East.  During this time, my husband pulled over the truck so I could look through our binoculars, but I could never find the object when I used them.  My husband tried! as well, but our binoculars must not be that magnified.  We then continued on our way home, while following this object in the sky.  It seemed to move very slowly and would stop and hover.  We could still see the object slowly moving when we turned and pulled over on Cty. Rd. O towards home.  While traveling on Cty. Rd. O, we lost sight of this silver bright object due to the valley, bluffs and trees.  We never saw it again.<n>
6/28/10 19:00|Columbus|IN|Cigar|5-10 Mins|Chrome Blimp, miles in the air, travels halfway across horizon at same speed before beginning to emit a disturbing chemtrail.|7/6/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76024.html|44|ndxe201006| Chrome Blimp, miles in the air, travels halfway across horizon at same speed before beginning to emit a disturbing chemtrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After stepping out of Fairoaks Mall in Columbus, IN around 7:00 p.m. I noticed what I first thought was a BLIMP, only MILES higher than any blimp I&#39;ve ever seen before. I began to watch it as it traveled across the sky very slowly.  It was low for a jet or commercial plane, but still much higher than any blimp you would normally see.  I began to think maybe it was a weather balloon of some type, but eventually decided that since it was traveling on such a direct path that it must be some sort of vehicle with an engine.  I was first surprised by the fact of a blimp so high in the air at first, but what really surprised me was what happened after it had traveled halfway across the sky.  It was traveling at the same speed, never stopped or slowed or sped up, yet when it had traveled roughly halfway across the horizon it spat out a huge chunk of white &#34;smoke&#34;.  Then about 3-5 seconds later it spit out another hunk of what I thought was smoke.  Now there were 2 dashes ! of smoke across the sky coming from what I thought was a blimp.  My second witness also witnessed these puffs of smoke.  However, seconds after these two puffs were spat out, it began to emit a CONSTANT trail of this smoke like substance, just like your typical Chemtrail (or Contrail, I suppose).  After traveling at the same speed completely across the horizon, this Blimp (which looked like a cigar covered in Aluminum foil) just SUDDENLY, out of nowhere without changing a thing in trajectory, speed, or altitude, began to omit a chemtrail. It literally looked like a giant crop-dusting blimp, miles in the air.  The thought of it made us feel extremely eerie and upset for the remainder of the day.<n>

The light was moving faster than what I thought it should be and also observed that there were no navigational lights that an aircraft would be flashing (green for right and red for left). The light continued to the northeast with no sound until I saw an obvious aircraft with navigational lights travelling to the northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> he light stopped as if it was at a traffic light and as soon as the obvious aircraft passed, the light continued on it&#39;s northeastern path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that was pretty strange and approx. a half hour or 45 minutes later while walking back to the office, something was biting the left side of my neck. Thinking it was a bug of sometype, I tried squishing it on my neck but the intense biting sensation continued.  Thinking it was a bug bite of sometype, I ignored the painful bite for a couple of days until I saw a nurse who worked at the same place I do.  I asked her to look at this painful bug bite for me on my neck and upon looking at it, she informed me that it was a burn and not a bite.  She said the burn was a triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A day or two later, I had my son take a picture of the triangular burn and upon relating what happened and expecting him to laugh at me, he immediately went to the computer and pulled up a very similar triangular mark on a male allegedly made by aliens when he was abducted. While I wasn&#39;t abducted, the uncanny similiarity of the two triangular marks, both appearing like arrowheads, leads me to be suspicious of what I really saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night, no clouds, stars could easily be seen, and there were no fires or any other instruments/equipment near me that could have burned me in such a manner.  I still have the scar on my neck as well as the pictures of the burn.<n>

I looked up to see a light which appeared to be very high moving very fast.  I was facing south and the the object was visible above a building in front of me, moving south as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the distance the object appeared very small, and was indiscernable as anything other than a single bright blue light.  The best discription i can give is that it looked excactly like a meteor, and in fact at first i thought that was what i had seen.  The difference was that this object had no tail associated with meteors i have seen in the past, and it zig-zagged, darting both to the right and left before dissappearing.  It was only visible for just over a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work with aircraft every day and am used to seeing them at night both civilian and military, this was not like anything i have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

6/27/10 00:00|Hat Creek|CA|Diamond|10-15 seconds|Two sightings of the same object  within 22 hours of each other in Northern California|7/6/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76033.html|49|ndxe201006| Two sightings of the same object  within 22 hours of each other in Northern California<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is two events within 21 hours of each other. At approximately 12:40am Sunday the 27th my friend and I went outside to talk and we were seated facing west. I was looking up to the southwest a bit when a bright flash of light with a diamond shape object in the middle just appeared. It came in really fast through what I call a portal, with a bright flash of light. AS it entered it stopped in the sky almost as fast as it came in and floated slowly from my left to right, a south to north movement as I could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the initial bright flash of light as it broke into our atmosphere and as it began it&#39;s glide/descent, the light quickly faded but not light instant on instant off. It just dimmed but as the celestial craft dimmed it also began to cloak or transform into a small light behind the foliage of the tree. I could see the small light just either go away from me or disappear altogether. My friend witnessed some of the event but not all; from the dimming glide to the small light. This event took about 10 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in total awe but the initial reaction I felt was that stir in your stomach and that tinge of fear that comes from seeing something so celestial you just know it is not of this world. I thought. &#34;Oh my God&#34; and I exclaimed &#39;what is that!?!&#34; which was then when my friend pulled the focus. I could see the object/craft so clearly as it entered our airspace, and I say that because I have seen many things concerning outer/inner world phenomenon like fireballs screaming across the sky, meteors striking our atmosphere so hard I could see the outer layer of earth&#39;s atmosphere and even sightings of UFO&#39;s floating in the sky. This brightness entered our earth and came to a halt as if it was the easiest thing an aircraft could do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting came at 9:35pm the very same day, Sunday 27th and lasted more or less about a minute. Me and my friends jokingly said, &#34;let&#39;s sit outside and lets see em again.&#34; We looked in the same position and my friend says,&#34;here they come&#34; but in a joking manner because he saw a bright star coming at us. He said it again, and then again and I realized the pitch in his voice changed and this object was moving straight towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving, no gliding across the sky from west(southwest) to east(northeast). It was in perfect view and I could see the diamond shape craft/celestial with a light that was so bright and . . . pure. I mean, I can&#39;t really describe it because I have NEVER seen such beautiful white bright light like this celestial emanated. It was smooth as glass and it was so bright and white there was this hue of blue in the center of the diamond shape... incredible beauty of light! It was so . . . pure  It was too early for a star to be this bright. Even Venus was dim because there was light in the sky still. This was as pure brightness and a color of light I had never seen.  As it moved across the sky it was unworldly in its movement. By that I mean unlike any aircraft we know today. Not like a plane or even a high flying jet aircraft. They ALL move with a worldly rhythm but this moved so effortlessly across the sky at a pace that is not of this planet.  It glided without movement or turbulence of any kind and the brightness of the light NEVER wavered.  It stayed beautiful and bright throughout the course of it&#39;s flight until it went out of our vision.  It moved from west to east and it was SILENT and PERFECT! NO SOUND came from this celestial at all.  I ran from one yard to another yard to follow the flight path and I tried videotaping it but I could not capture it.  I&#39;ll look again but it was dark on camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know something big is happening. It just falls into place with what I know is occurring with the planets.  My psychic ability tells me that we are in a transformation for all the human race but now I realize this is on a much larger scale than even I had foreseen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still in awe and I know this is not just another sighting, I just know that. Seeing something move across the sky is one thing; watching a diamond craft/celestial enter our airspace, and come to a halt like it did with such ease is another.  Maybe it didn&#39;t know, or care, that I saw it enter but it wanted us/me to see it later that evening.  It was clear and not fuzzy, it was close and not far away although I cannot tell the size from its flight.  It looked HUGE when it entered the portal early morning but much smaller when we saw it later.  I/we saw it clearly and it was, for lack of better words, beautifully perfect.<n>
6/27/10 23:12|Monterey|CA|Light|20 min.|Two brilliant blue and green lights that were observed for about 15 mins. that moved in an erratic fashion independent of each other.|7/6/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75989.html|50|ndxe201006| Two brilliant blue and green lights that were observed for about 15 mins. that moved in an erratic fashion independent of each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 11:12 PM on the 28th of June I received a phone call on my cell from my brother who lives about 4 miles from my location.  He wanted me to go outside and see if I could observe the lights he was looking at north of his location and close to the horizon.  I immediately went outside and looked in the direction he had indicated and was able to see a faint green light just above the horizon northeast of me which appeared to be somewhere near the direction of Ft Ord.  I told him to grab his digital video camera and film what we were seeing.  I immediately went inside and grabbed some binoculars and was able to distinguish a brilliant green light moving erratically near the horizon.  The light would move in an approximately east to west direction at a slow pace, randomly stop and hover then move again in spurts and change direction very rapidly.  It took about 5 minutes for me to locate the other light, which was blue in color, and I was able to observe both lights moving independent of each other.  The blue light would periodically disappear and then come back into view.  Generally it would appear as if the blue light would take off vertically and disappear behind the cloud cover.  At other times my view of the blue light was obscured by intervening trees. The blue light eventually disappeared from my view even though my brother did indicate that he could still see it.  At no time did I observe any navigational lights that would indicate that either of these objects were some kind of aircraft.  The movement also was unlike any aircraft that I have observed in the past.  After about 15 minuets the lights disappeared altogether.<n>

Still Daylight.  Periodic slight cirrus types of clouds were in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the pool at my friends house in Plano , Texas.  I looked up into the sky looking east and noticed a tiny pulsing REDish Gold spec of light in the air.  It was moving northward very slowly. The object was about the size of a head of a pin seen at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed for about 5 minutes.  It stopped moving and stayed in a stationary position..  I said to myself that i am going to go to my car to get my digital canon camera.  And i did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When i got back it was hard to relocate the object at first but i finally was able.  It was sitting there for another 4 minutes and then slowly moved off to the north...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Minutes later, I noticed another Goldish red orb in another area in the sky.  Basically overhead but  just a few degrees off to the south from just overhead...  It was larger  or lower and perhaps at the cirrus cloud height.  I took a few pictures with my canon camera..   Again it was still broad daylight and it almost seemed to glisten in a red gold type of light..  It was not close enough to tell if it was actually metallic or if it was a light.  I decided for some strange reason to turn the flash on the camera to on..  When I did that and took a photo.  The object that was standing stationary in the sky for about 5 minutes rapidly accelerated toward the southwest..   And then accelerated again and vanished. It was a two stage acceleration, going from still to rapid speed m then suddenly accelerates again to super fast and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When looking at the photo that I took,  and after I enlarged it,  looks  like all those other photos that you would see of UFOs in the national enquirer, and I laughed to myself..<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the naked eye it was more visible and did not represent any known aircraft.  It was neither a bird nor a balloon.  I did not know of any bird or balloon that will accelerate the way this thing did, or stay stationary they it did while being watched in the North Texas sky..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photo to be sent in Email<n>

We parked at the new Anson townhomes subdivision and walked in the backway to the lake.  Me and one of my step brothes walked to the car at about midnight to grab some stuff, he said WOW! Look at that. I seen up to 30 red or orange lights spreading apart.  I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes I had to walk closer they were I would guess no more than 500 feet up. I rubbed my eyes I though they where red lights like on the top of electrical poles, BUT they where moving.  After they spread apart One buy one they either dissipated or headed REAL fast east towards carmel.  I then proceeded to call the Boone County Sheriff. I said &#34; I really don&#39;t know if I wanna gice my name or even report this incident but I just seen something wierd&#34; SHE PROCEEDED TO SAY &#34;  Was it the red lights&#39; needless to say I was pretty freaked out.  I said yes, and gave her my description, and told ! her i was freaked , she said an officer at the crystal flash seen them and pretty much gave her the exact report.  We went back to fishing needless to say our other stepbrother really didn&#39;t believe us.  My other witness said that when he seen it first it was like a line, or possibly a triangle, and when it spread apart he said it made a geometric pattern or design that he could connect with lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I got a call at 12:15 from the police.  She told me she called the airport and the military, nothing is going on but there was one plane somewhere in the area.  And the officer that seen it wanted to file a report with the military and the initernational airport police,  And wanted to use my name. I gave themm permission.  We didnt get a bite all night kinda wierd.  We left at 2:45 when we got back to our vehicle to our surprise there was 2 red lights in the sky! NOW WE ALL have seen them .  PLUS others where emitting from the ground which could not have been more than 5 miles away.  They had white almost emulsions then would turn into the balls! of ligh ts.  Each one would come up , then towards us ,then sit for a minute, then fade away straight north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the police during this action which went on for up to 15 minutes they would not even harldy talk to me I asked if anyone else is reporting this they went blank, and flat told me &#34;there is nothing we can do&#34; we had to have seen all 30 of them coming up but only around 10 of them would be there at once before another would be moving north and fading away.  I think they were right over zionsvile and within a quarter mile of us. It felt REAL CLOSE.  I tried to take a pic with my cell phone but it didnt show up. After wards we talked for a while thinkn no one will believe us.  BUT if anyone else seen what I seen PLEASE let it be known.  Especially that cop.  So Im still kinda freaked. its the wierdest thing Ive ever seen . Thinkn about goin back next saturday around midnight or a little earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let you know if i see anything. IF I COULD HELP IN ANYWAY CONTACT ME THX.<n>

I stepped out into the yard to see what it was.  The light was very bright.  What made it interesting is that the light was solid and not blinking.  It was probably about 2,000 to 3,000 feet off the ground.  It was moving in a straight line.  No noise was heard from the triangle shaped object.  As I watched this craft moving to the east and it started to fade from my line of sight, I heard jets taking off from the nearby Charleston AFB.  Were they trying to chase this craft?   As the craft got further away to the east it started changing colors rapidly from red to blue to white and green.<n>

It was very big and glowing at least 5 times more then any star.  In fact it is full moon and it had almost the same intensity.  Everything happened in Corby, Northampton United Kingdom.  After like 2 seconds it got above us and it did a sudden move to the right and back to initial position.  This move was repeated one more time and then it increased speed and passed over our heads.  It looked like it stopped for a few seconds moved left and right in this time and after that it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was bizarre to me since it looked like a stingray; there were 4 orange lights one on top two on the sides and one at the tail.  They did not blink or change intensity all the time.  The colour was a very beautiful orange and intense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just want to add the sky was clear there were 18 Celsius or 64 Fahrenheit and also it was a full moon.  The UFO was way to big in order to be mistaken with a star or an airplane.  There was no sound from it or anything else that will get your attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to take a picture with my cell phone but nothing came clear.

It was hovering near the constellations of Cepheus and Cassiopea.  It was nearly motionless though it appeared to move vertically very slowly during the two minutes it was visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange reddish light had a flickering appearance and was slightly larger than the apparent size of the ISS and was much less bright than the ISS.  My best guess on apparent magnitude would be roughly 1.0.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After two minutes the light disappeared from sight.  The light made no sound and appeared to be roughly 2-4 miles away.  It had no navigation lights, anti-collision strobes or landing lights like the normal air traffic in this area.  The local visibility was excellent with no clouds in the sky and no haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The closest approximation to what I saw would be sky lanterns made from dry cleaning bags but this looked different.<n>

We were having a party at a restaurant on Lake Norman and everyone walked out onto the dock and saw many slowly moving red objects coming overhead, from the North West.  They were too slow to be planes or shooting stars and too fast to be hot air balloons.  They were red lights that looked relatively large and were all traveling in a group. There was a cloud directly overhead of us and as all of the U.F.O.s passed it, they all disappeared at the same spot!  It looked like they were burning out or turning off a light.  We did not see any U.F.O.s after they passed the cloud over head of us because all of their lights went out.  The duration of the event lasted from about 9:50 to 10:00 PM and after they all traveled past in that 10 minute time span, there were no more.<n>

Fifteen minutes had past an in another direction we saw 5 of the same fireball moving in the opposite direction.  They were much slower.  They came towards our direction, stopped momentarialy and then continued to moved and eventually all of them dissapeared at different times.  we were also able to catch it on video tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After it traveled from left to right it hesitated, and then traveled sharply back to the left for a short time, and then changed direction again to proceed to travel to the right out of the scope of the skylight. I ran outside to follow it further but it was no longer there.  I feel that it could not have been a space station or a satellite sighting because it moved too fast and because of the way it changed direction. When I first saw it through my skylight I thought it was a shooting star or a comet.   If I was to try to debunk this account I would take into consideration that we live within 120 miles + or - of the Norfolk air force navy base.  I would first consider this either a shooting star based on it’s appearance or a test rocket from said base, however it rapidly changed direction and speed.  This was no rocket in low altitude and it was no space station.  I understand that rockets and earthly crafts travel fast, however this damn thing was booking.   I first thought it to be a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To be perfectly frank I was offended by the rudeness of the hotline phone proctor who asked me to summarize this in ten seconds and after five would interrupt because he needed to go to a social engagement.  If this organization’s goal is to obtain all ufo sightings, it would be nice to show patience for every caller who takes the time to call this hotline to hear their description of the sighting and to assist them in reporting it.  I was very excited to share this sighting and was disappointed that the staff was not interested in what I had to share.  I hope in the future you will have time to answer the call when it is first made so I will not have to call again nor have someone else speak to the hotline on my behalf in order to seriously be heard by an organization that represents itself as one that wants to hear about strange sightings encountered whenever and wherever they occur.  I do not understand the goal of this organization.  I thought it was to receive informati! onal accounts of ufo sighting or reports as stated in the name.<n>

I was laying out at the pool, with friends, I was looking at the clouds, wondering if it was going to rain, patchy cloud cover,with a giant clear blue sky in center of clouds.  I noticed one cloud had to holes in it, and could see sky through them, as I went from cloud to cloud just looking at how wonerful the sky was.  I noticed a brown comtrail heading east,that was well above the clouds, I followed the comtrail to another cloud, and as my eye met that cloud an Orb appeared from nowhere under the clouds, it was grey and spherical in shape it was moving west at a speed of an airliner, it seem to spin and catch the sun it went from dull grey to shinny metalic,with a gold like rim on the forward front of sphere,then it became pure white, it blinked one time a larger whitness, then I thought to myself it see&#39;s me,maybe 5 seconds I saw it, it traveled apx 1 mile, and just then it disappeared into the pure blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I told my friend sitting next to me I just saw a ufo, he said yeah right, well as he was cracking jokes, I kept looking up to the sky, about 1 minute latter in the open blue sky, away from all the clouds, what now appears to be a metorite stars to fall towards earth,apx 100,000 ft, I yell to my friend thats no jet, and he yelled hell no, it&#39;s moving way to fast. It was a pure white short comtrail, I noticed a redish point small like a pixtel, as we watch it free fall, it turned off the comtrail for a second then back on, leaving a dash in the sky, it&#39;s comtrail maybe a mile long, I thought maybe it&#39;s a metorite, but it leveled off and went west, 50000 ft, about a minute later, as were watching, a jet flying so high and fast had same brown color comtrail as I observed earlier,now was chasing after this object,west, but the object had to be 50 miles if not more ahead of him. I watched ufo until I could no longer see tail, it faded into the blue sky, but I would guess it w! as in Iowa by then.The comtrail from jet was 10miles long,but this orb, its tail was very short and pure white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw, I am self taugh in many things, I have studied ufo&#39;s and never, ever wanted to see one.

I looked to the horizon and noticed how pretty the moon was (it was low and orange). So I backed up, and stopped to admire it.  As I was looking at it, there was a very bright star above it.  It was then I noticed it was moving! It was moving about the pace of an airplane.  When I first saw it next to the moon it was in the west.  It was headed southeast. I ran to the house and got my father, and he ran out just in time to see it too.  It never changed direction, just kept heading in a straight path.  We watched it go until it was past the tree line and we could no longer see it.  But it was a single bright glowing, round, white object, looking just like a star.<n>

We were on our way to highcliff. Our tire blew so we had to pull over to change it.  When the car was jacked up we heard a loud wooshing sound.  We were conviced it was the wind of the storm, but it continued to accelerate in volume.  So, we looked around and in the field to the right of us there was a blinding light similar to lightning, but it was lingering too long to actually be lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked up to see a circular shape moving across the sky in a painstakingly slow straight line.  Then, we saw a half of a circle fall to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We immediately grabbed the flashlight to find this object and nothing was there.<n>

Object was shaped like a three spoke, or Mercedes or peace logo. It had a white light a the end of each spoke and one in the center of spokes. There was a blue light on each spoke just inside the white ones.  The craft was suspended in air as I drove under it.  There was a hushed jet engine sound, or a sound like a hot air balloon getting a charge of hot air. The white lights looked to be completely around the spoke, like a gas lantern globe.  The white lights on the spokes changed in intensity and blocked out the blue ones. Then the white lights on the spokes went down in intensity and the middle white light brightened even more than the three spoked ones, when it went down the white spoke lights brightened again, but not all at the same time as earlier. I was still driving very slow, and it disappeared over some trees as I dove under and by it starting up a tree covered hill. I quickly turned a! round and when I got back to the open location ( 20- 25 seconds? ), the object was gone. This was on a full moon night without a cloud in the sky, visibility was excellent and I had a good view as it was a large valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

There were several blue lights along the length of the spokes between the white center and white end lights.  The blue lights were so bright when first observed that I thought they were long blue tube lights.  As I approached the craft, all the blue lights went off except for one on each spoke next to the end white one, and the white lights pulsed in different sequences as I coasted to a stop just below the craft.  The white lights ( four total ) were bigger and brighter than the blue lights.  The craft was hovering just above the tree tops silently off the side of the road.  The UFO floated over me ( I was in a convertible with top down ) and as it did a hushed jet engine sound with a loud &#34;crackle&#34; in it was audible and went silent again after it passed over me.  It disappeared over the tree tops just off the left side of the road, and I was unable to locate it after turning around and looking for it.  The night was clear with a full moon.<n>

I was a passenger on the left side of the cabin, with a view to the north out my window.  Lights in the cabin were dimmed aside from a few reading lights and television screens for the inflight entertainment. It was probably sometime between 11:20 and 11:50 pm.  The weather was mostly clear, with the stars and moon easily visible and a very small amount of light left from sunset at the northwestern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our flight was beginning to make its initial descent to the Albany airport, but still very high- as the cruising altitude of the flight was announced to be 39,000 feet.   As a former resident of Upstate NY, I could determine when we flew over Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we began approaching what I believe to be Utica, and possibly Rome to the North, I noticed a bright point of warm white light which at a quick glance would apprear to be a bright star or planet (no blinking ! to indicate it was a commercial aircraft,) to the north.  It was moving significantly faster than our aircraft to the ENE direction.   As it was to my eyes, simply a small, steady light, there was no way to determine how large or far away it was from our jet.  It is entirely possible that it was a high-altitude aircraft, or satellite, but it seemed to be moving much more quickly than satellites I&#39;ve observed from a stationary position on the ground. I was only able to observe it for a minute or so, as it flew somewhat parrallel and higher than aircraft, then quickly away.  There was no change of speed during the sighting.  The light appeared to be flying in a straight line, although I may have seen it swerve slightly a couple of times- possibly due to air movement between myself and the object, or the movement of our aircraft.  No other passengers that I was near seemed to notice anything, and as I was traveling alone, I did not alert anyone around me to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I consider myself a skeptic, and I am making this report simply because it was something that I could not easily identify.  It did not look the same as other commercial or military aircraft I&#39;ve seen from an airplane, and it was thousands of feet higher than necessary for a plane to use landing lights.<n>

As we drove down our street there was a craft banking towards us as it moved left.  It was triangular shaped with blue lights on the back that almost looked like afterburners. It had red light on the side.  At first i thought it was just a low flying plane from the neerby airport but I have a pilots license and i know planes.  I can tell you that that was NOT a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we arrived home i turned on the police scanner and there were 7 calls of house alarms going off all at once.

We&#39;re right where the Indiana and Michigan state lines meet, and also where St. Joseph and Elkhart counties in Indiana meet.  There were no clouds in the sky and it was about an hour after sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were outside doing fireworks for the kids when my daughter said &#34;look, a UFO!&#34;  I thought she had seen a plane but when I looked, there was a very bright red light in the east, less than 10 degrees above the horizon and I would guess about 5 miles from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light moved from east to west, right toward us.  It only took about 20 seconds to get to us, and it grew in size very quickly.  At its closest, I&#39;d say it was the size of a dime held at arm&#39;s length.  There were no flashing lights but it was giving off a VERY bright red light from what appeared to be inside.  It was the most incredible red, like a massive Christmas tree light but it didn&#39;t really flicker.  It wasn&#39;t just a glowing light because we could see there was some structure to it by the way the light didn&#39;t come from beneath it.  There was no sound at all, even at it&#39;s closest, which I&#39;d guess to be less than 1/2 mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it got to its closest point to us, it changed direction and turned 90 degrees to its right and headed north over southern Cass county, Michigan.  An airplane would have had to make an arc to change direction.  This thing simply stopped moving west and started heading north.  We clearly knew it wasn&#39;t a meteor, which would have been much faster and kept going straight.  I went into the house to get the video camera but I couldn&#39;t find the buttons to start it up.  Within 20 seconds after it turned, the object was out of sight.  As it flew away, it appeared to rise a little in the sky and the light rapidly grew faint as it flew away.  My wife tried to get pictures with her still camera but we captured nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four of us are absolutely certain it wasn&#39;t an airplane or helicopter, by the way it moved, the bright red light, and the fact there was no sound even as close as it got to us.

We were outside watching the space station pass overhead, and while the space station was still visible, we observed the small red glow moving up from the horizon.  It didn&#39;t look like a plane; it looked too big, and it wasn&#39;t blinking, although it did change from red to orange and yellow at inconsistent intervals.  It reminded me of some very slow-moving meteor gradually fizzling out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose it could possibly have been the sunset reflecting off of a plane, although that doesn&#39;t seem likely either; the glow moved toward us across the sky for maybe 40 seconds, before finally seeming to slow, stop, and then quickly fade away and disappear.  My father and I waited for a while to see if we saw anything that looked like a plane continuing along the same path, and didn&#39;t see anything at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, interestingly, I saw some very distant blinking lights that looked like those of planes, traveling right across and perpendicular to the path of that red glow.  How they were traveling was weird; I saw one set of blinking lights move from east to west, I looked away, and when I looked back, there was an identical set of lights moving west to east along what looked like the same path.  This repeated again; I guess I saw at least four planes traveling on almost exactly the same path in opposite directions, or the same plane changing direction three times. The lights didn&#39;t look like those of a helicopter and none of the flying objects made any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m aware of Wright Patterson Air Force base being about 30 miles away, but it&#39;s northeast of my location unlike those strange lights, and I&#39;ve never been aware of any strange flying objects before.<n>

It was about 9:45pm.  I was driving and we were all admiring the full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a red light in the sky at a 5 o’clock position from the moon.  I thought it might be a planet and asked them that.  It was about the size of the North Star when it first appears in the night sky.  My daughter said if it was a planet it would be Mars because of the color.  We were all looking at it and noticed that it was not steady in the sky and was pulsing slightly.  It was not moving in big movements but steady, like when a helicopter is trying to stay stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were watching it trying to figure out what it was its glow changed in size and its color was a vibrant red glow.  It increased over 20% of its original size and continued pulsing.  I asked my sister to get her camera out of her purse so we could get some video of it.  As she was getting it out of her purse it decreased in size and went to how it was before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned off the road I was on and traveled down a residential road with my hand out the driver’s side window taking video of the object.  I had to stop when a car came up behind me.  I turned towards home and that is when my daughter said that it is gone.   When we pulled into our driveway I went to search the sky to see if there were any planes or anything, but nothing was there.  Just the full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what we saw, but I know it is nothing I have ever viewed in the night sky before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time I first noticed it to the time it vanished was close to 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will get the video from my sister as soon as she returns from vacation and send it in.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live a short distance from where this incident took place.  This is my report, and I am an expert U.S. Government typist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday,  June 25, 2010, at around 3:00 PM, I was in town doing some shopping at our local Kroger store on the Scottsville Road.  The day was clear, hot, and humid.  When I came out of the Kroger store I saw a man in the parking lot looking up into the sky, so I decided to have a look for myself.  We both saw to our amazement what looked like a flying disk or saucer-type object traveling straight across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I dismissed it as a balloon, but the longer I watched it I began to wonder exactly what it was that we were seeing.  The object was large, and looked to be twice the size of an automobile.  There were no other around either.  It was about a mile away as close as I could tell.  The object was disk-shaped and was a very shiny silver color.  There looked t! o be indentations or lights around the edges of the object as well.  The main reasons I began to truly wonder if it was a balloon was these.  The object traveled in a very straight path line where as a balloon would wobble up and down and not fly in a straight formation.  As the silver object flew it tilted from one side to the other about a mile apart each time as if showing off.  First it tilted and flew sideways with its top showing, and then it would tilt again and fly sideways with the bottom showing.  The object repeatedly  did this over and over again the whole fives minutes I watched it.  If it was a craft it may have been going out of control.  There were no streamers of markings on, or attached, to the object like a balloon would have either.  It continued flying along at the same altitude.  I put my groceries inside my car, and then looked back up and the object was gone.  I think it may have went behind some cloud cover or fell somewhere.  This may be a coincide! nce, but shortly after as I was traveling home on the Scottsvi! lle Road their was a traffic jam or something holding up the traffic.  Finally we came upon a large semi truck that was stopped dead in the road.  To make it seem weird there was nothing visible wrong with the truck, and I could not a see any truck drivers either.  No other vehicles were damaged either.  There were close to seven police cars that just simply had this truck surrounded, and the roadway cordoned off.  Amazingly, the truck was in a direct path as to where the mysterius disk-shaped object would have traveled over.  Did he see it and stop?  Did something crash?  I don&#39;t know.  Did anyone else see this object besides us?  Did the object stop the engine of the truck?  I wonder now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, that&#39;s my report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Christian, and this sighting is true and accurate to the best of my ability.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else saw this object I would love to know about it.<n>

When I was returning to the house I saw what I thought to be a very bright shooting star. I immediately noticed that it was moving to slow for a shooting star and it did not change in light intensity, nor did it have the normal streak behind it.  I watched the object move from west to east, I know this as I am familiar with the layout of my parents property. I watched this light for several seconds and determined it was not a plane due to fact that the light was not unidirectional, as would be the case if it were a plane or helicopter.  I called to my nephew who was inside and asked him if he wanted to see something weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both observed the light/object as it continued towards the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few moments he ran inside to tell his mom, my sister, to come out and look at what was in the sky.  I explained that it was weird because there were no flashing port or starboard lights.  The flight speed and altitude was also odd as it seemed to be drifting and did not appear to follow a straight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that it could possibly be a satellite but due to its brightness and low elevation have considered otherwise.  I doubt that it was a small plane as there was no prop noise.  The object continued to the east until it disappeared behind the horizon.<n>

It appeared to have a aura or haze around it, and a very short tail (if any tail at all.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I were both witnesses to this event, but we did not see any crash or sign of destruction in the direction we watched the object fall.<n>
6/25/10 00:00|Sissonville|WV|Fireball||It was a big ball of light that lit the sky.|7/6/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75971.html|108|ndxe201006| It was a big ball of light that lit the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At midnight I was leaving my girlfriends, and as I was walking down the road it was quite no cars were seen, my friend and I saw a big ball of light jet out of the sky. Then in seconds it slowed down, and landing into the woods shooting beams through the branches of trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I ran over to see where it went, everything went dark again.  I noticed problems with my friend and my cellular device dis functioned.  So I set on my porch for 30 to 45 mins to see if anything else would occur and nothing had happened.  All of this occurred in Sissonville WV.<n>

Out of the corner of my eye i noticed something moving across the sky and assumed it was a shooting star.  Once I looked at it directly i realized it was an extremely bright blue circle, and much much bigger than a shooting star would have been.  It was so bright that I would almost consider it neon blue.  It didn&#39;t flash or blink any other lights, just the same solid electric blue color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved straight across the sky at a steady pace moving faster than an airplane at the same altitude would&#39;ve been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s hard describe the size since it was up so high, but from that distance it was about the size of a soccer ball. Up close it would obviously be much bigger.  Right when i saw it I knew it was something unusual and started shouting for the other two to look.  By the time they turned around it was gone because the opening in the trees that i saw it through isn&#39;t very big.  It was behind the trees and gone by the time they looked.<n>

It looked like a star.  It started moving east and away from the brightest bottom star of the Dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After traveling slowly away from the dipper, it turned it&#39;s light off.  It disappeared.  It seemed as though it hit it&#39;s own dimmer switch as the light faded from it gradually.  It didn&#39;t just blink off.  Which makes me wonder, if they wanted to be covert, why shine like a star in the first place if not to gain attention???<n> <n><n> <n><n> BTW:  This is my second sighting in a week!!  ! I must be the luckiest guy alive!  Glad it didn&#39;t stop at my place!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No Iridium satellites visible from this location, on the date, and at the time, indicated.

It steadily transversed the sky, remaining an unchanging blob of light until it vanished to the west past the top of the hill where Cleveland Avenue runs.  According to my cell phone, which runs on AT&amp;T time and always seems a minute or two behind everyone else the sighting ended at 21:20.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Checked w/Heavens-Above.com.  According to the site, there was an iridium flare at 22:50 and another at 23:38, so that would seem to ruled those out as an explanation.  When I got home about 12:40 AM, the ISS was over the Pacific Ocean roughly around Hawaii, so that would seem to rule out that as an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sunset was at 21:12. I understand the window for seeing satellites is about 45 to 90 minutes after the sun has gone down so that would place the time of my sighting a little more than a half hour outside that window as well.<n>

The night was cloudy, so we didn&#39;t think it was a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guessed it was an airplane (although it seemed too far down to be one), because of it&#39;s slow moving nature, but there were no blinking lights, just one solid bright light.  As it moved across the sky, my pet dogs began barking and growling insanely towards the star-like object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, as quickly as it apppeared, it faded away, as if flying out towards space.  About 20 to 30 minutes later, after my mother and I went inside, a helicopter flew over the house.   I suppose it was following the UFO.<n>
6/24/10 22:15|Waukee|IA|Light|120seconds|Bright Zig-Zagging Light over Des Moines, 6/24/10|7/6/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75956.html|114|ndxe201006| Bright Zig-Zagging Light over Des Moines, 6/24/10<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I&#39;m standing on my back Deck in the town of Waukee, Iowa [6/24/2010, APRX 9:15 OR 10:15 PM CST] waiting for my dog to pee so I could take her back in and go to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Explanation of the time discrepancy: I vaguely remember looking at a clock after this sighting and THOUGHT it said 9:15, but realized the next day that the sun hadn’t fully set by 9:15 on that day and I remember it being dark, because despite the ambient light of the city to the east of my house, I could clearly see stars. This leads me to believe that it was really 10:15 and I had misread the clock the night before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, on 6/24/2010, as I look up, I glance to the west south west I see a very bright white light moving in a easterly direction (toward me, toward Des Moines proper). The brightness is what caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling (as near as I can figure) in a straight line toward the east, perhaps east, north east. No green/red aircraft lights as one would see on an airliner. In fact I saw a jet liner flying to the east far above this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not good at estimating altitude but it, and as such I have a hard time telling you how big this thing was. But the jet liner moving east above this thing looked to be more than twice as high, that&#39;s the impression I got anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I figured, it&#39;s an airplane with its landing lights on and the landing lights are washing out the red/green strobes so that I can&#39;t see them. But as the thing keeps moving east, the light doesn&#39;t die out at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it were an aircraft landing light, it would be directional. You might see it very brightly as the aircraft was moving toward you but it would become more difficult to see as the plane moved over and started moving away from you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing moved over where I was standing, perhaps to the south of my position a little bit but clearly over the city of Des Moines, then it kept moving at the same rate of speed BUT it began moving (or at least the light did) in a slightly, nearly unnoticeable zig-zag manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mind you, I can see nothing but the bright white light. I see no craft/structure, no wings, nothing but the light. And the light continues off in an easterly direction until I lose sight of it behind the roofline of the other houses behind mine. It moved in a straight tack and for about 15 seconds, in a slightly zig-zag manner but it stayed at a steady speed. It wasn&#39;t very fast at all. The jet liner above it overtook it easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no noise that I could hear but it might have been too far away and it appeared to be illuminated all the way around. In other words, the light stayed bright, no matter the angle at which I viewed the thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I doubt it was a helicopter because if it was it seemed too high (although I have a hard time judging altitude) and even if it was a helicopter, what&#39;s with the 360 degree illumination effect? Even those super bright spotlights on helicopters are directional.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried taking a picture of it, but my crappy cell phone camera is all I had close and all you could see was a blurry white spot on a black background, it didn&#39;t tell the story at all and I deleted it out of frustration (sorry). By the time I could have gone in and gotten my good camera, come out, set it up and get the shot, the thing would have been gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, whatever this thing was, I remember thinking that the airliner flying above might not have been able to see it because of the illumination from the city below, but who knows? If the airliner did see it, he didn&#39;t alter his course or anything so it must not have concerned him. But the thing was very bright, in comparison to the stars (and the night was very clear), it was easily noticeable at first glance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All told, it crossed the sky (from rooftops to the west to roofline in the east) in about 90-120 seconds. I remember distinctly thinking that whatever I was seeing wasn&#39;t normal so I made a point to watch it intently (another reason I didn&#39;t go for the good camera). It was right after I made this decision that it started to zig-zag (again, ever-so slightly) and I remember wondering just what exactly I was seeing. The zig-zag was just enough to be noticeable but slight enough to make me wonder if I was perhaps seeing things correctly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I am rationalizing and explaining it away as any number of plausible explanations. But the fact that it was #1 so bright #2 had no red/greens #3 moving relatively slowly compared with the air traffic above it #4 IT ZIG ZAGGED. I&#39;m baffled and my logic tells me that it could not have zig-zagged, but I KNOW I saw the thing zig-zag!  So tell me I&#39;m not crazy! Explain this thing to me. I know what it was not...It wasn&#39;t a balloon (too fast, steady speed, night, over a metro area close to an airport). I know it wasn&#39;t the space station, a meteor or a satellite...a jet liner flew OVER it. The jet-liner above it was further to the south than the light, but from my angle I watched as the airplane disappeared briefly behind this light then reappeared as the plane outpaced the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I seriously doubt that it was a helicopter. I was a flight medic for some years and I know rotor-craft, especially the commonly seen rotor-craft in this area. The flight path didn&#39;t make sense (for a medical helicopter anyway). It came from out of town and bypassed all hospitals and went back out of town to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe it was military, but our Air Guard base is south of where this thing flew...it wasn&#39;t on approach to DSM International, it was WAY too far north, its course did not change and it didn’t appear to change altitude at all (again difficult to judge &amp; be certain). It certainly didn&#39;t just take off from DSM either.  I suppose it could have been like a private plane/jet or even a military jet, but I could hear NOTHING and what&#39;s with the light?  Let alone the ZIG ZAGGING!!!???  Once the light disappeared over the roofline to the east and I could no longer see it, I brought the dog back in and went to bed.  I had completely forgotten about seeing the light until the following evening and I shared this report on an online forum where someone suggested that I report the event to you.<n>

It had different colors, but the most noticeable was green.  If it would have been a firework, I would have judged it to be set off about half a mile away, but I never actually saw any upward trajectory, and there was absolutely no sound to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have had fireworks set off about a mile from our house on holidays, and we can definitely hear them in our rural area.  I stayed outside approximately 5 to 10 minutes, and never heard a sound other than a passenger jet high above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was North of me, travelling in a roughly 45 degree angle, appearing to travel from East to West.  It traveled about the same speed as meteors I have seen before, and before it disappeared in the air, it seemed to have a great green flash, with possibly some orange and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I stretched my arms out in front of me, using my hands to determine when it started and appeared to end, I would say the entire event took place within 3 feet, and the final burst or flash appeared about the size of my fist (approx 3 inch diameter), with the core being about the size of a silver dollar.<n>

They were silent but our military sent helicopters and airplanes over to investigate as we have a naval airbase close by and we couple hear the helicopters and planes when they arrived but the shapes remained silent, they suddenly gathered together and sped away faster than our eyes could follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the other witnesses submit reports.

6/23/10 18:20|Tampa|FL|Rectangle|5 minutes|I was driving at about 6:20 pm, bright daylight, in late rush hour when I saw a large, gray, rectangular shape floating low in the sky|7/6/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75910.html|131|ndxe201006| I was driving at about 6:20 pm, bright daylight, in late rush hour when I saw a large, gray, rectangular shape floating low in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> Low flying, one dimensional side-view of a slightly irregular rectangular shape floating in the sky.  The shape was alternating between floating slowly along, veering a bit to the right of the road, side to side, and then moving quickly beyond where the road would dead-end into a swampy area, back behind the tree line in the distance. It appeared to be coming down. It was broad daylight and I have to wonder if other drivers saw it as well, or how they could have missed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was matte gray and almost appeared fluid in its movement.  I thought it might be a weather balloon, but I am not sure a weather balloon would be rectangular.  I thought it might be a slowly falling satellite or something.  The rectangle had one vertical side slightly longer than the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a mother of 4 who was on her way to pick up my 2 daughters from dance class.  I was  really worried as this object appeared to be descending. I was afraid it might fall on the building where my daughters were--although it did appear to be floating down, not actually falling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t judge the size of it because I am not sure how far away it was from me.  I only saw one face of the object.  It seemed to be following the path of a fairly busy suburban road, not a main highway.  But I watched it as I drove about 5 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it had gotten out of my sight for about a minute and a half.  I do not know where it went, if it was behind trees and buildings or away.<n>

Like a hook shape.  The color was white it was so far. the more we got closer (my girlfriend and I were running) the more I could focus on it and I began to see it tilt in the air exactly looking like an oval shape but slanted like 40 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we just stared at it(just in aww trying to decipher the thing) because it was quite signifcant to the plane that was flying near it.  The plane turned around for some reason, I dont know if that had anything to do with the ufo thing.  But it was obvious that it was some type of ufo compared to the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For about one minute and a half it was the same slanted oval shape but it began to disapear, fade away, diminish.  Two seconds later, to the left, about thousands of feet away it reappeared but in a regular horizontal oval shape.  Same color, white with just a touch of shine. It was just there doing nothing just! being white and shiny for about 5 minutes.  It started to fade away,  As it was fading away it turned into a small light blue colored dot just diminishing.  We looked all around us for another shape but nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen anything in the sky like that and I look in the sky quite often seeing falling stars quite often, the stars and astrology type things are amazing.  My girlfriend is the same way.  So we would be able to tell if it was a plane or a ballon.   It was definitely something to report.<n>

All this happened in 6 or 7 seven seconds, it wasn&#39;t a meteor nor an aircraft it was something else for sure, a UFO or maybe a highly advanced secret weapon, satellite i dunno the only thing i know is that I&#39;m sure of what i had seen already.Next morning i was surfing the web and opened an Arabic news site called masrawy (www.masrawy.com) and i found a title that said: unidentified objects appeared in the skies of north Sinai causing terror among people and i was shocked , here is the link<n> <n><n> <n><n> (www.masrawy.com/New! s/Egypt/Politics/2010/june/23/areesh.aspx)<n> <n><n> <n><n> it&#39;s in Arabic unfortunately.finally I&#39;m just asking for a reasonable (or unreasonable) explanation for these sightings that happened to me and to many others all over the country.thanks for your patience. Oh by the way there is video included in the page i sent containing what i saw thanks.<n>

Saw what I believe are satellites (3 in 5 minutes), one of them I followed from west to east.  It flashed (about the size of the largest star) and vanished.<n>

It was overcast and all the stars were faint.  Except one in the western sky.

Up, down, left , right, sometimes in a semi circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed the lights.  It seemed as if they were rotating and every once in a while you could see a red light.  I called in my son and his friend and we all watched it.  They left after about 10 minutes and I continued watching it for another 10 minutes or so.<n>

It was also transparent, i could see the blue sky through it.  After the reflections, it would seems as though the object wasnt there, but it was.  The object when i first saw was about 3000-4000ft above ground and very far away, I was driving towards its direction.  The objects size if bringing the wings to account, would be massive, (being 2 planes width).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This area is no flight path, and theres no airports closeby.  This is my first sightings as such, and i know there was something definetly in the sky. I drive for a living and have been driving through the A14 for a while.

When we spotted it it looked like a very big crumbled newspaper shape with a point at the end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden it started to move in different directions and then it started moving east very fast.

I followed the vapour trail only to see at the end of it and almost down to the east horizon two elongate orange lights. 30 seconds later all that was left was the vapour trail from horizon to horizon which didn&#39;t vanish until at least 15 minutes later. i&#39;m just wondering if you can shed any light on what this could be. it was amazing to see and i have never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

New interest in astronomy, and trying to get somewhat familiar with night sky.  At 60 yrs old, nonetheless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway was in lounge chair lying back, and looked over to my left (NNE), maybe 45-50 degrees from what I perceived to be horizon, and with naked eyes noticed two what I thought were stars.  But they were moving, moving east.  They were keeping the same distance apart, as if they were attached. But I thought they were too far apart to be connected.  I believe they were at least my fist-width apart at arms-length.  I watched for a few more seconds, to verify they were in fact moving.  Then looked through my binoculars at the objects.  But the magnification didnt seem to do anything more as far as figuring out what they were. I thought the binoculars would reveal airplane lights blinking, or colors, or something.  But - nothing more than my eyes did, though I suspect they were a bit larger through the binoculars.  They just looked like white stars to me.  As I watched them disappear in the east, over treetops, they seemed to be going faster, and were now twinkling, like stars. ! I figured this was some atmospheric thing playing tricks on my eyes.  The closer one disappeared first, then the lead one turned to a blur before disappearing above the trees.  Never any sound, but again I thought they were stars, so didn&#39;t expect any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At my 1 o’clock, on the horizon I noticed a very bright object in the sky.  I thought it was a plane banking and reflecting the sun light.  The object was moving towards me, heading north parallel to the west side of the freeway.  As it approached I could see that it looked like a sphere flying in the air, clearly not an airplane shape.  The object kept coming, as it got closer and the glare went away I was able to get a good view of it from the passenger’s front window. It was a metallic disc, with conical shape at the bottom and top, rhombus shaped profile.  It had no windows, lights or moving parts.  I was a metallic color, resembling what an unpainted aluminum aircraft body would look like and it had no markings on it.  It was moving in a straight line with no signs of leaving any trail behind it.  To the best of my a! bility I’d estimate the object was about the size of  a helicopter maybe bigger, flying some 350 meters off the ground at a speed similar to a plane.  The object flew with the edge of the disc pointing to the ground at a steep angle, the face of the disc pointing forward.  The closest it came to me was about 400-500 meters.  The whole sighting lasted about 15 seconds.<n>

From the direction of the forest moving toward South Hills came a craft shining lights of red, white and possibly another color.  The lights were moving wildly, the craft made an unusually quiet noise like an amplified insect, and it moved quickly but gracefully towards my house in a way that no helicopter could.  I ran inside, afraid. The noise was audible for a minute from inside the house, then gone.  An unusually large shooting star hit the atmosphere a minute or so after the noise disappeared.<n>

They were flying fast and then disappeared quickly.   At first I thought they were a part of one craft but the realizsed they were two since the flight pattern was a bit sporadic.  It was definitely NOT a plane or lights from the ground or atmospheric phenomena.<n>

I pulled over my car to watch it and it flew very slow but in a cirle, changing directions at sharp angles.  Every so often square panels of lights would flash underneath from blue to red to green.  The lights were large, too large to be a plane and the flight pattern was uncharacteristic of an airplane. No sound was heard.  I drove home approx 2 miles and woke up my family and made them look. The craft continued to stay flying low and suddenly flew behind trees and we lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was between 10 and 10:30. I decided to take a break and sit outside on the picnic bench in our front yard. The moon was out and what caught my attention was the huge gap/line in the cloulds. This was not ordinary because because of it&#39;s size. It would have had to be a jet liner flying at about 1200 feet to leave mark of this size. The cloulds that I saw were atleast a mile or two high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The impression that was left had clean edges on the clould and a center line was sort of how a boat motor may leave a line trailing behing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It crossed above our home and went north.  It didn&#39;t move real fast and it had no sound.  It seemed rather close and if it were a plane it would have made noise, but there was no sound.  I was washing my face at the time, and so I rinsed it off and then went outside to see if I could still see it and I did see it continuing on to the north.  I didn&#39;t appear as a plane which usually isn&#39;t orange and, and a plane will have blinking lights or more than one light.  This was just orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

6/20/10 13:40|Torrance|CO|Fireball|10 min|Glowing/reflective object clears coastline and makes odd movements around airport in Torrance CA|6/23/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75867.html|162|ndxe201006| Glowing/reflective object clears coastline and makes odd movements around airport in Torrance CA<n> <n><n> <n><n> First it is important to let anyone who reads this that I am someone who has always wanted to see the unknown. Therefore  I am always trying to debunk what my mind wants me to think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live4-5 miles from the Redondo Beach coastline.  There is an airport ½ mile from my home, There have been a few times that a plane coming from over the ocean toward the airport seems to glow but I quickly figure out that it must be the sun reflecting off of the water and giving the appearance of a plane glowing.  The two times this has happened after a few minutes the plane looses reflection from the water and shows itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today however I was stumped. I wondered, not sure why, outside of the overhang of my carport and looked directly up beyond the airport airspace. I saw what I quickly thought was a plane that had caught  the sun that was behind me. My first thought was that this plane must be some aluminum shell picking up every possible reflection  it could to give the appearance that this plane was flickering with fire. The reflection was flickering like Morse code or something in that type of pattern.  The light moved at normal plane speed from west over the coast line to east about 5 miles past my location, slightly higher than 75% of the planes that come through this area.  Once it traveled far from me I expected the reflection to dim but it maintained it’s glow well.  I was somewhat perplexed but I still felt it was a plane. At the 5 mile point past my location it turn upward and traveled to a greater altitude, before turning back at what appeared to be around the same speed as many of the! WW11 planes and sesna’s  that decentin to the airport landing strip.  The glowing golden object came back past the airport heading west and then stopped it’s westwardly movement. It help position for the most part in one area for the next five minutes.  There was some minor attitude changes but it maintained a very still and silent hold of it’s position.  The moment it stopped movement I was not thinking plane anymore. I was able to go in my house twice to get my phone camera and my digital camera, both times when I came outside it had not moved and continued it Glowing flashes.I made one final dash inside my home begging my girlfriend to come outside, when I came out the last time the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could it have been some type of metallic object like an aluminum balloon that appeared to be farther than it was, therefore it looked like it was traveling at plane speed and it just happened to catch the sun reflection and wind patterns that created its movement? I thought about that at certain point when I did not think it was a plane anymore but when I came out of my home for the third time after a 10-15 second absence the object was gone.  Before I went inside it was not moving at all and in 15 seconds it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not saying it was a UFO, but it was not something I could deduce, and going outside for noreason in the first place is a bit weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not one of the photos I took had anything on them except for blue sky<n>

So I went and got the video camera, put it on tripod, and had 28-135 lens on my camera on the chair beside me.  I then sat and looked around in the sky, I then noticed a definite silver shine to my west pretty far away, I don’t know how high it was from the ground, I was faceing north the craft was west moving slowly south, I grabbed the camera and waited to see if it was the craft, another shine off a sphere slowly moving south. I ripped some shots then grabbed the video camera and tried to aim, the object dimmed and shone reflecting light I figured from the sun.  I dropped the video camera and solely shot with the camera, it was hard to shoot because the sunlight would shine then go out, shine then go out as it traveled south each time I had to refocus and fire.  I got 19 shots in Raw Data images not the best but I got them, heres the enlarged and enhanced photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Photos not of a genuine UFO, we believe.

Almost in the same position as Venus at 9-10:00PM from my viewpoint.  After a few moments of watching I noticed bright glimmering lights as if you were shining a prism in the sun.  The object was very far in the distance I could not make out a shape.  Grabbed my telescope and focused on the object as it moved very slowly toward the northwest.  Colors were red, blue, green.  Once again moving to slow and large to be a plane going off in the distance.  I watch it until my point of view was blocked 30 min or so.<n>

I was driving, looked out of my drivers side window, but towards the front of the vehicle.  The craft was about 1 mile away, traveling at a very low speed and a very low altitude, southbound towards our car, parallel to the freeway.  The craft had 2 red lights in front of it, and a red light in the rear, center of the two front lights.  After the craft passed the car, the 2 front red lights dissapeared, and a 4th light, this one white, was in the center of the craft, but was only visible from the side and rear of the craft.  3 of us were in the car, and we all saw this craft.  There were no sudden movements of the craft, no sound coming from the craft, and none of the lights were flashing, meaning it was not an airplane or helecopter.  The craft moved very slowly and smoothly.  We followed the hwy around a curve, then lost track of it.  There were also 3-4 ve! hicles around us that slowed when we first saw the craft, leaving me to assume they noticed it also.<n>

I had stepped out on our back porch to smoke a cigarette and I looked up in the sky and saw, what I thought at the time was a shooting star.  Then I saw one more and then another and by the forth I yelled into the house for my family to come and see these “moving stars”.  Everyone came out and saw them I looked at another part of the sky and saw four more as did everyone else.  At this point my stepfather who is an active duty military officer had stepped out to see what was happening.  He too witnessed the lights.  It was partly cloudy but we were still able to see the stars and the lights and tell the difference between the two; I witnessed about twenty-five myself.  My mother saw about 12 and my sister saw about 15. My stepfather caught the last of them and says he saw 5.  I thought at first it might have just been a meteor shower but all of the lights we! re moving in the same direction at what seemed like the same speed.  They were all roughly the same size and shape.  I checked the charts for meteor showers and it said that the last shower was May 6, and the next isn’t until August 12.<n>

I noticed the light and advised my entire family to come out and observe as I noticed it was moving South slowly and was a color light I have never seen on an aircraft before.  As we watched, it started moving faster to the South, only to be amazed that a helicopter was following the blue light.  This struck fear as we continued to watch, when suddenly, the light shot back in the direction it was going, and immediately dropped below the house line. I ran into the house and grabbed my video camera.  The light returned and in a similar, but not exactly the same pattern, flew the same path running at very wild speeds. I was able to capture the light but due to how dark it was, kept having to zoom in and out to get a clear example of the brightness of the blue. It finally dropped again and was never seen again.  The sky was dark and very clear so this was by no means a spotligh! t as most of us were thinking.

No reports of it, couple seconds after that people were out and shooting fire works off, it was too big for a fire work, and it was slient.  It went 3 miles till i couldnt see it anymore.

I took a drink of coffee, lit a smoke, then looked directly overhead. it was exactly 8:52 pm the sun was behind the garage to the west and I saw between the branches of the trees above me what looked like a star, &#34;which never moved&#34;, to early for a star I thought?  I grabbed my camera CANON REBEL EOS T2i with the Canon 28-135 Ultrasonic EF, I.S. lens and ripped a few shots, then zoomed into the shot on the camera panel to see if it was a star, I saw a definite sphere, I aimed the camera and shot some more, I then decided to get my tripod and 400mm Tamron crap lens. Into the house I run, unravelling the video camera from the tripod, grabbing the 400mm then extending the tripods legs with the object still in the sky, I aimed on auto focus, it locked, so I snapped away. The object then went dim and the auto focus wouldn’t take so I switched to manual and focussed and focussed I could barely see the object through the camera when the Probe lit up and I shot again seeing it split into a few pieces, I was so pumped with my heart pounding and I could barely operate the camera.  The object then went dim and I lost it all in the camera and in visual. Just then A freand came in the driveway, I told them I was taking photos of birds.  Later I told freand, and showed her the photos.  Looking at the photos in the computer with the Canon Photo software I noticed there where five shots that were black instead of blue but the object was still visible in the photos, the most interesting thing was near the ending there seemed to be a puff of smoke in a Saturn like ring around a center object then two sets or 4 more spheres come out, here’s the 28 pics I took.  The photos are from Raw images, roughly 20 MB, I enhanced and enlarged them for detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was like a round object with an orange bottom and the most significant thing I noticed was the circular laser type light rotating over top of the object!  As it was moving about medium speed I raced back to my house on my bike and was suprised to see that it had picked up speed!  By the time my brother came out and saw it, the light above it faded out and it was gone over the trees!  The city was Springfield Ohio in the west end neighborhood skys.<n>

It was around 3:30 am and my son and I were sitting outside visiting and talking.  I happened to look up at the sky in front of us and I noticed a very bright yellowish orange light shining in the southern sky.  My first thought was “satellite”, and to dismiss it, without calling attention to it. I glanced back at the sky and this light had grown a lot brighter and was also getting larger.  This confused me and I turned to mention it to my son when he said “hey Mom!  Look at that light!”.  I was about to tell him it was most likely a satellite when I saw that it had grown much larger (closer?), and brighter and was now not very far above the treetops.  We both sat there with our breath held and our mouths wide open watching this strange spectacle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the light no longer seemed to be moving, but hovered for a second above the treetops, and then it suddenly veered up and off towards the east and before either of us could say “did you see that?!?!?” it had totally disappeared!  We just stared at each other and I asked him…”uhm, did you see that?” Hmmm…that star moved up and away…fast!”. He asked me if I thought that was the definition of a “UFO”… We decided that it was most definitely unidentified, was an object, and  flew away very fast!   Had my son not witnessed it as well, I would never have said anything about it.  Ever! I would love to explain it away by calling it a shooting star, but in my experience, shooting stars streak across and d o w n  the night sky, not  u p  the night sky. I am now attempting to convince myself that perhaps it was a new aircraft being tested at the AFB in Shreveport, LA., although it made n o  sound at all!  Today, just for fun, I thought I would do a “Google search” to see if maybe there were comets or meteors or something reported around the same time that my son and I saw this interesting, for lack of a better word, Object! This is how I discovered this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a background in family practice nursing and my son will be a JR. in High School this year.<n>

The sky was cloudless and a perfect night to see all the stars and the moon.  We both immediately saw two round bright lights heading towards each other and just when we thought the two would hit each other, they seemed to ping pong away from each other in different directions.  One aircraft went to the right of us and eventually we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  The other one headed in another direction and then it seemed to levitate in one spot, completely stopped in the sky and that&#39;s where we saw it for another 5 minutes before we turned off the highway and couldn&#39;t see it any more.  We didn&#39;t see any blinking lights on the craft that would indicate it was a plane.  They also seemed to be playing with each other--nearly coming together and just when they seemed to want to hit each other, they deflected away from each other. We are both 50 years old professionals(! sales manager and para-legal). My girlfriend is very religious and also believes in the existence of other life forms and UFOs.  She was completely convinced of what she saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/18/10 22:15|Cape May Courthouse|NJ|Unknown|three minutes|object with one flashing white light flying very erratically moves impossibly fast in impossible fashion|6/23/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75841.html|193|ndxe201006| object with one flashing white light flying very erratically moves impossibly fast in impossible fashion<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second report that I’ve filed this week, though I’ve received no response to my first sighting report. I’m curious to know if my first report was classified a hoax or a joke, and that’s why it is being ignored. I mean I have far better things to do with my time than make stuff up. I read somewhere during the extensive research I’ve conducted over the last year and a half, that a witness is more likely to be credible if he or she only ever files a single report; though credibility sharply decreases the more reports someone files.  The reason given is that UFO sightings are so statistically rare that it is highly unlikely a witness will ever have more than one UFO sighting or experience.  I can’t say for sure about anyone else, but I know that in my case that for some reason the tiny patch of sky visible from my house, as well as once at my friends house and twice at my job last year, has been teeming with highly unusual activity.  Last night that act! ivity continued. I was outside over by my car that I share with my grandmother; whom I also take care of, and of course I was sky-watching. (I saw something 8 summers ago that has had me intently watching the sky ever-since)  I was facing north and looked over to my left(north by northwest of where I’m standing) and saw something flying in an extremely erratic fashion. It had a flashing white light on it that for the most part was in one second intervals; though the pattern was somewhat irregular.  Every time the light would blink off, when it blinked back on the object had moved an insanely long distance.  But it wasn’t simply traveling forward. It was moving forwards, backwards, diagonally and side-to-side. I’ll put it to you like this. If this craft had a solid light instead of a blinking light, the pilot could have written its name just by maneuvering.   I’m sure you are familiar with what happened at Stephenville Texas, right?  Yea it would have probably looked a lot like that.  I stood there and watched for about 2 or 3 minutes as this object darted around the sky the same way an electromagnetic charge instantaneously jumps from pole to pole.  If there was a human pilot flying this object, unless he is using some unknown super-technology, he or she would not have been able to withstand the G force required to make manuevers like this.  The oddest thing is that the object should have passed out of view; and if it was moving straight it would have. Instead it was moving in every possible direction, but never the same direction for very long.  Finally I just laughed and said to myself, “show off!”   The funny thing is that it isn’t the first time I’ve witnessed something very similar. Like I said in my last report I stopped filing reports after the first one to MUFON last year. No one is willing to come near NJ because of Morristown, but all that would be water under the bridge if I could just get an investigator with some high-tech cameras, video-recorders and infrared equipment to come down here and set up shop for a! night or two. Forget for the moment that almost no one sees stuff like this on a regular basis, because for once there is someone who really does.  I have a 141 IQ, am highly educated through collegiate and self-taught means and my vision is 20/15. I am a writer, work as a waiter, have an elderly grandmother to take care of, and absolutely no time to take out of my busy day to file a fake UFO report. Why would I ridicule a topic that I have extensively studied and found to be extraordinarily credible; based on things like the disclosure project, the Rendalshim Forrest incident, O’Hare Airport, the 1951 incident where dozens of UFO’s buzzed the white-house, the “battle” of LA, combined with what I have seen with my own eyes? I’d give anything if someone would come down here with some good image-recording equipment because whatever is going on down here isn’t normal, by any stretch of the imagination.<n>

My split second perception was that two stars were merging as it was a very clear night.  I realized that it was a craft, non blinking, that was moving in a straight line at an incredible speed.  It made no noise and it appeared to be very high in the atmosphere.  I have witnessed a night time launch of the space shuttle, I have seen meteors galore,  and watched satellites go by...but I never saw anything move this quick.  It went horizon to horizon in 15 seconds.  Maybe I caught the rumored Aurora....I don&#39;t know...but the object was a consistent bright white and was moving from south to north.  Hope that helps.  This seemed like a good place to place my sighting as I didn&#39;t know where else to post.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I decided to look up for some sky gazing, despite the sun being the only thing hanging in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun was shining behind some maple trees, decreasing its luminosity to the point where I was no longer blinded if I looked at it.  I could see bugs and pollen flying through the air, but I also saw something else as well.  Two metallic white / silver spheres caught the sun&#39;s light.  One proceeded to move North East, and I watched it fly to the horizon.  It seemed to have a sort of darkness around it, like a haze. The sky just seemed darker around it.  The other objects, still catching the suns light, hovered for a few more seconds and just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I submitted the report to MUFON.  That day, another report was submitted by a man about how he and his wife and kids saw &#34;dozens&#34; of silvery spheres in Leesburg hovering in the sky over a Costco at about 5:00 PM, an hour after me.  They watched them for about a half hour, and saw some of them glow.  Their report also states that single spheres would split and become two, and two would become one.  They were moving North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that week another individual submitted a report to MUFON with pictures.  The individual saw a silvery white sphere flying North.  This report took place an hour or so before me in Richmond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is three reports of silvery / white spheres in one day, over the course of a couple hours.  This is my report.  I don&#39;t know if the submitted theirs here or not but for investigation purposes, theirs and mine are on MUFON.  I am very sorry if NUFORC is a competitor of MUFON.  I just want to this story out to as many people as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, somewhere between 4 - 4:15 PM I went out to the pipeline behind our house for another cigarette and in curiosity I looked up to sky at the spot where I saw the objects the day before.   My curiosity was peaked even more so because of a very low flying and very slow flying Blackhawk helicopter that flew over the pipeline.  I didn&#39;t think anything would come of it but I was wrong.  This time I watched a black sphere for a minute fly under one of the only clouds in the sky.  Once it hit the blue sky it was gone, like it could only be seen near the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Needless to say, I have a love affair with aircraft and any time one flies over, I can’t help to look up and admire it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a farmhouse that is on the North approach route to Pearson International Airport in Toronto.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About this time last year around noon while working outside, I heard an airliner on approach to the east of our house. Approximate altitude was 10,000 feet, and about 5 miles downrange to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Atmospheric conditions were very clear and cloudless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the aircraft’s heading was tangential to my point of observation, I noticed a very bright luminous ball of white light suddenly appear over the wingtip of the airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was caused by tip vortex condensation, but this was hardly something that would happen to a throttled back airliner on approach pulling only 1 g.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Besides, the form of the ball was not a trail, as in tip vortex condensation, and was very luminous. I had never seen anything like it.  What really dispelled any vortex cause was when the ball rose rather quickly vertical to the wing section and over the fuselage.  It then quickly progressed forward to the cockpit but before reaching it, vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And that was it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole observation occurred within a maximum of 5 seconds.<n>

At first I thought it was Mars because it was idle.  After a few seconds it started to move slowly across the sky. It was glowing and seemed the outer lining seems to be pulsating red.  We watched it for about three minutes before it ascended higher and grew smaller. The sky was pretty clear that night minus a few clouds.<n>
6/17/10 21:33|Riverside|CA|Light|2 min approx|Light blue object, suddely turns brilliant white, leaves trail and wake|6/23/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75865.html|204|ndxe201006| Light blue object, suddely turns brilliant white, leaves trail and wake<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 06/17/2010 at 2133 hours I was on my back porch, looking at the sky before going to bed.  There were no clouds, but there was some haze near the ground.  I noticed a light blue object approaching from the South which I at first took to be a satellite.  As I watched, I noticed it was moving much faster than any satellite I have ever seen.  The object continued going North, passing overhead slightly to the East of my location.  Suddenly the object went from medium intensity light blue to brilliant white, and its size seemed to increase substantially.  It was not a gradual transition as with an iridium satellite, but instantaneous, as it something had switched on.  About a second after it turned white, it began making a conical shaped wake which spread out from the object and dissipated.  The object itself began leaving a thin, white trail behind it as well. After several seconds, the brilliant white light, wake and trail went off, and the object returned to its lig! ht blue form.  After a few more seconds, it briefly switched to brilliant white again, but this time no wake or trail were visible.  The object returned to light blue and remained that way until I lost sight of it as it went behind the roof line of my house to the North.  The object was on a straight flight path the entire time, going from South to North.  It seemed to wobble a bit after it started making the wake and trail.  At the time of this sighting, there were satellites and various types of aircraft visible in the sky.  I did not hear any noise that seemed to be related to the object. I did hear jet aircraft but I am sure the source was from airliners passing overhead.  I watched the sky during the same time period for the next two days to see if it could have been some type of satellite, but I did not see anything similar.<n>

It was large enough to see the distinguished shape of a cigar. It did not flash light or blink and there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 6ft. tall and if I were to point my hands in a clock type motion encompassing the entire sky; from where I was standing, my right hand would be a 1 and my left at 9.  My daughter and I watched it for approximately one minute.  There were some people that came out and I ask them if they could see it; which they could not because at that time it was already far west and then it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unable to keep up with it to take a picture or video with my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 30 seconds, no more, a military jet appearing to be a F-16 followed the same path.  10 Minutes later we were back at home and saw the same jet flying back in the direction it had came from.<n>

A very few were seen flying from east to west.  Those that were, were closer and almost looked like airplanes.  They were very bright.  We thought perhaps it was the sun reflecting off of planes however the closest airport is smaller and does not accommodate a large number of planes.  We started counting the objects and saw approximately 36 items.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we had gotten to about 30 we saw a jet stream in the sky above one of the items.  You could see the stream but not the jet itself leading us to believe that the objects were possibly something other than standard airplanes.  A couple were closer than others and emi! tted a bright white light.  It was close to dusk so we thought it possibly reflection of the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just very odd to see such a large number of items even if they were just planes.  We could not determine that so to us they were UFO’s.<n>

I was taking out the trash and I spotted many of what appeared to be Jet Fighters, at least 3 or 4, over the course of about 10 minutes.  I continually watched the sky, but it got cloudy. I eventually saw a blinding white spherical light appear in front of me.  It was blindingly white but didn&#39;t hurt to see, and it appeared to travel almost instantaneously; it appeared to travel in spurts of Energy, though continuous it had more energy let out at certain times.  The light behind it almost had many clouds of light jetted from it in the opposite direction of its motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I noticed over this time 2 more Jet Fighters flying over my head before my vision was obscured by clouds, and this I feel was may not have been coincidence.

6/16/10 22:30|Cape May Courthouse|NJ|Disk|several seconds|dimly lit disc shaped object flying east to west makes a hard 70degree turn at unimaginable speed|6/23/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75819.html|214|ndxe201006| dimly lit disc shaped object flying east to west makes a hard 70degree turn at unimaginable speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> First let me begin by saying that what I saw last night is just one more in a long list of extraordinary flying objects I’ve witnessed in the skies above where I live and where I work.  Last year I reported a sighting that three of my friends and I saw to Mufon.   However we were not taken seriously. I am aware that the Morristown Hoax has done a great deal to diminish credibility for all future UFO sightings in NJ, but I am not talking about seeing flares here.  I am a writer/researcher and one thing I discovered is that when our government wants to discredit a ufologist, they often create a hoax designed to lure UFO investigators into proclaiming the event is a genuinely unexplainable occurrence; only to have the rug pulled out from under them when the sighting is revealed as fake.  Morristown ruined the UFO hunters (on the History Channel) because the UFO hunter team went on national TV claiming that the sighting is undoubtedly real.  As soon as they did this, the sighting was proved to be hoaxed and the UFO hunters got canceled.  I feel I have to include this in my report because I think it is a big part of why no one seems to take me seriously.  Ok, on to what I saw last night. I am constantly sky-watching because I see so many unusual things up there.  I walked out my front door and looked up in the sky-facing east.  The first thing that caught my attention was a very quiet object with red strobe-lights.  I followed that for a second or two until a very dimly lit object flying west to east appeared in my line of sight.  This objec was shaped like a disc with two small wing-like appendages similar to the alien craft in the movie Independence Day.  The object was moving at an astronomical speed; faster than anything I’ve ever seen.  It flew straight over my head, kept on its course for about 2 or 3 seconds and then pulled a hard 70 degree left turn, and began heading North at that point. There is a house to the east of my house only 20 feet away, so t! o follow the object I had to rush toward the end of the drivew! ay to tr y and get a better look.  Unfortunately by then the object was gone. The night before last, I saw a very similar craft, also dimly lit and flying at break-neck speed in the same general direction.  I have witnessed tons of other amazing airborne activity, which if you are interested and willing to take me seriously, I will describe in detail.  Some of the most outrageous sightings happened when I was with friends or my co-worker in one case.  So I know that I am not crazy, even though I have been forced to question my sanity based on some of the things I’ve witnessed.  Also, I woke up a few weeks ago with a circular crater-like scar on my upper left thigh.  I don’t know how it got there, but I can see that there is something hard under the skin, and extending from the center I can see what looks like spokes on a bicycle wheel. I did some research to see if others have reported the same thing, and I must say I am a little bit frightened by what I found.  I have no memory of how I go! t this scar, but I do know that one night it wasn’t there and the next morning it was.  I really hope I’m not wasting my time filing this report.  I just want some answers.  I am aware that most people go their entire lives and never see a single thing that could be classified as a UFO, and yet in the last year alone, I’ve witnessed dozens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n>

We decided to do some night fishing this night.  The lake was Chippewa Flowage, it is a lake in northern Wisconsin, pretty secluded and surrounded by forest. We had are boat anchored right by an island, and we were looking east.  Right above the tree line I seen two bright amber yellow objects and by the time I asked the guy in the boat if he was seeing this, there was 5 and then we watched the 6th one rise straight up from behind the tree line.  It seemed like the other 5 were waiting on the sixth light.  Once they were all there they formed more like a check mark formation.  They moved north for about 30 seconds. I lost 3 of the lights behind the trees on he island but I still seen three and they were headed east now, and fast. Just as fast as they came in our field of view they were gone. I know they weren&#39;t planes, I live in Chicago and right by one of the busiest airports in the world.  I am used to seeing hundreds of ! planes everyday.  Plus, I know it wasn&#39;t military.  I was in the Air Force for many years and I never seen a formation like that, and plus the distance between the objects was two far for military.  I checked maps of the area and there isn&#39;t a airport in site that could handle such aircraft.  The lack of noise and the way they moved ruled out choppers.  So I am puzzled, but it was definetly something I can not explain.<n>

I glanced up into the haze of out-flowing clouds and inside of them I saw this dark, cigar shape just sitting in the thick haze.  I couldn&#39;t tell you how high up it was, but originally I thought maybe it was a goose about to land in the pond, but the object didn&#39;t get any closer.  It simply hovered and would vanish into the clouds and then back out again.  I told my husband to look because there isn&#39;t any towers or high trees like that around, I had to see if he saw it too.  Every time I would point the object would slowly fade into the hazy clouds, then back out.. it never once went higher or lower.  It would only fade out and in until eventually it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness, for some reason, indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

In that area the planes come in over Harlem somewhat low.  I noticed a black spot, which I initially thought was a bird, following along side and behind a plane and then swoop around to the front of the plane. It then followed along side and then drifted away from the plane.  I kept watching the spot move around a small patch of sky.  Its movement reminded me of a boat on water.  I say the shape was oval shaped in general, but at times appeared to be almost like a figure eight.  As the bus approached Higgins Rd I lost sight of the shape.<n>

It was a brilliant star field and the Milky Way weaved a misty pattern in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A lightly illuminated orb seemed to suddenly float across the sky.  No sound and about the size of an asprin tablet in the sky.  It floated acrosss the sky from one horizon and disappeared on the other.  It took only a dozen to 15 seconds and was gone.  You could see it diappear briefly behind a few puffs of clouds and quickly reappear.  It had a floating action, but moved at considerable speed at a 60 degree angle from the horizon, seemingly faster than a plane would.  It appeared to be self illuminated by a low intensity orange amber glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw anything quite like it before and it is the first time I saw anything in the sky I could not explain! .<n>

Object in the NE (was the same both nights) appeared to be too far away so we could not make out a shape, it just looked like a round flashing object.  We could see lights changing colors from white, red, light blue-ish, and a slight orange color. I could physically see the NE object change direction in an almost erratic manner.  We got very excited about the sighting and were making a lot of noise and the object almost instantly stopped moving around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:50 pm a smaller object shot across the sky just under the NE object.  The smaller light came from the bottom right side of the large NE object and zipped across at an upward (45 degree) angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:10 pm another smaller object shot across the sky just under the NE object.  This time the object came from the left side and shot across to the right at a very sli! ght (20 degree) angle.  One more object shot around the sky shortly after that (approx. 10:40 pm) this time just a horizontal path just under the large NE object.  All three of the shooting lights were short bursts and in different directions that the others.  They did not follow the same path or direction.  The large NE object pulsated and slightly wobbled in the sky, as the time went by it appeared to go farther up into the sky, like it was going higher up so the light appeared to be smaller and farther away, but we could still see that it was pulsated very brightly (about 3x brighter than any star in the sky, and brighter than any airplane that flew by).  Both of the large objects pulsated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other object in the West was cigar shaped when we initially spotted it.  It was hovering (directly to the right of the moon) in place and appeared to be suspended vertically with 3 very bright lights (changing from orange to yellow).  This object was much closer and lower than the other NE object. We have a video of this (W) object.  It was recorded from the back porch through the screen, and there was some debate about if it was an optical illusion.  However, we could see the cigar shape and 3 lights in plain sight, and I am absolutely sure that it was not an illusion.  We watched this object change shape (or appear to be different in shape) because the lights appeared to become one large light instead of the 3 single lights.  When this happened we ran out to the front of the house to watch it.  From the front of the house we saw this object change color and size (or brightness).  It moved across the sky in short, slow, erratic movements (up, down, side to side, and at angled, wobbling or dancing), and eventually found its place very low in the sky and drastically below and to the right of the moon.  It pulsated the entire time with very bright, large flashes to small flickering.  At one point the object became at least 3x brighter and appeared to be coming toward us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after that the object dimmed down and appeared to be moving (slowly) downward again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We finally went in the house at about 11 pm and we stopped watching.<n>

I know it was not durring the hour of 9:00 in the evening, as I was inside for the whole hour watching tv.  I stepped outback to check on the cat.  I was facing west when I noticed a bright flashing orange light to the south east of me.  We live near a smaller airport and I like to watch the air traffic.  I have never before noticed a plane with such bright a light.  The light was alternating bright orange and white.  The lights appeared to be side by side.  The object was low in the sky, much like the planes who are turning to go in for a landing about a mile north of us.  It seemed to be lower than most small crafts in the area.  This flashing object was headed east.  It is not a usual flight direction for our area.  I noticed a second light that came from the south and turned to go east following the first set of lights.  I know the second object was a plane or hellicopter because it flashed the normal color lights and it made noise.  The first craft with orange and white lights was not making noise. I found that part strange.  The light from the first object looked much brighter and larger than any other in the sky.  I could not find information on any type of aircraft that uses bright orange and white alternating lights.  This short sighting just doesn&#39;t sit right with me.  It was rather bright and  pretty low in the sky so, I hope someone else also noticed it.<n>

Pretty sure the Citronelle report was off in its month numbering.  It was between 9 and 11 on a perfectly clear night.  I&#39;m a career student.  I must say, I&#39;m quite intelligent and well experienced in life.  I&#39;m NOT crazy.  I can&#39;t explain this.  It happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Okay, so here I am walking from the main house to a storage room at the south end of my property.  I noticed what I believed to be was a satellite going from NE to SW.  I grew up spending my summers on Mobile Bay, far from the city lights.  Nothing but a blanket of diamonds above me.  I&#39;ve seen thousands of satellites quietly move across the night sky, always giving me a slight thrill of exhilaration.  So, I slowed my pace to watch it.  I&#39;d say it was 50° from the horizon when an orange light appeared, heading straight for it from the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when I stopped dead in my tracks.  My hairs were standing (standing now just thinking of it).  The lights cross! ed paths.  The orange light continued while the 1st light (bluish white) LOCKED on the brakes, immediately halting, changed directions and pursued the other.  I was now back pedaling w/my eyes tearing up but never looking away.  I was scared.  I was REALLY scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bluish light eventually stopped and fixed into the sky like a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange continued to the northeast.  As it passed directly above me, a white light from the ESE approached, crossed paths, and made like a star as the other.  The orange light kept going until out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when I ran inside.  My wife could tell something was up as soon as she saw me.  I could barely speak.  I&#39;ve only shared this story with a handful of others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly can&#39;t explain it.  Military exercise?  A war above us?  Perhaps a few visitors taking pics of the silly humans and their oil spill...who knows?<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened.  I&#39;m just glad that I was able to witness it.  To have this drawn into my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope this helps!<n>

My estimate of the size of this object, taking into account the distance it was from my window, is that it was in between 10 and 30 centimetres wide and 120 to 200 centimetres tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After throwing on some clothes and shoes I left my house and observed this object from the top of my driveway (~465m away). The object appeared to slowly float right to left parallel to the ground, at an estimated 5km/h.  It continued its course until it was obscured by trees that blocked my vision. The easiest way for me to describe the appearance of this object is to compare it to an oversized ruler.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been trying to come up with an explanation of what I saw, and as such I have thought of a few questions already that readers of this report may want to ask, so I present to you some more facts:  There are no lights in my room that are green, or otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not turn on the lights when I got up to go to the washroom, so this sighting couldn’t have been caused by a reflection of light from my room, or my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did turn on a light in the washroom, but it is a dull 40w glazed bulb, and I didn’t look directly at it, so this couldn’t have been a case of after-images in my eyes created by looking at a bright light source while my pupils were dilated from darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t discount is the possibility of fireflies engaging in some sort of strange behaviour, as the colour of green was identical to the colour that fireflies produce. As to why these fireflies would /could behave in this type of behaviour is beyond me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I considered the possibility that someone could have had some sort of reflector /light/glow stick on the side of a bike, or on pants or arms, but this doesn’t seem likely since the object was moving in what appeared to be only along the x axis from right to left, not up or down at all – contradictory to what one would expect to see if this object was affixed to somebody’s leg or arms while walking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What do you think? If you have any ideas as to what this object may have been, please let me know!<n>

Located in Monroe, New York.  I live just south of there on Greenwood Lake, in Hewitt, New Jersey.  I am a believer and I frequently read your site for updated reports.  I just read the report mentioned, and have to tell you, I saw the same thing that night, same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sit outside at night on clear nights, watching the sky for shooting stars, etc.  I&#39;ve seen satellites before and thought I was watching one that night, when the same thing happened as mentioned in other report.  I watched the &#34;satellite&#34; come south to north, heading towards Monroe, NY, and then it flashed brightly and disappeared.  It was simply a white spec, like a distant star, until it light up bright &amp; was gone.  I thought maybe the &#34;satellite&#34; was so high up, the sunlight bounced off it.  (Is that possible from north NJ?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I found it interesting to see the same report here.  I enjoyed the sighting that night &amp; forgot about it the next day, until just seeing the report today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen many shooting stars &amp; satellites over time, but never one that started as a white &#34;spec&#34;, moved quickly like a satellite, but then flashed brightly &amp; disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n>

You can make out the underside and can see bolts of electric power that make an even pattern on both the right and left sides which created the light.In the middle, the bolt of electricity sages down but connects the right to the left side of the object.  Very clear and I was zoomed in with my VHS camera.  A little shaky but the images are clear and you can see details of the electric current and possibly a little more with a little video knowledge.<n>

My girlfriend beat me outside by a few minutes when I walked out she was standing on the sidewalk at the end of the driveway.  I walked down the driveway towards her when I noticed a plane pass by that was low to the ground and I had commented how it looked cool in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked back down at my girlfriend she was pointing up in the sky just slightly to the left from where I seen the airplane and said, &#34;What’s that?&#34;  I looked and it was jaw dropping.  There were 3 circular orange balls of light in a straight line and the one farthest to the right seemed to fly in a circle around the middle one.  It was jaw dropping because the lights where brighter than any star in the sky and they were fairly large.  The only thing I could think of to do was run inside and yell for my brother to come out side and see this.  As I came back outside with my brother the lights had formed into a large triangle and he told me to run inside and grab the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came back outside the lights where still there but one seemed to dim then disappear, then another, then the last one was gone.  I do not believe it was a flare or anything like that because when it disappeared you could see them move off into the distance and not burn out.<n>

It was about 10 miles from the actual sight, but the size of it made it look closer.  It was bigger than the moon from our view.  We looked eye level with it, it never went over us, it just stayed in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The faint glow turned into a bright orange-white dragonfly shaped, very very bright beam.

He told me him and his girlfriend had seen a legitmate ufo, not explainable any other way.  He described it as bright red lights, ascending from below the treeline and rising up into the sky before forming a triangle and then disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fifteen minutes later he called me, as they had returned.  I went onto my roof and obvserved the lights, facing the south.  My girlfriend and my sister were also witnesses on the roof with me.  First I saw only a few lights, they slowly ascended vertically until there were at least six (I estimate, I didn&#39;t count exact, or get a photograph).  They rose slowly and eventually formed a triangle before they slowly dimmed, one at a time, and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The appearance of the lights was a bright red, and must have been large in size judging by my estimated distance, minimum of 5-10 miles away, possibly further.  They rose very slowly, and not in a perfect linear line as a plane would climb as it gained altitude.  They seemed to exhibit a fixed x-y position relative to the ground, only increasing their z position (altitude).<n> <n><n> <n><n> They formed into a triangle, and then began to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were not any kind of aircraft I&#39;ve seen a human have.

It was approx 50 degrees above the Eastern horizon in a North Northeast location when first observed and last seen at almost 90 degrees.  To the younger eyes of my daughter it appeared to be triangular.  At one point we observed a very high, fast aircraft in the vicinity.  The plane was flying from a Northeastern to North Northeaster direction.   We heard no engines of any aircraft at any time.<n>

It followed what seemed to be an arc shaped trajectory; was visible for a few minutes, dimming as it moved into the distance, then disappeared into the distant night sky.  This light was followed closely by a second light which appeared before the first one had disappeared and behaved similarly.  There then followed a further eight similar lights all moving in the same direction although their trajectories varied slightly.

My friend in the front seat said it looked like a cloud that was moving .I had been taking many snapshots of the object with my Cannon power shot 8 mega pixel.  Then I started recording video of the object. I was having trouble keeping the object inside the view finder.  At the end of the video approx.1:16 minutes.  The object disappeared .I uploaded the pictures and video onto my computer the next day.

I volunteer at the my daughter’s school and co-lead her 2nd grade brownie troop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking down the street and heard a small plane.  I looked up and saw a bi-plane flying in circles. I noticed about a dozen or more small white objects floating in the sky either near or above the plane. They were somewhat round, although it was hard to be sure.  They were somewhat reflective either white or silver and glinted as if they were moving yet stayed stationary for the most part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of them seemed larger, possibly because it was nearer and had a sort of  parachute shape.  Some ladies saw me taking pictures and we all started looking at the objects trying to figure out what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought they might be parachutes, but they were hovering in the same position for too long. We also guessed they might be balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute or so of staying in a fairly stable pattern, they started to spread out and change positions.  They looked like star constellations.  In fact, one group was forming what looked like the big dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stood watching, they began to  dissipate into the atmosphere as if they were floating upward and then they disappeared.<n>

I started to look and did not see anything but a plane that looked a little low for how big of a plane it was when i notice a fire like object that was traveling east kinda like a stop and go motion.  It was going east and went in 90 degree angle to the west and then went back east until it disappeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first i thought it could have been a plane on fire until people was saying that there was five of them .

6/12/10 02:00|Sofia (Bulgaria)||Light|1:30|Fairy like UFOs|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80849.html|262|ndxe201006| Fairy like UFOs<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello guys, I want to report something very strange and at the same time very interesting.  The exact date is 12.06.2010 at 2:00 Am in Bulgaria, Sofia.  First I would like to apologize for my English, cos I am not from USA or other English speaking country but I will try my best to explain everything as detail as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok I will start from there that I am a young guy who likes sports, dont drink, dont smoke nothing, only healthy life, I am saying this, cos I was not hallucinating or something!!!  I am very interested in UFOs since I was little, now I am 27 and I am obsessed with the subject.   When I am at home after work I am watching all kind of documentaries about it, everything there is on Discovery, History channels and so on.   So one night when I finished watching a docu about ufos, I said to myself - ok thats it, I am tired of only watching about it and about all those fake ufo clips on youtube so I decided to look for myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was June very warm weather I looked outside from my window, I am living in a 9 story building and I am on the highest floor, when i looked up I saw that the sky was absolutely clear, so many stars and I said to myself omg I got to go on the roof and start watching the sky every single night, inside myself I knew I would see something, cos up there high I can see the whole sky more clearly and without the distraction of the street lights.  So when everybody was sleeping I got there I took even a blanket to lie down and look at the sky till the morning that was my plan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Friday I stayed for like an hour and I saw a meteor fly by it was so beautiful and at that moment I thought to myself wow when this meteor can enter the planet Earth so easy everything can and I stayed like half an hour more and got back to my apartment.  That was my first try, I was very happy thou that I saw something moving not only the stars but that was only the beginning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the next evening was the actual sighting, so the same story I get there around 1:00 am and laid down on the blanket and actually I was prepared to see another meteor I was convinced that there are ufos but didnt expect to see what I saw, its crazy! So around 2:00 am I saw this time a bigger meteor to fly by and it was destroyed by the atmosphere into peaces very high in the sky, it was beautiful, so I got on my feet and start watching it and after 30 sec I saw the meteor the sighting began!  So I was staying on my feet and still watching up high cos wanted to see more meteors maybe but what I saw I couldnt believe my eyes!   So the meteor was burned out and 30 sec after I saw him I was still looking up and saw a light cant tell the exact color red or violet was falling from very high in the sky down to the roof in a spiral fashion it was unbelievable like a dance and I thought to myself wow a peace of the meteor is falling down yay I am a lucky one, I saw a meteor very high in the sky and its gonna fall a 6 meters in front of me wow what are the chances but thats what I thought cos I didn&#39;t expect something else! So this light was falling down in a spiral fashion from very high very slowly and when it was around 6 meters in front of me so close and the same height as me so in front my eyes I just step back one step cos I was like wow its gonna fall on the roof but when it was on my height falling in a spiral fashion it just start to fly straight in front of me but not straight I mean left right up down it was like dancing and then I was like ooo my God that is not a meteor, it flies! I was very scared, what the hell is that I didnt have time cos I look to my left guess what another light falling down this time like a &#34;falling leaf&#34; fashion left right, left right and when was in front of my eyes height it flew in the direction of the other ufo and it was absolutely silent no noise at all only flying and it look like it defies gravity up down, left right so smooth it was like magical I was like watching those fan tasy movies watching magical lights flying by me no sound no nothing I immediately call them fairies cos they were so beautiful no sound at all, so after the second one I turned to my right a 3rd light falling and flying in the direction of the first one.  And when I look at them how they are flying it looked to me that they were intelligent, cos they were flying so like they were looking for something left right up down and like scanning the surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I was there all alone on the block of flat at 2:30 am and those lights were like dancing and wanting to show me their presence I dont know but I was scared and started to fall back and when I was going back a 4th light flew over my shoulder and I was like omg I am out of here on the way back I was looking in every direction, cos I didnt know from where they will appear I was scared I coudnt hear a thing only with my eyes I was like turning my head in every possible direction and when I got to the door to exit the roof a 5th one flew over my head omg I am out and I ran the stairs down to my flat, I was all shaken!   This is absolutely unbelievable! I stayed at my apartment like 15 min and was looking up from the window and saying to myself omg some lights (or fairies like I call them immediately) are flying up there and I am staying here I have to go back not everybody is seeing this I have to be crazy not to go there this is unbelievable!  So my curiosity was bigger than I was scared and i got back there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived I was looking at every possible direction cos I knew I coldnt hear them only seeing them. It was 3:00 am and I waited till 3:30 and I was trying to convince myself that I was hallucinating and to go back to my apartment, cos actually i was scared :D and I said to myself ok last look up to the sky till my neck hurts and I am out and when I looked up immediately it just flew over my head about a 2 meters above it, it flew so smooth I can describe it like when you make an airplane from paper and throw it, it flies so smooth and make a smooth turn to my left and just disappeared I even saw it very clearly, cos was above my head and I could see it in more detail it looked something like a rc mini airplane I can even describe it, it looked like 2 dots connected with a minus sign something like that *-* and had a haze around it, but there was no mist or something it was absolutely clear night, but when it flew it had some green glow around it, it was like going th! rough the space and I can even make another comparison, when there is a mist and the lights of the car is on, around the lights there is some kind of glow cos of the mist this is what it looked like but was a clear night, it was unbelievable, and I was like &#34;There it is ooo my God!&#34; (I was talking with voice to myself all the time, cos this was something that cant be explained) and I got out of there and that was my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went 9-10 months from that sighting and I cant go back there cos its still cold.  I cant wait to get warm to go there again, but this time I am very scared cos I know what to expect, don’t saying that this was something scary but those lights were something out of this world and when the human brain sees something that cant be explained, it is scary.  That day I didnt expect anything to happen but now I know and i am 100% convinced that they will return, cos they know I am looking for them and I am even convinced that they are even flying every single day and night but we cant see them, cos they are invisible and only if they want to show their presence they will light their light and glow, cos when I saw the last light and when made a turn to the left it just disappeared, so they can be flying without we even know it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope someone has a similar experience and tell me what that is. Thank you in advance! Bye guys!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>
6/12/10 01:00|Taneytown|MD|Circle|seconds|green glowing circle shooting across sky and nightly white light|6/23/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75770.html|263|ndxe201006| green glowing circle shooting across sky and nightly white light<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always had a habit of watching the skies at night.  The best sightings I had were when I lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  My boyfriend and I were walking into the mall on night and I noticed an unusual light in the sky and we decided when we left the mall if it was still there we would go look for it.  When we came out it was still there but had moved slightly.  So we drove up to Hyde Park where the lookout spot is and could see a disk like object hovering above Santa Fe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sightings I am reporting now are above Taneytown, MD.  I have not lived here long but since I have moved here I have been noticing different things.  Last winter I saw a falling object over a local park, it was too large to be a falling star.  I have noticed an object that travels parallel with a main road- the lighted object moves so slow it is almost not noticeable it is moving unless you are actually watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also noticed that around 9pm there is a light in the sky behind where we live.  To give an idea of the diameter; stars vs. &#34;the light&#34;   it is like the stars are pin-heads and “the light” is a pencil eraser.  The light is not directly above me when I see it; it is off in the distance a bit. To show attempt to express the distance it travels within an amount of time; if you were to go on my back porch with a ruler and hold it up, the bottom of the ruler lined up with the roof top of the house-- the light starts out about 12 inches above the house diagonally behind us, then by 10pm the light is level with the chimney top of the same house.  Not sure how else to explain it.  The light is not directly above the house it is off in a distance.  Just using perspective to explain how it moves.  Also it does not move in a straight line – it slowly zigzags as it moves forward.  My friend and I went looking for it the other night but it was slightly cloudy out and lost it.  We a! re going to attempt it again on another night.  This light is out there every night – but I have not noticed it on rainy nights because I don’t go out there when it is raining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier tonight I saw something in my peripheral vision above me out front.  It was a very large green glow shooting across the sky.  It was round in the front and it definitely was not a shooting star, if I would have held my fist in the air it would have been bigger than my fist. And it disappeared right after I looked up.<n>

6/11/10 23:30|Six Mile|SC|Light|20 seconds|My wife and I independently and in two locations saw similar unexplained lights at about the same time|6/23/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75755.html|265|ndxe201006| My wife and I independently and in two locations saw similar unexplained lights at about the same time<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night sometime between 23:00 and 0:00 on 6/11/10 I went upstairs and just happened to see two yellow lights that appeared to be stationary on Duncan road near our horse pasture.  I thought someone was messing with the horses so I ran downstairs and grabbed a powerful flashlight and went outside and pointed the light down Duncan road.  Nothing was there, there was no sound, absolutely nothing was visible or could be heard. I scanned the flashlight beam all around and the horses were resting and did not appear disturbed.  I forgot about it.  Shortly after that I heard a crash on the porch and a chair with cat food on it was turned over with no sign of an animal.  This could have been a raccoon or something.  My wife works late and got home about 00:30 after midnight and I told her about the chair, but did not mention the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today on 6/12 my wife and I were coming home from eating lunch and she mentioned she saw four lights red and yellow on Mile Creek road where Love Care road intersects.  This is no more than a mile from our house. She said the lights moved rapidly off to one side and were gone.  She thought it was someone with a trailer in a nearby house, but when she passed nothing was there.  We decided her sighting and mine were very coincidental and unusual and may be worth reporting<n>
6/11/10 23:30|Afghanistan (Forward Operating Base)||Triangle|under 10 sec|V-shaped formation of lights over Afghanistan base.|6/23/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75895.html|266|ndxe201006| V shape formation over Afhganistan<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was on guard duty, from ((deleted)) to ((deleted)) hrs., I looked up to the northern mountains at my 2:00 o&#39;clock  I saw a string of lights moving from east to west; it stopped at my 12:00 o&#39;clock.  I ran out of the tower with my NVG (night vision goggles).  As I got to the outside of the tower the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared in the area and noticed that the object was coming out of a left bank turn heading towards me.  The mountains are about 2 miles away, and it floated over our Forward Observation Base (F.O.B.) in Afghanistan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped over our base and it spun around pointing north again it drifted west over a small village.  Just past the village, it stopped then it just shot over the northern mountains in a split second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was 5 large lights in a V shape formation.  I could not see the object, due to the cloud cover, but you can tell that it was one solid object with 5 lights.  It was also very large as it hovered over the base, I can see that it was larger then the base!<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a war zone no military air craft are to fly with lights on, and I know all of our aircrafts.  Also, as the U.F.O was hovering over the base it was a windy night with gust of 30 miles.  It had stopped and it started again as it passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded, and quite serious about the sighting.  He reported that he thought the altitude of the tops of the mountains was about 2,000 feet.  Also, he estimated that the object appeared to be, from the vantage point of the witness, to be larger than a clenched fist, at arm&#39;s length, appears to be.  PD))<n>

At closer look it was very high in the sky, no sounds were audible, and no blinking lights, or shape were visible.  The light appeared to be very high and seemed to change directions from approching to reversing and it ascended upward very fast and then the bright light just disappeared without a trace(as if someone just turned off the flood light).  I have no idea what it was but I have never seen any known aircraft travel at those speeds to not be visible that quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Flame because it flickered in that sense. It was large enough to recognize the flickering.  Thought of a hot air ballon but it was traveling too fast and flame was too visable to be of any highth to catch major winds for speed. Surface winds were 5 mph.  No sound. It was traveling South to North and kept a steady direction until it dissapeared.  Weird because of flame versus glowing lights like most sightings.   Not a meteor high / low characteristic nor any trail of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The lights were approx 500-1,000 feet above the ground.  This guess is based on my own personal experiences with flight lessons in which I was a pilot who flew under VFR only.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What made me watch the lights was the fact that there were no navigational blinking lights as well as literally NO SOUND.  The craft flew over my house and it was at this time that I noticed it was not two but three white lights in a triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to run in and get my wife but did not want to miss out on what I was seeing.  This craft was very low and while directly overhead emitted a sort of haze around the lights.  I really believe that this object was not a conventional aircraft despite it heading in the direction of the Moline, IL airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There has to be other people in the vicinity to have seen this.  I am shocked at what I saw at such a close distance.  I would not normally go out of my way to report something like this but this was very unique experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the sighting occurred at night, and we have amended the time above.

My son noticed a plane flying high in the sky, but I noticed something much higher.  At first my husband said it was a star, but I said no it was way to low to be a star.  I watched it for about 5 minutes and it just seemed to stay in one spot.  It was very bright and almost seemed to twinkle different colors.  We all looked at it for awhile.  Then one of my kids saw a dolphin in the water. When we looked back up after a couple of minutes the object was gone. My husband and I are both school teachers and our children are 13 &amp; 15.  We have never seen anything like this before.  At one point we said possibly a satellite, but the ones we have spotted in the past were moving.  We enjoy looking at the stars and have seen a meteor shower but we do not actively look for things out of the ordinary.  I would like to know if there is anyone else who may have seen this as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star, or Venus??  PD))<n>

We look out the right window and are shocked to see four bright lights in a row hovering about 50 feet in the air.  The lights flipped from horizontal to vertical in place then rose and flipped again so now it was upside-down, then it took off diagonally, not in a straight line but curved and flew off to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped and the cars behind us stopped.  When it took off we kept driving away trying to figure out what we saw, I tried to take a video but it was too dark.<n>

Tokachidake (an active volcano in the northern part of Japan), which has been famous for UFO sightings for decades.  Near the bottom left corner of the video, you can see two lights showing zigzag motions, keeping the same distance between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the past, during the daytime around this area, my friend witnessed a strange oval object with two lights, one each on the left and the right edges, so I suppose that would be the reason for these two lights keeping the same distance.  I fixed my camera position and did not follow the lights, so the zigzag motion of the object was not because of camera shake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although the lights were moving around a lower part of the sky, it does not mean they were close to the ground because I was standing on the plateau looking down the wild forest and valley below.  The site was a kind of dangerous area where wild bears often appeared, so no one could fly an LED night kite or anything else in the wild forest or valley in the middle of the night.  The site was at an altitude of 1200 meters and the temperature was very low at night.  It was completely dark and I could see many stars in the sky with the naked eyes, but my small digital camera (CASIO EX-H10) could not catch any starlight.

I watched it fly past (as I have done since I moved here- we have a good view).  After watching the plane for rouughly 15 seconds i realised it wasn&#39;t moving.  As I studied it for a few more seconds I realised it was in fact moving- but vertically.  I thought at first it may have been a hot air balloon but common sense made me realised that no sane person would have been flying one at this time of night.  The object was a perfectly cylindrical &#34;plume&#34; of light- yellow in colour- with a small &#34;bulb&#34; at the top of it.  At this point I called the girlfriend over to confirm I wasn&#39;t just mental, but she saw it too.  The object rose a further minute till it was at a height higher than that of which planes pass the window.  My girlfriend turned away for a bried moment when the object all of a sudden &#34;vanished.&#34;  Had I not been concentrating so much on it then I would have lost it but I was fixed on it.  The object had tur! ned into a perfectly circular ball of &#34;blackness.&#34;  The onject veered slightly to the left and toward us quite quickly.  All of a sudden it started to accelerate horitzontally toward us. In a period of about 20 seconds, it had passed over our heads and out of our sights.  As I rushed down and out of our first story flat to inspect where it should be, it had vanished completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was about the size of a typical star but was 100 times brighter.  It would go in a small circle and then go back to hovering.

Like a basketball surrounded by electric bolts of electricity.  Soundless and hovering 500 ft. above the ground and you can see lights where alledged windows might be away from the engine or bright white lights.  There is contour around where the alledged window light is or a bend in the outside of the object and can see reflection from the bright white light on the contour around the alledged window.  I just got off work and had picked up my two small kids I&#39;m raising on my own from day care and had put them to bed, went outside to have a smoke before going to bed myself.  It looked like a star but something was odd about the light, so I grabbed my vhs recorder and zoomed in while filming.  It&#39;s pretty clear but I believe if someone who new about video tape and could clear the picture up a little such as the lighting we might all be surprised.  Not sure what to do with the video, its amazing!<n>

I tried to focus and get a better look but the light was so bright and powerful it hurt my eyes to look at. I couldn&#39;t focus on this object as hard I tried.  I was outside of my house and I called 6 other family members to oberserve it and they all agreed it wasn&#39;t a star but a unknown object.  I stayed outside to observe the object to see if it would move or change but it didn&#39;t move at all and I tried to take a picture of it but it was too far away to capture a good picture of it.  I have a picture of the light but it is small.   As I stood out observing the object other people came out of their houses and I could hear people talking about the object in the sky. I also called a family member driving towards the house! and they could also see it.  The object slowly started to move down and it seemed to get closer.   As it seemed to get closer maybe within 2 miles it looked like it was pulsating light coming from it.  I started to worry and I went into my house.  When I went into my house I heard airplanes and helicopters flying by my house which is uncharacteristic of this time of night or even flying in my are.  An hour later I went out to see what it was and it was gone.  I would say this is the most eerie thing I have observed in the night sky in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At least 10-15 of them all in a row same color going the same direction, I went inside to grab my binoculars (keep in mind i didnt have a camera or video recorder) &amp; tryed to see w/ the binoculars. It was simply amazing we couldnt belive it, we stood there &amp; watched them go by. 15! minutes later another fleet comes by! 10-15 same color going the same direction. Now we are in shock almost scared... We knew these were UFOs because @ one point one actually jumped from the left side of the row to the right side. Now my dad is actually calling the towns paper but it was late so he left a message on their voicemail describing what we seen about mysterious lights in the sky but in the morning we never got a call back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This phenomena continued for about 30-40 minutes.

What we saw was a series of lights flashing one by one in a line which would disappear after one or two series of flashes only to reappear at a different location from where we last saw it. Also for each of the series of flashing lights, whatever the lights were attached to was distinctly hovering in one place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no tracking light that all planes and helicopters have.  After about six or seven times of it reappearing and disappearing, it finally disappeared behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was clear to the point where all of the stars were visible.  In fact, in a different part of the sky a plane was also visible which provided a point of comparison.  The plane seemed to be significantly smaller and the only light it was giving off was the flashing tracking light on the belly of the fuselage.  The series of lights given off by the UFO, while far away, were especially bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been a UFO skeptic for my entire life, but after racking my brain for a full day I cannot come up with an explanation for any current aircraft that behaves like what we saw last night.<n>

I am currently a student in the medical field and I had to be at the hospital by 5:30 am that morning.  It was still sort of dark out, enough that I had to turn my headlights on.  There was no wind. The sky was clear, no clouds were in site.  I got in my car around 4:50am, started it and waited for it to warm up. I live in a normal neighborhood in the south east part of the city.  As I was backing out of my driveway I happened to look up in the sky out of the driver’s side window, which would have been towards the west.  I saw a fairly small whitish light about 45-55 degrees above the horizon in the sky.  It almost looked like a star.  When I first saw it I did a double take, when I fixed my eyes on the object it looked like it was moving around very fast and then it stopped and hovered for a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I started driving west down my street still looking at it through the front windshield of the car.! It was moving very slowly.  There were no flashing lights, or blinking lights like those on an airplane or any other man-made aerial craft.  As soon as I got to the end of the street at the stop sign I stopped and got out of my car and was watching the light slowly travel north north east at a fairly slow rate, slower than any airplane could fly without crashing.  When I got out of my car and looked up at the object it was pretty far away, but it almost looked like there were 3 lights in the shape of a triangle.  They appeared to be kind of close together, like it was a single object, not 3 flying objects in close proximity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a few seconds I was pondering driving back to my house to grab my video camera, but I didn’t want to lose sight of it as it was traveling away from me.  (Later that evening I checked to see if my video camera was even charged and it wasn’t.  I am always going to make sure it is from now on at all times.)  I was parked in front of a neighbor’s house long e! nough for someone to turn on their front porch light.  I don’t ! know if they saw me and was wondering what I was doing.  I didn&#39;t want them to call the cops thinking I was a prowler or anything so I got back in my car and watched the object moving away from me slightly increasing in speed. I backed the car up back towards my house so I could try to see it as there were trees blocking my field of view and I gradually lost it in the sky due to the sun starting to rise over the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said I know what I saw, and I saw something that wasn’t man made. It looked like it had 3 small lights in the shape of a triangle and they were white. I am not a liar.  I consider myself very credible.  I teach at a local high school, and I am also a student in the medical field.  I have also seen several other unknown objects in the sky over my lifetime.  Hopefully someone else saw the same thing I did, but it’s highly unlikely that anyone will report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks. I hope this has been helpful and I hope someone will believe me.<n>

I immediately began to drive away toward my parents house 15miles away.  As I was pulling away the lights were i would say about the size of two big trucks at 50ft up.  They began to dim and move higher in the sky.  A few miles away it was higher in the sky and smaller but it had moved rapidly in a zipping horizontal movement across the bridge i was heading over.  At this point it was the size of maybe a cluster of 3 or 4 bright stars.  As I drove the final 2 or 3 miles the light shrunk to the size of 1 bright star size or planet.  The light remained stationary for the next 2 or 3 hrs then disappeared beyond the horizon,  As if it was a fixed star.  The light would at times elongate itself to a vertical point.  The light was extremely bright when above my home but emmited no light on any surface or surroundings. at some poin! t while driving it caused my car radio to shut off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

A few minutes later we saw a single large oval amber colored light that also disappeared.  We could look up and see the planes flying in the sky and they were tiny in comparison. A few minutes later we saw on the right side of the road two very very large amber cigar shaped lights side by side that were moveing forward, these also quickly disappeared right before our eyes. the sky was clear and the sun had just set so there was still some light in the sky so that when the lights went out you could see that there was nothing there. about four years earlier we saw a similar large amber light in the same location at the same time of night that also disappeared.<n>

6/7/10 00:00|Moberly|MO|Changing|25 min.|I have noticed a very bright twinkling light several nites in a row and it will appear in the west sky ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))|6/10/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75722.html|298|ndxe201006| I have noticed a very bright twinkling light several nites in a row and it will appear in the west sky around 10:30PM and around 11:00PM will disappear.  I wrote it off as a satalite or planet.  Last night I was on my second story deck facing the west and just above the tree line I saw a shape with bright red, green, blue lights that seemed to move very slowly while changing the shape of the object.  It seemed to be not moving...I called my dogs in and could hear no sound of aircraft at all.  All was quiet.  I then went into the bedroom and watched out of the west window and got my husband up to see what he thought and he said he had not seen anything like that and it was moving but very slowly.  I con&#39;t to watch and could see flashes of white lights seeming to come away and to the object the white lights almost looked like shooting stars.  It took about 25 mins. for the object to move northwest and below the tree line and out of sight.  In my observing the ! object the lights didn&#39;t dim, they stayed very bright red, green and blue and would change in position to change the shape of the object.  This is not the first time I have seen strange lights to the west above the tree line but the first time to see the lights so bright and different colors.  I also observed an airplane flying and looking like it was going right to it and then dipped down and flew under the object.  I tried to take pictures but my camera is not a strong enough lense to get a clear one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))<n>

We had just got back from 4-wheeling and we had a barbacue.  I was sitting on a ledge and looked up into the sky.  At first i saw 2 crafts about 10 feet away from each other.  Both were blinking red,white, and green.  I then saw another one about 30 feet above both of them.  After about a min or two both were then moving upwards at a slow pace. It seemed as if they moving towards the one above them.  I then saw a helpicopter or airplane fly towards the objects, it went right through it as if nothing happened.I then looked to my right and saw another object.  Of them origin, same shape and color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked to my right more and yet again saw another helpicopter or airplane and it was heading towards the object.  I looked back and the objects had not moved.  The two below the one were once again moving upwards.  Yet again another airplane or helicopter was seen this one however just flying to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then ate and sat back dow nand looked up in the sky....... they were gone.  I then went home to go to sleep.  During this whole event my father was right next to me and numerous times i said look up, what do you think it is. He responded I dont know.  He said he has never seen it before.  I explained it to my friend over the phone who said that it must have been extremely weird.  He beleived me. I beleive that i saw was a UFO, and i do believe that there aliens out there.  One more thing is that today 7/2/10 i went outside and looked up and as i was sitting on my porchi looked up and saw the same object as seen before, i went back inside before i got to see what happened to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s my UFO sighting and i believe that its true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

A building blocked the view after watching it fly for 3 or 4 seconds. In my opinion this was not a shooting star-different color, not as fast, and was visible for much longer. There were 2 passenger jets that it flew near and must of been going ten times their speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had the pleasure of seeing something else many years ago as a young teenager.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was wrapping up my stargazing this evening, my neighbors had just pulled into their parking spot and where getting out of there car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly as I was stargazing an object floated across the sky at approximately 100 to 300 yards directly in front and above us.  I was very taken back by this And got the attention of  my neighbors.  The object was like a flying wing approximately the size of a hangglider.  It actually resembled a kite with rounded edges white lights or paint along the nose of the objects.  No sound at all,  the object was very faint and appeared to be somewhat transparent like a floating light green shower curtain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it wasn’t just me as the neighbors kid who is around 10 years of age Noticed it as well unfortunately,  his parents did not get to see it as it slowly Disappeared.  The viewing lasted roughly 15 seconds. Very strange!<n>

The one going right lighted normal then bright again. Then the one on the right went out to far out of site. This is what I saw. I can&#39;t answer for who I was with what he saw.

All activity was east of my location in Sandy, UT., and flights were over the Wasatch mountains. I saw an object of undetermined size flying north above the mountains much higher than any type of plane I am aware of. As I was watching the northbound light another light  appeared traveling East to West and appeared to be on a collision course and both units maneuvered at this point seemingly to avoid the west bound light. The West bound light extinguished shortly thereafter. The north bound light continued North and covered incredible distance in a short amount of time. I continued to watch the sky and another light headed from South to North. I saw one more after this that was not as bright and moved rapidly from South to North. I watch this area of sky frequently and this was an exceptionally unique occurance. I would be interested in contact by email if! this a typical sighting or what you may think about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was very overcast, with no stars, moon, or planets visible.   I went in for a second to get my husband, and it was totally gone when we came back out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We observed this until it was in to the tree lined area.  It is still there and not sure what this could be?  Seems to be a bit west of Rockford.  We did not pursue this in our car to see its location.  Would love to know if anyone else in Rockford has reported this or not.<n>

Upon observing, I realized it was considerably more distant because a light aircraft landing nearby at a community field eclipsed the object and based on the size I would have estimated it to be much closer if it was a &#34;free-ranging&#34; balloon.  Still skeptical, I observed and noticed the sphere ascending slowly to the south at a steady rate.  A faint fuzziness existed around its perimeter. I photographed the sky using a blackberry camera phone such that each frame should encompass the sphere.  To my amazement the object passed behind a thin but opaque cloud during the observation period.  This then confirmed that it was much higher and further away than a mylar balloon or facsimile.  The object maintained its altitude (estimated ~2000-3000 ft).  The presence of numerous jets landing and small private aircraft preclude the notion of a misidentification of a plane as a black/opaque sphere.  Six images were taken as it progressed southward to ultimately disappear.  I am posting this observation in response to seeing NUFORC reports of similar  in the vicinity.<n>

Then as if turning sideways, they would suddenly disappear, then appear again in a random group.  There were at least two separate &#34;clusters&#34; of shapes with at least one metallic side on each shape, just hovering and moving almost in a circular motion, not far from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them for about a half hour with some other curious onlookers and nobody could tell what they were...the two clusters eventually joined in a line above us and went south east of us.

These objects would change direction in such a matter so quickly that from my experience as a retired fireman and who&#39;s been around aircraft for over 30 years, there is nothing you can compare with the speed of which these things would move from one area to another.  They would at times disappear and reappear while changing in color from a shinny metallic to a dark color. then after approximately 30 to 40 minutes they started moving toward an east/south direction over the 15 fwy and out of our view in a cluster like formation and extremely fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Husband&#39;s report.

PD))|6/10/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75712.html|320|ndxe201006| Star like object and reddish sphere sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to a nearby park around 1:30am and laid down in the grass, looking up at the sky. I was with a friend. The sky had bouts of moving clouds.  Sometimes the clouds were more dense, and sometimes the sky would be pretty opened up.  I soon noticed a very bright star, there weren&#39;t any others noticable in the sky.  It was abnormally bright, and it was moving north in the sky.  It felt much too distant to be a plane, and there was no sound.  I asked my friend what he thought of it. He said he wasn&#39;t sure, he thought it was probably a satellite and fell asleep.   I&#39;ve never seen a satellite before, but this &#39;star&#39; looking object then stopped and stayed in one place, making small seeming motions back and for or up and down.  This object would fade in and out sometimes, other times it would get covered by clouds and it made it difficult for me to understand what it really was. After observing this one object, and noticing others over a matter of a half hour to 45 minut! es, one single, low flying plane, flew through the sky right in the vicinity that I was watching the object. I felt as though someone else saw this and was investigating the situation.  This was the only airplane I saw in the sky from my location that night.  Not long after that, I saw the most facinating thing I have ever seen.   A reddish, hazy, round sphere, less than a quarter of the moon in size came from nowhere from the lower left side of the star moving to the right, and flew at a very fast speed in front of the clouds across below the star looking object, and immediately moved south, in front of the clouds, but still feeling pretty far away.  The experience lasted about ten seconds and then it disappeared.  My friend soon woke up, and we left. I can&#39;t really remember much after the red sphere, I know the sky cleared of clouds, and some stars were visible.  It became more difficult to tell what were stars and if the star like object was sitting among them. I was pretty ove! rwhelmed.<n>

The sky night is beautiful there and we often go out in our field and checkout the night sky.  My mother little sister maddie my brother dino and my friend tommy were all sitting out on lounge chairs talking and trying to find constellations in the sky.  It was about 11:35 and I noticed a whit sphere shoot out and dissappear from  what looked like the brightest star in the sky that night.  I tried pointing it out but they had all missed it but we countinued to watch the orange looking star after a bit they we stopped watching because nothing more happened.  About half an hour later when I looked at the star it appeared to be getting bigger and soon we could see it moving away from the tree line and picking up speed.  At first I pointed it out but not everyone could tell if it was moving or not but it started moving a bit faster and soon had moved a large distace over the sky and finally fell directly above us and just sat there in the sky.  It sat directly above us for about ten minutes until it stared to kind of shimmer a bit aof red beneath it and then accelerate almost straight up and turning solid red.  It did not stop util we could no longer see it at all.  We all without a doubt knew this was not a natural  as it only took about a full minute and a half to make it from the treeline untill directly above us and the just stop from such a fast pace and sit there not moving directly above.  I can tell airplanes and satelight immediately and watch the night sky quite often and it was a cloudless night.  Anyways after seeing it leave we headed back to the cabin to tell my dad and other sister and when we got there had realized three hours had gone by and did not remember being there that long and my mom was a bit mad because we had to wake up early.  I had my phone wen we where out there and she didn’t want to be up that late but I seemed to be the only one who really noticed the time loss and found it weird.<n>

Moments later, the star began changing colors from yellowish-white to red to blue and flashing excitedly, briefly got brighter, then it appeared to began moving away from the Earth at what I can only assume was a surprising fast rate of speed.  The light grew smaller and smaller until finally is disappeared.  There appeared to be a faint haze around where the lights had been.  The movement away from the Earth was very fast and took only moments.

The rings then changed to what could be described as triangular shapes protruding from the sides of the circle.  The circular shape then &#34;flew&#34; upwards where we lost sight of it.  Please note that the rings/triangles where surrounded by a fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 1 - 2 minutes later we then observed an aeroplane flying from a different direction.  This was obvious from the shape and the wing lights, we therefore dispute any person/s or organizations trying to state that it was an airplane.

They made no sound and appeared to be powered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my back yard facing straight south on Saturday 6-5-10.  I had been outside about 15-20 minutes and then at approximately 1:00 AM, still facing south, I spotted, at an altitude of about 45 degrees up, and just slightly to the west, two separate lights, side by side, traveling directly from north to south.  I ended up following one of the lights with a pair of 10x 50 binoculars, south, to an altitude of about 5 deg, just above the trees down the block.  By this time it was far off and very dim. The sighting, from beginning to end, lasted around 35-45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects made no sound,  jet, prop etc., completely silent.  No blinking, or flashing  lights. Magnitude was 2.0 to 1.0, approximately.  Looking through binoculars, the colors were a dim orange glow with no distinct lines and the shapes of the glows were rectangular with rounded over corners.  Through binoculars they were approx 0.25&#34; inch wide, maybe slightly larger and the position of the &#34;rectangles&#34; were symmetric to one another.  My first impression when viewing through binoculars was that they looked like sky lanterns as they start to burn low, when all that&#39;s visible is the glow from the lower part of the paper sack.  It was hard to tell, but the shapes looked like they were the bottoms of something as opposed to being the entire object.  I could see (with binoculars), a very faint reflection or distortion out in front of the orange glows.  This was dark in color and not a reflection of the orange light but more of a reflection or distortion of the night sky.  These &#34;refl! ections or distortions&#34; were extremely faint to the point of fading in an out of view.  Height of the lights could have been satellite altitude or as low as passenger jet altitude, but I couldn&#39;t be sure.  I do believe the lights were much higher than local low flying air traffic.  Speed appeared slightly faster than satellite speed.  Distance between the two objects, when I first spotted them, (extending my arm up, in front of me at a 45 degree angle and spreading two fingers apart) was about 3&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I like watching satellite/Iridium pass over, so initially I thought I was seeing two satellites.  Movement of the objects appeared powered and were very fluid and constant.  They stayed perfectly fixed, side by side, traveling in a straight line like two fighter jets in formation.   They were definitely not something being carried on the wind.  There were stars between them so I know they weren&#39;t attached. I watched them like this, with naked eye, for a few seconds, but the lights looked different than satellites, not pin point reflections, but more of a dull glow, so I switched to my binoculars.  After a few seconds I began watching just one of the lights (the other light was outside the field of view of my binoculars) until it dimmed out of sight, so I don&#39;t know if the other object stayed beside it the entire time.  As far down on the horizon as it traveled, about 5 deg, I would think the other object would&#39;ve come into the FOV but I didn&#39;t see it.  The &#34;dull glow&#34; of these objects was dim enough that had they been the smaller size of the pin-point of reflected light given off from a satellite passover, I probably wouldn&#39;t have spotted them.  Because of their larger size, though, they were very evident to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Night was clear, moonless, little or no breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be curious to know what these lights are, and someone else may be able to easily explain them, but in all my years of looking up, I&#39;m at a loss.

Sky had just gone dark, so the sky was slightly light.  There was a skinny storm cloud stretching across the sky- you could see the whole perimeter of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching it closely because the tail end appeared to be trying to drop a funnel cloud.  Then I saw green light shining down.  I thought it had to be some strange lightening, but there was no other lightening in the sky.  It was shining through a spot in the clouds exactly like a spot light.  It was clearly very green in color.  We tried to capture it on cell phone camera, but it would not show up.  When we watched the video the screen flashed white a couple times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was probably about ten miles north of Bismarck on hw 83.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On approach to Bismarck we saw three amber/orange/red colored lights above town.  They would move around independently.  I thought they moved like a fly.  Sometimes they would sort of fade away...then light up again on a different end of town.  They were more difficult to see from in town, but we still saw them and again tried to take a video, but the phone would not go onto video mode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People were obviously looking at the lights from their vehicles too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would really like to know what this is about.  I searched the internet for reports of it, and found this website.<n>

I looked into the southern ski and seen what looked like a shooting star, only it was going up.  I then noticed as many as six craft that looked the size of stars.  But they where playing!!  I watched them for about 40 minutes in shock at the speed they moved, they must have been traveling 1000 miles per hour.  They would make right and left turns without slowing at all.  They would fly in circles with no pattern set. As if they were just having fun!  They where still flying when i left, i had no video camera and no witness however i know what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited untill 05:00 for my wife to leave for work so i could call her with this story.

One of the object, glowing red, moved quickly toward my house, above where I was standing. It hovered no more than 300 feet above me, and moved down the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night, at 3:00 sharp, my roommate came outside as I was coming in.  I told him what had happened, and we both began searching the night sky.  Seconds later, the shape appeared again, moving as it had before (very rapidly).  Within ten minutes, a series of flashes erupted from the east, without cloud cover (no lightning).  Immediately afterward, a dozen circular &#34;crafts&#34; emerged, traveling in perfect oblong triangles (groups of three), moving west at a decent speed, as though heading toward some planned destination.  It didn&#39;t take long before more and more of these groups emerged.  Soon enough, the sky was littered with these triangular groups.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like looking at a sky filled with moving stars, but the stars were larger and far brighter, able to pierce through cloud cover.  After each wave finished, there would be more flashes of light, followed by hundreds of &#34;crafts.&#34;  Coincidentally, the flashing red craft I had seen earlier came bounding down towards us, but stayed at a decent height.  Tiny specks of light (or what looked like smaller crafts) broke off of the entity periodically.  This whole process lasted two hours, or until 5:00 am.  All in all, I would say that we saw approximately 1500 anomalies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize how outlandish this sounds, but I am being quite honest, and only wish to help people understand the gravity of the situation. I can only share my subject feelings on the matter, but from the looks of it, each anomaly was being piloted, taking non linear paths, some turning around completely.  At one point, when all of the cloud cover vanished, the crafts froze simultaneously and took on the patterns of constellations, i.e., Orion&#39;s Belt, the Big Dipper, etc., as though to camouflage. The flashing red anomaly also emitted a strange pulsating noise, very quietly; however, only further examination of the envirnment will tell if this is somehow connected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this happens again tonight, as I will be patiently awaiting.  I am serious in admitting that something very big was (or is) going on.  I hope that you can believe my story, as ridiculous as it may sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best regards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received assurances from the source of the report that it is a serious-minded report.

I saw immediately above me (approximately 100 feet above and 150- 200 feet in front of me) a dark, very large, slow-flying (approx. 10mph), disc-shaped object (almost identical to the movie independence day), flying in a south-easterly direction.  It was making a low, humming (buzzing) noise as it passed over the house rooftop next to our house. In shock, my mouth dropped and I watched it literally become invisible as a wave of colorlessness enveloped it. I could still see the shape and outline of it, though, once invisible. Afraid I would miss the sighting&#39;s entirety, I did not alert my boyfriend who was inside only a few steps away. And since I&#39;d seen other UFO&#39;s, but none sooooo low-flying, I did not want to miss a thing. I watched it melt away into the clouds at the same super-slow speed. The farthest I saw it&#39;s distance was approximately 500 feet away, still at approximately 100 feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and told him what I had just seen. Every night for a week we went out at the same time and watched for it&#39;s return. Unbelievably, the next Friday, exactly seven days later at the exact same time, the exact same thing happened, at the exact same place. The only difference was it was an additional 50-100 feet higher, at a total of 150-200ft up. I was facing it, with his back to it, and I said &#34;There it is!&#34; I pointed to it and he and I watched it do the very same thing I had seen only a week prior. We were stunned and I was only too happy to have had it verified by another pair of eyes. We watched for it and never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I then filled a glass of water and left it on a counter, then went to bed around 10pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 2:00 am I awoke with a tingling sensation all over my body,  Standing just outside my bedroom doorway, there were two figures standing in my hallway.  I went to get out of bed and couldn’t, I seemed to be paralyzed with my head turned toward them, I went to point to the sky, couldn’t, tried to roll out of bed and couldn’t.  During all of this there was a brighter than usual light coming in through a far bedroom window, behind them but towards me, with a blue-ish tint to it.  The two figures I saw were gray in color with dark, large eyes, nostrils but no visible nose, and a small mouth, but there was no sound of any kind, except the frogs and ducks outside.  My bedroom is on the second floor, on the back of my townhome, the light was coming from the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fell back to sleep, until about 10am the next morning, bad dream right.  Went to turn on my cable tv in my bedroom and the cable was out, tried down stairs, it was out too.  I then called my cable company, they ran a circuit test and said everything was fine on their end, so they came to look at my boxes. The cable tech said he had to reprogram the EPROM chips in my boxes with another computer and did, worked fine after that. We talked, there was no lightning or storms the night before that we knew of and I informed all my equipment is on surge protector anyway shouldn’t have blown or wiped like that.  Then I went out to my front yard and there was and still is, a tear- dropped shape of discolored, almost burnt grass in my front yard about 30ft wide and 30 ft long that wasn’t there before, pointed from where the light was coming from.

The circle just appeared and moved a short distance across the sky, south to north, was still for just a moment and then vanished, as if it had been erased.  It was not moving as fast as a meteor would, but it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my perspective, the bright neon green circle was a few inches above the houses and moved from left to right a few inches, like two inches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object did not have the same characteristics as a meteor.  It did not have a tail, nor did it shoot high across the sky and fade away.  Meteors are fairly easy to track because they consume more distance in the sky than this object.  As low as this object was, and that it was headed across the sky instead of a falling or having had an arc flight pattern, like meteors do, it could not have possibly come from the atmosphere.<n>

It was very skinny with four legs that seem to be longer than its body, skin that was pinkish and paper fine,almost see through. It didn&#39;t seem to have any eyes and it&#39;s face was long.  As soon as it realized that it couldn&#39;t convince me that it was a animal it shrank down to the ground and it&#39;s crawling almost like a spider. It crawled over to a fence post and wrapped itself around it,there was no where for this thing to hide, I could feel fear coming from it to.My teenagers where afraid and wanted to leave,so we left.

As two friends of mine were leaving, one got in his car and drove off, the other called for me to quickly come over and look up.  As we can only see the &#34;aircraft&#34; from one angle, below us, the object was a circle shape, so likely some kind of saucer/disk.  It’s altitude was near what typical, large commercial passenger planes reach as they are approaching landing, near Mill Avenue bridge.  The aircraft proceeded to head mostly south, in a slightly west direction.  When I witnessed the aircraft, it appeared to be 1-2 miles from me, over head.  It silently floated in the sky, as it traveled down over the rest of Tempe (until it was out of my sight).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my friend and I were watching it slowly drift away, another neighbor came outside to go to their car as well.  We called to her immediately, notifying her if she wanted to see a UFO to come quick.  She came over and watched with us, as she called her roommate to come outside.  By the time the roommate (4th witness) came outside to meet us, all he could see was the red light in the far distance (unable to tell the difference between this and another local Sky-Harbor related aircraft).<n> <n><n> <n><n> To describe the object:  It had no color, maybe black, and had a red light at the tail of it that occasionally turned quickly on and off (slight flash). The front lights were a series of lights, between 6-8 white, circular lights that were all on, but one. This is hard to describe, but one light would turn off, in the row of lights, and turn back on as the next one turned off.  It repeated this pattern, across the entire row, and back again.  Resembles the kind of lighting effects that are used on games we see at the fair, or Peter Piper Pizza, for example.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I have lived in direct sight of Sky Harbor’s flight path for landing/taking off over the last 4 years, I have watched aircraft during the day and at night time.  I know what helicopters look like, and how aircraft are supposed to have one red and one green light (to indicate which direction they are flying to other aircraft) and this did not have these lights.  Like I said, the only red light was at the tail. The object moved slowly, similar to that of a police helicopter, using their search light to find a criminal.  The bright white lights making a pattern, as the object flew, was very usual, let alone unsettling.  The object made little sound, very slight puttering sound, but almost nothing at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 21 year old female, just graduated from ASU.  The other observers are one male, 22 year old, current ASU student.  The other witness, another resident at this apartment complex off 8th street and Dorsey, is about 19-20 years old.  Her roommate is male, between 21-24 years old.<n>

We live on the 3rd floor of our Apartment. &#34; He said look at this object in the sky&#34;, There was a bright far away fuzzy looking object in the sky above the tree tops from where we were standing in the north west sky.  At first I thought it was a star, but  it moved in closer and it appeared to have a hazy glow so I went inside to get my binoculars.  While I was inside the object moved somewhat closer. The object  looked like a top that young children use to play with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The tips of object both top and bottom extended to a point the middle was of course round but the strange thing was the object was encircled in fluorescent reddish orange light that lined the whole object. It  had squares throughout the top that were set apart from each other in equal size. The squares looked like windows and/ or small rooms with white flat pads on the bottom of the squares or rooms. I saw nothing but light in the squares and the round pod or pad on the botton of each square or room - I saw nothing move inside the windows the squares were empty with bright light shining throughout each square. The squares were also surrounded by reddish orange fluorescent moving light all around them like static haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a UFO before and didn&#39;t want to.

I am going north bound on the 55 just about getting to where the 91 splits to the 91 east and west. As I am talking to my friend I could not keep my eyes off the ball of light that seemed to be hovering right smack in plain view. The first thing I said that must be a helicopter…  Then I started rethinking that idea because it just stood in one place for a period of time. I told my friend I think I am looking at a U.F.O he said record it and I said that is what I was going to do.. I pulled over three lanes on the free way and hopped out of my car. I looked at it for a min to make sure that it was not a plane or a helicopter. But then it could not explain why it just hovered over me and my car. It seemed really close now and I took out my phone and was not sure that it would be able to see it but I pushed record.  As I was trying to capture it on my phone cam, I noticed that the color was like a baby blue and bright ball of light. The way it traveled   I could only compare it to the patterns a lightning bug would use slow back and forth in a zig zag pattern.  As I kept looking at it not on my cam anymore It almost seemed to get closer and get brighter as if it noticed I pulled over and was recording it.  It looked like it was coming down… I freaked out and jumped into my car still looking through a possible window that would let me see it.  At this point the panic set in because all I could think about was I was going to be taken…  I have seen many a movies to know how it works.  Then from one min to the next now it was not behind me anymore it was back in from slowly moving to the right where it disappeared over the free was sound barrier.  I then started to look for it some more and it was nowhere in sight in a matter of five seconds I could not find it. Then I drove a little bit up the road still looking in every ! which way and nothing. I was able to get to a perfect clear sp! ot that would allow me to see and say ooo that was a helicopter. But no such luck. That blue ball a light was gone. I had plain view over everything but no light in the sky. Here is where it gets better. I have it on my cell phone.  I thought I did not record it I was wrong I see my little blue light.. I have proof I am not crazy. I now wonder was there anyone else who saw the same thing???<n>

It flew a little further when all of a sudden a bright white light expanded in front of the ship about the size of a theater screen.  It flew into the light which then slowly faded and it was gone.  Most amazing thing I have ever seen.  Some side notes: Ship never changed speed or made a sound even when entering the light.

We were watching a police helicopter fly circles over the neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the helicopter was approaching us, we saw two fast-moving lights cross in front of the helicopter&#39;s path, moving from our right to our left. The lights were about as bright as an average star, and were positioned closely beside each other, like the wingtip lights of an aircraft. They were solid, unblinking, steadily-moving lights. There was no sound coming from them, at least none that could be heard over the approaching helicopter, although the lights appeared to be much closer to us than it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch them move rapidly across the sky. I was thinking perhaps they were the wingtip lights of a glider or something, they didn&#39;t look like anything I&#39;d seen before. When the lights were directly above us, they spun around each other once quickly, like the wingtips of an airplane doing a barrel roll.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they did something I&#39;ll never forget: The two lights appeared to &#34;unlock&#34; from each other, increasing the distance between them briefly, then they rejoined and appeared to &#34;lock&#34; together again. Immediately following this maneuver, they made a sharp upward turn and disappeared from sight. The total time elapsed between our first sighting until the upward turn was less than 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what we saw that night, but I&#39;m confident that it was no ordinary aircraft. It was hard to judge the altitude of the lights, but I&#39;m pretty sure they were low enough that we should have heard some engine noise, even over the helicopter, as it was still far away from us. The only way I can explain the lights expanding and coming back together is if they were on the wingtips of a variable-wing aircraft like an F-14 Tomcat... However if this were so, I&#39;m sure we would&#39;ve heard the engines, and I just can&#39;t see any conventional plane being able to move as sharply and precisely as these lights did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had watched it for 3-4 sec to realize it was a black (air)/ship/craft/thing (not stars) flying over a broken sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my amazement, it was a typical V shape, more like a Christmas tree V shape, rather than a B2 stealth bomber.  It was more like two converging rows of lights in a V formation, moving swiftly over the entire sky in mere seconds.  A few second later, a subtle low hum, much like a jet at high altitude,  the way you would ear it on a quiet farm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After thoughts: I saw it right above me, between two low clouds.  Altitude was IMO, for a craft the size of a Airbus 320, around 6 thousands feet, and with speed over mach 1, (really quietly), north bound.  The sound could not have been another high altitude jet, cause we can hear many every -quiet- day. I remember my surprise to ear such a low and distorted sound.

It was not moving at all.  I couldnt figure out what it was, and it wasnt going up or down or moving closer, or further away.  It was grey or silver and large for the distance it was from me.  After I got off the train I tried to get a better look at it since I wouldnt be on a moving train, but It was obscured by trees and buildings or it was gone.  A few minutes later a dark helicopter with no markings on it flew by in the direction of the object.  I tried to see it again, but couldnt.  Did anyone else see anything??

I looked like like a jellyfish shape and it looked like it was burning inside &#34; like fire&#34; and slowly ascended into the sky and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One minute later it happened again.  I thought it was just some kind of balloon, but it moved horizontal across the sky and not straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t explain how this could have been reproduced by kids messing around or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my first time seeing anything like this. I&#39;m not real sure on the date , but I know it wasn&#39;t fireworks<n>

These bright white starlike objects were in triangle formation, flying low with a sort of tilt or plane to our view that sheared the shape of the triangle. The objects then appeared to get much dimmer as they appeared to move at an alarming speed ascending, silently and maintaing perfect triangle form. Now also more at a perpendicular plane to our view as it ascended, this triangle was a perfect right triangle, it ascended slightly northward and completely zenith out of our view due to our own rooftop. Whether it left the atmosphere is something left to question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I chased out into the streets to see if we could still see more, but other buildings and canopied trees blocked our view.<n>

Groton Long Point, CT.  I was sitting on the porch of my parent’s home directly on the shore  of Fisher’s Island Sound, unable to sleep (for personal reasons).  It was a perfectly peaceful, clear, quiet night (a.m.) I noticed a bright light hovering over the waters of what looked to be just outside of Stonington harbor (could have been more like Watch Hill, hard to tell).   At first, I thought it must be a heli, but there was no sound, and it did not move for ten minutes.  I have seen the satellites way up in space, this was at heli level.  Obviously, it was not a plane, because it wasn’t moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was curious enough after 5 minutes of hovering to get the binocs out.  I watched through them for the next 5 minutes, then it seemed to spin (I saw a second light) and then quickly disappear towards Rhode Island,  I watched it through the binocs till I couldn’t see it anymore (probably took about 30 secs.  For it to disappear.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so blown away, and bummed that I was the only one in the household that actually saw it.  Surprised there aren’t any other reports of that sighting, though it was rather late (or early).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please let me know if anyone else saw this!  I know what I saw.<n>

I was looking out my driverside window towards the city, which would have been directly east of the city.  It was an elongated triangular shaped object, seemingly delta shaped, which was either glowing or reflecting a bright yellowish white light.  At first glance I thought I was seeing moonlight through a break in distant clouds but quickly realized that the body of light was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling southbound with me and without immediately considering the details I just assumed it was a particularly visible conventional aircraft, but it&#39;s odd shape kept my attention.  With only my own perspective to judge from I couldn&#39;t accurately determine the objects distance from me and therefore couldn&#39;t figure its speed or altitude but after watching it for a couple minutes I realized that it was either much too large and traveling much too fast to be anything conventional or it was flying much too low over the city.  Within a few minutes I was taking the 35 East exit and at this point the shape was south east of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around this point it split into two lights, one was directly above the other.  The bottom of the two lights seemed to have a slight red hue and the top was a pale white.  About two miles onto I-35 the lights were directly south of me and as I drove east the two gradually disappeared into the south.  By the time I reached Keowee St. they were no longer visible.<n>
