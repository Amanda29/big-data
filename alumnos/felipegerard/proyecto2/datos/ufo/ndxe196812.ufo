I had recently turned 5, so the exact date &amp; time are approximations, but I clearly remember the year, and that it was just a few days before Christmas. While asleep in my room that night, I saw a rather bright bluish-white light come in through the window. It was much brighter than the moon would make. I got up out of bed and went to see what it was.  As soon as I went into the beam and looked up, I became paralyzed and unable to move. The object was about 2x to 3x the apparent size of a full moon, and was shaped kind of like a half-moon, but it was tilted at a bizarre angle, and the flat side wasn&#39;t flat at all - it had a scalloped appearance like you&#39;d see on the tops of ancient medieval castle towers. Although it was difficult to judge height &amp; distance because I was so young, I&#39;d guess now that it was hovering about 50&#39; above the ground at a distance a distance of 150&#39; to 300&#39; away.  This would make the object around 20&#39; in length by 15&#39; in height - but these are only rough guesses.  There&#39;s no way to know for certain how long the object was there, but my best guess would put it at about 15 to 30 minutes. Immediately after the sighting, my hearing seemed to become very sensitive. Small objects like pins falling to the floor sounded like pieces of rebar being slammed into concrete; I also remember feeling what I might now call an altered sense of reality. From that point on, I&#39;d start having these strange, almost dream-like periods that would always begin the same: a series of rectangular shapes colored in bright yellows, greens, and blues would appear and rapidly superimpose themselves upon one another in my visual field. After a moment or two, a small area of intense, scintillating green would appear near the center; followed almost immediately by the paralysis, the apparent enhancements in my hearing, and an overwhelming feeling of terror. This &#34;thing&#34; would happen almost every day; usually at night but sometimes while wide awake during the day. It wasn&#39;t until many years later before I learned a way to &#34;control&#34; or &#34;stop&#34; these in their intial stages, and eventually the incidents of them slowed to the point where they only occur very rarely anymore.<n>

The voices slowly got louder and the music began to fade away.  Suddenly, everything went dark (the room was lit) and the next thing I knew I was in a &#39;room&#39; which I knew was a space ship, with two little aliens.  They were very kind.  I felt only love from them.  The air in the space was saffron colored and one wall to my left was filled with small lights and what looked like switches.  It looked a bit like a sound board.  They communicated with me telepathically and said that they wanted to see what effects Earth had on me.  At least that&#39;s what I heard.  Then, my body levitated to a horizontal position and under me there appeared to be a slab like table.  I closed my eyes and the next thing I Knew the music slowly began to come back.  I was not drinking or doing drugs.  :)   By the way Peter, I REALLY enjoyed listening to you tonight with Art Bell.  One of the best conversations I&#39;ve heard.  I apologize if this is not the kind of report you are interested in.  I would love to have a conversation with someone about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had been there for several days when another group of people arrived and camped next to us.  We did not know them, but we all became aquainted pretty quickly.  We were all hippies (at least that&#39;s what people called us then).  One of the men from the other group was coming back from the outhouses and he was walking along a narrow dirt road that led back to our campsite.  He was only a few feet away from the central campsite when he suddenly stopped and looked up into the sky and said, &#34;What the hell is that?!&#34;  We all gathered on the road next to him and watched an amazing display of flashing lights that covered an extremely large portion of the sky above us.  Each flash was independent of the others and there was never a flash in the same place twice.  (On your form I estimated that there were 400 flashes but I actually have no idea.)  We stood there for at least 45 minutes or so watching and trying to figure out what it was.  We knew it wasn&#39;t aircraft because it was totally silent.  (In the desert sound carries for very long distances).  We knew that we were near two airports.  One was Palm Springs Airport and the other is a military air base nearby. I don&#39;t know the name of it.  When the planes went over we could hear them very well long before we saw them.  These lights did not trail in any one direction like you would see on a plane with blinking lights on it.  It was as though we were seeing the lights from several objects that were zig-zagging all over the sky at incredible speeds.  I was not aware of anything being blacked out behind these objects.  They were flashing at such incredible speeds all over the sky that it seemed we were only seeing lights not objects with lights on them, but the flashes were such a bright white light that I wondered if this was some kind of natural lightning phenomena.  As far as I can remember there were no flashes that occured simultaneously.  Each flash was independent.  The weather was clear, cool and dry.  (It gets cold in the desert in December!)  There were no clouds and no moon that night.  The only other light that could be seen was the faint glow of Palm Springs on the horizon.  We eventually got bored with it and went back to what we were doing.  Every now and then someone would look up to the sky and say, &#34;It&#39;s still happening&#34;.  It went on for approximately 2 or more hours. I would have reported this sooner, but I didn&#39;t know who to report it to until I heard an interview with Peter Davenport on WERE 1300 radio in Cleveland today.<n>

I then realized it wasn&#39;t moving but thought it must be a helicopter.It was in the direct path of my shortcut and as I got closer I realized it was completly silent. As I got a little closer I discoverd that the red and green lights were actually one light traveling very fast around a circuler object. The light changed though the entire spectrum appearing on the left side as green then rainbowing to the right very quickly and disapearing as a red flash. The light travelled so fast that from a distance you only saw the the green appear then the red go out. Eventually I walked directly below the object and could see the light travelling clockwise in a perfect circle. I was a UFO nonbeliever at the time but I knew this was no normal aircraft. It was about this time that the object started to zip around the sky doing imposible precise turns of 90 degrees and more. After 10 seconds or so of this it suddenly streaked to the southern horizen and started to follow an airliner. I picked up my pace but only made it about another 200yds. before the object sreaked back and stopped right over my head. I was right behind the backstop of a baseball diamond and I remember clutching the screen with both hands and swearing and threatening the thing as loud as I could scream.I thought that if I put up enough fuss &#34;THEY&#34; would leave me alone. It then began to zip around the sky at extreme speed and I turned and ran faster than I could to a friends house about 150yds. away. I hid in a hedge and sure enough it returned and cruised about slowly near where I was hidden for about 20 seconds[ which seemed like an hour ] then shot straight up till it disappeared. As terrified as I was I remember thinking I wish it would come back. I also remember saying to myself that I&#39;ll never believe this really happened so I swore to myself to remember that exact thought.What makes it harder to believe is that it was there again the next night at 17:30.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate<n>

Craft hoovered about ten feet over my head, backed off, lowered to eye level, then raised and hoovered over head again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 12:30am, Lake Secession, in Abbeville, SC.  This event occurred aprox. a quarter of a mile from a hydro-electric dam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was alone when I noticed a whirring/whining dynamo type of sound outside.  I saw an amber colored flashing light reflecting on the trees outside.  When I walked out the door, overhead I saw a flying saucer (saucer/disc about 35 feet across and about 10 feet in height) hoovering above me no more than ten feet.  There were four sets of lights (each set had three rotating amber lights) which bathed the area in amber.  The outter skin of the ship was what appeared to be a silvery/shiney metalic color.  I recall being terrorfied beyond description to the point where I could not move.  (the house I was in was one of those lake houses that was on &#34;stilts&#34; where the outside deck was about 8 feet off the ground.  Also the lake house had twelve sides and would look circular from the air)  After hoovering overhead, the craft backed away some twenty (20) feet and lowered to where it would be almost eye level with me.  This craft was a saucer shape with a smaller dome on top.  The top dome had a round porthole (window) that was opaque/translucent and I could see that there was a white, low intensity light inside.  Due to the type of opaque/translucent characteristic of the porthole...I could not see if there was anything inside; however, I &#34;knew&#34; that something was in there and it was looking at me.  The craft then raised up, came forward directly over head and hoovered.  This event lasted approximately 5 minutes; although, there are gaps in my memory as to what exactly happened.  The craft then sped off effortlessly about 200 yards and hoovered momentarily over the Lake.  Then it sped off at a 45 degree angle towards the southwest at such a speed that I could not even begin to estimate, until it vanished from my sight into space.  That evening it was a crisp, winter night and the sky was clear giving me an excellent unobstructed view of the craft and the sky as it was departing. As far as my background.  At the time, I was 17.  I&#39;m a white male.  I currently am college educated with a degree in General Business.  I am also a Vietnam Veteran and spent about 3 years on a US Naval Destroyer and have put in many hours as lookout while at sea.  I have been trained to spot and identify various types of aircraft and missiles.  This craft was not identifiable to any aircraft in existense in the United States or any other country&#39;s millitary or civilian air force. I&#39;ve always had the feeling that there was something else that happened that night.  I have a gap in my memory as to all of the events that occurred that night.  I wish that there was someone that I could talk with about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Change discription of noise....I need to make a change to my earlier report that I sent in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just entered a report last night....please change the sound that the UFO made.  I had originally typed in it made a Whirring/whining sound.  It was a whirring/whooshing noise. Also...several years later...I had bumped into a fried that I had known for a very long time and after years of not seeing him.  He asked me &#34;whatever happened with that UFO that you saw?&#34;  I didn&#39;t recall telling him about that and asked him what he meant by that.  He told me that I had called him while the UFO was there...while it was over the house.  The reason that I said that I have gaps in my memory abouth this encounter was that I never recalled being on the phone with him and telling him about the UFO being there.  This more or less collaborates in a way, that this was happening.  Also....an addition to my background I have had many years experience as a radio announcer and radio news reporter.  At the time of this encounter...I had already had about 2 years experience in broadcast news gathering...so some of the details that I give are as specific as possible. I hope that you will make the changes in my original report that I sent in earlier.  Thank you.....again.  ((Name deleted))<n>

Engr.Sisters &amp; Person not yet born then has seen since<n> <n><n> <n><n> In about 1968, my dad was out playing with his band, the Moonlight Serenaders.  The rest of his family was at home, with the exception of my brother.  I woke up and saw a colored fog which periodically changed color aprox. where the railroad bridge is located.  The object making the glowy fog was behind the house across the street from us.  My mom told me &amp; my sisters to go back to bed, that it was nothing.  I told Mom &#34;If it&#39;s nothing, I&#39;m going to go outside and see it.&#34;  I was about 19 years old.  My mom said &#34;OH No you&#39;re not&#34;.  She wouldn&#39;t let me go outside in a town with only 250 residents with no crime and no policeman.  WE didn&#39;t even have a lock on our house door.  I went to sleep, woke up in an hour and the night was clear, no fog, no lights to be seen.  Last year I flew home and my mom sent a man to pick me up at the airport who was not alive in 1968.  He wasn&#39;t yet born.  He completed my sentence when I told him what I had seen.  He lived closer to the bridge than I and he placed it in the same location at a later date.  He seemed to thing it was a unidentified flying object too.  I never even got to fog and lights.  He used the same words as he had seen the same thing years later.  He said everyone thought he was crazy.  I am a nuclear engineer.  He was in UDT with the Navy.  There were 2 other sightings in the town.  A conservative, no nonsense 79 year old lady whose son got his degree in Civil Engineering at the same school I did told my mom that she saw a UFO hovering over a power line, like it was sucking power from the line.  One of the bosses at the local U.S. Army Corps of Engineers boatyards who went to my college U of Mo. Rolla for a couple of years, also saw a UFO landed in the field across Highway 100 from his house.  His name was name deleted)).  He is still alive, at least he was when I was home last year.  ((name deleted)), the lady who saw the UFO atop the light pole however passed away.  I did not see my object fly.  Still I&#39;d classify it as a UFO Unidentified foggy object.  The ! bridge w as the sight of a fatal collapse in the 1800s.  A trainload of dignitaries going from St. Louis to Jeff City for the first time cause the newly built bridge to collapse killing many of the prominent citizens on board.<n>
