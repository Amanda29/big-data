My home was located on the western edge of the city. We were in one of the rooms facing the field (a cow pasture) adjacent to my home. Two spherical objects appeared over the field, probably a quarter mile away. They were, and I am guessing here, about 100 yards across (the red one) and 80 yards across (the orange one), definitely too large to be balloons and surely not balloons as balloons do not glow in the dark like that. The light was coming from inside these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were simply awe-struck with comments like “Do you see that? What is that?” If we had out wits about us we would have found a camera but we could only look in awe. After about six minutes they disappeared. They did not fly away, they just disappeared. Another five minutes passed and they reappeared. They were not moving on either appearance, just hovering over the field probably 100 yards in the air. The night was pitch-black and these things were really bright. After another five minutes they disappeared and did not return although we stared in that direction for a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, here is the spooky part. Nineteen years later a friend of mine I had known only a couple years casually told me that he had seen some UFOs in 1989. I took a chance and told him “I will describe what you saw,” and I gave him the description I have just recorded above. His jaw dropped and he told me that was exactly what he had seen, only he had seen them while camping out at the beach, a distance of about 20 miles from where the four of us had seen these objects.<n>

Disappearing and reappearing for approx. 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To whom it may concern: This incident took place during the summer of 1989 (June/July).  It was approx. 22:00 hrs. I was sitting on the side porch of my parents old home talking with a friend when I observed  2 solid white lights in the Eastern sky I found the objects immediately interesting because of their ability to control there light intensity varing from very bright to vanishing completely and reappearing and then moving at a high rate of speed slightly lower in the Eastern sky.  This behavior continued for a few minutes when I decided to get my mother and let her take a look.  During this time we both observed the objects disappear, reappear, vary light intensity, make very fast right angle turns and then return to a previous position.  Rather, interesting we both thought.  After, approx. 20 minutes the object suddenly disappeared.  I&#39;m very knowledgeable in aerodynamics and a plane enthusiest.  I&#39;m niether U.F.O believer or a skeptic I&#39;m just a normal guy reporting what me and my mother witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The Orb, much like a Christmas tree ornament, was highly reflective reflecting the sky color and cloud texture. It moved very rapidly from right to left and was gone before I could turn my head to track it. The object size was that of a quarter dollar coin held between thumb and finger at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Saw a cluster of white lights in a patter (not sure how to describe it), it was VERY wide and very low, almost made a humming noise as it went along at a VERY slow speed, maybe 2 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was travelling south along the beach road.  Ont he ocean side of the craft, a light swung out as if on an arm of some sort, the light then accellerated away in an easterly direction at a speed I canno describe.  It was a blur it went so fast.  The craft continued in a southerly direction for several minutes, the object then returned with the same alarming speed, &#34;docked&#34; and folded back into the craft.  We could only see lights, nothing else, pitch black, no moon or anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no memory of what happened next, I woke up the next morning in my bed, my friend was in his bed as well.  We never talked about it again.<n>

WE went to check the windowand saw a strange Object floating above our pond. IT was DISK shaped with a dome on top and bottem A blueish tone of light shown off of it. lights and TV in room went out then there was a blinding light.  WOKE up on bed FIVE feet away from window with pain in my side. AND my underware was on backwards. I immediatly got sick on the floor.  Checked side and found a brite red mark on my side that had not been there before it was very painfull. THEN wrote down experience. I then checked the time it was 3:55  almost 5 hours since sighting.  OBJECT was no where to be found.  SINCE then have had a strange fear of small ponds at one time so bad would not go near one.  Have strange dreams of EYES FOLLOWING me.  THIs has frightened me and I have been too scared to tell any one about this before. I don&#39;t want to be laughed at. AND I may have just been dreaming.  BUT I want to know if I was.  BEFOR this incedent me and my friend were both firm non-believers in UFO&#39;s.<n>

Me, my brother and my mother were at the consert of Janis Parios or what ever it was at KOS. The place was on the beach boulevard, some big parking lot. The consert started around 21:00 so it was dark then. It was getting a little chilly so my brother went to sit on my mothers lap (arms). I was sitting next to them and i was getting bored so i started to look at the stars. There was no clouds, beautifull night. Then suddenly a big (little smaller than a full moon), bright red circle appeared to the sky! It came from nowhere just like that! Just like someone would&#39;ve turned on the lamp! I was stearing it and i said: mom, look! Guess she didn&#39;t hear it at first. Few seconds went and it rapidly started moving at very high speed! It flew maybe two times the diameter of full moon and disappeared just like that! Just like the way it appeared, like this someone would&#39;ve turned the lamp off! It left a red trail behind! Diameter of this trail was the diameter of this circle. All this happened in maybe 6seconds max. My mother and my brother soo this read trail. Then it slowly disappeared too. So anyone who looked at the sky then would&#39;ve seen it. This has been bothering me ever since. Hope to get an answer some day...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was about 9pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed a light in the sky. It was a very clear calm night; it looked like a ball of fire like a hot coal. The closer it got to us it looked more like a football or possibly saucer shaped thing, which was hot white/yellow in the center and got orangish gold toward the outside. This thing flew from a distance away toward us and above and beyond us across the sky. Approximately 500ft up?  It was totally silent. The size to our vision would be similar to if you held a children’s “nerf” football out at arms length. Being at the height that I assume it was, it was very big. Bigger than my moms house easily. I have seen the EXACT SAME style craft on a ufo show. the one where craft hits the desert then bounces back up then hits again and explodes into a million firey lights, its pretty popular i think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the weird part, we had my moms camera up there to use like a scope (kids ya know) it was an old 80’s rectangular style one. Anyway with camera in hand I saw all this. Never once thought to take a picture at all. It was too strange for me to do anything but stare at this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn’t move super fast either. 100mph? Now that im almost 33 im a better judge of visual speed applied to something at a distance and 100mph for an air craft isn’t that much I think. We had our parents look through the news papers to see if a meteor had hit or other people reported seeing it. it was really big. There was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok, years later, when I spoke to my friend about this again, he said something I didn’t remember and still barely remember. Within 5 min of the sighting, he said 3-5 military style helicopters flew across in the same direction. This could have been at the point that I jumped off the roof and frantically tried to explain to my mom what had just happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since those days, I have become a huge ufo enthusiast as well as other unexplained things. All stemming from personal experiences like this one.  I will post more sightings I have had over the years right after this one too because the form wouldn’t let me use “various” under times and dates.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Observed a spherical object fly from south to north. Shere color was either black or dark grey, and appeared to rotate. It also appeared that it emitted some type of light or reflected the morning light. Object appeared to be 1 to 2 miles away and travelling a little faster than normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working the night shift at an area marina as night security. The night was nice with no weather to report that night or morning. The skies were clear and it was a beautiful sunrise. I was standing on the easternmost part of the marina (a large beach type of area strewn with large and small pieces of broken concrete). I looked up to the west, north west and observed what appeared to be a rather large sphere shaped object travelling from south to the north, maybe northeast about 1 to 2 miles away. It was possibly black or dark grey in color and possibly rotating. I say possibly rotating because as it flew on there was some type of either light or streak on it that appeared to rotate around the object end over end. The object was travelling somewhat faster than any aircraft in the area that morning. There was a small private plane that was approximately 5 to 10 miles away to the south travelling west, at what speed I do not know. I looked back to the object and noticed there were no smoke or vapor trails which would have been noticeable in the morning sky. I looked around the sky to see if I could see any type of military aircraft following or attempting to intercept, since Selfridge Air National Guard Base is approximately 5 to 7 miles north of the marina I was at. I saw nothing else in the sky. When I looked back to the object, it had disappeared. I contacted the CoastGaurd about 2 minutes later when I returned to the Gatehouse and asked if they had recieved any type of reports of unusual things in the air and they replied &#34;NO&#34;. After this I did not attempt any other reporting for fear of being completely criticized and also possibly losing my job which, at that time, I could not afford to do.<n>

We were walking it was dark, and we noticed that there were small rocks being thrown into the creek.  Nobody really took and notice of this we all thought that some of the other boys where behind the rocks, but soon one of the boys got hit by a rather large rock.   We then realized the rock were bigger and coming form over the tree line to our left and into the creek to the right, and none of the boy were responsible for the activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we decided to line up in one large line and we were going to walk through the tree line to find the person or persons who were responsible for these rocks.  About I would say 50 yards or so we came to a large field, and there was NO ONE there.  I know of at least one boy who broke his leg going through the trees,  why we stayed that I do not know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The scout leaders decided that we would go ahead and sleep one the creek bed that night they instructed us to dig in to the rocks to get to the sand and put our bags over our heads to protect ourselves from the rocks, (which at this time were still flying over these one hundred foot trees) and we went to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up sometime I noticed two objects they were like two ice cream cones put together, the one on the left was slightly higher than the other one on the right, there where pulsating lights at the tips of the objects and through the middle.  I could not feel my body or my sleeping bag, I tried to scream to my scout leader who was a foot away but nothing came out I tried to move but was paralyzed.  Then nothing I can not remember any thing past that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to know what happened to me that night.  Did they take me?  Did they just watch me? Did they hurt me? I do not know I need help from someone.  I WANT ANSWERS!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I&#39;M A 12 YEAR VETERAN POLICE OFFICE. WITHOUT BEING TOO DESCRIPTIVE, I CURRENTYLY WORK FOR THE 4TH LARGETS CITY IN AMERICA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IN THE SUMMER OF 1989 OR 1990, NOT SURE THE EXACT YEAR.  IT OCCURRED A VERY LONG TIME AGO WHEN I WAS A YOUNG TEENAGER.  THE EVENT HAS BEEN BURNT INTO MY MEMORY.  I WILL PROVIDE THE INFORMATION VERY TO THE POINT, HOPING TO MAKE IT EASY FOR ANY READER.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IN THE SUMMER OF 1989 OR 1990, MY FRIENDS AND I WERE HAVING A SLEEP OVER, USING MY FATHERS CAMPER WHICH WAS PARKED IN THE DRIVE WAY AT MY HOUSE.  IT WAS A CLEAR, WARM EARLY MORNING, APPROX 12:00AM TO 2:00AM.  THERE WERE ABOUT FOUR FRIENDS THAT OBSERVED THE UFO, TO INCLUDE MY MOTHER WHOM I RAN INSIDE TO HAVE HER TO COME OUT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE LOCATION WAS IN DEFIANCE COUNTY OHIO, IN A SUB DIVISION NEIGHBORHOOD WITH APPROX 50 HOMES IN THE CIRCLE DRIVE NAMED &#34;LAKEVIEW DRIVE&#34;.  IT IS LOCATED NEAR THE PAULDING COUNTY LINE ON THE BANKS OF THE MAUMEE RIVER.  IT IS A RURAL SETTING ON ST. RT. 111.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A LARGE DARK COLORED CRAFT, APPROX THE SIZE OF A LARGE COMMERCIAL JET AIRPLANE,  FLEW NORTH OVER LAKEWIEW DRIVE.  IT WAS VERY LOW TO THE GROUND AND WAS FLYING (MOVING) AT A VERY SLOW SPEED.  IT LOOKED LIKE A SPEED OF AROUND 40 MPH.  IN MY OPINION TOO SLOW TO BE ABLE TO HOLD FLIGHT.   IT NEVER STOPPED, AND DID NOT APPEAR TO CHANGE SPEED.  I COULD HEAR A SLIGHT SOUND, NOT AT ALL LOUD, BUT WAS A CONSTANT WIND/FAN LIKE SOUND.  I CAN REMEMBER THINKING TO MYSELF, &#34;IT&#39;S SO CLOSE I COULD HIT THAT WITH MY BOW AND ARROW&#34;.  IT WAS IN A V- SHAPED FORMATION WITH THE FRONT COMING TO A SMOOTH ROUNDED POINT.  A SERIES OF LARGE ROUND, DIM WHITE LIGHTS, WERE ON THE BOTTOM, APPROX 3 TO 4 ON EACH SIDE FOLLOWING THE V FORMATION. THEY WERE NOT BLINKING.  AS THE CRAFT WAS DIRECTLY OVER TOP OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, ALL THE POWER WENT OUT. NOT A HOME OR STREET LIGHT WAS ON. IT WAS QUITE UNUSUAL AND CREEPY. AS THE CRAFT EXIT THE AREA IN THE DISTANCE, ALL THE POWER CAME BACK ON. THE POWER WAS OUT FOR ABOUT 30 ! SECONDS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> APPROX 10 MIN LATER, THE SAME CARFT APPROACHED IN THE SAME LINE, FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. NOTHING HAD CHANGED. SAME SPEED, SOUNDS, AND LIGHTS. MY FRIENDS AND I WERE STILL &#34;PUMPED UP&#34; ABOUT THE FIRST SIGHTING SO WE USED OUR FLASHLIGHTS, POINTING  AND WAIVING THEM INTO THE AIR AT THE OBJECT.  WHEN THE CRAFT GOT OVERHEAD, ALL THE POWER IN THE BLOCK WENT OUT ONCE AGAIN. AND AS IT CONTINUED ON IN THE SAME DIRECTION, THE POWER CAME BACK ON. IF IT MATTERS AT ALL, THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAD BURRIED POWER LINES.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I SOMETIMES SEE A UFO TV SHOW WHERE A CRAFT WAS SPOTTED IN THE ILL. / IN. AREA WHERE A V SHAPED CRAFT WAS SEEN IN ABOUT THE SAME TIME ERA. THE DRAWN PICTURES ARE QUITE SIMILAR, IF NOT THE SAME.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MAYBE IT WAS A MILITARY PROJECT,OR  MAYBE NOT.  THIS IS JUST AN EXPERIENCE I DECIDED TO SHARE WITH ANYONE INTERESTED IN THE TOPIC. MAYBE IT CAN HELP WITH ANY LEADS IN PAST OR FUTURE UFO INVESTIGATIONS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> CROP CIRCLES HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE PAULDING COUNTY AREA,  APPROX 5 TO 10 MILES FROM THIS SIGHTING. REAL OR NOT, I DON&#39;T KNOW. I&#39;M SURE THEY WERE INVESTIGATED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THANK YOU.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I am a retired police ((deleted--senior officer)), 4--- years old. I have some info about an experience with a spherical light probe that entered my van some years ago. I am not some nut or some glory hound, I am a level headed person that had an unexplainable experience. I had taken my ex-wife ((wife&#39;s name deleted)) with me to a training class held by the Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy (OPOTA) held in London, Ohio. I recall it was a one day session. My certificate for 1989 show 2 dates of one day long training, May 30 &amp; July 10, 1989. I don&#39;t know which date this occurred on.I was driving on US Rt. 30 between Mansfield, Ohio and Wooster, Ohio. Actually I was closer to Mansfield. It was at night time, late between 11pm and midnight. My wife asked me the time, I looked at the clock and told her. Immediately there was a blinding flash of light. The bright flash occurred in the sky. The light was a very bright lightning flash. It filled my whole field of vision, filled the whole windshield of my Ford Econoline van.  My wife screamed and I looked at her. This is when I saw &#34;it.&#34; The &#34;it&#34; was a white-bluish bright ball of light that appeared to be floating in midair in my van. The ball of light was floating right in front of the abdomen, over the lap of my then wife (-now ex-wife). As she screamed the ball of light became more agitated. It clearly was reacting to her screams. It rapidly moved back and forth as it floated in front of her. It then moved to her right and vanished THROUGH the door panel of the van. It actually went through the door panel. The window was up and there was no sound. Within in a second or two the ball appeared back in the same location in front of her. I didn&#39;t see how or from where it appeared. It did exhibit the same properties and behavior as the first light ball, with one exception. I got a long and hard look at the ball. I stared at it and watched it. It appeared to be a ball of whitish-blue light (similar to the light of an arc welder). The ball was about the s! ize of a grapefruit with about 6 smaller light balls circling its equator. This ball of light moved back and forth in sync with ((wife&#39;s)) screams. It was then observed to float through the door panel, as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is interesting is that from the time this experienced occurred until it ended, I figure 30 seconds had went by. In reality, when I looked at the dash clock 15 - 30 minutes had gone by!! I had never stopped driving the van. I never pulled over to the side of Rt. 30 or stopped. I have no memory of what I was doing during the experience. All I know is that I kept driving but I was looking at, staring at, studying the light balls. How this occurred, I have no idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Wife)) did sketch the lights when we got back to Canton. We had divorced in 1988 but were friendly. So usingou dvorce and my training certificates, I have narrowed the occurance to two dates. I have not seen my ex-wife for  over 10 years and I don&#39;t know what she did with the sketch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a trained observer, 2- ((twenty +)) yr police ((senior officer)) and I know what occurred. I just can&#39;t account for the missing time and how I kept driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for listening ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with this witness, and our impression is that he is extremely credible.  We have requested that he attempt to locate his ex-wife and have her submit a report, as well.  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Daytona summer 1989<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many details are fuzzy, I had to guess on time and date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s been a long time but has been on my mind often since it occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the summer of 1989 me and two of my friends were house sitting about a block away from Daytona Beach shore. The house was on a bit of a hill so more than just our street was visible. Late in the evening around midnight, all the lights went out. We rushed outside to see what was going on and noticed that all the lights in the neighborhood were out. I do not remember if there was a sound.  I remember this sighting coming from the non-water side of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This much I know for sure: In the horizon a giant blue-ish light shot from lower ground to miles in the sky. It then fanned out,  covering the entire sky in an incredible blue green display that lasted many seconds. It looked like a laser light show but the size and complexity was way too enormous to have been man made. Think of the movie Tron and a peacock tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of my friends witnessed this. What we all agreed on instantly was it&#39;s size and that the power outage had to be related.  Moments after, the lights in the neighborhood began to come back on. We were absolutely blown away and speechless at what we saw.

Collins, Co on County Road 44H.  We had started on our footers and we were sleeping in our camp trailor which had a large back window next to the bed. It was 23:30 and I saw  an object coming from the South.  I told my wife to look at it.  It was moving about 25 to 30 mph.  It was long and lit up.  It almost looked like it had 5&#39; x 8&#39; windows. It went North not making a sound (No noise at all). It was about 100&#39; over the mountain.  Later on we joked about it, calling it a flying mobile home.  It was a half mile off a seldom used dirt road back on a mountain.<n>

The craft appeared about 100 foot away and about 50 to 75 foot in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what i can recall the craft was about as big as an English red bus.

The lights were headed directly at my vehicle at a rapid speed. The craft began to slow rapidly and hover. The craft rolled over to a different side and had a bright yellow light. The craft turned again and I was looking directly at the engines no more than 1000 feet away. The engine I guess ran the length of that side of the craft and was a bright green in color and had a pattern of reverse triangle cells. The craft lowered itself down into the water and disappeared. I jumped into my truck and drove south to the weigh station in Belleville , Kansas and reported that I saw something go into the water to the scale master. He made a few calls and said that there were no reports of missing airplanes. I was a truck driver at the time and logged close to 2 million miles accident free.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After speaking with my friend who was also present at the time of my sighting, she believes the date was more around 1989.  The weather was warm enough that we were not wearing jackets. We wre just leaving my parents home and were joking about the UFO reports that had been in the news lately.  When one of us looked up we were shocked to see the very thing we had just been joking about.  As stated before, the object moved from the south-eastern sky towards the north-western sky.  It was low flying, slow moving and utterly silent.  All lights were white and remained so for the duration of our sigthing.  They were led by a single light, trailed by a 4-5 other lights forming a &#39;V&#39; shape.  No apparent craft shape could be seen, only the somewhat hazy lights.  The object was below cloud level and flew directly over our heads and seemed very large.  My friends guessed about as wide as the width of a football field.  As it passed over us, it continued straight and steady on its course then the lights proceeded to go out in what appeared to be a random order.  As soon as the lights were out, we had no idea where it went.  ~ Less than 20 minutes later this same evening, my friend and her parents reported the exact same thing happening again.  She lived at the time about 3 blocks west of the original sighting.  She told me it was of the same shape, size and light patterns and moving in the same way and the same direction as the sighting we had shared.  ~ Later reports in the newpapers claimed that officials said that helicoptors or military craft was in the area at that time and that is what everyone was seeing.  Helicopters flying in formation seemed to be the primary explanations, which I don&#39;t buy for a minute.  Silent, low-flying helicopters?  I don&#39;t think so.  Huge stealth aircraft moving at a snail&#39;s pace from one military base to the next?  Maybe, but still seems a long stretch of the imagination to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

There were four of us ridding in my car down the Natchez Trace Parkway just in front of the Visitors Center. It was just getting dark out and on the tree line 75 yards ahead of us a football shaped object with no lines sort of like a teardrop but with two points. It had a green pulsating glow and a green trail of haze. It came from the east side of the tree line to the west tree line. The object was moving to slow to be a plane and we were close enought to tell the it had solid mass and the shape of a football. The size was about the size of a standard passenger car. We turned our car around and went home. I never saw the object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of three submitted by same source.  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were stopped at a red light, when I noticed an airliner flying far overhead.  I mentioned it to my friend, so he glanced up and said he could see a little dot next to it.  So I looked back, and sure enough, there it was:  a small dark speck perfectly pacing the jet.  It appeared to be behind and maybe a little below the plane, and was so small as to be virtually unnoticeable.  I had to look twice myself before I saw it.  I doubt anyone in the plane saw the object, based on its observed location relative to the plane.  I had read stories of UFOs pacing trains, planes, and ships, but from this time onward I had first-hand knowledge of this part of the pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

7/1/89 03:30|Cedar Rapids|IA|Triangle|15 minutes approx.|I think my sighting as a child may have something to do with my current abilities|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64101.html|32|ndxe198907| I think my sighting as a child may have something to do with my current abilities<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I&#39;m telling anyone outside of my family about what I saw when I was a child. I&#39;ve always been scared to, but now I&#39;m ready to learn more about it because I&#39;ve lately been experiencing abnormal things in my adult life and want to explore further. I just don&#39;t know where to start and something tells me to start here. When I was about 11 or 12 I woke up from a deep sleep to go to the bathroom. My bedroom was in the front of the house with a big window facing the front yard. We lived outside of town in a housing development so it was pretty secluded but we had neighbors. As I was coming out of the bathroom across the hall, I could see a VERY bright light shining through my window and through my room out into the hallway. I remember walking very slowly, robotically, towards my room. I thought maybe there was a car in the driveway with their brights on and thats when I remember looking at the clock. It was 3:30 am. I neared the window and thats when I remember this heavy feeling come over me. I was totally frozen where I stood. This giant object was hovering over our front yard. We had a couple trees in the yard but it was somehow clearing them but the object was also kind of transparent. I could see the house across the street through the object. I remember it was triangular with curved corners, not pointy. Underneath, in each &#34;corner&#34;, was one large light and in between each big light were straight lines of smaller lights. There was a small circle of lights in the very middle too on the bottom. I could also tell from my angle that the top of it was slightly elevated. Not a lot, just a little curve at the top. Like a VERY short pyramid but again, not pointed at the top but curved. I don&#39;t remember any colors or colored lights. No sound either. I remember thinking that was odd that this wasn&#39;t waking anyone else up and thats when I looked at the clock again and it was 3:30. I had been standing there for a half hour just staring at this thing. I don&#39;t remember it feeling ! like a h alf hour though. I snapped out of my trance and bolted for my parents room. My mom would not get up but I forced my dad out of bed to come look out my window. By the time we got to my window, it was gone. Since then, I have seen pictures in books of the EXACT thing I saw. I also have read where there were similar sightings around the same time in the midwest too. That made me feel not so crazy and I&#39;ve just kind of let it go. I have never seen anything like this since nor have I told anyone outside my family. Who of course don&#39;t believe me. They only make fun of me.  I am almost 30 now and have recently been feeling strange &#34;vibes&#34; as I call them. Ever since I was little I sometimes knew when things would happen or could guess things about people. I always have chalked it up to just being lucky. My sister and her husband recently told us they were pregnant and I knew it was a boy almost as soon as they told us. I told my other sister that I know its a boy. She asked me how I knew. If our other sister had told me first and I said no, just that I knew. I don&#39;t know how I knew, I just did. Yesterday, she called me and said our other sister had told her about my &#34;vibe&#34; and asked how I knew that. I again explained that sometimes I just know things like that. I realize its a 50 50 chance, but I can&#39;t remember a time I&#39;ve ever been wrong. What are the odds of that? Anyways, she did confirm that it is in fact a boy. This same sister has, in her childhood, had odd experiences too. She had a dream about a Christmas present that she hadn&#39;t received yet. The next day she got that exact same doll. Same name and clothing and everything. She also has an uncanny memory. She is the only other person in my family with unusual abilities that I know of. Its not like I&#39;m psychic or anything. I don&#39;t see dead people or things like that. I can&#39;t explain it. I just know certain things. I have certain dreams of things that haven&#39;t happened yet. I just don&#39;t know what that means and want help figuring it out. I can&#39;t help but won! der if m y childhood &#34;sighting&#34; might have something to do with all of this. Its always been something I&#39;ve wondered about. Anything you could do to help would be appreciated. Thanks for reading my story and hopefully believing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

When everyone at my house had gone to sleep we snuck out of the yard to wander the neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while we stopped near this building, I think it was a public restroom.  We were on the eastern side of this building with our backs to the wall and in front of us was Mount Hebo.  This is a small mountain that sits to the east of the small town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were looking up a ball of orange light passed directly over us and slowly moved in a straight line until it went over the mountain.  It made no sound at all and had to be big and high in the sky to go over the mountain like it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both looked at each other and ran home immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
