She was a very practical woman, not given to flights of fancy so I know that it is true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was a kid, she told all of us grandchildren many, many times about seeing a cigar shaped UFO when she was about 12 years old.  This would have been in 1910 because she was born in 1898.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred in broad open daylight, in front of her house in the country, and it moved from West to East at a fairly brisk pace.  She said it was very large, gray in color, and that it had nothing below it or any sort of wings whatsoever (like a dirgible for instance).  It made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She told this story all of her life.  It made a big impression on her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
