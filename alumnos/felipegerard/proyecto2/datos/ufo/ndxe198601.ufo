Seconds later from a third of the way up from the bottom a small round light ejected out to the side and stopped. Moved slowley at a 45% angle toward the ground. A second round light repeated the first. When they were out of sight and near the ground, suddenley the large light immediately soared to the roof of the barn and only a small part of it extended above the barn rood. It set silently, then moved ever slowly sideways, as it ap-proached the barn edge what should have extended past it was black, only a lessor part of the light was visiable. When it was tatally past the barn there was no light. Total silence.during the whole time.<n>

After about an hour of watching it over and over again on TV, I was called-in to work.  I left around 1pm from Whiteville, NC to travel to Elizabethtown, NC.  I travelled Red Hill Road, a less used route, as I wanted to avoid lunch traffic in town.   Just a couple of miles from Clarkton, NC I started to pass through a wooded swamp area that had been heavily logged.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my right I caught a glimpse of something large through the open areas and remaining trees heading from my right to left (North to South). I slowed down as I was expecting to see some large Military aircraft travelling way to low or thought it could be a passenger jet about to crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it appeared in front of me over the open road I was shocked to see a craft that was metallic brown, cigar shaped, with either windows or squares and a ziz-zag pattern around them. The craft had no wings and there was no sound and was travelling too slowly for any aircraft I knew of to stay airborne.   I know this because this was not a distant sighting. The craft was right in front of me maybe 500 to 1000 yards away and I got the best and only view I have ever had of an unknown craft as it passed in front of me heading south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had spent six years in the Navy and had been discharged only about 6 months prior. I had seen the Russian bear, migs, most of our jets and aircraft in Grenada, Lebanon, and all over the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later my wife and a friend brought food to the power plant for me.  When they arrived they were all excited about seeing dancing lights in the sky, the kind that dance around then join into one before travelling off at an astonishing speed. They witnessed this in the same area in the swamp on Red Hill Road just after sunset that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s been 24 years since that sighting, and I don’t feel as uneasy talking about it now.<n>

1/16/86 09:10|Lido Beach|NY|Circle|20 minutes|The Object was above our car hovering.  We didn't see it move towards us ...it was just there in an instance.|10/7/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32100.html|5|ndxe198601| The Object was above our car hovering.  We didn&#39;t see it move towards us ...it was just there in an instance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at Nassau Beach with my friend it was the middle of winter. The place was deserted.  While we sat looking at the ocean, I noticed a bright light which could have been a plane. My friend wroked for Grumman at the time and said that it was a plane.  I continuted to watch the light and saw that a second bright light appeared next to it, while we were both watching, the lights merged and became 1 and started comming toward us.  We immediatedly left the area, got in the car and headed out of the large parking lot.  We stopped at the traffic light(turning onto LIdo Blvd) we looked toward the ocean and saw this very bright light stationary in the sky.  We didn&#39;t see it move towards us but it was over the car about 30 ft above us, there was no sound.  We both were extremely frightened and sped out of the parking lot.  It seemed to follow us when we got onto the Loop PKY (also pretty empty) it looked almost like a star keeping pace with the car at a far distance off.  WHile we sped down the pky I noticed that it got brighter again. Once we got onto a more populated pky (the Meadowbrook) the light dissappeared as quickly as it appeared.   Needless to say nobody believed what we saw.  The next morning we went back to the parking with some friends and burned into the pavement was a huge circle. The burn mark was apox 4-6&#34; thick and about 100 feet around.  I tried to report what we saw to the local police dept,  but like everyone else they didn&#39;t believe us.  I really don&#39;t care who believes me, I know what I saw, it was only 30 feet above the car.  It was round and had blue and white ligths under it.  To be honest I have never NEVER been that scared in my life.  I will never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

1/15/86 22:00|South Yarmouth|MA|Circle|2+ hours|white,luminous, circular object encircled with colored lights hovering above neighbors house for over 2 hours.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34467.html|6|ndxe198601| white,luminous, circular object encircled with colored lights hovering above neighbors house for over 2 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in January 1986. I remember it vividly because 1986 was the year that you were supposed to be able to see Haley&#39;s Comet and we had binoculars ready just in case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 9pm. My 9 year old son had gone to bed at 8:30-he slept on the top bunk of bunkbeds. He came out of his room and told me that he was scared because he was lying in his bed looking out of the window and said that there was something above our neighbors house across the street. He said that it was white and had different colored lights on it and it was just sitting above the roof. I went and looked out of his window and saw what he was describing...a white object with a green light on the top and a green light on the bottom. Across the center was a row of red,blue,yellow, and green lights that appeared to be blinking across it. The object was circular and was just hovering there. It was approximately the size of between a nickel and dime held at arms length and was hovering above the house across the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went and got my (now ex) husband, my son and 7 year old daughter and we went out onto the front lawn with the binoculars to get a closer look. The object was a luminous white with the lights as described above and continued to hover...occasionally it would weave slightly to the left or right, but basically returned to the same position above our neighbors house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband kept saying that maybe it could be a Christmas ornament that someone strung up above the house, but I said that no one in their right mind would have climbed up that high to string up an ornament that big AFTER Christmas was over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By 10pm, the object was still hovering there, so I went inside and called my best friend up on the phone(who lived at the end of our street)and she came up to our house to be my &#34;witness&#34; and saw the object with us. We all stayed outside in the cold staring at this thing until 11pm.It made absolutely no sound at all. By this time my kids were petrified and so was I. We went into the house and I proceeded to call the Yarmouth Police to ask them if they had gotten any calls about this thing. The answering officer started laughing at me when I described it and said that he had a phone number he was supposed to give out to anyone who called with a &#34;sighting&#34;. I was so humiliated by his laughing that I just hung up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do, however, remember being the most scared I have ever been in my life. I went around the house locking all the windows and doors and my husband was laughing at me saying that if &#34;they&#34; (meaning whatever was inside this thing) really wanted to get into our house, locked doors and windows weren&#39;t going to stop them. My 9 year old son was so afraid that he had to sleep with us that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last time I dared to look out was 11:30pm, and this thing was still in the sky above our neighbor&#39;s house. I and my son (now 26) will never forget this experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed, but it is unusual for a genuine UFO to hover in the same spot for two hours.  Moreover, such an event almost certainly would have caused a &#34;pulse&#34; of sightings and activity, which apparently did not occur.  Based on the description of the object, and given that it was a winter sighting, we believe that the first possibility to be ruled out in this case would be a &#34;sighting&#34; of the star, &#34;Sirius,&#34; which is VERY prominent, and VERY chromatic, in the sky.  If the witnesses were looking to the east from their home, that is a possibility.  If it was not Sirius, we do not know what they witnessed.  PD))<n>

I noticed a faint beam of light coming down upon a fielded area several miles away, it seemed. I looked to see where it was coming from as I drove my car.  My son and I both saw that it came from what appeared to be a star.  It seemed   unimaginable that a beam of white light could be coming from that far of a distance or that it was really happening.  There wasn&#39;t a car to be seen, or house light, and I admit that it was very chilling and I decided not to stop. We thought for sure that it would be all over the news. We don&#39;t have any idea how long it had been there, or how long it lasted.The beam was about 1/4th of an inch wide [looking at the sky], and was about 1/2 of an inch as it came to the ground.  We have no idea where it actually touched or what it was doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
