The object then split into two seperate objects and each one went a different direction at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the spring of 1968, I was standing in my front yard with a few of my relatives. I was looking to the south over the town of Delta, CO (western Colorado) and saw a very large object that seemed to be moving away from me and slowly rising. The object was spherical and bright red, it also seemed to have a glow about it. After watching this object for approx. 15-20 seconds it suddenly split into two seperate objects.  Both objects took off at a very high rate of speed, with one moving in a horizontal western direction and the other moving in an upward southeast direction.  They both were moving at such a great speed that they were out of vision in just a few seconds. This happened over thirty years ago and is not a fantastic sighting, but I am curious if there is anybody out there who might have been in the area during this time and witnessed anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They would shift the shape of the formation and move about very quickly in a tight area in the distance.

These lights appeared comming up from the sea, (distance indeterminate), rising up and disappearing into the sky. There were five of these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds later they dropped back into the sea.  We thought perhaps they were distress flares from a ship. A few minuetes later they rose out of the sea and performed synchronized  manuevers moving up and laterally in perfect formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They then rose up into the sky and disapeared.  I think the whole episode lasted perhaps two to three minuetes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The USS Gearing one of our sister ships was initially dispatched when the objects were first sighted to see if they were flares from a ship in distress.  However they were no reports of may day calls or missing ships and our combat information center, (CIC), could not get a radar fix on the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident, (as was par for the course), was never recorded as a UFO sighting but rather as an unsubstantiated ship distress signal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With regards to the USS Scorpion who were a part of our manuevers, she was most likely sunk by accident by one of the two Soviet subs that followed her out through the Straights of Gibralter into the Atlantic - they were playing &#34;cat and mouse games&#34; and I personally think the incident was an accident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC RESPONSE TO SOURCE OF REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear ((name deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for the excellent, and interesting, report!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Are you still in touch with members of the crew of the USS Zellars?  If so, I would like to invite you to have them submit reports of the incident, as well.  We know from experience that different witnesses to the same event often see, remember, and report different aspects of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have you considered the possibility that the Scorpion might have been sunk by the Israelis, or a force in sympathy with their interests?  The Israeli submarine, &#34;Dakar,&#34; was lost on January 29, 1968, in a fashion which suggests to me that the U. S. might have had a hand in that sinking, given the Israeli attack on the USS Libery on June 08, 1967, an act of war against the U. S..  We might have sunk the Dakar as an act of quiet &#34;quid pro quo.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, again, for the fine report!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Davenport, Director<n> <n><n> NUFORC<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

However, I have always had a lingering, unexplained fear of the area where it occurred. Things have gotten rather muddled over the years, but the elements I distinctly remember are standing in the back yard with my mother at about age 2 years old, while an fiery yellow- white orb, about 10 feet in diameter, came down and hovered about 2 or 3 feet off the ground in front of us. After a little while, it flew away in a kind of wavy motion toward the southeast. I also seem to remember laying in bed afterwards while my mom spoke to a policeman at the front door. I&#39;m not sure how this could have actually happened. I am sure my mother does not remember it. Our neighbors would have had to have seen such a thing. And I doubt very much whether a police report of the incident exists. All the same, I have always been afraid to go in our back yard at night. When I was about 6, we added a family room onto the back of the house, and the area it was built on was the same area where the event occurred. I have always felt very nervous going into that room at night. Still, I don&#39;t think I &#34;remembered&#34; the details of this event until I was about 11 or so and started hearing about UFOs, so it may be some kind of false memory. I honestly don&#39;t know. But I thought I&#39;d report it anyway, just in case. I have never heard of a UFO quite like this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We could not get past the Marine Sentries although they verified what had happened.  We were originally notified by phone by by a CT from the transmitter site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night when the CT got off duty he came to our house with his wife (who worked for the Captain of the base) and had us come out and witness witness the UFO hovering silently up in the air.  It was a gray disc shape with red and green lights on the bottom and was completely silent.  Could not s see the top of it as it was overhead.  It was hard to judge the size but the night was sparkling clear that far out in the desert.  It was not a weather balloon as it was too big and did not move but hovered silently.  I did not stay up to witness it leaving as my wife and I both had to report to work early in the morning and we were conscientious workers and did not drink or smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is an authentic report from a military e-9 (30 years service) and his wife who worked for the U.S. Government.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife went to work at Supply the next morning and when she reported it, they all laughed at her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The E-8 or E-9 who worked at the Transmitter site was demoted the next day to Barracks Master at Arms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What does this tell us.

Then, in 1968, I was assigned to an Air Force &#39;outpost&#39; in Trabzon, Turkey. Trabzon is an old city with a harbor, located on the Black Sea coast within &#39;striking distance&#39; of the border between Turkey and Russia. Our facility was on a high mountain (Boztepe) that overlooked the city below and had an unobstructed view out to the Black Sea beyond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One afternoon in late spring, I was walking somewhere and happended to look up/out toward the sea (view was toward North). I saw a dull metallic looking &#39;disk&#39; shaped object hovering in the distance. While I had little to judge size and distance by, it appeared to be pretty good sized and several thousand feet up in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it, I became sure that I was seeing an actual lenticular cloud formation. I did not see anything like ports or windows, and did not hear any engine sounds, etc. There were a lot of clouds on the horizon...clearly, a significant weather front was moving in...and the light / sun angle / etc. was a little &#39;off&#39;. Everything had that &#39;pre-storm&#39; look, if you know what I mean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, after several minutes of observation, during which the object hovered in one spot, it pulled the same maneuver the United Airlinea employees observed at O&#39;Hare. Suddenly, it shot off at an upward angle...against the prevailing wind direction...directly into / through the approaching front. Punched a hole clear through it, like drilling a tunnel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was dumb-founded and realized this was no &#39;lenticular cloud&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I cannot pinpoint the day or month because it was so long ago, therefore I could not enter that info in the box above, but it was during the Democratic Presidential Primary election (Bobby Kennedy vs. Eugene McCarthy). I had come to Omaha from Indianapolis as a campaign volunteer. I became acquainted with 3 other campaign workers, 2 of whom were instructors at the University of Iowa. A day or two before the election, we went to dinner at a family restaurant--NO ALCOHOL SERVED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dinner conversation covered many topics. It developed that the name of a former English teacher from my alma mater was mentioned under his pen name, Brad Steiger. I informed the group of his real name and from there the talk led to the paranormal, Steiger&#39;s main subject in those days. UFOs were mentioned at length, but after awhile our dinner talk went on to non-paranormal subjects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark when we left the restaurant; I believe it was about 9:00 PM. As we walked out the door into the parking lot we noticed a school bus in the lot full of what appeared to be high school students. Several were leaning out the windows, screaming and pointing upwards behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we turned to look we got the shock of our lives. Directly over the restaurant&#39;s parking lot, at an altitude I estimate at no more than one hundred feet, was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was circular, with a flat bottom and an opaque dome on the top. I estimate the diameter of the object at 35 to 50 feet. It held absolutely still and made absolutely no noise. On top of the dome was a single, steady white light. Around the rim were solid white lights in the shape of rectangles with rounded corners, separated from each other by unlit space. The lights flashed around the rim in a counter-clockwise direction like lights on a theater marquee, but I assure you, this was not a theater marquee we were looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions were ideal to observe. There was not a cloud in the sky. There was plenty of moonlight behind us so that the bulk of this UFO was outlined against the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assure you this was not a hot-air balloon. There was no flame, no hanging basket. Besides, a balloon, even if tethered, could not have been so absolutely motionless as this object was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As other people came out of the restaurant, they also saw the object. I remember parents with children taking one look at the object, then RUNNING to their cars and leaving the lot as fast as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, one of the men from the U. of Iowa started timing the object. It was more than 2 more minutes before the object began to move away. But I stress that we were able to look at the object for quite awhile before it occurred to anyone to start timing it. While we were timing it, we also asked each other to describe to each other what we were seeing. Our descriptions agreed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object began to move, it moved VERY slowly, maybe 4 or 5 MPH. Again, it made absolutely no noise. There were no ports or windows in the object, just the disk shape with the dome on top, illuminated by the lights described. We watched until the object was too small to see with the naked eye. While it moved away, it maintained its low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have often wondered if anyone took photos of this. Let me tell you, if there had been video camcorders in those days, we would have had, without any question whatsoever, THE CLEAREST, MOST DRAMATIC, LONGEST-LASTING SIGHTING ever made of a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got in our car and attempted to follow the object, but this was tough to do in a city we were not familiar with. Later that night we thought we saw it again on the outskirts of town, but we could not be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, SOME PUZZLING THOUGHTS. Was it just coincidence that our dinner conversation had been, in part, about UFOs? Did our collective thoughts produce an illusion? But then, we were not the first to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More puzzling: this was Omaha in 1968, still the active headquarters of the Strategic Air Command, and yet there was not one other aircraft anywhere in the sky. You would think that this thing would have been seen on radar and all kinds of aircraft scrambled to intercept it. Unless, of course, it was one of ours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, if it were one of ours, why would it hover so low over a busy part of town where it would be sure to be seen? Why were there not at least some police cars chasing this object? At the time, I was 23 years old, and had attended a small, private, church-sponsored  college, majoring in instrumental music and minoring in English.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not recall what departments the 2 men from the U. of Iowa were in, but much later, maybe a year or so later, I happened to see them both in a story on the national TV news related to some event taking place at the U. of Iowa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never forgotten this incredibly vivid encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, I&#39;ll tell you this: I never want to see another UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> --end--<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  However, the Presidential Primary Election occurred on May 14, 1968, so we have assigned an arbitrary date above of May 12, 1968.

I was allowed to go half way around the block and play with my 3 year old girlfriend &#34;Fluffy&#34; after 9 AM...her brothers and sisters would be off in school and that is the time my mother said I could go over to Fluffy&#39;s house to play. As I walked around the block to her house, I looked in the sky for cloud pictures and there were no clouds, a cloudless sunny day. I went down the driveway as usual to the back of her house and already found her outside in her backyard by the tulips along the side of the yard next to neighbor&#39;s garage.I think it had to be the month of May because of the tulips. Fluffy was wearing a new white blouce with rick-rack stitching across it...I asked her if it was new and she said yes and I told her how pretty it was. I asked her what game she wanted to begin playing and she said hide-and-go-seek!  Then it became very, very windy and I was laughing trying to part my long hair out of my face...I noticed the grass was long and blowing strongly too and had not been cut or mowed...I looked over to my girlfriend &#34;Fluffy&#34; and she was already crouched in the corner of an &#34;L&#34; shaped hedge by the side of her house...I said I hadn&#39;t even counted to ten yet and you&#39;re hiding! The wind was so strong and I was reaching toward her and she looked very pale and scared. She was shouting at me, &#34;What is it? What is it?&#34; and I looked up and saw large square grey tile shapes (metallic, yet I didn&#39;t know the word back then) it was low and hovering near the height of the tall tree and high enough up right above the neighbor&#39;s garage and I said, &#34;I don&#39;t know...I don&#39;t know!&#34;  She was begging me, &#34;Don&#39;t go! Don&#39;t go!&#34; I reached my hand out and said, &#34;I&#39;ll take you with me cuz you&#39;re my friend, cuz you&#39;re my friend.&#34;  The next memories I have are: Her mother is standing at the back door swinging it open and yelling angry at us, &#34;I&#39;ve been looking for you children, where have you been playing, get in here, lunch is ready now!&#34; (the house has an added on back edition with large picture window facing the backyard and window that looks out to the side of the house by the hedge area, neighbor&#39;s driveway.) We were at the side of the house together and it was as if we had become unfrozen from time and were now walking toward her mother upon hearing this to go inside the house. I am confused because I know I just got over there past 9 AM and how can it be lunch time now? Why is her mother seem upset and angry with us? We walk in the house and Chicago WGN Channel 9 is on TV with popular kid&#39;s show that comes on at noon called &#34;Bozo&#39;s Circus&#34; The ping-pong toss into buckets one thru six are happening in the show...which means it is almost over, at the end. I sit down at the kitchen table and look at the clock on the wall and it reads 12:25 PM and I am counting from 9 AM to Noon trying to figure out how it can already be that time...we hadn&#39;t even played hide-n-go-seek...why is her mom mad, has she baked a lunch casserole or fancy dish. She serves us folded over half sandwiches of peanut butter and jelly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After lunch, Fluffy and I go down in her basement with crayons (we know we can not draw on the walls of the house)  and put some chairs against the wall underneath the see thru stair steps where we draw with orange, bright green, and red crayons a big spooky man ...he looks scarey like a monster and we put him there on the basement wall that day under the stairs down to the basement laundry room.  Fluffy&#39;s five brothers and sisters come  home from school in the afternoon and discover the drawing teasing each other and asking one another who put that on the wall to scare us. They don&#39;t believe us when we tell them we drew it, we explained we stood on chairs to draw him tall and big.  The picture remained on the wall till the mid 1990tys before her parents decided to paint the basement with two coats of paint.  I go home that day before 6 PM dinner time to tell my mommy and daddy that I saw something in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tell them how windy it was and my mom says you must have seen a helicopter and I say no, it didn&#39;t make any sound. My father asks me what it looked like and I say big square grey shapes and he says you must have seen a blimp! I don&#39;t know or realize what a blimp looks like until I am six years old and I see one in the night sky. My folks remember this day because I would not stop talking about going over to Fluffy&#39;s house to play and seeing something in the sky. I remember the feeling of not feeling safe. Her mother did not know where we were and we went away somewhere all morning and came back after 12 o&#39;clock noon time. Fluffy and I both had 3 foot tall manequin dolls and she took her doll out to where the autumn leaf pile is burned in the back yard behind her house and lit a match and burnt her doll. I watch and her mom comes out asking her why she did such a thing to her doll and she says, &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;  I am afraid of my doll getting me that I keep shut in my bedroom closet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of six, seemingly credible, reports submitted by same witness.

I was allowed to go half way around the block and play with my 3 year old girlfriend &#34;Fluffy&#34; after 9 AM...her brothers and sisters would be off in school and that is the time my mother said I could go over to Fluffy&#39;s house to play. As I walked around the block to her house, I looked in the sky for cloud pictures and there were no clouds, a cloudless sunny day. I went down the driveway as usual to the back of her house and already found her outside in her backyard. Fluffy was wearing a new white blouce with rick-rack stitching across it...I asked her if it was new and she said yes and I told her how pretty it was. I asked her what game she wanted to begin playing and she said hide-and-go-seek!  Then it became very, very windy and I was laughing trying to part my long hair out of my face...I noticed the grass was long and blowing strongly too and had not been cut or mowed...I looked over to my girlfriend &#34;Fluffy&#34; and she was already crouched in the corner of an &#34;L&#34; shaped hedge by the side of her house...I said I hadn&#39;t even counted to ten yet and you&#39;re hiding! The wind was so strong and I was reaching toward her and she looked very pale and scared. She was shouting at me, &#34;What is it? What is it?&#34; and I looked up and saw large square grey tile shapes (metallic, yet I didn&#39;t know the word back then) it was low and hovering near the height of the tall tree and high enough up right above the neighbor&#39;s garage and I said, &#34;I don&#39;t know...I don&#39;t know!&#34;  She was begging me, &#34;Don&#39;t go!

5/1/68 14:00|Franconia Notch (near)|NH|Circle|~1 hour|Landing site?|12/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104780.html|16|ndxe196805| Landing site?<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were students at Franconia College, Franconia, NH, which was high on a hill overlooking the Mt. Lafayette forest, looking toward Franconia Notch and the Old Man of the Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, very late, we were looking out the upstairs windows and we saw a bright disk of light rise up out of the forest in the valley below the mountain and zoom away into the sky and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day my boyfriend and his buddy got on their bikes and rode out to the forest.  They found a lot of old logging trails.  They followed them in the general direction of the light we had seen the night before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They found a large circular clearing in the middle of the dense pine forest, over a hundred feet in diameter.  Around the edge were three large circular marks pushed into the ground about two feet deep, which they guessed were marks of some sort of landing gear.  In the center was another smaller circle about six to eight feet wide that was burned deep into the ground so that the blackened burned rocks were crumbling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They got scared and got back on their bikes and came back to the college.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They promised us they were not stoned, because of course we accused them of being high, which they hotly denied.  They got pretty mad about it, so I think that was because they were actually scared, but trying not to show it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just saw my boyfriend again a year ago, and he still remembers it.  He swears they were straight and telling the truth.  He is an honest man and I believe him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was only a few years after the Barney Hill episode, which happened not too far from there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember that they were excited and nervous when they got back.  That was in the late spring of 1968.  We are all 65 now.  We were 22 then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also remember that we suggested calling the Air Force, but they both said nobody would believe them, and besides that, they weren&#39;t sure they could find the place again because there were many logging trails criss-crossing each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They just seemed scared and reluctant to say anymore about it.  So we never have, until I found your site this evening.<n>

I just stood there watching the whole thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was riding my bicycle across the railroad track, when the ufo came flying straight with the railroad track about 50 feet above the track,. all I could hear was the sound off a swisching sound, not very loud, it followed the track went about 200 feet, stopped and came back and houvered about 5 seconds and went straight up and out of site,.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was cloudy that day but warm and calm,. I think when it stopped, it sas checking me out , so I waved at it and it took off out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
