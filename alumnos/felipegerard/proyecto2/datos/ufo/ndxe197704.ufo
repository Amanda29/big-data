4/26/77 18:05|Kansas City|MO|Other|30 seconds|Symmetric geometric shape, black with blinking long red lights.|9/15/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46153.html|2|ndxe197704| Symmetric geometric shape, black with blinking long red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My childhood friend and I were playing a game of catch with a baseball in our neighborhood.  The ball went over our heads and up the street.  We both ran after it to see who could get it first.  We got to the ball at the same time.  Neither one of us touched the ball, we were both distracted by what we saw ahead of us in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were looking south and there was a Catholic church across the road from our neighborhood.  What we saw looked like it was perched on top of the tall pointed steeple.  I quickly realized that what I was seeing was actually miles away from us, and it had to be very large.  It was a very unique geometric shape, unlike anything else I have ever seen.  It was taller than it was wide.  It was very symmetric in shape.  It looked like a tall triangle was sitting on a mirror and the top point had been cut off about 3/4 of the way up, so it had a flat top and bottom.  It also looked like two more shorter stubbed triangles had been placed on either side of the object directly in the middle tapering out.  It appeared that the object was black and it had what looked like red flourescent light bulbs on it that followed the same pattern as the outer edges of the shape.  The lights were blinking on and off in a random but slow pattern.  The sky in the background was pure blue without a cloud in the sky, so the object was very distinct in the sky.  It seemed to hover in place for about thirty seconds and then started to slowly rise and move away.  Then it suddenly bolted faster than my eyes could keep up, I just remember knowing that it had traveled faster than anything on this planet could ever go, except maybe a bullet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I just stood there with our mouths hanging open in awe at what we had just seen.  We looked at each other for a few seconds without saying anything and then I said &#34;Did you just see that?&#34;.  He said yes.  I told him not to say anything to me about what he saw, just to go home and write it all down and draw the object.  I then told him that we would compare our notes the next morning when we were on the bus for school.  Just for the record, I only new to do all of this because the TV show &#39;Project Blue Book&#39; was a series on TV at the time and I had seen the Air Force investigators on the show tell people to do that, so they could buid a more credible case.  Anyway, we both went home and wrote and drew what we had seen.  I told my parents about it, but of course they were not going to believe a little boy telling such wild tales.  The next day my friend and I compared our notes and drawings and they were identical.  I have never forgotten that event nor have I ever seen any other drawings or pictures that looked like the object we saw.  I have always wondered if anyone else saw that object that night.  I also want it to be known that I am not sure of the exact date that this took place, but I believe that I am fairly close to it.  If anyone out there saw this, all those years ago, please post your sighting so I will know that my friend and I were not the only two that saw this amazing sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.

And noticed a fireball similar to the one I witness|11/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/010/S10350.html|3|ndxe197704| As I reported in my first submission, I was standing guard, with a Pvt. Rodriguez.  And noticed a fireball similar to the one I witnessed in Pittsburgh.  And as I reported it to my drill sargent, he thought I was a lunatic.  Then, just about 10 meters outside his tent I viewed an object stealthily coming above me.  It would stop directly over my head, as if it were observing me, and I would stand there just looking back at it.  Originally, it had lights on, and I stood ther just looking and thinking.   I was armed and never once did I think of shooting at the object.  For me it was all time had stood still for this brief moment.  The object turned it&#39;s lights off and stayed hovering above the trees and me for a few more seconds and then it just suddenly took off at a speed unimaginable.  Then, i didn&#39;t understand it, but today I would consider it a blessing, to view these objects.  And I would live all these years never forgetting.  The siting in Pgh. and in Ga are just two of many I would go on to witness..  My next siting would occur in Texas, some time later, at Lake Belton, in Belton County, TX.  This siting was a cigar shaped object and looked like a lit up bus.  There was no sound as it passed over head.  Then, as with now there was no known technology, that could explain these events. I know, firsthand, because I was in the Military Intelligence community at the time and viewed all known Strategic Initiative Technologies, under the then Jimmy Carter, (Carter) Administration.  I would then and now still look to the skies, for more events i have witnessed in my youth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Georgia the shape was a fireball at first.  And upon my closer encounter, it was rectangular in shape.  It had lights brighter than the new halogen lights of today.  And when i first haeard of the new stealth bomber, i looked forward to seeing it&#39;s shape.  i felt it wpould maybe appear to be the rectangular shape I had witnessed earlier in my life, but it wasn&#39;t.  And I would imagine that the lights that folded into the craft I had witnessed in Georgia, were not there on the stealh bomber.  Rodriguez was from America, probably from the western half of it then.  Where he might be today is unknown to me.  I&#39;m sure he never forgot this night, in GA, either.<n>

I continued to drive to Saunders Ice Cream at Loch Raven Resevoir, pulled into small lot in front of field at Saunders. Craft appeared then disappeared and reappeared around 6 times at a distance of 200 feet (disc coninued to move to other points around Baltimore) Ball of Light finally landed in field, Light drive powered down to reveal Black disc approx. 60 feet in diameter.  Event witnessed by 5 others age 11-13 on their bikes. I was seventeen at the time. This was not my last up close encounter that summer.<n>

Saucer came into front view and went behind a hilltop where I lost sight of it.  My two companions could not be roused from a trance-like state, so they never observed what I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/15/77 23:00|Clearence Center|NY|Oval|3-5 min|close encounter in ny|4/25/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22475.html|6|ndxe197704| close encounter in ny<n> <n><n> <n><n> as I was rounding a curve approaching my home one night in the rural town of clearence center outside of buffalo,ny I saw this approx 300ft wide oval shaped object moving slowly from right to left about 100ft in the air. It had 3 predominat lights(2 on each bottom corner and one center top)besides those there were hundreds of smaller lights dispersed thruout the oval shape(guesing on the shape since lights were the only way to define it) I stopped and got out of my car,focusing on the three bright lights I could see the vessel slowly gyrating. It made no sound as it stood in the air. I got back in my car and flashed my highbeams rapidly at it,suddenly it stopped moving from right to left and a single small light left it, made an arcing swoop to line up with the road about 50 yards in front of me and 50 ft up. It then turned on this bright white beam aimed at the road approx 45deg angle and started towards me.I then put my car in reverse and as I was scared. At that point both objects immediately disapeared from the sky in opposite directions.Not sure on date but I do know there was another reported in lakawanna,ny on the same night(25mi)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We noticed by the stars disappearing in front of the object and reappearing behind that it was moving.  There were no flashing lights and no sound.  We had seen blimps over Phoenix that covered sporting events and they are very loud.  Also this was much larger than any conventional craft I had ever seen,  If it was a craft.  We could not see any structure.(estimate, 400 yards long x 250 yards wide)  No one in the neighborhood said they saw it and no mention in the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father a very logical man never wanted to talk about it over the years<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was in the afternoon and I should have put 17:00 for the time instead of 5:00.It was in the afternoon and my friends and I were outside visiting and just enjoying the beautiful day.  One of us noticed a very bright white metallic low in the sky, but above the light poles.  We all just stood and stared at it and tried to make sense of it.  We thought it had to be a weather satellite gathering data.  It was shaped like a cigar and had four small red and green lights, positioned on its &#34;corners,&#34; one above and to the left, one above and to the right, one below and to the left, and one below and to the right.  These small lights would take turns darting out for a few seconds and then reposition themselves by the bright white metallic cigar shaped object.  The larger object was metallic, but it looked unlike any metal we had ever seen.  It was so bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched as all four of the small colored lights repositioned themselves at the same time beside the cigar shaped object, and then what happened next made us decide it could not be something from the earth.

4/11/77 14:00|Silver Spring|MD|Disk|few minutes|Saw a saucer hovering over the, then Hebrew Congregation on Lockwood Drive. It was less than a 100 yds from me, as clear as day.|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57074.html|10|ndxe197704| Saw a saucer hovering over the, then Hebrew Congregation on Lockwood Drive. It was less than a 100 yds from me, as clear as day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saw a saucer hovering over the, then Hebrew Congregation on Lockwood Drive.  The saucer seemed to idle for a few minutes then it jetted off in a split second.  It was less than a 100 yds from me, as clear as day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The saucer was your typical dull silver color with green lights circling the outer rim.  My cousin and I were both 13 the spring of 1977, I remember this day clearly, because we were getting ready to go for Easter Sunday Service and we were standing on the 4th floor balcony of the, then El Dorado Towers.  The Synagogue is approximately 100 yards from the building, at arms length the saucer appeared as big as a football field (100yds).  By the time I realized what was happening I told my cousin to run inside and get my camera, but the saucer disappeared in a split second.  My cousin and I couldn’t believe what had just happened, and being we were just kids we were afraid to tell our parents in fear of being labeled out of our minds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Till this day we still don’t talk about the incident, because it freaked us out.  I remember telling my cousin that maybe they had heard us mention we were going to a picture, and they zipped off instead.  I think that we always felt as they had heard us, and therefore we were afraid of saying anything, in fear of getting abducted.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/1/77 22:00|Louisville|KY|Light|30-35 sec.|Three lights moving in the sky.Two white,one red. The size of a small aircraft light. Form a triangle and then shoot off backwards.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36530.html|11|ndxe197704| Three lights moving in the sky.Two white,one red. The size of a small aircraft light. Form a triangle and then shoot off backwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in a parking lot, with my children, waiting for my husband to get off work. I noticed a light in the night sky that was going north at a slow speed. At almost the same time, I noticed an exact light going south. With a small airfield a few miles away, I assumed that they were light aircrafts. They were approaching each other at the same level and I began to wonder if they weren&#39;t going to come close to hitting each other.  That&#39;s when I noticed a third light of the same size, only red, coming straight down from the sky, due center of the other two.  The three of them silently continued on their courses until they were [a thumbs width] from each other. They stopped for 4-5 seconds, forming a triangle, and then simultaneously shot off backwards in the directions they had come from and disappeared in seconds.  I was speechless until I heard my 8 year old son shout,&#34;Wow!&#34; from the backseat. &#34;Did you see that?&#34;, I asked excitedly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both enjoyed the show, that&#39;s for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
