It cleared the horizon in less then 4 seconds. The fall took about 3 seconds. As it fell it appeared as if itwere a falling star and was coming straight for us and twinkled white. When it turned it was a globe shpe which appeared as a bright blinking emerald green translucent color. It seemed to fire a strobe burst from the front of the craft which changed colors as it rotated around the craft leaving a trail behind it of white strobes. It looked as if what the trails were was actually the previous position of the craft. Almost like it was occupying both positions at once and was moving quicker then the eye could register.<n>

I appeared, then disappeared suddenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My thirteen year old son and I were travelling west on I-10 in April of 1994 en route to Los Angeles. At about 9:00 PM, or so, as we were passing thru the state of Mississippi (Pascagoula was the last sign I noted before the incident)we saw to the south and about two miles away, deep in thick swampland a huge prism of multi-colored and very brilliant light appear. It fanned out from a zero point at ground level and spread out with distance. The light did not diffuse or dim over distance. For the short time we saw it,(about two seconds)it seemed to stretch to infinity in the night sky. One other detail is that the angle changed and tilted upward slightly as we observed it. It was without doubt, the most brilliant light I&#39;ve ever seen. I could also tell that this beam was a flat projection. The last detail worth noting is that my son and I both experienced severe panic following the sighting. I accelerated the car to very high speed until we came to the next brightly lit city (I think it was Baton Rouge, La.)<n>

My friend and I were standing in my parents backyard (I was a junior in high school at the time). Behind my parents house was a park. The two of us were smoking and talking. Out of the corner of my left eye I saw a ball of light perhaps the size of a basketball raise up over the fence, I turned quickly to face it but all I saw was the trail of light it had left behind as it came towards us. I looked back towards Adam, his arms were raised above his waist level with his palms facing down and he was looking down. I looked down and I saw the trail of light this sphere had left behind as it made a figure eight around us. We are not sure if it made the figure eight around us once or twice. We think it shot across the yard after that and left over the fence towards the park (the same fence it entered the yard over to begin with). The object was moving so fast, it was really something else. The entire event took 2-3 seconds. This is TRUE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

The speed of the orange ball was so fast that it crossed the entire valley in less than a second.  All I remember seeing was an orange flash in the distant horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am barely reporting this because this is the first time I&#39;ve ever seen this sight.  I have always remembered that night, and I marked it on my calendar because it really made me think and wonder what the hell that thing was.  Anyways, I think I was the only one in the tramway that actually saw the orange ball, but I know that everyone saw the flash. I know this because everyone was asking where the flash came from. Well, I wish I could write more, but I need to be going.  P.S. If you were around back in 94 I was wondering if I could find out if you had any similar reports for that same night<n>

Where upon we all turned our attention to the skies to examine the object.  All of the other teens quickly agreed it was a U.F.O.. I was the only skeptic at this point trying to find an explanation. What I witnessed was a black almost disk shaped craft with a series of red lights hovering in the sky.  I tried explaining it by saying it was a blimp moving slowly at a strange angle away from us so it appeared not to be moving. We debated this for about one to two minutes when the craft nearly vanished before our eyes accelerating at a great rate of speed I cannot compare to anything I&#39;ve ever seen. I immediately conceded and agreed what we witness was a U.F.O.. I have never seen anything like it since, nor have I seen anything like it in any photos I&#39;ve seen of U.F.O.&#39;s online or on television.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

My Step dauhger was 16 and was it the Saturday before Easter. We were camped at Lynx Lake, near Prescott Az; camped south of the lake in a wide spot about 50 yards south of the dam.  It was VERY cold. (The cold is my primary memory of this night). I had two teenagers, one preteen, one todler two adults and one tent. About 2300 I was trying to rearrainge the beding to provide some relief from the cold. Went to my pickup for a ground tarp. My ex-wife had abandoned the tent and was sleeping in the cab of the pickup with the engine running and the heater on. The kids were all with me in the tent. As I recall, the pickup engine stoped for several minutes; Tina woke up and nearly wore out the starter trying to get it going again. Vehicle was 1969 GMC 1/2 ton (with several dozen USMC sticker on it). I heard a sound that I initially thought sounded like a water fall. Looking up, I saw a large object that I initially thought was 4 military helicopters flying in a formation. I did not see any red or green lights, only white ones. I then noticed that the stars behind the paralagram formed by the four lighted helos were occulted.  The sound was not the typical (womp womp womp) made by military helos (I spent 2 years in the Marine Corps and 6 years in the Navy, I know what helos sound like.)  It sounded more like a waterfall, using a bass voice. The object(s) were traveling slowly west to east. Their speed was about the same as a flight of helo as seen from the ground. It is difficult to guess the altitude, however I have seen military helos overhead many times. The altifude of this object(s) was similar. The shape was not square, or prehaps square seen from an odd angle. Assuming a 3 to 2 ratio of the object, (3 lenght and 2 width) the northern leading light was 1.5 units farther east than the leading southern light. At the time I &#34;assumed&#34; that it was military aircraft with a net or something strung between them, but I remember the sound. It was not a normal helo sound.

We were in what is called the Croom section of the Withlacoochie National Forest, and all three of us are university instructors. We were lying on lawn chairs around a campfire and I looked up to see what appeared to be a huge (football-field sized, perhaps) chevron-shaped formation of red lights. The other two witnesses didn&#39;t seem concerned, but did remark, as I did, that it was &#34;odd.&#34;  It was either one very large object or 7-8 small ones, but my best guess is one large, black or dark gray object moving very slowly overhead, absolutely silently.  The red lights were around the periphery, from a point at the front and widening toward the back. One witness suggested helicopters, but I pointed out that I didn&#39;t think they&#39;d be flying in formation with no lights but a single red one, at night, over the forest. The object(s) moved slowly (I don&#39;t know which direction--we were in the woods, at night) and disappeared.  It took probably 15-20 minutes. The next morning, one of the witnesses (my husband) and I went out birdwatching; I left him to finish by himself (too many blackflies) and he disappeared. That is, it took numerous searchers on horseback, rangers in trucks, a helicopter, and--finally--a tracking dog to find him at about 21:00 hours that night. He said he took a nap in the woods, and was slightly disoriented and dehydrated when checked in the ambulance afterward. He still won&#39;t discuss what happened to him that day, although he appears to have suffered no obvious aftereffects. My own interest in UFOs goes back to my childhood. The third witness has since moved to a different town and we&#39;ve never talked about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mrs.((deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for the most interesting report!!  I do not know what it was you witnessed that night, but I agree with your assessment that it almost certainly could not have been a conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is there any possibility that you could reconstruct the precise date of the sighting?  For example, do you have a record in a bird-watching diary, fuel receipts, or something along those lines, that would permit you to establish an unambiguous date for the event??  Is there any possibility that the sighting could have occurred in March 1994?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you again for sharing the information with our Center!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Davenport<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((RESPONSE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello--<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can get an exact date, but it might take a few days.  We went with a large group of &#34;horse people&#34; (the campgrounds are primarily used for horseback groups) and one is still a friend of mine.  I&#39;ll track her down and ask her, but it definitely was April.  There was a short mention in the local news about &#34;local man missing in forest,&#34; that sort of thing, and really, by missing I mean gone.  What I forgot to mention in my first message was that when they found him he was 25 miles away.  Oh, and it&#39;s &#34;Croom,&#34; not<n> <n><n> &#34;Groom.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll start tracking down the date for you.  Thanks for the respons--and feel free to get in touch if you need to.  I can probably volunteer some time, as well, to your organization.    ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END CORRESPONDENCE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((SECOND FOLLOW-UP))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wanted to let you know I&#39;ve found the woman who runs the annual camping trip.  I should have the exact date soon.  I&#39;ll be in touch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m afraid no one else will be filing any reports on this one.  The woman in question doesn&#39;t know what we saw that night--she was at a different part of the camping area and has never mentioned anything &#34;odd&#34; about that night to me.  My husband is an entirely different story. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find that he has a history of such experiences (we&#39;ve been married 13 years and I&#39;m 50), but he&#39;s very much in denial, both about his personal experience and the experiences of others. &#34;Skeptic&#34; is an understatement.<n> <n><n> So, no--no investigators or counsellors for him.  Hard to tell what he recalls of that day (and night), because, although we&#39;ve made reference to &#34;the time you got lost in the woods,&#34; that&#39;s as far as it goes; he simply won&#39;t explore it, and I don&#39;t push it.  I&#39;ll just add that my ex-husband and I had a number of incidents before we divorced, and it does seem to run in my family. (Some day, if you&#39;re interested, I&#39;ll tell you my father&#39;s story.  It&#39;s quite unusual.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

The object seemed to appear out of no where.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on I would read about cow mutilations and thought it was pretty strange because there were cows over there where the UFO was at. I can remember this very vividly in my mind. It was sort of like a disk; but it&#39;s like I could tell how it was moving. It was dark outside and a good distance away from me so I wasn&#39;t able to make out details. I was so completely astonished I didn&#39;t know what to say. I remember thinking, the flashing of the lights reminded me of the ships from the movie Close Encounters. I didn&#39;t tell anybody I saw it at the time. I didn&#39;t think they would believe me and accuse me of making things up for attention or something. I went inside real quick (my parents and I were visiting our neighbors) and then stepped back out... And I was gone. I remember feeling like they wanted to see me, like they were checking up on me. After that I was consumed with an extreme urge to do advanced math, and discuss so many things which were beyond my level (Supposedly) I felt like I had this mission. This is by all means no hoax or lie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in 1994.

Back when I saw this UFO there were not any such thing as web sites to report them to. Prior to this I haven&#39;t ever reported any of my sightings except one and got no response or acknowledgment for it. So to this day I still don&#39;t know to make of it. I have 3 more sightings if your interested, email me anytime. I can only guess when this 2nd sighting was, which I attempted to describe to in the form I filled out to the best of my ability.  I was still in Elementary school at the time, so it had to have been about 1994-95.  You also might be interested to know that after I saw the UFO, I wrote a book and it was published.<n>

We made a stop at a rest area in louisville Kentucky.  After we had all gone to the bathroom and streched for a minute we headed back to the car.  We were on the road going on to the highway from the rest area when we noticed a huge object with lights way off in the distance.  Just joking my dad said &#34;Oh it&#39;s a UFO&#34;.  Just as my dad had finished saying that the object started moving towards us at a fast rate of speed. As it approached we could tell that this object was very very huge.  It kept coming towards us untill it was literally right on top of our car.  I was so scared I clung to my friend in the back seat.  I couldn&#39;t believe what was going on.  The object that we saw hovered above our car about 3-4 stories above it.  It followed us for quite some time.  I know that what we saw was not from this earth.  We got a really close look at the thing.  The shape of it was triangular and it looked to be at least the size of a football field.  It was really big.  It also made no sound, which I thought was really strange.  It had three bright lights that were shining on our car, on on each point of the triangle.  The thing that bothers me the most about all of this is that I remember that it was hovering on top of our car one minute and then it seems like not long after that it went up slightly and then took off at an incredible rate of speed and vanished.  When we first saw the object it was around 11:00 p.m. after it left it was about 2:30.  I remember only seeing it for minutes.  what happened with that other time? Is it possible that I could have been abducted? This event has changed my life in so many ways.  I have been brought up believing that these things are make believe and that crazy people make up these stories to get attention.  I had to change many of my views and include the possibility that we may not know the full story.  I thought I would share this story in hopes that it may help other people to consider that there may be something out there.  I didn&#39;t believe or go looking for them.  It is so hard because I have only told a few select people about this.  People think you are crazy if they here this.  I could send you a drawing if you want because it is very hard to describe all the details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I had been inside my house in a very rural area watching television with my family.  It was after the last show of the night, and I went to my front porch to relieve myself, as many do out in the woods.  As I stepped out of my front door onto the porch, I saw what I can only describe as two car headlights right above the treeline in front of my house, which was about a hundred yards distant.  The trees themselves were about 75 to 100 feet tall, and I estimated the lights were no more than 50 feet above that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I was stunned at the sight, which my mind attributed to their being a car hovering in the sky.  Instantly, I realized that this was impossible as the lights revealed themselves to be on the front of a large craft.  It was moving at about 10 miles an hour, at about the rate of a running person.  I ran in the house, screamed to my family to see the sight, then ran back outside.  The craft was now directly over our house, and I ran out in the yard to stand under it, to the great distress of my mother &amp; father who assumed I&#39;d get beamed up by it or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up into the bottom of the ship, of which the outline I could barely see due to darkness, (but I could make out a vague saucer shape) but the craft had four really bright lights arrayed as points on a cross directly across from each other.  I&#39;d say they were roughly fifty feet away from each other.  The craft appeared to be about a third larger, maybe a saucer with a diameter of 75 to 100 feet.  As per most ufo sightings, I heard hardly any sound as the massive craft passed overhead.  I strained my ears and heard a very faint hum.  As the craft passed over the trees behind my house in the direction of the rising moon, I could make out more of the thickness of the saucer and the general shape.  It appeared to be about thirty feet or so with a blinking blue strobe light on top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in an intense state of excitement after this occured, and my dad called the police and reported the sighting (with a satisfaction only a life-long science fiction fan could have).  The next day at my high school, I found out that several people I knew had seen the craft as well, and some had even shot at the thing with no effect.  Another friend and her sister had chased the thing in a car only to have it shoot straight upward at a great rate of speed after a lengthy chase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s my tale, I found this site and wanted to record my experience for the ages, I guess...even if it happened over ten years ago.  To the life of me I can&#39;t figure out how such a thing could propel itself with no air downdrafts or normal means of propulsion/lift.  If it was a military craft, they are working with some EXTREMELY sophisticated technology these days...if I wouldn&#39;t have been outside I&#39;d never have seen it.<n>

It was traveling very slowely.  When it passed Kings Mountain, and was in the neighborhood of the Kings Mountain Ranch, it suddenly headed in a east northerly direction towards Sims Lake and disappeared (like a bat out of hell over the horizon).  We called up a TV Station in Springfield, and they said that it had been reported that a Russian Space craft had come down, and that was what the people were seeing, because of the many telephone calls.

In the first person from our neighbor, who is a Physicist and PE, quoting: &#34; My wife, son, and I were traveling along DD Hwy from Willow Springs when we saw a hugh dark triangular craft approaching the airport landing strip, then it suddingly made a right hand turn and flew parallel to DD in the direction of Kings Mountain.  It had lights all around outlining it, which from time to time changed color from blue white to red.  It moved slowely at first around 20 mph.  It was just above the trees,  and its size was estimated to be 3 to 5 times the size of the B2 Bomber!  At one time while I was driving, our son saw a huge blurry red light in the middle of the underside of the craft.  Sometimes the craft seemed to have a halo, or force field around it. When it almost reached Kings Mountain Ranch, it suddingly crossed the road, flew over the ranch, and disappeared into the direction of Sims Lake/Whiteman AFB! Like said, it flew like a &#34;bat out of hell&#34; suddingly over the horizon and dissappeared!&#34;  The object was also seen by another witness!  While some attended the Tri-Lakes-UFO Convention last November 2003 in Kimberling City, one of the vendors at the conference who sold UFO related books,  also admitted that he had seen the same object at about the same time,  when he was living in the area between Sims Lake in line with Whiteman AFB.     -   Therefore there were at least 6 witnesses to the craft who were qualified observers, and can state that it was not a Russian Satellite or similar object,  that the TV Stations were aluding to.  Probably what they were told to say!  Another Gov&#39;t Coverup?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The beams were mostly of a greenish color. Only one object and moved in a way no aircraft or helicopter can. Stopped above the side of(Route BR 116) busy interstate highway at about 500 feet altitude and 1/3 of a mile from our vehicle. it is interesting to note that initially object travelled parallel to our vehicle that was travelling at about 60-70 MPH for about 20 minutes. cars, trucks and buses stopped on the side of the road and object stood stationary and quite visible for over 5 minutes. When other witnesses started to take pictures and flashing lights, object which was quite close, suddenly picked up speed very quickly and soon disappeared in a SE director climbling very fast in a circular pattern and a 45 degree angle. Witness is an airline pilot (now retired) with almost 40 year experience in aviation, air traffic control and a weather forecaster. the other two witnesses were also airline personnel which were training in Brazil at the time. observer is totally sure that aircraft was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, weather balloon, hot air baloon, or a freak meteorological phenomenon and exhibited signs of being controlled by some form of intelligence, probably observing group of witnessess on the ground as the object seem to be responding to lights on the ground and finally departing rapidly when approached. There are no hills, mountains or radio antennas in the area of the sighting. when hovering there was a slight humming sound and the sensation of static electricity in the air even though the night was perfectly clear, with moon setting earlier in the evening and no clouds in the sky. Object was fairly well illuminated and shape was quite visible to observers. We will provide additional geographic details and sketch of the object sighted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

We where not old enough to be smoking, and the park was closed.  There was nobody pulling in.  I looked up to see what appeared in my line of vision about half of an inch wide burst of green light traveling at increadible speed cross about 40 degrees of the night sky about 45 degrees off of the horizon in about 3 to 5 seconds just off the shore of the lake. The briliant flash of light lit up the whole parking lot. As it crossed the sky it went from lager to smaller and then disapeared but had almost an after image behind it for about half a second. That is when it occured to me that it was much to large and traveling way to fast to be a meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The description is not inconsistent with a meteoritic event.

After about 10 min. i saw a light on the horizon and jokingly said &#34;look a ufo&#34; not thingking much about it since we were close to the airport about 5 to 10 miles few min. later a red car that had also been watching the light show came speeding back past me to the main road afew moments later out the right side of my truck a bright blue light that seemed to rotate like a siren light and move horizontal back and forth fairly quick was right out side my window about 20 feet out and 20 feet up the light shut off quickly and the craft took off  I started my truck and begin to chase it while i was shuting off and on my lights to get its attention when i came to the end of the road which had turned into gravel and stopped by some type of mad made pond about 1 mile. i could still see the light way on the the horizon again now but this time it was brighter than ever glowing white green  blue and orange the light shut off and in a few seconds later at this time i have gotton out and am standing out front something flew over my head but this thing looked diferant it was dark  and the object had know lighs on it so all i could see was a outline of it as it passed over making very little noise a would say about 100 feet above me after it passed a noticed afew lights blink in afew differand parts of the sky i felt like their were many around seeing that this all was real weird i Decided maybe i should say something so I say out loud &#34;c&#39;mon show your self i won&#39;t freek or nothing&#34; right after that we both herd what sounded like a few children giggle mind you were 2 miles from anything and it about 9 o&#39;clock at that point i got in the truck to ask my girlfreind (now wife) if she herd the laugh she said she had. at that point i decided i better stay in the truck and watch the last of the dying lightning. By the way this lightning was the most unusual i had ever seen a saw one that was a yellow ball that shot lighting 3 ways off of it after some research i found it was possible just unlikly. anyways we waited for the lightning to stop and right after the last blast and no more lights to see, the pond we were next to filled with the sound of sometype of birds that we had not herd the ten or so minutes we were near that pond well thats my story crazy as it sounds<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Judy Moore and I went  to interview a family living on a farm near Von Ormy, Texas  that had an encounter with a U.F.O. one night about a month ago.  . . .  We interviewed the mother, a computer programmer in San Antonio, and her children, filling out MUFON forms and having them draw what they remembered seeing.  We also took photos of the area, and walked all around the area.  . . .  The sighting occurred around 9:30 p.m., or so, with the object first seen hovering over a large field in front of the farm house, shining lights down on the field (the field had cattle in it when we looked at it and is subleased to another family) when one of the children saw it, and with lights off but clearly visible when the mother was alerted.  It came toward the house 50 - 100 feet above the ground, coming toward one of the children (13-year-old daughter] outside, who ran, quite frightened, inside the house.  (When last seen by one of them, it was quite close to one side of the house.)  The mother ran for a gun, dogs, cats and nearby coyotes were making a lot of noise and reacting, and then the object disappeared.  When they were outside the house, with the object nearby, they felt a lot of heat. They speculated later that they may have been exposed to radiation, since they all developed colds just after the incident  , possibly because their immune systems had been affected.  (Or, this could have just been a coincidence.)  Later, in the middle of the night, a radio and TV (that have remote controls) came on further frightening them.  . . .  There were some indications that they may&#39;ve been abducted.  [She and the daughter examined themselves for possible surgical implants, tissue removal, etc., and all she noticed was something like a mosquito bite behind one ear, that would&#39;nt go away.]  She said she had had two &#34;false pregnancies&#34; when I asked if she&#39;d ever had any. The woman said she&#39;d meet with a local abductee support group, and is interested in being hypnotically regressed to see if anything can be remembered that  is perhaps being blocked from conscious memory.  . . .  Hearing all their stories separately, it sounded convincing that something unusual had occurred.  . . .  The craft had made no sound other than, perhaps, a low humming sound, that the mother thought she might&#39;ve heard.  . . .  They called 911,  sheriff&#39;s deputies came, and deputies continue to check on them almost every night. The woman&#39;s husband&#39;s response puzzles me a bit, as well as the fact that she had made little mention of him when she first told us about the incidence.  He had not been at the house when the incidence occurred.  The woman said he had been supportive when I asked how he fit in.  While we were there he was working outside, came in later, we were introduced to him, and he went to sleep on the sofa by the TV.  . . .  Personally I am a bit puzzled as to why he didn&#39;t share at least a little of his excitement, puzzlement, amusement, etc. at what his wife   and the children were reporting.  . . .  Ron Johnson, in Austin, told me on the MUFON amateur radio net this morning that he had run into similar responses from spouses before and that the husband&#39;s response should be mentioned in the report.  He encouraged making efforts to document the false pregnancies.  Also, he wanted me to remind MUFON members to watch Dateline at 9 p.m. Tuesday, when Dr. John Mach will be interviewed. - Cliff Gieseke, May 21, &#39;94 (From notes I made in 1994; I am no longer a member of MUFON; when I tried to report the incident to the Air Force at Lackland, they told me, to my amusement, to report it to the sheriff&#39;s department, which apparently now has the responsibility of protecting our air space -- Cliff Gieseke, San Antonio, TX)<n>

I first saw 3 round orange orbs above the tree line heading south.  They were equal distance apart from each other and if you put both arms foward and made them into a circle that about how big they were from my point of view.  They made no noise and all traveled at the same speed. The only way to explain the speed is as I saw the orbs and I said to my former brother-in-law look and pointed with my finger by the time he turned around they were out of our view.  I saw a few more and my former brother-in-law still did not see them and thought I was screwing around.  I ran inside and got the phone.  I called the FT. Lauderdale airtraffic control tower.  I told them that this was not a prank call and they could call the police and I explained what I had saw and he told me their was nothing on radar.  I sat outside for a few more hours this time with a camera but they were to fast to focus on.  I counted a total of 11 with in 2 hours all going south, all flying the same pattern.  I believe this was in 1994 but I can&#39;t be sure.  I have told some people but I think they thought I was making it up.  I know what I saw, I know your thinking why did I not write sooner.

We were on a boat in the center of the lake.  The lights were about 200 yard away. The lights got bright and started to change colors. Eventually the craft came over to our boat and followed us back to camp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was April 2,1994. Daylight savings time.  A buddy and I from work decided to go for a fishing trip on the boat he just bought.  We picked Lake Sonoma , and you had to get to the campsites by boat.  We set up camp friday night just by dark, then decided to cast a few times off the shore and ;ended up staying up all night.  The next day we did alot of trolling around. caught and released a couple of small mouth bass.  Later we ate and went back out to the marina. (we are camping aprox. 4-5 miles north of the marina which was near the dam) It took about 20-25 mins at top speed-25 mph-.  We We saw this guy working on a houseboa and we all talked for a while.  Later we went to the boat ramp to catfish.  I was looking east from the boat ramp when I was A flash in the sky comming from just behind the mountains, then a second later two more quickley repeated flashs.  It seemed only slightly odd but I told my friend what I saw.  It was about 11:00 pm.  We ran out of worms.  My friend had alot more catfish bait back at camp.  It was a long ride back but we figured it was worth getting the bait since the fish were bitting.  We started heading back and noticed the fuel was almost empty, so we changed tanks.  We headed up, north from the dam.  All we had for light was my 5-cell mag light.  There were stumps protruding from the water so we sere going to have to be careful.  We rounded the corner up the north fork toward Cloverdale. The wind was so strong that water was coming over the front of the boat, we reduced our speed to 5 kph.  After we passed the public boat ramp, my friend noticed two lights up on the hill and said,&#34;Hey, look at the four wheeler up on the hill.  He&#39;s really moving throuhg the trees.&#34;  I said,&#34;Are you sure, how could he be going sideways like that.&#34;  All we could see were the lights. No object. It would sometimes come in front of the hillside and then be behind the treeline.  Then I shined my maglight up at it and it went behind the hillside.  It had followed at our pace for about 8 min.  W! e weren&#39;t sure what it have been and didn&#39;t really think much about it after it disappeared.  Then it came back and instead of dodging in and out of the trees it was above the ridged of the hill.  It was about 200 yards west.  This time instead of two bright lights it was two bright colored lights, each changing a different color randomly. The colors were beautiful almost hypnotic. It was as if each color had its own vibration. I could feel the light touching my body.  Then my flashlight went out.  It felt like some one put icey hot and electricity all over my arms.  Then we looked up and it started getting brighter.  It kept getting brighter and brighter.  Then a colorful rainbowy mist fanned out from underneth it.  It beacame a glowing ball of light.  So illuminesant that I thought the hill had caught on fire.  At that point we decided not to look at it any longer.  As if ignoring it, it would go away.  I still had to look at it every few minutes.  Then it finally left.  It had followed us longer that time about 15 minutes.  It still hadn&#39;t clicked in our heads what was going on.  I was afraid to talk about it, afraid if I did it would hear us and come back.  The after a few minutes my friend said he thought the lights looked like an angel.  I didn&#39;t think the lights looked like an angel but they were awesome. We talked about it for a couple of minutes then we stopped talking.  We wanted to concentrated on getting back to camp.  It was pitch black without my flashlight.  About 5 minutes later my friend tapped me on the back and said look at this.  I said no way I&#39;m not looking at anything anymore.  He said, you have to see what I&#39;m looking at.  I turned looked back up on my left facing southeast. I noticed an incredible looking craft slowly coming down the hillside, then after centering itself begind us it then closed in comming with in 100 ft.  At first sight my whole body just colapsed, I was paralized in disbelief.  It couldn&#39;t take my eyes off it.  Then I could just say, &#34;Oh my fucking God&#34; Then the ! only thing that came out was air. My friend told me not to look at it,to turn around.  So I did.  We both started praying aloud, I followed my friends lead.  We could still tell it was there by the reflection of it off the water.  The ship was blackend like tarnished silver and shaped like a jelly doughnut.  There was a dark band around it horizontally.  There were lights inside the band, rectangles with rounded corners.  We couldn&#39;t tell if the light was coming through a window or not but the light was pouring out like lumminescent fog.  We could see about seven lights around it.  It was about 30 ft. tall and about 200 feet wide?  The ship so close to the surface of the lake that we couldn&#39;t see under it.  After about 10 mins we saw the fork that lead to our campsite.  We started to head that way when we realized it was a dead end.  My friend turned without having to face the craft and we made it around the next corner when we saw two campfires.  Then the ship was gone.  In the sky over head a hugh comet seemed to take off from our direction.  It started from one color and went through all the colors of the rainbow.  With each color picking up speed.  Then it was gone.  We went back to camp.  My friend immediatly fell alsleep. I did not...<n>

Weather was calm, clear, temperature very mild, moon- less sky &amp; dark except for lights of Taft and Bakersfield (30 miles away).  While sitting in front of our trailer enjoying the serenity of the Spring evening at approx. 10:30 pm, I noticed a white light approaching from the NW in the direction of Taft Airport.  The light was fairly un- spectacular in appearance, not nearly as bright as an aircraft landing light and rather indistinct. The light, however, kept my attention due to its very high speed and relatively low altitude of approx. 5,000 ft. Once the light was directly over the town of Taft it began to slow down considerably to what I would say was a normal lightplane cruising speed. At that moment, the object &#34;blinked&#34; on an enormous conical shaped beam of yellowish light straight down. The beam at its widest &amp; lowest point was at least five times the size of the object itself.  I grabbed a pair of 8x50 binoculars out of my flight box and observed the object and the beam for only a very few seconds. The object was a very hazy, indistinct ball of white light with no apparent anti-collision or navigation lights like an airplane.  The beam was very well defined against the night sky and did not reach the hill tops below it. As quickly as the beam &#34;blinked&#34; on it turned off and the object started to accelerate very rapidly as it resumed its southeasterly course paralleling the Diablo Range &amp; heading over the Tehachapis towards Los Angeles. My wife saw the object too, and remained fairly unimpressed by the spectacle, dismissing it as nothing more than an experimental military aircraft from Edwards AFB.  The craft followed the same course as the airliners that were flying high above it since this is on the main flight corridor between L.A. and the S.F. Bay Area following the Coast Range. The object was in sight approx. 15 seconds and made no sound even though it travelled at jet fighter-like speed.<n>

I was inside my house with my mother and five siblings. When all of a sudden a loud humming started to vibrate the house. My older sister was the first to go outside to see what it was. She said she saw a disc shaped object over the top of the trees. The object was NOT emitting any light at the time. All you can see was the outline of the object over the night sky. After a quick glance my sister runs inside with the news. My mother then lets us all go to see it. We head out the back door to notice that it moved to the side of the house. This time it was emitting a green and red color. It just hovered there at the same altitude for about 5 minutes. (this is where the classic thing happens) my mother goes inside to find the video camera but couldn&#39;t find it. And was to afraid to take to long and that she would miss the object.) After the five minutes past of just hovering there it headed off over the house to exit going 20 to 25 miles an hour immediately followed by three jet fighters aligned in a v formation. When we went inside my mother called the police. Before my mom could finish her description of what happened the officer on the line said, &#34;that the lines were flooding but everythings alright the Air Force called and said that they were doing a test.&#34; At the time my mother and all of us completely bought the reason the officer gave us. Ten years later all of a sudden the memory of the event flooded back. what came back to me was that i saw a object above the tree line emitting colors for about five minutes. That is all I remember. After gaining this memory back i asked my mother and sisters about this event. and thats how i got the whole story together and the first time the shape of the object was put into play. My two sisters rememeber a circlular object while my mother remembers a circlular object with a sort of square piece at the back. When I first heard them tell me the shape since it faded from my memory i was surprised that they didn&#39;t think it was wierd ! sounding. They replied that it was the Air Force doing a test. When i told them that no U.S plane was circular and could not hover they just said really. At first I thought they were just trying to pull my leg. But after a few questions I realized that they really had no idea how planes work and the great importance of basic aerospace dynamics. They really thought a plane could be any shape. Thats why they sucked up the Airforce&#39;s Reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Was looking so. when a green light suddenly flashed on over the Straight River. The fireball was close enuf to light the tops of the trees on either side of the river. It travelled very slowly and parallel..so slow I expected it to fall down..but it didn&#39;t. The color was flouescent green and despite it being night I could see thick smoke trailing as well as a shower of sparks.  It was completely silent. After 2 seconds or so it suddenly just blinked off. I have not reported this in the past since there was nowhere to report to. thanks.<n>
4/1/94 15:00|Megargel|TX|Unknown|10 minutes|Missing Time: 10 minutes erased from my life|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20100.html|30|ndxe199404| Missing Time: 10 minutes erased from my life<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the month of April 1994, a strange experience happened to me. I was driving back to Dallas to attend college after I had a visit with my mother in the small, west Texas town of Knox City, Texas. I was passing thru a small town called Megargel,Texas. As I was leaving the small town, I noticed a red truck pulling into a driveway at the edge of town. A few minutes later, out in the country, a strange haze was seen all around. It left just as quickly as it came.This is where it gets strange, I passed thru the town of Megargel again. When I reached the edge of town, I saw the same red truck pulling into the same driveway. I never turned around at any time. When I arrived at my apartment in Dallas, my watch and car clock were 10 minutes behind all the clocks in the apartment and everywhere for that matter. I lost 10 minutes somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
