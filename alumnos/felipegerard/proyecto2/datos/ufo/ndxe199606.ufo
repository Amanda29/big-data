There was a pulloff where you park your car and then you walk to the creek, I say we were about there a half hr before we had noticed in the distance(about 2 miles away from us) something was rising straight up from the ground. Underneath the obgject was white beam that shone as it was raising verticle up from the ground.  It was  at a slow pace and as soon as it got about 20 feet into the air it stopped in mid air and hovered in place with the beam still on for about 45 seconds and then it turned off its beam and started to come toward us.  As it passed over us it was only about 10-15 feet above us.  As it was paasing above us it turned a set of lights that was around the edges.  On the edges it had lights. They would go in sequence and flash red, blue, green.  While it was passing us it had a low humming sound. It passed slowly by and then! it shot off and was gone.  I think that was the most amazing expierence that I have had happent to me.  I remember that when it was gone all 4 of us looked at each other and all said basically the same thing.  &#34;If we told anyone they probably think we were full of it&#34; .  I know what I saw and nothing will ever make think it was a aircraft of our world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

He should have been home 15 mins later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He came home 2 hours later, drove into yard and fell out of the car.  I helped him up.  He was white as a sheet, no energy, and told me he was driving the River Road by open field when extreme colored lights of such intensity blinded him from behind the trees, he had to pull over. (blue, red, white; etc. )<n> <n><n> <n><n> He next found himself on the ground next to car and it was 10:30 pm.  He had no recollection of what happened.  He made it home  under great difficulty.  He never seemed the same again did not want to be reminded of incident and died at 66 in 1999.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His health was not A-1, but his health suddenly declined.  He did say the colored lights were still there when he awakened and they flashed straight down into in the field.<n>

I didn tell the other people anything, but I was sure that this object was different from an aircraft. We continued our walk, and comming back home, in the same place, we saw all of as the same object, but this time going strait to the sky from the earth at a very high speed, disappearing at the end in a clear evening of summer. I think that this object could be 15 miles away from us. It was like an orange sfere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Was probably as a high a commercial planes fly but below the clouds.  How long it was there before we saw it was no more than a few minutes.  We all saw it and freaked out because it was clearly a UFO. Not a craft any of us had known to exist.  For some reason we think it knew we saw it because we signaled it with headlights and lighters and waving and yelling from car in open wooded area and it blinked once, maybe twice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We couldnt believe it and after a minute it blinked again and cut the distance in half within a second and was probaly a couple miles from us as opposed to 5.  Maybe more, hard to tell distance.  Don&#39;t know how far eye can see.  But definatley was 50% closer to us.  We were shocked and we wouldn&#39;t take our eyes off it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It soon dissapeared.  And so did we.  Started car and got the out of there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we didn&#39;t think of at that time, but later on was; maybe it was right above us that last time.  Didn&#39;t take time ot look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area is near a AF Station.  Proabaly 20 miles away.<n>

It was moving west to east, its shape was in the form of a cube and was black. On the underside of it were 16 white lights all equidistant from eachother. We stopped the car and got out to see if we could hear the noise of it. It made no sound whatsoever. The object slowly glided behind a hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Contact me regarding more information<n>

I want answers...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok, I know its old info, but Its a true as could be.  My ex and I were in the car arguing.  I did the &#34;what-ever&#34; thing, and looked out the passenger window as he drove down highway 51 heading south to Decatur Il.  All of a sudden it was like someone turned on a big neon blue light.  My first thought was what the heck kind of farm equipment is that?  Then I thought, that&#39;s not farm equipment!  What is it?  Then it shut off, and me and him both went to the windshield and shouted, &#34; WHAT WAS THAT?&#34;  Then it came back on!  We didn&#39;t say anything that I remember at that moment.  It was to high up to be anything from the field, but it wasn&#39;t moving, AT ALL, NOT at all!!!  Then as if this isn&#39;t enough- all of a sudden lightning fast-it was LIGHT out, like early morning..as FAR as my eyes could possible see. Except it was early evening.  No sun.  Then it went back to the Neon Blue Orb only and it was dark outside again, then it turned off.  No, it wasn&#39;t the great northern ! lights, I tried to convince myself that&#39;s what it was.  Back then I never heard of Blue orbs.  I thought u.f.o.s were supposed to be round silver disks so we only told a couple of our closest friends. Heck, I just told my sister last year. I want to know what&#39;s going on. ? I don&#39;t remember going home. My ex said we had lost time. I did have a few visions after that through the years, biggest one was Haiti&#39;s earthquake.  I did call someone, back then hoping to hear back, wishing to hear an explanation but I never did hear anything.  A few years after that I had the weirdest mark on my leg, it was a triangle that was made by 3 dots except each dot was a triangle and it was deep red like a bruise red.  Perfectly spaced out, perfect triangles. This is a true story as I&#39;m getting to old for made up drama.  I just really want to know what we seen. Ps,  My past jobs are bank supervisor and a security guard.  I&#39;m a grandma of two and I don&#39;t do drugs.<n>

I forgot the name.  Anyway, I just finished dinner. There was a real brief thunderstorm that had just cleared up as the sun was going down.  I looked at the comet and was amazed at something more interesting! J<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jst below the comet was this spectaculsr cloud formation that caught my eye! It was a huge cumulus cloud rising up like a cylinder! The colors were stunning! It was illuminated by the sun, there was a gold and red look to the whole sky!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then I spotted about Five Gold Discs passing directly in front of the cloud! I was shocked as they moved in line formation from left to right! They were avoiding the large cloud1 The most curious thing was that as they circled the cloud the left flank end disc relocated from his position to the right wing! All the others stayed in formation! It was incredible!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The went behind the cloud, but I never saw them again. I waited, but no sign.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called a site for reporting such events from the phone book, but no one was there.  It was a weekend. I never received any response from the message i left.I never saw anything like this before!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very skeptical about these things, but Not Any More!!!!!!I have witnessed over a thousand meteors, I search for them constantly, These Were Flying Crafts!!!<n>

When I opened the door and told her to stop barking, i saw that she was up by our fence and looking up.  I walked towards my dog and looked up when I saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was a bright, stationary light about 30 to 40 feet in the air, and over my neighbors yard, about 5 houses away.  This light would pulsate and flash brighter, almost like a strobe light, but much slower, about one pulse every 2 or 3 seconds.  It was completely silent, and just pulsed every few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/30/96 01:10|Lake Havasu City|AZ|Other|10 minutes|Two large mother ships first witnessed merging together, and then observed silently passing over the northern edge of town.|6/23/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37667.html|10|ndxe199606| Two large mother ships first witnessed merging together, and then observed silently passing over the northern edge of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two very large mother ships were first observed across the lake approaching from the west. They appeared to be an iradescent glowing green from a distance, and seemed to &#34;fuse together&#34; twice while they were still approaching us. It was a Friday night at 1:10am and prior to noticing these UFO&#39;s, one witness first observed all of the stars in the sky &#34;shaking&#34; and &#34;pivoting&#34; in the sky. This was then confirmed by all other witnesses who saw exactly the same thing, before all of us were inclined to look to the west where we first saw the UFO&#39;s approaching from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft flew parallel with each other keeping a good distance between them, could have been a few hundred yards or more, and were silent. Their size was easily much larger than any suspected craft I had seen before, about several hundred feet long and very wide as well. As they got closer the green glow seemed to fade and their shape was something like a turtle shell oval shape but with the back flat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many different lights glowed from the bottom, at least three rows of lights, with one particular constantly pulsating white light closest to the front of the craft. Some of these lights were strange iradescent changing colors I had never seen before. Nothing seemed to be in the back of the crafts to be powering the crafts forward, and the outer part of the ship was not itself lit, or glowing, or metallic. It seemed to be much more of a protective covering much like the turtle shell shape I mentioned earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ships flew right over the north side of Lake Havasu City on a Friday night in the middle of the summer no less, so there had to be more witnesses like the hundreds of people that were probably still on the lake. The ships continued to the direct west and never appeared to be aware of our near presence, although we all experienced about 15-30 minutes of missing time prior to the sighting. This was noticed by the position of the moon in the sky both when we first all went outside, and then went back in in what seemed like a ten minute trip outside, but the moon had moved across the sky a good distance for it to only be ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No picures were taken, although they could have been, and that has always been a gigantic regret on my part and the witnesses involved. They themselves had never witnessed any sightings before this one, and I believe they still havent since. Myself, however, I have seen things since I was young and I still see things. But then again, I live in Alaska, and our skies are just as UFO active if not more active than the Arizona skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sincerely believe this sighting was something important in all of our lives, and the answer to who and what that was will come to us shortly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Made absolutely no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seemed to be metallic with a dome on the top.  On the bottom were 5 or 6 perfectly proportioned circular lights, all green, themselves in a circular formation.  Do not remember if there was a dome on the bottom of the craft as well.

It was 7PM and still very sunny and clear. We came out of the grocery store and got in the car. We were driving west down Guadalupe Rd. in Tempe, AZ. My mother gasped, leaned forward to look into the sky and pointed at something. I leaned forward too. We saw a silvery streaked object falling southwesterly at a 120° angle against the blue sky. It was leaving a small tail behind it but not falling as fast as a meteorite and much bigger and duller than a meteorite. My first thought was space debris or a missile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then it stopped suddenly about 50° above the horizon. When that happened, the tail ended, the shape changed to spherical and the color went to a lustrous pearl color. It appeared to be over South Mountain, maybe 5 miles away.  My mom managed to drive home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, we drove into our parking lot, having never lost sight over the treeline. From the parking lot, I ran into the apartment to grab my binocs, at which point I informed my dad and sister that there was a UFO outside.  I ran back out, rejoining my mom. All four of us watched it.  The bottom had opened up into a “V” shape and it seemed like hot gases were coming out of the bottom, like the steam rising from car hoods in the summer. It was soundless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the only one who saw it through the binocs and when I looked, I saw little sparks flying off the pearly surface, which flew chaotically around the UFO and would fizzle out, as if composed of electricity.  I also saw more specifically clear-colored heat waves coming out of the “V” shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO hovered there while people on the street were calmly driving their cars past us. It seemed to hover in exactly the same place in the air while the Earth turned underneath it. Sunset approached and after thirty to forty minutes, it was getting further away and more back against the horizon.  It seemed to be over Estrella Mountain at this point.  It was going to disappear soon. The sun was already down below the horizon so we just turned and left at around 7:30 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the news that night expecting it to make the news.  We were frustrated that it didn&#39;t. Certainly in a city the size of Phoenix, people are not that busy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did write down all these details that very night and I called Luke Air Force Base, spoke with a secretary and asked her if anything strange was seen on the radar.  She was nonplussed about my UFO sighting.  I have since learned that on that day, there was a funeral procession for a fallen soldier at Luke Air Force Base at appr. 7PM and so somebody at the base must have seen it.  Personally, I think it was experimental unmanned aircraft out of the NASA testing facility south in Maricopa.<n>

But even though this was 13 years ago, I remember it vividly.  It has never left me, just for some reason started to think more and more about it lately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a small group of us over at a friend’s house, planning to spend the night.  As the evening was winding down, a few of us stepped outside for some fresh air.  After a bit of time the other individuals with me decided to go inside, but for some reason I thought I’d just stay out there a little longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember looking straight up at the sky, and marveling at the fact that it was so clear.  There were tons of stars out.  As I was looking up at the stars, something caught my eye.  At first it had blended in with the rest of the stars, but I soon realized that there were a set of white lights moving with each other, slightly rotating.  (Since the object was high up in the sky and it was dark out, the lights were the only thing I really saw).  At this point, the lights appeared as if they were in a triangle formation, equi-distant from each other.   The object remained in the same point of the sky, but started to ‘revolve’ around it’s vertical axis.   This is when I started to realize that it was a 3D object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the triangle shaped set of lights began to rotate at a moderate speed, the triangular plane created by those lights became slanted until I was looking at the very edge of the triangle (for a split second I just saw a line of lights).  As it continued to rotate, the! triangular plane appeared again as if viewing it from the other side.   All this was happening on/near it’s vertical axis, but the entire object start to revolve around the horizontal axis as well.   As it continued to revolve it began moving slowly across the sky.   After moving at that speed for  a bit, it sped up considerably until it was out of sight in a matter of seconds.  It traveled a long distance in a very short amount of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching this, I remember feeling that this object was way up in the sky, and very large.  My setting was almost void of any sound, and this craft did not add to it at all, there was no sound (but it took me a bit to realize this, since it was so odd).

I poited it out to my son, but then oticed the silverish oject was traveling much too fast for a blimp at that distance.  As my son and I watched, the object traveled at a diagnal path ad wiked out.  It immediatlly reappeared in the same spot, but traveling i a completely different angle.We both watched this strange flight until the light tured green and we were honked at to proceed.  No aircraft I have ever seen is capable of flying i this strange manner.  My son and I were perplexed to what it was and kept askiing each other if we had really seen what we saw!!

I was with three friends of mine, two I worked with and one was a older uncle of the other. I had went to bed early that night and I slept in the blazer, I was wakened by a bright light coming from the woods. At first I thought it was a full moon and I knew that Elk was in the camp grounds from the night before. As I looked around I saw the shadows of the trees every where and at that moment I was falling back to sleep like someone or some thing was pushing me down to go back to sleep. I tried to stop and stay awake but it was no use I fell right back to sleep. in the morning I asked if anyone saw the full moon, nobody did. But it was pitch black that night like every night, and the older gentleman said that he saw the tent light up and he could see the other person in the tent. I asked the person that monitors the camp grounds and he said that there is no full moon for at least two more weeks. I walked out to the woods to see if there was a large light tower but I could not find a thing but trees from where the light was coming. This is the same area that a &#34;fire in the sky&#34; movie was made from.<n>

6/22/96 23:30|Boekel (The Netherlands)||Circle|1 hour|we thanked our host and walked outside immediately I saw a disk like object with many lights circling above the farm house|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57131.html|30|ndxe199606| It was june22 1996 on a Saturday we were at my wife’s bosses house in the village of Oeffelt, close to the German border.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 11:30 pm when my wife and I decided to leave. We were the first to leave the party I had to work the next day and I don’t like to go to bed late on work nights we thanked our host and walked outside immediately I saw a disk like object with many lights circling above the farm house. It was nothing like I’ve ever seen before I said to my wife hey look at that. She said yea that’s strange. We stepped inside the car and drove west towards a major road and my wife said that the object was following us flying on the passenger’s side of the car I looked and saw it, turned left and the object turned with us I speeded up and the object did as well, turned right and he proceeded to follow. It was kind of strange. We drove another ten kilometers and this object kept the same distance from the car above us on the passenger’s side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess I got brave our stupid and stopped the car, got out and got a good look at the object that was spinning slowly in front of the car moving over a house then stopped spinning and started spinning counter clock wise coming back towards us. To get an approximation on the size of it I would have to know how high that he was flying, what I do know for sure is that it was close and large maybe the size of a football field and it still made no sound. After a few minutes I got back inside the car trying not to alarm my wife I kept my thoughts to myself and drove on turning left on the middle peel road. We thought that we had lost it because of the trees but that was an illusion, one minute later it was back on the passengers side of the car. When we reached Boekel we were driving under a lot of trees so we couldn’t see anything following us any more my wife said drive fast and hide the car in our garage so I did we got out of the car and ran inside the house. I told the baby sitter and she said that it was a shame that she couldn’t have seen it. Me being of the nosey types had to look outside and to my horror it was hovering above the neighbors house but now it was very close and I could see from the lights that he was slanting down in my direction I could no longer see the under side just one row of lights, looking at me. I called for the baby sitter and my wife to come outside, but when they did the thing took off like a rocket. I mean a blink of your eye as fast as light. Then the two ladies went back inside, a minute later it came back and I called the ladies back. This time the object stayed and the baby sitter turned a little shade of white and said that she was going home because this was scary. Then she departed for her house. Just them my neighbor was returning home from a party. Walked over to me and the object took off again. Then I told him  of our “strange night” He laughed and I told him to stay put it will come back, just then it returned and he was surprised  He had never seen anything lik! e this a nd a couple of minutes later it took off and we went back inside. While undressing I asked my wife what she thought of all this she said that you should not think about it because it was too scary. And we talked about things and one thing that we are sure of is that we were followed by something that is not from this world. Being an SSgt in the US Air force I know what conventional aircraft looks like this was not anything I’d ever seen before.  Total route that this object followed us was 26, 6 km and the time was about 1 hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Joe The Netherlands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This looks a little like the object from the under side. did&#39;nt work pasting the drawing Facts: * Date: June 22 1996 * Time 11:30 pm * Distance followed 26, 6 kilometer * Duration 1 hour * Lights moving clockwise until it turned around they stopped then started turning counter click wise * Totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> * Height unknown * total length unknown but at least as big as a football field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> * speed during the pursuit 80 to 100 km per hour later as fast as light.<n>

Me and a friend began to examine the craft and noticed a strange light configuration.  Three small lights in each corner (red) and a pulsating lght in the center (orange).  Until that day we were both sceptics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ship was making making no sound at all and was sitting absolutely still.  We exited the car and began to get a better look.  It was very large in a perfect triangular shape.  The lights at each corner were very small in comparison to the large center light and were also not pulsating.  They were red in color but appeared to fade slightly into an orange in the center.  In the middle of the craft was at first glance an orange light but after careful examination was hanging down like a large ball of light pulsating and fading and then restoring to full brightness.  We then realized that the road permitted a closer look.  We entered the car and began towards it.  We ran under a passing of trees and then cleared them.  the veiw of the ship was elliminated by the trees.  Upon reaching the other side the ship was gone from sight.  The sides appeared to slope inward at an angle from bottom to top.<n>

Landed in field.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90504.html|34|ndxe199606| Egg shaped ball of light UFO at Avebury, England during summer solstice 1996.  Landed in field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I am an American computer engineer.  I carry dual passports so I was able to spend two years working in the UK at Intel corporation from 1995 to 1997.  During this time I had a few UFO sightings, this one was very bizarre and up close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Summer Solstice 1996 – Avebury, Wiltshire, United Kingdom   I decided to repeat my 1995 summer solstice camping trip to Avebury, UK on the 1996 summer solstice.  I camped in the same grove of trees in my hammock.  I again had hiked across the recently plowed fields and settled into the grove of trees just up the hill to the east above the famous Avebury stone circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The radio scanner I brought with me from the USA (illegal in England) was again full of chatter from the police maintaining a 4 mile people free zone around the Stonehenge circle, as they did the year before. I heard one hilarious exchange where a couple of policemen were chasing a group of 4 people that managed to break through the barrier and were running across the fields toward Stonehenge. One officer asked for a description of the people and the reply was “they were hippie type people, carrying flowers.”  With that they sent two patrols out that quickly stopped the group. I am sure they were a real threat.  I note this because it is/was unusual for them to do this and the year before on the same day and while camping in this very spot I saw a huge UFO to the south of me in the direction of Stonehenge.  That UFO had to be hundreds of yards across, at least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again as last year, I was watching the druidic ceremonies around the Avebury circle when I turned and noticed a white light approaching me from behind.  It was coming from the east and appeared to be coming along the 2000 year old Roman (dirt) road.  As it got closer I realized it was not on the ground, but was in the air.  I was thinking helicopter, but was unable to hear any sound even though it was only maybe 200 yards away.  As it got closer I noticed there was a spotlight of sorts coming out of this “ball of light” that was criss-crossing the ground at incredible speed.  It was like a search light on steroids, making radical sweeping and zigzag movements at lightning speed across the ground.  It appeared it might be looking for something, the ball of light was moving across the ground at a very slow pace as the search light scanned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer I could make out a clearly egg shaped ball of light with no other features except the search light.  Now only 100 yards from me and still not making any audible sound, it hovered slowly by me and then began to go back toward the east.  It moved like this, back and forth, over and over for a long time.  At some point I finally decided that it was not of this earth, certainly not man made, I accepted the fact that it was a genuine alien UFO.  I began to “think” to it. I said in my mind, “come to me over here”.  As soon as I thought this it immediately made the first movement directly toward me. I almost pissed in my pants and I immediately thought “NO!!! please go back” and it immediately moved back to its original back and forth searching.  I was fairly rattled at this point and was quite frankly scared a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized I had binoculars and I used them to try to ascertain more information. I was unable to make out any more detail with the binoculars.  In my binoculars, the object was large enough to fill ½ the view or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the entire area filled with light. I put down the binoculars and saw a 50 foot circle of light on the ground in front of the UFO.  This was no less spectacular than the scene in Close Encounters of a Third Kind.  The light was apparently coming from somewhere above and I could not see the source due to the canopy of the trees.  I was momentarily terrified, and maybe 10-15 seconds after it appeared, the light from above disappeared.  The UFO continued its &amp;quot;search&amp;quot;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or so more the searchlight stopped, all that was left was the egg shaped ball of light moving back and forth in front of me.  It was very mesmerizing.  Slowly, the light began to dim, still moving back and forth, slowly dimming, back and forth, slowly dimming.  I watched, as it dimmed it began to slowly change shape.  It also was now almost perfectly still in the air and no longer moving back and forth.  It went from a bright egg shape to red glow that began to flatten out.  It was now so dim that I could barely see it without the binoculars.  It turned into a very flat, thin disk barely glowing a reddish color. Then it slowly descended to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I recall is it is 10:30 am the next morning and I am waking up, still in my hammock.  I have no idea how I could have gone to sleep when a UFO had just landed next to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put this event out of my mind for a long time.  I remembered it just fine, but I never really processed it.  I never asked questions, even to myself about what it was, and what the possibilities were.  It was just one of many strange events in my life.  It was only recently (2006) that I decided that it was very strange for me to have ignored it as I had for so long.  It occurred to me that I might have been programmed in some way to not make issue of it.  I now want to know as much as I can about it. What happened to me after it landed?   Was I approached or affected by anyone or anything on board this UFO?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Update 2012:  Strangely again, this event keeps getting ignored by myself.  I feel almost compelled to ignore it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: at the time I wrote this report I had never before heard of anyone seeing a large ball of light UFO like this.  I have since heard a few stories very similar to my experience.  One of them I believe occurred in the same region some years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.<n>

6/20/96 15:30|Surrey (Canada)|BC|Other|30 minutes plus|Strange Planes That Changed Shape And Appear To Be Interdimensional|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84880.html|40|ndxe199606| Strange Planes That Changed Shape And Appear To Be Interdimensional<n> <n><n> <n><n> That afternoon a friend and I went down to the river (Campbell) where the fishing boats came in to get fresh fish for dinner.  We arrived early so I sat on a log waiting for the boats to come in.  This spot was a brief walk from the highway, perhaps 400 ft or so from the road.  My friend sat on the sand, leaning back on the log looking at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He caught my attention by saying, “Look at those strange seagulls up there.”  I looked up and saw five to six ‘planes’ that had a strange shape, bulbous middles apparently white metal for the sun was glinting off of them.  The time may have been an hour later, like 4:30, come to think of it for the sun was low in the sky.  It was a clear day with few clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These planes were more than a mile high by my estimation and way too large to be birds, to appear as large as they did from our vantage point down below.  Further, the metal wings were moving alternately.  “Those can’t be birds – they are too large. Those are planes! Look at the shape,” I said.  ““Gulls are streamlined, don’t have bulging, round middles.”  “And gulls flap their wings in unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I said that, the planes began moving their wings in unison, as gulls do.  I know it sounds strange, but he and I both remarked that we felt as if our brains were being scanned and picked, our thoughts being read.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued watching these “planes” flying aimlessly back and forth above us in the sky.  If their shape were not unusual enough, from time to time one or more would “disappear” – against blue sky.  And then reappear.  We got the impression that somehow they were going to and from another dimension.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this bizarre sighting to the UFO reporting group in British Columbia, Canada.  Their president returned my call and asked me many questions about the sighting and my personal background and history.  I do legal investigative work for lawyers and am not known for lapses of consciousness or imbibing any mind altering substance, by the way.  If my friend had not seen the same things in the sky, I might not have reported it.  The president of the society confirmed that he, too, had seen such planes over the Campbell River in Surrey while walking his dog.  But he saw just one, not five or six as we had seen.  When I told him of our impression that these were going back and forth between dimensions, he said that was a good possibility from the way they vanished, almost dissolving against the blue sky – and then reappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no doubt we saw what we saw in this long daylight sighting.<n>

I had watched it for a minute, not thinking much about it as I was listening to my walkman in the family van. I could look away, and it would still be there, and still slowly moving. It was very close the buildings and looked very odd and somewhat dangerous. I would cirlcle around the buildings not changing much in elevation, just 3/4 of the way up and sometimes higher. I found out much later there is an airport nearby, but it doesn&#39;t explain a disc shaped craft moving 1-5 mph 20 ft from the buildings for 3-4 minutes. The craft would move behind one of the buildings and be only partially visible, but circle around another building and become visible again. As we got to the end of the highway, I was excited to get a closer look and find out what it was and why it was so close to the buildings. It started to move behind a building again and became totally hidden behind a building, and I never saw it again. No sound or exhaust trail. I looked out every window of the van and it was nowhere to be seen. The three other passengers did NOT see it so of course when I told them about it I was not believed and teased about it. Oh well. I believe there are other curious life forms out there exploring, but I myself don&#39;t believe 90% of UFO sightings, but I know I saw something. It was in a very populated area, and I can&#39;t find any other reports of this, and if it were a UFO, I&#39;m sure I would have heard about it. But I don&#39;t know it&#39;s been 6 years, and it DOES fascinate me and I just want an explaination!<n>

Walked out onto the porch.  Facing eastward I can see the lights of Ft. Collins to my left and the lights of Loveland to the right (I was at my cabin above Masonville, CO at the time). From the south and to the east of me something in the sky was moving towards the north.  My best guess the object may have been 3000&#39;-3500&#39; from the ground and mabye 5000&#39; feet distance from me.  I was in awe.  I didn&#39;t hear any noise from the object.  It was black and as it moved in front of me I could tell it was triangular.  It was non-reflective or otherwise I would have seen lights from Loveland reflecting off it&#39;s belly.  It was much blacker than the night sky.  Stars would disappear as the object moved under them.  I can only guess at the size, there were no lights but since it was blacker than the sky I could tell it was triangular.  I would guess that from the rear tips of the craft that it may have been 125&#39; across the back end.  From the nose to the rear tips mabye 100&#39;.  I&#39;m not sure.  It continued trekking north towards Cheyenne at the same pace as when I first saw it.  I wuld guess the speed at about 65-70 mph.  I watched it till the mountain north of me blocked my view.  This is the first time I&#39;ve mentioned this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a scout in the Marines from 70-76.  I&#39;m pretty levelheaded, never did drugs and don&#39;t drink alcohol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was on the CSU campus that morning looking southeast over the student center.  The sky was clear enough I noticed certain stars going missing and reappearing.  After a while, I could make out a huge triangular craft much blacker than the rest of the sky moving northward over I-25 about seven miles east of campus.  It was very large, from my perspective, about six hundred yards long by two hundred yards wide at the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while, as it moved into view, I could see its underneath dimly lit by the reflected city lights from Loveland and Longmont.  I backed into the building and shut off the lights.  At first I was not anxious.  From that distance I did not see seams, rivets, windows, lights, etc., and the whole sighting lasted about two minutes before other buildings and trees obscured it from view.  Its path may have been nearly pointed in my direction for the duration which may be why it seemed to crawl along.  No way anything that size would have escaped the attention of NORAD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was round bout 5:30 that afternoon i was at my buddies house and we had nothing better to do but shoot ducks, but shortly that got boring to so we just sat there on the patio talking when IT, or whatever it was SLOWYLY CREPT around a VERY BIG hill,(it would take prob. about 5mins to get to the top,if you walked up it), and when i say slowly i mean, i didn&#39;t even realize it till he said something, it made absolutely NO sound, nothing. It wasn&#39;t the sun niether because the sun was behind us.  whatever this was, it was right infront of us, just hovering, no sound, no nothing. So as kids what did we do...got our guns back out and started shooting at it seeing that from the patio to where it was it was only about 100yds away. not that far, but because we didn&#39;t no better and nobody lived anywhere near there we continued to shoot at it...and yet still IT did nothing...then i&#39;ll say about 3mins. later it left the same way it came, right back around the big hill where you couldn&#39;t see anything...we took off as quick as we could, down the patio, down the hillside, beside the pond, and right beside the hill where it once was, nothing...not a single thing. we told our folks when they got there but they said ok, sure. and that was that never saw anything like that again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

6/18/96 08:26|San Diego|CA|Circle|70 seconds|A brilliant white perfect circle changes to a circle within a circle and then becomes a distant dot in the sky.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97077.html|53|ndxe199606| A brilliant white perfect circle changes to a circle within a circle and then becomes a distant dot in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about June 18, 1996 at 8:26AM, while travelling southbound on Interstate 15 (I-15) corridor in greater San Diego, California, and in the vicinity of formerly Naval Air Station, Mira Mar, and now the Marine Corps Air Station, Mira Mar, I saw in the southeastern morning sky a round circular object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time (1996), I lived in North County San Diego and worked for a private, not-for-profit, Institution of Higher Education (post-secondary), which was headquartered on and along Camino Del Rio South parallel to Interstate 8 (I-8).<n> <n><n> <n><n> On regular work days, Monday-Friday, I commuted to and from work using I-15 corridor, and appropriate exits taking me to and away from my office location.  I had been using the I-15 corridor since 1991 and became familiar with smaller cities between my residence and place of work along the corridor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When approaching the vicinity of Mira Mar, my daily routine was to quickly scan the morning skies (while operating my vehicle), and look for Naval fighter jets in the skies practicing ‘touch-and-go’ maneuvers at the Air Station.  As memory serves, it was customary for the fighter jets, flight pattern, to circle and approach air strip from the east when landing or touching down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of June 18, I was scanning the morning skies but did not notice any ‘human’ craft in the air.  I assumed the Air Station had their jets down in hangers conducting maintenance on them.  I did however notice what appeared to be a brief glitter in the southeastern sky.  At first, I thought it might be the sun but the sun had already risen to higher elevation.  Then I thought it might be a commercial aircraft from San Diego International Airport at high altitude and the sun’s rays reflecting off the fuselage of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It suddenly appeared in the southeastern morning sky.  The object was a perfect circle, brilliant white in color but blinding to the eyes.  Using my thumb as a gauge and extending my arm out in the direction of the object, it was larger than my thumbnail and perhaps the size of a 25 cent coin (quarter).  It didn’t move it hovered as if suspended in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving approximately 65mph, keeping up with the traffic, and flailing my left arm out the window shaking my hand and pointing my fingers upward in the sky hoping other drivers would notice and see the object as well.  This is all taking place and happening within seconds, really.  I looking up briefly, driving, and trying to get others to look-up as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object changes!  What initially appeared as a brilliant white circle, suddenly changed and it became two circles or a circle within a circle.  The inner circle was white but it moved like gaseous steam, rolling over and over, and it was surrounded by an outer circle that was clear and translucent.  The space between the perimeter of the larger outer circle and the perimeter of the inner circle (the circle within a circle), was transparent and there was something like a heat wave that moved between the perimeters of the circles.  It reminded me of heat waves moving across a hot desert floor that can be seen from a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object begins to move.  As quickly as the object appeared, hovered, changed, and reconstituted to its original state, it begins to move southwardly in the morning sky.  Within seconds what appeared to be an object the size of a quarter, moved and accelerated its speed and was now a mere white dot dancing in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting incident happened within seconds, and maybe slightly more than a minute?  I honestly do not know how much time elapsed.  I do recall looking at my clock radio when I first noticed the object and hence I report the incident occurring at 8:26AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is more … a very unusual dream that happened several days after experiencing the sighting but perhaps that is for a different posting.<n>

At this point, its velocity made it appear as though the object was just &#34;cruising, like a normal aircraft.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observer, at first, thought the object was a balloon.  When it started to &#34;rise,&#34; he though that it had simply been caught in an updraft.  The object had a flashing appearance, and it appeared to have a ring around its equator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the intensity of the glow that emanated from the object got very bright, and it ceased moving.

As I was approaching the park, the road does a very slight left turn and has a slight decline which allows you to see the tree line, I saw a black object which looked triangle shaped at first but as I got closer I could see that it was more diamond shaped.  IT was a very sunny day out and I was wearing my prescription sunglasses and I was driving a work car back to the office.  I saw this object litterally staring at me or so it seemed.  It was looking right at me and I just stared at it the entire time.  I think it noticed that I was able to see it and it started to slowly drift towards its left (my right).  It was hovering above the tree line and just turned into the trees where I lost sight of it because i was then underneath it and lost sight because of the roof of the vehicle.  The very split second I lost sight of that, something told me to make a quick scan at the park to see if anyone saw this.  Not a single person saw this object, they were all playing soccer and tennis.  I was just in total shock when I saw this.  I should have stopped and got out of the car but you never know how one would react in a certain situation.  I saw this object very close and upfront.  It was a solid black metallic object.  Whatever this thing was, it simply defied any law of gravity.  It hovered about the tree line and didnt rustle a single leaf.  It made no noise whatsoever.  There was no exhaust coming out of it like you see with any vehicle and was apparently invisible to everyone except me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this happened, I was in total shock.  I didnt even tell anyone until the next day and of course nobody believed me.  I tried to examine and research for any possible explanation and came up with nothing.  I was scared to death to really even talk about this to anyone aside from my closest friends and then once i told them, I never mentioned it again until many years later.  I KNOW WHAT I SAW IS REAL.  I came up with only one logical solution and its far fetched at that.  The only reason i saw this object on that sunny day in june is because I wear prescription sunglasses and I believe that these sunglasses were able to bend the rays of light and allow me to see this object.  I know this is far fetched but my sunglasses have this reddish tint in them that makes certain colors look different.  The sun looks reddish in these sunglasses especially around sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Lights: 1 front, 1 on each side, 1 in back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor and I were standing half way down my driveway when we saw this object fly overhead due west.  The sky was clear with no clouds.  It didn&#39;t have any blinking beacon lights, and we could not make out shape.  The 4 lights were orange/yellow color, somewhat bright, and and they were positioned in the shape of a diamond around the object.  It was very low, compared to most aircraft that fly, at night, and made no sound.  We viewed it for about a 7 or 8 second duration, in which time it just flew over our heads and over the trees out of our view.  I do not know what the object was,because I figured that if it was airplane flying at night, it would have beacons, which the object i saw did not.  And it went very slow for the altitude it was at, which must not have bee more than a few hundred feet up.  To this day, i have never again seen an air-plane or jet fly at night with no blinking beacons and lights at the head, each wing tip, and tail.<n>

It was a very clear night, when I had parked in the driveway I sat on my car hood to watch the stars for awhile before I went in for the night, To the north I noticed 5 lights roughly the same height as a plane landing at Vancouver international airport. The lights with a bright white color and basically looked like stars, with a difference. These five lights moved in unison for left to right, In a zig-zag pattern. Would make sudden stops and quickly start moving again, They would form a line or go into a pattern formation. This lasted for about 15-20 minutes. At that point they flew in what I would assume in a direction leaving the atmosphere and disappeared. The following morning on a local radio station a dicussion was going on with callers and the DJ about what people had seen the night before. The DJ had video taped the event and at a later date I did see it on the show Sightings along with an interview with that DJ. From the distance of these lights to my home I would assume they would have been over the Fraser River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

However, it was at least 3 or 4 years before the death of my dad, who was the other witness to this phenomona.  3 bright lights that did not move as airplanes and lined up one after the other.  Precisely, they flew in laze curves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Secondly, I have seen the standard gear on planes to know a jet, or a helicopter from an object that puts out a blinking white glow or a solid white glow.  A UFO doesn&#39;t resemble a jet or a helicopter.  And it is very easy to tell them apart.  A UFO will actually fly higher and faster than the commercial jets.  Dad and I used to spend many hours on summer evenings looking for the space ships when I was a kid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, of this night in question, not meteors, meteors leave trails.  Nor do they closely trail each other low in the sky over the area near CDA.  They do not travel as though they were manned.  I have seen meteors too, they do not act as UFOs.  Folks, I neither hoax nor joke.  Dad is dead now, but I still remember this event very well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In closing, how well does a &#34;weather ballon&#34; shine at night.  Does it have an internal &#34;light source&#34;?  How fast do &#34;weather balloons&#34; travel to out speed air force fighter jets?  The attempt to debunk becomes ludicrous on the facts.  Further, how fast can &#34;Venus travel&#34; if you are laying down and watching the night sky and see &#34;Venus&#34; blinking and moving very fast from one horizon to another from the north to the south, to the east, to the west.  Isn&#39;t that strange behavior for a planet?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1996 is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in June 1996.  PD))<n>

My sister was playing in the yard also, we were having a &#34;sleep over&#34; My friend and I looked up and there was a HUGE craft, it seemed to be close enough to almost touch! Probably about 100-200 feet up. It was about as big as a football field. It was a boomerang shape and there were two whit lights on each point, and a large red and white light in the center/front. The metal looked brownish, and you could see it all pieced together, like where it was welded together or something.There was NO sound at all. I looked over to my sister and screamed &#34;LOOK!!!&#34; and we all looked up and it was gone. My friend and I told her (my sister) about it, but the next monday in school I asked my friend and she said she didn&#39;t remember seeing anything. I don&#39;t know why she ever changed her mind. About 4 years later or so, not sure, I was taping the MTV music awards, don&#39;t ask why...anyways, I was flipping through on commericals and stopped on Unsolved Mysteries and what do you know! The EXACT thing that I had seen was on the TV about like 25 people who had seen it in like Tennesee or something. I hit record and got about a 1 second taping of the craft. Even though it was a &#34;re-creation&#34; it looked exactly the same. I don&#39;t know what ever happend to the tape. Oh well, just thought that I would share my story!! I looked up pictures on Google but couldn&#39;t find anything that matched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I believe it was 1996 but don&#39;t remember the month or day all I know is that that night there was a full moon and that my window faced the west. My bedroom was located on a second floor and my window faced the moon at about 10:00 pm. I used to stare at the moon during the full moon stages through my window. On the night of the event, I was looking at the moon when suddenly I saw a sphere shaped object of small size, almost a dot. It was traveling from North to South and was of a very bright neon blue color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object traveled in a straight line across the moon at a very fast speed. I observed the object for about five seconds until it was out of sight. At first I didn&#39;t know what it was but it really cought my attention. Afterwards I tried to identify what it was and thought it could vave been a plane. The thing is that the object was obviously very far away and at the speed that it traveled at that distance away it could not have possibly been a plane or jet of any sort. Also, as it went across the moon, it was clearly visible as a sphere shaped object and still very bright although the full moon served as a background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is 1996 is approximate.

We stayed on Jeckyll Island in a hotel right on the beach.  After dinner, all four of us went for a walk to the beach via a long boardwalk.  As we were walking, we passed an older couple and the man was pointing up and saying to his wife, &#34;There!  Did you see it that time?&#34;  Not wanting to appear rude, we continued our walk, but did glance upwards as we passed and saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 - 20 minutes later, as we walked back to our hotel, the same couple was still looking into the sky.  At this point, I had to ask what they were looking at.  The man told me to look at a particular grouping of stars in the sky.  It was a perfectly clear night, and there were many stars out.  My friend saw it first, then his wife, then I did.  My wife never got the visual.  Here is what we saw:  About every 5 - 10 minutes, way up in the sky, it appeared as though one of the stars would shoot accross to another star and stop.  After another couple of minutes, it would shoot to another star and stop.  It kept doing this in the same triangular pattern between the same 3 stars.  We finally stopped watching, and eventually left.  I really regret not having my wife see the ordeal, because I swear I saw something I never will again!<n>

Across the street is a little strip mall and above it was this huge, gigantic orange oval shaped object. It was totally silent did not move, it was like it was drawn on the sky. I was terrified. But for some reason the boy did not see it. I did not mention anything to him as to scare him. But you definatly could not miss it. We went into the store no one said a thing. This ufo was just about as big as the strip mall and the strip mall is about 500 to 600 ft long. when we got out of the store it was gone. I didn&#39;t say a word to anyone but hopefully waited to see if any one had seen anything. Unfortunatly no one said a thing. This is the second sighting I&#39;ve seen of an orange ufo. I have never heard of one being orange. The first time I seen an ufo it was white moveing slowly across the sky and the whole thing turned orange and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:   Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I KNOW they to saw what me and my husband saw...the date is fuzzy it might of even been in 95. I didnt tell many people what we saw for fear of being called a fake.  Me and my husband at the time were driving home from dropping off my son in Pontiac Il, we drove there every other weekend for visitation. This night me and my husband were having an arguement and I leaned on my passenger side door to pout, looking out into nowhere. I was startled by a BRIGHT NEON blue orb? Round. Pretty light. Then after it had both of our attention, not that we spoke a word, it &#34;turned off&#34; I just starred toward it wondering what was that? Then it turned on again..and I said WOAH....Then while he and I both watched it, it just went daylight...seriously...I have read a little about some phenomenas but they just dont match up to what we saw that night, It was daylight as far as the eye could see. I guess that isnt as exciting as being taken to a mother ship, but if you experienced it-it would be a life altering moment. Then after it looked like daylight it was a blue orb again and then &#34;poof&#34; it was gone. That was it. I just wish someone else would of called and made the big deal about it, that I was wanting to do...but was to afraid.

Now, these two objects looked exactly like stars, in fact, if they were not moving there would be no way to tell them apart from any other star in the sky.  but these two objects were moving in figure eight motion.  Based on our perspective, and how far away they looked, they were moving at impossible speeds. imagine, seeing an airplane, really high in the sky,it looks like it is barely moving, well these objects were very high up and they were moving very smoothly and Fast, about making a figure eight every second. It was an amazing sight, i will never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Have been involved with meditation&#39;s and various Shamanic work also.  I see this experience as spiritual in nature.  As natural as any other. I also feel honored to have had this experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been on a raw food only diet for a week, no alcohol, no medications, etc. and for the past three day&#39;s before the sighting had attended a seminar which had a profound affect on my consciousness. A few hours before the sighting, at the end of the seminar, something happened to my awareness. This must be explained in detail to make sense. I am willing to do that if need be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway I was in an amazing state of bliss. It was something I had never experienced. As I returned home at dusk, after the seminar&#39;s completion, I went up to my apartment in Newport Beach, California. As I walked into my place a voice said softly in my ear, &#34;Go out to the balcony&#34;(second floor). It was not strange to hear this voice in the state that I was in and I slid open the door and went out. The sun had gone down and immediately off to my far right was a ship slowly moving in my direction. John Wayne airport is off in the distance and I remember even seeing, as is the case regularly, a distant plane flying out. I knew immediately this was no airplane, jet or anything else I had ever seen. And it was so close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ship&#39;s details were not clear because it was getting towards dark and the light was not hitting it in front of me. As it moved at about 10-20 mph from a quarter mile away at my right to directly in front of me it was between 500 and 1000 feet from me...right over the parking garage next to my complex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped right in front of me...as if to say hello (that&#39;s the feeling I had).  And within 10 seconds of stopping flew off at a 45 degree angle upwards at incomprehensible speed.  It was gone from view in 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the ship was stopped in front of me...I looked down breifly and there were the usual people walking in and out of the large apartment complex but none of them were noticing this craft.  My estimation was it was the size of a football field.  It was circular with noticeable, but undefined, multi-levelled sides.  There were also dim auburn colored lights at a few places on it&#39;s side.  Or this may have been the after-sunset reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the only time I have seen a UFO.  I believe my ability to witness this craft was because of my raised level of consciousness(via an intense seminar, etc). My theory being &#34;I met them halfway&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/15/96 19:00|Butler|PA|Circle|10 min.bu|huge round black object with huge lights spotted in sky over Butler Co. PA|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27452.html|74|ndxe199606| huge round black object with huge lights spotted in sky over Butler Co. PA<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is so weird. I had just told my new husband of my seeing a UFO in 1996 when we decided to watch some tv and found a program on UFO&#39;s on the History Channel. Well, when it aired the report from a pilot over Pittsburgh I was screaming because I had just described the same thing to my husband! Please take me seriously - I was very disappointed that nobody had ever gotten back to me as I did report the sighting to the Post Gazette newspaper. What I witnessed was so amazing.  We were just driving along a rural road in my friends pick up truck - there was a light in the sky - we both saw it but didn&#39;t comment because we just assumed it was a plane - until a few minutes later when we realized the light had not moved! I remember commenting &#34;what in the world?&#34; at about the same time my companion came to the same realization that something just wasn&#39;t right. I am delighted to have this forum to report this to as I have thought about it so often during the years. Anyway, my friend just happened to have a pair of binoculars in his truck and told me to take a look at the light through them - which I did AND I COULDN&#39;T BELIEVE MY EYES!! Without the binoculars the light was just a light but with the binoculars it all became clear! My first response was &#34;Oh My God, Oh My God, Oh My God&#34;! I shouted for my friend to stop the truck - to pull over because I was dumbstruck! I was looking at the most magnificent sight - a huge round object with huge round lights - two of which were lit - the lights had what I called &#34;hoods&#34; over them - making them look like the hanging traffic lights. The lights would go off and I could see that they would come on at a different location on the object and then back to where I was looking. Tonight as I was trying to describe to my husband what I had witness I used the word &#34;energy&#34; - as in I could feel a great &#34;energy&#34; within this object - as though it were seething with power but I did not really feel frightened - just in awe. Well, as we watched the UFO program I saw where the pilot ! over Pit tsburgh described what he has seen as &#34;pulsating&#34; and I just had the chills as that would exactly describe what I had seen. The object was black - a very dull black and it was huge! I really could not tell how big it was until I realized that the lights were coming on on the other side of it and then I was able to ascertain that it was huge - it was blacking out a huge area of the sky! I could not imagine why more people had not reported seeing it but then I realized that without the binoculars it just looked like a light in the sky.  When I called the newspaper I was told nobody else had reported it. In the time it took me to hand the binoculars over to my friend it was gone - however, he did see the light earlier. So, this was my experience and now I am convinced that others saw it too - especially the pilot. I wish I could remember the month - I cannot and I had just told my husband that I was pretty sure it was 1996 and then I heard the pilot had seen one in 1996 and I am now convinced that I saw a UFO.

My path around a corner apple tree I felt the presence of something. Second time around in the same spot I feel a presence again so I am looking around but see nothing.  Third time I am coming up to this corner looking at everything in front of me and see nothing but going under and around the tree I feel a presence again, continuing on and looking back, still I see nothing.  OK now I am disturbed, I know I am being watched but I don’t see anything.  It is my fourth pass I am determined to see what is looking at me.  I come up on the corner I feel the presence I pass under the tree and as I look back, up in the apple tree is a small creature being with dark almond shaped eyes, opaque color thin limbs.  It was kind of scrunched up in the tree just watching me, in clear view and just watching me.  When I first seen the being it was invisible, I mean I was looking thru i! t, I wasn’t grasping what I was seeing. I was scared.  I did not finish mowing the lawn.  I did not tell anyone as I thought certain they think me crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a week later around 1:00 am I witnessed a mother ship hovering in the field just outside the bathroom window.  5 acres separated us and our neighbor, I could not see the neighbor’s house it was so big.  It appeared to be hovering just a few feet off the ground, round and disk like in shape with many windows.  It was close enough you could see activity in the port holes of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sense was that the being in the tree was lost or perhaps like a teenager took off and the mother ship was there to pick him/her up.  I have always been of the opinion that we are not alone and well now I know that to be true.  Of course you ask the question, Why me, why did this being presence it’s self to me?  I sensed the lesson for me was continue on my journey continue on my search for peace.  It was like the being and I had something in common, assuring me that there are struggles no matter who you are or where you are in the universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I pulled over to the side of the road(now facing east on Beardshill Rd.)to see what was going on if possible.My son and I were watching(facing west)the helicopter.To the north you could see a light airplane practicing flight maneouvers at the Harford Co.Airpark when I happened to look to the northeast and was startled to see a low flying vehicle(disk or saucer shaped)passing over head.I asked my son to look.He acknowledged by saying &#34;What is that?&#34; I replied,&#34;It looks like a flying saucer!&#34; The vehicle was approx. 500 to 750 ft. above us. As it passed overhead it made no noise whatsoever.It was just floating from N.E. to S.W.,following I-95 toward Baltimore. I would say the vehicle was approx.50 to 100 ft.in diameter,domed at the top and bottom with a dark ring around outside diameter.I saw no windows,engines,or wings.The color scheme was that of the space shuttle. The vehicle colors were bone white(top&amp;bottom)and a visibly black tiled ring around the outer edge.You could see the top of the vehicle because as it moved away from us following I-95,it became level with our eyesight.We were standing at one of the highest elevations in Aberdeen.As this vehicle moved away getting smaller,I turned and looked to see another identical vehicle floating overhead. I told my son to look.&#34;WOW!&#34;,he said. We saw six of these vehicles that day. As one vehicle moved out of our sight to the S.W., one would appear from the N.E..They were following each other in an inline group.I would say they were traveling at approx.75 to 100 mph. The next day at work I talked about what I saw but nobody I talked to saw what I did.The Md.State helicopte! r pilot&amp; copilot had to see these vehicles,as the helicopter was facing to the S.E.,and these vehicles would have crossed their &#34;path&#34;.I can say that I do not think that these vehicles were extraterrestrial,but manmade in nature.Unless we truly do have alien technology! They were so close to us overhead that they resembled the same texture of material and color scheme that the space shuttle is made out of.I have stood next to the shuttle at Kennedy Space Center.Except for their shape,they do resemble each other.It was really uncanny.My son dosen&#39;t remember much about what he saw that day except that they were saucer shaped, but I am sure that some others in Aberdeen had to see these vehicles especially those helicopter pilots from the state police.I found out later they were searching for two robbery suspects at that building.Also I must note that I saw these same vehicles on the T.V. show &#34;Sightings&#34; twice. Someone had videotaped these vehicles in 1997 and turned the videotape over to the show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was mowing my backyard lawn and went to dump clippings into trash can. As I came up with the grass catcher I was looking due west. There were 3 black christmas tree cookie cutter crafts holding a triangle formation. I went quickly into my house and asked my wife to come outside. She asked me, &#34;Why?&#34; With a bit of aggrevation in my voice, I said, &#34;Come on!&#34; She came outside with me, I pointed in the direction they were and asked her what she saw. She said, &#34;Christmas tree cookie cutters&#34;. I asked her if she could hear any noise emitting from the craft. She answered no. We watched them together for a few minutes. They were not rock solid in the sky. It was a windy day (10 to 15 knot winds with slightly higher gusts) and they were being knocked around a bit.  Nevertheless, they held a constant formation. All at once, in formation, they quickly shifted to our left around 3 degrees then 6 degrees to the right (this is an estimate). They did this twice in about 3-4 seconds, stopped, and then accelerated at an unbelievable rate straight up and out of sight in around 2 seconds. My wife and I just looked at each other and I said, &#34;Do you think they were ours?&#34; My wife said, &#34;I hope so.&#34;   On that afternoon we could hear about 3 of the air national guards&#39; C-130 cargo planes. They were on the tarmac warming up their engines in preparation for moving out of Van Nuys Air Port that they had used as a home base for many years. It looked like the UFOs were looking in that direction, toward the airport possibly watching troop movements. At this point the story is over, until. . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 6 years later my wife, who is a teacher, and I were at a school function, sitting at the faculty table. The night&#39;s function was going fine and the kids wanted to play bingo. So they handed out bingo cards and they started playing. Those of us seated at the faculty table were not too intrested in the game and were just kind of playing along. All at once the gentleman next to me held up his bingo card, showed it to me, and said, &#34;Look what I have&#34;. The card was a tan color with black plastic slides. With the center free slot filled and two black slides filled on either side of and one row below the center spot, the card&#39;s 3 black squares formed a triangle shape. I said &#34;I have seen that before.&#34; He said &#34;Around 6 years ago?&#34; I said &#34;Yes.&#34; I told him they were due west, he said they were north west of him. He lives 1/2 mile south of me. I don&#39;t know the math but such information means that the UFOs were not very far away.  Later on, I asked my friend why he showed me his bingo card with that triangle shape. He said he did not know why. We now say with a smile that we have a &#34;cosmic connection&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A friend of mine took the photo and gave it to me. It sat around in my dresser for a while before I got it scanned and put it up on the internet. And then it was another couple of years before I found this site and decided to submit it. (I haven&#39;t been terribly interested in the whole thing.)

I&#39;ve<n> <n><n> placed this photo up in a couple of different places and asked people what they think of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I submitted it to you, I wanted to pose it as a real UFO photo (it is actually a hoax), and then see<n> <n><n> what sort of tests were performed on it. Apparently, my conscience won&#39;t let me follow through on that :-)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve heard stories of UFO researchers who have wasted lots of money on examining hoaxes, and I certainly didn&#39;t want that to happen here. (I figured my photo probably wasn&#39;t good enough to justify it.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> So basically....I&#39;ve often wondered how easy it would be to dupe UFOlogists....but I guess I&#39;m not the man for the job &#39;cause I just don&#39;t feel right doing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sorry for any trouble I may have caused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Christ,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END FOLLOW-UP))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The report and the photo are a hoax.

Seems like we|UFO seen while driving the back roads of Wyoming.|1/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106573.html|83|ndxe199606| UFO seen while driving the back roads of Wyoming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about June 15 in 1996, at around 2:30-3:00 in the morning;  My brother, his girlfriend (now wife), a longtime friend, and I were on the back roads between Gillette WY and Lusk WY towing back my brothers&#39; old Ford pick-up truck with a tow bar.  (No one had to be in that vehicle, we were all in the towing vehicle, an older Suburban.)  It was very late and we were all very tired.  My brother and his girlfriend were laying down in the back seat talking to each other.  My long time friend was driving and I was in the passenger seat.  My friend and I were talking about the events of the day trying to pass the time.  We were heading south from Gillette on our way to Lusk.  I was looking out the passenger window at the horizon (this would be towards the west) enjoying the dark almost uncanny calmness of the night sky, when on the horizon, (I would assume a couple miles away, there are lots of hills and momentary turns) I saw what I thought was the spotlight on the front of a locomotive on the horizon.  I didn&#39;t think much of it until within seconds, it became brighter and instantly was within 100 feet of our moving vehicle.  It shot from the west to the east, moving through our headlight beams, and this part is very hard to describe; it was like a spinning disc (?) with multiple colored lights (red, blue, green) and when it crossed in front of us it seemed to bounce(?) and flip over (it was a horizontal spinning disc(?) coming from the west until it &#34;bounced&#34; in front of us; it &#34;bounced&#34; vertically on it&#39;s side flipping over to the other side, and continued spinning to the east over the horizon.  This all happened in seconds, but it truly felt like we were in slow motion.  My friend who was driving and I immediately looked at each other and said, &#34;No ((deleted)) way!&#34;  My brother an his girlfriend started to freak out, (they had only looked up after it had crossed us and we had passed it because the lights were so brig! ht it lit up the entire cab of the vehicle.) they were able to! see it shoot over the eastern horizon.  We had to stop and pull over, it was very weird, it felt like SOMETHING had happened.  But all that we knew was we just saw something VERY weird.  It almost felt like I had been running a long distance. I was out of breath and shaking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped got out of the vehicle and smoked a cigarette, all the while my brothers&#39; girlfriend wouldn&#39;t get out of the car and was crying.  We were all in a daze wondering what ((deleted)) was that?  My brothers&#39; girlfriend was telling us to get in the vehicle and get going, we were still all so dumb-stuck that I really didn&#39;t know quite what had happened.  We got back into the vehicle and continued on down the road, all of us not talking much and my brothers&#39; girlfriend sobbing in the back seat.  When we finally reached our destination, we were almost 2 hours behind schedule.  No one really said much, or thought much about it other than &#34;what a weird night&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never said much about it, until a few weeks ago I was at my brothers&#39; house, and we were talking about weird stuff and this came up.  The weirdest part of the whole situation was that we had a &#34;lost time&#34; incident.  And I don&#39;t know, but there&#39;s this part of me that says something happened.  I was never into the esoteric or paranormal until after this experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I have been an avid C2C AM listener and always heard the UFO guy say that it doesn&#39;t matter how old the sighting was, they wanted it recorded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, that&#39;s my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I recall everyone gathered above the top of the Edmonds Library for a quick break and re-assignment when one of us spotted 3 flashing lights in the sky above Puget Sound.  All of us stopped talking and were in shock to notice these circular white and red lights make triangle formations in the sky.  They appeared to be playing and chased each other at rapid and then slow speeds to re-group.  At one point, they disappeared into the night sky and then came back to spin/zip around.  Eventually, a 4th one came down and then they disappeared by fading so high into the sky we could no longer see them after 15min or so.  Some of the teens cried and went home.  The police officer who was there literally got teary-eyed from fear and asked that we not ever speak of what we witnesse! d that night because he promised to deny it, and advised people to leave.  I was an adult and we were all police explorers doing a security detail for the community artists and vendors.  Some of us still speak of that night, but we know people who weren&#39;t there think we&#39;re nuts and all made it up... I wish I could say it was make believe, but it wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The bases we had to patrol were spread out and it was common to drive many miles of fields and farms between housing areas. I was driving from one housing area to another on midnights in an isolated area. I saw a light headed straight for the ground at a high rate of speed. Even though it was moving too fast and was far away I believed it was a helicopter or plane crashing. I was at an aviation base and had recently had a helicopter go down. I came to a stop in the middle of the road hoping it wasn&#39;t going to be a crash. The object did a 90 turn and shot back out and disappeared in a matter of seconds. Upon reflection later I realized the speed had been too fast for a crashing plane or helicopter. The sharpness of the turn and speed is what really confused me. I can not say for sure what this was. I was at an aviation base and was familiar with many type of aircraft but this not anything I had seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At first I thought that it was a plane, but it came closer and the lights weren&#39;t right for a plane. Then I thought it was a helicopter, because of the bright light, but I thought to myself, why would a helicopter be flying in the middle of the night over open forest land.  I then noticed the light got brighter and there wasn&#39;t any sound. When my flight or fight response kicked in it was really bright and I drove as fast as I could home and ran into the house as fast as I could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will ask the witness to attempt to reconstruct the exact date.

Me and my sis hollered at my brother to come see the UFO. We opened the sliding glass door to the right to go out to listen.  There was no sound.  The object was right above our trees in the front yard.  We expect the object was very close to the size of a football field. It slowly moved away revealing it was a disc shaped UFO with a line of lights around the whole ship. I would guess it was moving about 1-5 mph.  Our parents were sleeping at the time by the time we woke them it was so far away it could have been a airplane to them.  But for me and my siblings it was the closest encounter we have ever had.  I will always look to the sky...hoping this time i have a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: This happened sometime in the summer of 96.

Well about a half hour went by and I saw a sight that reminded me of a A-Bomb explosion in space, just above the SouthWestern horizon. &#34;Look at that did you see that?&#34; I said to my friends , some of them said yes , the others said that they caught a glimpse of something .Well thinking that was it for the strangeness that the night would bring we started playing tag again , well me and Mark were on the western side of the green tank when Regis yelled for us to look * well we looked towards his voice , he was on the eastern side of the tank along with everyone else except me and Mark , we looked up and the heat lightning like light had returned in the eastern sky ,we ran as fast as we could to the others as the light continued to flash , as the light flashed in the eastern sky, we looked to the west and saw another explosive time of light like a A-Bomb, as the night continued the events diminished and we went to sleep scared  about what was going on but before went went to sleep all we could talk about was the events that had occured . I realize that there&#39;s not much to work with as far a solid proof but i think its important enough event to report to you anyway even after a year , thank you.<n>

This phenomenon did not only happen once but twice in a one week interval and both have witnesses. It has been 8years and the memories are still very vivid and unfortunately I am the only witness to publish this material - I do not currently live in the Philippines anymore and the whereabouts of the other witnesses is not of my knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started in a humid summer night in Cebu,Philippines in Mandaue. As usual, me and my mates(we were of varying ages: 17,16 to 10) hang out in my friend&#39;s topless jeep and share jokes or whatever. Suddenly at around 8PM, my friend alerted us to a red light up in the sky moving(right to left) from east to west, and we(about 8 of us) spotted the single red light and unexpectedly another red light popped out in the east following the first and another until it completed into four red lights trailing each other that moved quite fast from east to westward manner. The distance between these four red lights were very uniform in a straight line(east to west) and suddenly all four halted in mid air(12o&#39;clock in front of us, about 50degrees above our sky view, their height might be around a normal cloud height). After halting, the four red lights &#34;waited&#34; for a few seconds and the fourth red light(from the right) moved clockwise around the other remaining 3 and climbed up to sky about 10o&#39;clock position above the remaining 3 and is about a few miles up the sky(estimated) and stayed there - while the fourth red light was manouvering, the second red light moved counterclockwise around the remaining 2 and moved slowly to the east and &#34;played&#34; around in the sky(easterly) for a few minutes and decided to go &#34;high speed&#34; up the sky into nowhere like the ones you see on starwars. The first red light(from the left) while the fourth and the second red lights were manouvering, just went &#34;high speed&#34; up the sky into nowhere, again. The third red light(which was the brightest of all 3) remained still without any &#34;visible&#34; movement. The fourth red light remained in its position until it was covered with clouds. All this happened in about 30minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment, there were 2 adult witnesses which makes it 10, and I called my parents and saw it in disbelief and concluded that it was just a &#34;satellite&#34; - I said to them, &#34;Doing those ridiculous moves, no way&#34; I know how satellites move, I have observed them very well, but not this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third light remained until 9:30PM and did that &#34;high speed&#34; thingy up into nowhere. These red lights were quite bright and vivid up, like LED(light emitting diodes) up in the sky, but not so bright or so intense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that incident, the following week, which was Wednesday(I could still remember) at 8PM as well, me and a friend of mine were having a chat at the back of a pick up truck. I innocently gazed into the patchy cloudy night sky and thought of nothing and the second time I gazed on the exact position I gazed before, there, the intense third red light(which I recognized) was there along with the passing clouds, as if looking at me. I called upon my other friends(about 3) and saw it too. We were excited and both fearing why it showed up again as if it&#39;s intention was only meant for us - I could feel it. A passing cloud covered the red light and by the time the cloud was gone(about 10 seconds past) the red light was in no sight. That was the last of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We speculated the possibilities of what the red lights might be, and a lot of them have been junked: 1. not an airplane, surely it wasn&#39;t, not even helicopters(no noise) and moves too fast &#34;upwards&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. not a kite with a very bright red lamp, why: a. the intervals of all four were seemingly uniform moving from left to right, east to west, not to mention how it stopped abruptly in mid air like there is a pause button somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> b. the level of brightness in that height would require a huge battery and a reasonably huge lamp, as big as a car&#39;s red lamp, which require at least a 6volt(very heavy battery) - not even a 3metre kite can carry it. An LED can&#39;t produce that level of brightness at that distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> c. a kite in a night sky is not very steady, wind pressure is weak. These red lights were as still as you can imagine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. not a satellite, too bright, and the movements are very complex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, I only wished I had caught it in video with a steady tripod, it would had astonished the whole world who owns a TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I might email a sketch of how it moved in the sky and its arrangegments.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We took off from a campsite named Horseshoe Ben (if I remember correctly) to the nearest town. My father was driving at the time, and I was looking around while my brother was falling asleep. To my left, as we came up around a hillside I looked up in time to see what looked like to be a shiney, metallic, almost like liquid metal . It seemed to rise quickly off (on top of the hill side)the ground as soon as we came in front of it. Dust flew into the air for a quick second until it settled revealing the object (5-10 ft of the ground). And then it quickly shot off into the sky kinda like the speed warp thing off Star Trek. My father saw it from the corner of his eye and asked if I saw it, and I replied with a yes. As soon as we got back to our campground where my mother awaited, she wondered what took so long. We told her we were only gone for no more than half an hour to an hour, and she claimed that we were gone for 3 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

The sun would have also been in the sky although it was a dull morning). It was a cloudy morning and i would guess the cloud bank to be at 1500-2000 feet. The object was copper coloured and had what appeared to be lines on the underside(?) which formed a thick cross-similar to the nazi iron cross design-there was also a set of lines which went around the outer edge of this thing. This disc also travelled on its rim and climbed into the sky like a wheel. It was not hovering but moving steadily on its rim. I believe i was looking at the underside of the craft and do not know if there was mass or bulk (cabin or infrastructure) on the side i could not see. It was the size of a penny-a canadian or american one cent. i watched it until my head was almost on the dash board trying to see where it was going. Eventually it moved into the cloud bank and out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this is a diagram to the best of my memory. The disc was the size of a small coin and the same colour as a one cent piece.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://i27.tinypic.com/ehhso1.gif<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I parked in the Naval Academy stadium around 0300-0400 Hrs. I noticed a round light approching from a northwest direction heading southeast from my location.  The light was changing colors (green,blue,red). I exited my vehicle to get a better look. I heard no sounds. I shined my cars alley light toward the object but saw nothing more than the glowing circle.  The object continued untill i lost site over the chesapeake bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was listening to Art Bells coast to coast at the time and heard someone call in reporting the same object over Delaware about 20 mins later.  Never told anyone oter than my wife but it has always baffled me as to what it was.<n>

A USAF Jet circled the area in search of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was relaxing in my parents spa.  About ten minutes had past and I got a strange feeling that I was being watched.  I opened my eyes and stared up into the sky.  I noticed a silver greyish ball in the sky just hovering, approx 2 football fields high. I thought it was the damnest thing.  Being a person with a rational mind I ran inside and told my wife, and mother to come see. I realized that a multiple sighting would have more weight than a single eye witness account. They rushed outside and I had them look in the area of the object.  I was actually suprised it was still there 3 min must have passed since I first saw it.  &#34;I thought it could be a weather balloon&#34; My mother has poor eyesight and can not see even with the help of her glasses.  My wife could not see it until it emitted a orange glow from underneath that lasted about 1.5 sec.  That helped her focus in on the object.  Shortly after it emitted a blue orange glow underneath and went up out of the atmosphere. Out of site. No sound was heard during the whole event and it was quite windy.  The object never diviated from it&#39;s local position, was not affected by the wind.  At that point I desided it wasn&#39;t a weather balloon I continued to scan the sky about 1 minute after the object left the atmosphere a military jet flew into the area where the object was and circled as if searching for something then it left. Usually jets don&#39;t fly in our area that low.  I then called the local MUFON group and and told them what I saw.  They blew me off. I was 24 years of age at the time and personally didn&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s at that time.  Several days after the incident I had seen some strange lights in the sky, green shooting comets on a horizontal plane with the earth. I am a member of the US Reserves.  My reasons for reporting this is to have a documented report of this incident, I feel it is worth mentioning.<n>

We live out of the city, in a more rural, mountainous area.  The overseas flights from Bangor International Airport fly overhead and from my home we see/hear them passing above daily.  My first thought was that this was a late, redeye flight but the plane moved too quickly across the sky. I was about 1+ mile from the Hatcase Pond Road (formerly the South Road).  As I ascended the crest of a steep hill in the road this plane went zooming overhead.  I sped the car up trying to see out the front and passenger window in the direction that it was heading and I didn&#39;t see anything.  I then drove faster to the next field/clearing on the right (about a quarter to .5 miles further)to see it and instead of being far away it was slowly flying over the field.  This scared me so I drove faster towards home, still looking to the right above the tree line and was shocked to see that the UFO was hovering above the clearing at the end of the South Road (another .5 mile or so away).  I slammed on the brakes and was mesmerized by the shape and lights.  I could see it completely as I leaned over the passenger seat of my car and looked out the window.  It was triangular shaped and appeared black against the night sky except for blue circular lights which seemed to line the edge of the ship.  After probably only 30 seconds to a minute, I sped the car up,driving at breakneck speed to get home.  I did not see the UFO again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Quickly scanning the sky with my binoculars, I found three other identical objects.  The objects, which appeared as two black spheres one over the top of the other and connected by a thin short rod (simillar to a barbell stood on end), had no wings or rotors but still hovered in place. These objects were high enough in the sky that they could not be seen without binoculars.  After watching the objects for about 20 minutes, I tried shifting position in order to steady my binoculars and get a better look at the objects.  This took maybe five seconds, but when I looked for the objects from my new position, all four of them had disappeared and could not be found again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The sky was a  bit hazy and the objects were darker than the background. They seemed quite large, maybe 50-60ft across, and hovered about 200ft up in the air. They had no other dicernable features, did not make any noise, and they were side by side (about 30ft between them and maintained that distance.I called out to my friend to come and look. She and her daughter came to see them aswell.I then ran into my house to get my son who just had time to see them before they took off at incredible speed and strait up, away from the earth. As they got higher they got closer together before becoming pinpoints of light in the night sky.I thought they may be stealth bombers but questioned this when I saw how fast they took , they seemed to defy gravity.<n>

(Apache County is very close to the New Mexico border).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three other people were staying at my rural home near Concho.  I arrived home at about 10 in the evening (the joys of self-employment) and as usual, the three of us sat at the kitchen table, catching up on our respective days.  One of my guests, who faced the window, exclaimed &#34;Holy *fill-in-the-blank*! Did you see that!&#34;  He and one other, a woman, had seen a UFO streak by, apparently crashing.  They said there was fire in the object&#39;s wake.  I thought at first that they were talking about the comet, but they insisted that it was a craft of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We jumped in my Suzuki (resembling a white jeep), with me at the helm, still wearing high heels and skirt, and raced off in search of the crashed object.  We crossed State Highway 61 for a wild ride along an old cattle trail.  At the highway, an elderly couple had parked their white travel van and were standing at the highway, staring off into the field.  They asked if we had seen the UFO crash and I told them that we were going to try to find the crash site.  They had been driving westerly along Highway 61 toward Show Low when they saw the object streak by and appear to crash, and also described the &#34;fire tail&#34; that my guests had reported.  They were very exicted about this, and if I had more room in the jeep, I think they would have come with.  They pointed to us where they thought the object crashed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This area has few trees -- some scattered cedar and junipers -- and a lot of rock and canyons.  I drove about 30-40 miles an hour down the cattle trail and across the rocky fields.  Periodically, we would slow down so that my passengers could move rocks out of the way.  Driving through these conditions at that speed, with the greenish glow of the comet overhead, was both nerve-wracking and surrealistic.  I was quite concerned that I&#39;d roll the Suzuki and kill all of us, but the two who had seen the crash insisted that we keep going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about an hour of this, we arrived at a very deep canyon and could drive no further.  Deep in this canyon (approximately half a mile down, at the bottom) was the crashed UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an oblong, egg-shape.  The color was strange -- it was the color of a caucasion&#39;s skin with a fading tan, and it faintly glowed. The glow was sufficient enough to illuminate the bottom of the canyon. There were two &#34;pillars&#39; for lack of a better word at the &#34;front&#34; of this object (I call it the front because that was the portion that was visible to us).  These pillars may have been posted on either side of a door -- although a doorway was not visible.  It was about the size of a barn typically seen on a small dairy farm in the midwest.  Oddly, there was a helicopter down there and a black pickup truck.  We were baffled how that truck could have gotten down the remote canyon so quickly, unless there was some road that we did not know about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In any event, we watched this for awhile and then left. By this time, I had put in a 16 hour work day, hadn&#39;t eaten and was simply exhausted.  Nothing seemed to be happening; we did not see any people or any activity. Unfortunately, in our haste to find the crash site, we failed to bring a camera along.  We were so far out in rough country that we got lost and it took approximately 3 hours to get back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, I went to a local meeting about UFO sightings and sat next to an amiable woman who turned out to be the editor of a magazine that used to circulate here called &#34;White Mountain Sightings.&#34;  We engaged in small talk while waiting for the meeting to start.  She told me she was desperately trying to find a woman who drove a white jeep, who chased after a UFO a few weeks earlier.  I told her that would be me, and gave her the same story I just reported here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The elderly couple we had seen at the highway had filed a report with this editor.  If this is something worth more information or follow-up, I can try to locate the witnesses and the magazine editor.  Most everyone has moved from this area, but I believe that this report can be verified.  The witnesses would include the three guests at my home, the elderly couple, and myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first UFO I have seen, and I&#39;ve seen quite a few odd things in Apache County.  However, it is the only crash that I have seen and this is the only sighting in which I have had other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have sent an e-message to the witness, requesting more information on this case.

They all looked at me. I closed my eyes and was ready to be attacked. At first I thought someone had broken in and was going to hurt me. I opened my eyes again and saw them again moving around. At the time I did not think it really happened. I knew it was real but I thought that would make me crazy to admit that it was possible. I started to hear that other people have had similar experiences. I have also heard theories of aliens being able to travel in dimensional spaces unnown by our modern science. Giving them the ability to come and go at the blink of an eye. I had one other experience that was around the same time but I can&#39;t remember its been so long. My cousin and I were outside of the house where I saw the beings by my bed. We were there and saw lights in the sky just over the woods. It looked like lights you see on the side of a semi truck at first but there is no road close to that area of the woods and the lights were in the air close to the tree tops which means the lights were levitating. We both saw it. Him first then me. We both ran inside to get away because it was so strange and weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The only sound I could make out was a tinkling sound or subdued multiplexed pinging sound.

As I continued observing they began playing what looked like a game of chicken.  They were moving horizontally, in a south to north motion, changing places if you get my meaning, about 4 to 5 points above the oceans horizon.  From this action it turned into an infinity shape game of chase.  I called out the other person from the bridge.  We stared for another minute or so, duty calling, we ran into the bridge, I returned with a video camera, not more than two minutes.  The objects were no longer visible.  We spoke of it at breakfast and it was dismissed as the heat from the exhaust stacks bending the light.  The only problem with that theory is I walked to the rear of the exhaust outlets to observe the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There was about five of us in a small children&#39;s pool in her backyard. I remember the time of night because at 20:00 my dad would always call us in for dinner, and maybe 30 minutes later would actually come out and get us. We were in the water and I heard my dad call us, but we continued playing anyway. I got out from under a pan we were playing with when I looked up towards the sky. When I looked up I saw a white light that was moving slowly from the right side of the sky. I continued watching it trying to figure out what it was because it was only one light, which I knew wasn&#39;t a plane, and it was also moving faster than a satellite would be plus it was much brighter. While I was watching this object I noticed that it had stopped moving almost as if it realized I was watching it. While this object was motionless I decided to get one of the others to look at the sky to see if they saw it as well. When I finally got them to look at the sky the object then did a zig-zag pattern kind of in up and outward way like what would happen  in a generated image, but as it was doing this pattern it was leaving behind a trail of light behind it. When the light was completely faded is when my dad showed up. I have only told two other people of this incident, the first being my dad who has since passed, and the other told me to report it to this site even though it had occurred many years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The lights were there for roughly 20 min when fighter jets came from the southwest and the lights moved away in remarkable speed. As the jets passed by and left the lights came back in the same triangle formation. My wife stated the local news caught footage of this, and did identify them as UFO&#39;s.

It must have been winter, because it seems to me it was dark early.  As I pulled into my driveway in the north of town, I saw a huge &#34;diamond broach&#34; shape in the sky, south-southwest.  It was humungous.  If I had put my hand up, my palm would have just covered it.  It was a triangle, point up, with lights in rows inside the triangle, like diamonds.  I don&#39;t recall how many.  It could have been 6 (1 at the point, 2 in the next row, then 3 on the bottom row), or there was another row, making 10.  It wasn&#39;t moving and didn&#39;t make a sound.  I could see lights from helicopters and small planes heading towards it from every direction.  I jumped out of the car to see it better, but my kids freaked.  They ran to the house, begging me to open the door and come in.  They didn&#39;t want it to come get us.  My kids were very young at the time, the oldest about 7, the youngest at the time 4.  I don&#39;t know why they thought this thing would take us away, and I wasn&#39;t showing fear, but rather fascination, so I&#39;m not sure whey they reacted with such terror.  For them I went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night, or possibly the next night, I chatted with someone on Prodigy (remember that!?) who claimed to work out at the airport in Eugene (the airport was north of the object, behind me while I was watching the triangle).  She said there was some sort of sighting, a report made even, and no official announcement of what it was, but supposedly it was noticed by the airport, or perhaps reported by them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I can&#39;t be sure of the date, but it must have been Fall or winter of 1996, or perhaps late winter of 1997, although I don&#39;t remember it being cold, just dark early. It could even have been the year before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Or which i thought was a star, maybe Venus. Anyways i was talking to my friends 2 adults and a thier daughter. We were going to K mart in Medford to get their daughters Brownie outfits. We were about 4 miles from downtown Medford and i noticed the light was extremely close and much larger. like a headlight( very bright) it was moving as fast as we were it was maybe a mile away from us. Parallel to the highway. When we reached the part of the highway parallel to the Airport it stopped above the Airport maybe 2 miles up and extremly bright. I was changing the radio stations to see if anyone had reported it. When we pulled into the Parking lot to K mart we watched it hover for 45 min. No noise. We didnt notice but across the street from Kmart many transformers had blown before we got to Kmart. the power was on at Kmart so we didnt notice til we saw many Police looking around. I crossed the street and approached an officer and said I know what caused this power outage. I pointed at the bright light hovering and he looked up, but at his angle he couldnt see it because of a roof top, he told me to get lost. the light slowly moved across town and fog set in. we watched it for 20 more min then we decided to leave. I heard of no reports on this incident, I cant remember the date or month but im sure it would be easy to find out the day the transfomers blew on the summer evening in Medford 1996. Thankyou<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Approximate date.  PD))<n>

I saw a silver round object moving over the treeline rather slowly.  I called for my wife to come see it, but she was in the bathroom.   It was travelling from a North to South direction.  I was close enough to see it had no &#34;wings&#34; or blinking lights as on an airplane.  I heard no sound. Just saw it move slowly, the it changed to glow a very bright white, and I could not see its silver color anymore. It was coming from left to right and it flashed, and then was out of there.  I could not track it with my eyes. It glowed bright, bright white and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/1/96 14:00|Lakebay|WA|Triangle|3-5 minutes|Two contact incidents of Black, Shiny, Triangular Craft that hovered just above tree line emitting low hum.|4/3/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80695.html|136|ndxe199606| Two contact incidents of Black, Shiny, Triangular Craft that hovered just above tree line emitting low hum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never thought to report this incident as I always assumed that what I saw back in 1996 was just some type of top secret Department of Defense aircraft. But now all these years later I wonder if what I actually saw on that day was man-made or possibly alien.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had come back from our little rural grocery store after spending the day at the lake with my children and a neighbor child. I was driving down the country two lane road in my little Toyota car and was about a block before my property when I noticed a strange object hovering almost tree level above my neighbor’s mobile home which sat on 5 wooded acres of land. The tops of the trees were moving violently like they do in a strong wind storm. I was baffled over what it could be and immediately stopped the car in the middle of the road. I was about 200 feet away and looking up at it through my windowshield. It was large, completely black and triangular in appearance. It hovered completely still over the property, but I detected a strange humming noise coming from its direction. It appeared very flat on the bottom from the angle I was looking at it. I was then stunned to see a huge intense white/light blue beam turn on suddenly pointing directly down on the neighbors home. I can! not give an exact width of this beam because of my distance, but it may have been anywhere between 10 to 20 feet wide. Even with the trees the craft was very visible. It hovered over the neighbors home for about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four children in the car with me were; my 3 year old son in the front passenger seat, along with my 5 year old daughter, 13 year old daughter and 13 year old neighbor girl in the back seats. They wanted to know why I had stopped the car and I pointed at the craft excitedly. They got very excited when they saw it and rolled down the car windows. At this point the craft turned off the beam and slowly turned, like on pivot, until one of the points of the triangle was facing in our direction. At this time it smoothly flew toward us and stopped directly over the car hovering just above the tree line. The kids were hanging out the window very excited asking me what it was. I didn’t know what to tell them and told them to stay in the car and not open the doors. I did not feel any heat or wind from the craft as it hovered above my car, but the tree tops swung wildly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so glossy and black underneath almost like a mirror, but nothing reflected back at it, not the car or trees or road below it. I saw no propellers, engines or helicopter like blades on the craft. The bottom was very smooth and shiny, like glass. The humming noise coming from it, as it hovered above our car, was the lowest note I have ever heard in my life and I am a musician. It felt like it was penetrating every part of my body with its low hum. I felt like my teeth were vibrating inside my head. The hum was very powerful and it caused vibrations, it felt like I was inside a huge amplifier. All the junk that I had on the dashboard, sunglasses, snacks, little toys for the kids etc. started to bounce around from the vibration that the hum was creating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft hovered above us for a couple minutes then it simply pivoted with one of the points of the triangle pointing down the side street , then proceeded in the direction that the triangular point was now facing and then slowly started to pick up speed. When it flew away it moved like it was under water. It is hard to describe this movement, but it went up and down three times in a graceful smooth wavelike motion as it was flying away, kind of like the motion of a large sea creature underwater. The tree tops swayed violently as it passed over them. When it got to the end of the block, it suddenly picked up great speed skirting just above the tree line and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was really excited and a little shocked too at what I had just witnessed, so I drove quickly home which only took about half a minute. My husband was there with some friends rewiring our house and we excitedly told everybody what we had just seen and asked if they had seen the strange craft too. They thought we were joking and no one believed us. I insisted that what I saw was real. Just for my credibility, I do not drink alcohol or a use drugs, so was not hallucinating. I could not make any of the people present at my house believe what I had just seen and was very surprised that none of them had seen the craft either, although they were all inside working at the time. My husband thought I had put the kids up to ‘a little joke’ on Dad about UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fast forward to the very next morning, my husband had gone down to the small town store early around 7am. He came back from the store and woke me up as I was still asleep all excited and saying, “Honey, I saw it too! I completely believe you now!” Apparently, he had just gone down to the store and had to use the payphone, we did not have a cell phone at this time. In the middle of his phone call he heard this very loud sound with a low hum. He noticed that the phone booth, one of those old ones with glass side windows was vibrating. He looked around for the culprit of this annoying noise, because he could not hear the person who he was talking to. He was going to tell this inconsiderate person to please turn off their vehicle so he could complete his phone call. But, there were no other vehicles in the parking lot except his truck which was turned off. That is when he looked up and saw that exact same black, shiny triangular craft hovering above him and the store. He stated ! that he believes it was at least 50 feet from point to point, and possibly as much as 70 feet. He was so shocked to see it, but believes it was longer than the width of our house which is 48 feet. He is a general contractor so is pretty good at judging distances, but of course he joked later that even with his tape measure it would have been inadequate to measure the craft as he was shaking so badly from the shock of seeing it. He saw no engines, propellers or blades either and could not figure out how it could just hover like that completely still. It stayed above him and the store for a minute and then pivoted on its triangular point and flew off over the bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of these incidents happened in broad daylight. For years we believed they were just top secret aircraft from nearby McChord Air Force Base, now we are not so sure, as no one we know has ever seen anything like this before. Anyway that is my story of the day I meet the strange mysterious black, shiny craft. Oh and by the way, it was absolutely beautiful like obsidian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in 1996 is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was facing the North sky, I first noticed a very bright object seemingly very far away that shot across the sky then started hovering in one spot, so I kept my eye on it because I have never seen something move so fast and then just sit in one spot. Watching this I noticed two more moving objects shoot toward the other one and just hang around that one, they abruptly disbursed in different directions, then came back together again, just as that happened I seen four more appear and all rendezvoused together hovering, now a total of seven, the speed of these things were very fast, just like that they all shot in different directions and were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

It moved too quickly to be a conventional jet, and since it had been stationary, accelerated rapidly and then returned to a stop, it defies what I understand about current satellite technology.  The oddest thing about it was that it must have been rather low in orbit since it produced sound similar to that of a jet, but without any sonic booms.  Shortly after its sound passed, a jetliner passed overhead from the opposite direction, and its sound trail was positioned only slightly behind it, whereas with the supersonic object&#39;s sound trail didn&#39;t reach my position until the object had already stopped.

I estimate it was between 3500 and 6000 feet above my home.  It seemed that the trajectory would be coming down in  T of Middleton.  I was thinking at the time that the thing would do great damage to about 1/4 square mile.without a warhead-it was that big. What was really strange was the color-It was the green that comes close to the glowing color of radioactive materials seen in movies.  It looked like a large glowing  Pepsi type can only it was the size of a house.(no sound)  The rear end of it had  something like a twisted tail of what looked like smoke mixed with the green. I watched it until it went where I could not see from inside the house. When I went outside to follow it it was gone.

It performed seemingly random turns 3 or 4 more times before finally moving away beyond our sight. It appeared to move slowly but, using the roof of the house as one reference point and the treeline opposite as another, which were around 30 meteres apart, dependant on the height of the object iot crossed this space in about 20 seconds, suggesting a rate of some hundreds of miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I watched and waited for the flashing of the anti collision lights which can be visable up to 15 klms and no flashing I then watched as the lights eventually faded from sight and waited to hear jet noise but nothing.

It was a very clear beautiful night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was fishing on a boat with a friend of mine, ((name deleted)). It was getting late and we decided to call it a night , as we approached the boat dock we noticed a glowing amber colored light/object hovering over an overpass next to the dock. We were approx 150’ from the overpass and the object was approx 40’ above the overpass. This light/object bobbed up and down and side to side as if it was floating on an invisible ocean. We looked at each other and said &#34;what the hell is that?&#34; I immediately stopped the boat and we watched it for a few seconds; it then instantly shoot upwards   It appeared to have gone to the edge of the atmosphere. It moved so fast that it left &#34;trails&#34; from the point it was at to the point above us where it stopped. At this time it appeared as a very bright amber colored star. As we continued to watch it for a few seconds we noticed a red ring of light start to appear/pulsate around it. The red &#34;ring&#34; first started out dim and as it pulsated it got brighter. At the point of it’s brightest moment the amber object &#34;disappeared&#34; into the ring. As soon as it went &#34;into&#34; the ring the ring shrunk and dissipated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The amber light looked slightly &#34;fuzzy&#34; as if it was dissipating heat from it, like the ripple affect you see from a hot road or hot car hood on a hot summer day. It did look like an object radiating light rather than just a light in the sky. It appeared to have &#34;substance&#34; to it. We did not hear any noise coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was taking my wife home (she was then my girlfriend) down Airport Rd in Longmont. We were heading south and the event happened north of the airport. Back then, Airport Rd was a small, thin two lane road lined with telephone poles. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a long orange glowing object suddenly passing the other direction in the other lane between my car and the telephone poles that were lined up right against the lane going the other direction. The object was floating (traveling, but in the air) about the height of my car window. It was long and continuous, like a floating train passing in the other lane, but with no breaks (no &#34;train cars&#34;). Couldn&#39;t have been a plane because there was no noise, it was long (took several seconds to pass - several), and a plane would have clipped its wings on either my car or the telephone poles lining the other side of the street. As mentioned, it was simi! lar to a train, but probably not as tall - maybe half the height. I never did take a direct look at it - was driving and got nervous - kept my eyes forward. Did not see it coming - it just all of a sudden was passing in the other direction on the side of us. The vehicle behind us (only other vehicle on the back then quiet road) began flashing its lights at us and honking as soon as the object passed (I remember what the vehicle was - but don&#39;t want to say in case anyone ever says it was them, so they can tell me what they were driving to prove it was them).  The object itself was nowhere to be seen.  I didn&#39;t stop for the other vehicle - I floored it instead - wish I would have stopped to talk with the other vehicle about what we had seen.  My wife usually denies this ever happened in front of other people - only confesses to me sometimes about what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At first i figured it was just a plane high in the sky, but then realized that it wasn&#39;t traveling in a straight line nor moving at one speed.  Plus it had no sound.  The object would move down, then stop and hold its position.  it did this a few times until it made it down to i&#39;d say about 500ft. and about 1 mile from me.  It then hovered up and down in a line for a few minutes, before lowering behind tall trees out of my view.  As it got closer to me i noticed that it had 5 lights.  3 bright whites in a triangle and 2 dim colored lights on the top and bottom.  It was a long time ago but i remember it well.  I&#39;ve always wondered if anyone else had seen this object.  Thats what compelled me to report this old sighting.  you never know.  I do have another witness to prove i&#39;m not crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was a large delta shaped craft which emited a low pulsating hum, it hovered at what apeared to be at the bottom of the hill where I live before it drifted lazily behind a large tree and was lost to view due to a further squall. B ecause of the weather conditions at the time and the fast decending twighlight it was hard to judge the size of the object but I would guess it was at least 20m in width at its base. I also couldnt see any of the crafts fuselage only three flickering bright white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness remains anonymous.  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
