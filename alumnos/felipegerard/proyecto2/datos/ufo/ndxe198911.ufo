I was surprized when my father was calling us outside from the front porch saying: &#34;Do you want to see a UFO?&#34;  I then rushed outside after my sister and mother onto the porch to see several orange-white balls of light approximately 40o above the horizon, in the north-west sky.  From our vantage point, they were about the size of 1/4 the size of a dime held at arm&#39;s length. Some increased in brightness, then decreased or went out, and right next to it another ball of light appeared.  We&#39;re not sure how many there were,  because they appeared to hopscotch each other vertically to the left and right, we saw perhaps 5 or 6 as they were appearing, disappearing and lighting.<n>

I like to watch the sky when riding in the car.....There is a Constellation, that I don&#39;t know what is called,  but it looks like an arrow or an arrow head or a triangle with 3 stars that come off the bottom.     Anyway, I got to noticing that the stars(?) between the three main points of the triangle were flying off and disappearing and then coming back and getting back where they were to beging with..... We watched this all the way home and then went out to our tiny little airport and continued to watch it out there.     I sure would have liked to have had a video camera because this would have been easy to film.     We have no idea how long this continued to go on because we finally went home.     We decided that it was more than likely some kind of Military stuff.     Did anyone else report this oddity.     Every time I see the triangle in the sky I can&#39;t help,  but to watch it for a while to see if it is going to happen again and that has been many years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

Revelations of my UFO sighting have always been met with ridicule by the family and friends I’ve shared it with. The only reason I’m writing this now is because an “open-minded “ friend who I shared my experience with happens to listen to a “coast to coast” on the radio and seemed to hear specifically about sightings of the same type in the same location and time as mine. I admit my recollections of details are a little fuzzy but many memories are clear as day. Here goes: I was a student at UW-Madison in the late 80’s &amp; early 90’s and was coming home for Thanksgiving vacation to be with my family. I caught a ride with my cousin who also lived in Madison and liked to take the “back roads” home to look at all the Christmas lights in the small towns. I recall that we were heading  west on a country highway at night when my cousin pointed out some odd lights far in the distance. I agreed they looked strange and we continued to watch the progress of these lights. As it happens our course turned in a North –South direction and it was clear that the lights were getting closer and if it continued on the same course it’s path would lead it right over us. I told my cousin to pull over to the side of the highway so we could get a better look. Insanely, I recall opening the front passenger window and sticking my head out to look up and was mesmerized by what I saw. What I recall seeing  was  “layers of lights” moving slowly over our vehicle at a low altitude. What struck me most was that  this large form was “silent.” As the UFO moved over our car I pulled my head back in the vehicle and said to my cousin excitedly , “you have got to see this!” When I looked back out the window seconds later – it had vanished. My question to myself was – “what on earth can be that large, airborne, silent and disappear without a trace?” In my opinion this was no weather balloon! I’ve lived quietly with this experience in my memory and only wish I’d reported it sooner to a reputable source such as yourself. My interested friend said that he knows someone in law enforcement that witnessed something similar in the same time frame and location as myself. He said that he may be able to get  “audio” from the police car as it followed a strange UFO. I am wondering if in your database anyone has had a similar experience. I would be very interested to know more if such is the case.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We both saw a black triangular shaped aircraft to the south of us by several miles.  I think we had a side view of it because it absolutely had a front end that came to a definitive point and more mass toward the rear where it was thicker.  It was hard to gauge it&#39;s size at that distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object began its path below where we could see because of a berm built up on the side of the highway so we couldn&#39;t tell if it started on the ground or not.  It shot up in a perfectly straight line at about a 45 degree angle from behind the berm.  It moved at incredible speed until it got up a couple thousand feet and then just stopped dead in place below some low level clouds.  It rotated in place so the front end was pointing straight up, and then shot up through the clouds at the same incredible velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m very knowledgeable about military aircraft, and this was not only moving with &#34;linear&#34; speed (unlike aircraft with throttle) that far exceed conventional aircraft, it stopped in place so abruptly that any pilot would have been killed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

My wife, brother in law, and myself were playing golf at the city course on the south side of Tallahassee, Jake Gaither Golf course.  We teed off in late morning, and were on the 5th hole, a par 3,  around noontime.  Weather was perfect, clear blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While waiting to tee off, I noticed a USAIR turboprop flying south along the east edge of the golf course at maybe 1500 ft. altitude.  The plane was approx.  a mile away. It was heading towards Tallahassee regional airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that it was starting to make a right hand turn for final approach and it was going to collide with a flock of birds that was also flying south.  I watched for a few seconds and as my eyes changed focus from the plane to the birds<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then realized that the flock of birds was not a flock of birds but rather several small grey spheres flying in formation heading south but at a slightly higher altitude than the! plane, or maybe a little farther east of the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane made its turn and the spheres continued south.  I yelled to my wife and brother in law to look but they could not locate them before they passed behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire event lasted about 5-10 seconds.<n>

It was completely silent.  We counted seven (7) circular white lights on the underside.  The triangle craft was moving at a high rate of speed, surrounded by a white haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights on the underside were NOT flashing or pulsating.  The craft was darker than the night sky.  It appeared to be heading from east to southwest from the ocean, i.e. from Fort Lauderdale area towards the Everglades.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The altitude appeared to be no more than one mile.  What impressed us both was the speed, shape, lights, haze, and silence of this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was observed from our rear yard at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END TEXT OF WRITTEN REPORT))  ((ADDENDUM FROM LETTER, WRITTEN BY WITNESS))  ..Prior to contacting you, I watched the Peter Jennings Special on television and your Reporting Center was shown.  My reason for calling was to learn if others had observed the craft similar to the one my wife and I observed in 1989.  I have agreed to submit the sighting forms, as you suggested, and I would appreciate a telephone response as promised.  After all these years, I really desire an answer as to the question of were we the only persons to observe this type of unidentified craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening in 1989 (month not remembered), my wife and I were sitting in our open back yard patio hoping to observe the fire trail of a launching at Cape Kennedy, which could be visible unobstructed, as we reside on a lake.  For reasons unknown, we did not see the flame tail and were returning to the house.  Suddenly, my wife became very excited and pointed towards the Eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approaching us east to west from the ocean/Fort Lauderdale area, was a strange flying vehicle.  It was moving very quickly at a low altitude and turning southwest directly towards our home.  We both observed a very large triangle, or arrowhead shaped craft, surrounded by a haze at approximately 3/4, or a mile, altitude.  As it passed above us, it made no sound.  It was completely silent.  Clearly visible were circular white lights, seven in number, on the underside, beginning at the nose, and evenly spaced towards the rear.  It disappeared from view, going towards the Everglades.  I build model aircraft as a hobby, and this vehicle was not shaped like anything I have ever seen, including the stealth F-117, or the B2 Bomber.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I mentioned this incident to several of our friends and neighbors immediately; however, they expressed no interest.  We did not contact any official agency for obvious reasons.  I hope that this information will be useful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please keep our identities confidential, as my former work in Law enforcement raised certain hostilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would appreciate a short collect telephone response.  I now have great interest in determining whether my wife and I were the only persons that observed this triangle type of UFO.  Thank you in advance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END CORRESPONDENCE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with the source of this report on several occasions, and he appears to us to be an exceptionally qualified observer.  He served as a senior law enforcement officer in several positions over the course of several decades.  He writes that neither he, nor his wife, is a UFO &#34;buff,&#34; although he enjoys watching television programs on the subject.  The party who submitted the report, we suspect, is an exceptionally good witness, and exceptionally reliable.

I was on the side of the hill which is filled with houses all the way to the top and around. Before the craft came howering over the houses I called my family who were in my sister-in-law&#39;s home; by the time they all gathered to see, the craft had dipped a little below the houses in top of the hill (who is aproximately 500 ft. high). The craft made a turn at a very slow speed and went towards the left (west) parrallel to the hill. My wife, sister-in-law, and my two kids saw it perfectly well in front of us at a height of about 300 ft. It didn&#39;t make any noise, and I perfectly saw the three rays of lignts on the bottom of the craft inside this round hole on the center of the bottom. The craft looked identical to saucers that have been drawn or fotografed before.  It was night but we could clearly see its dome shape siluate and bottom because of the light of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My kids noticed many blue colored windows. There were neighbors on the other side of the street in front who were talking together in a circle who didn&#39;t noticed it even though it went by very slowly until it disapeared behind the same hill over the houses not far from our house. Many sightings were seen by many people even during the day months around this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I saw immense, pulsing lights of varied colors slowing passing above the clouds.  Could not make out a shape but object was at least 2 or 3 footballs fields in size.  It moved very slowly from east to west by southwest.  After several minutes, I saw and heard two fighter jets roar past in same direction.  This pattern was repeated on at least 2 or 3 other nights sometime between 11pm and 2am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened sometime in November in Moca, Puerto Rico.  I came up from New York on vacation and was staying with an uncle on route 110, close to the town square.  It was cloudy and happened between 11pm and 2am.  I would see bright, colored lights pulsing above the clouds.  The object(s) moved in a west to southwest direction.  It moved very slowly.  I was facing south and saw the lights from the east as they passed overhead to west.  It took about 30 -60 seconds for it to pass and seemed immense because the different colors would pulse sporadically over a wide area as it moved west.  Several minutes afterward, 2 fighter jets would roar by in the same direction.  This went on for 2 or 3 nights.  I found out that this had been documented in November of 1997.  A friend lent me a book about sightings in Puerto Rico.  In there, to my relief, I saw a reference to the sightings.  It helped to reaffirm what I saw.  The book is in spanish but I don&#39;t know the name of it.  This is the second incident that I have submitted and will be submitting others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Date is approximate.))<n>
11/15/89 23:00|Wolf Creek drainage (N of Hwy. 26)|OR|Sphere|30 min|We both saw a spherical glowing flying object come out of the west, head for Portland and get chased back by three fighter aircraft.|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84992.html|11|ndxe198911| We both saw a spherical glowing flying object come out of the west, head for Portland and get chased back by three fighter aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were on our way to our elk hunting camp when we stopped along the dirt road to take a break.  We were stopped along the edge of a Forest Service road near the top of Wolf creek drainage north of Highway 26. We stopped the motor of the pickup and stepped outside.  The night was very clear and quiet and we began to talk about being able to see satellites as they were passing overhead. We also noticed that we were high enough that we could see the glow from the Portland, Ore area to our SE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were looking for more satilites we both noticed a bright glow in the west that we thought was a distant planet.  The object was much brighter than a satilite and as we watched we realized it was moving in our direction from out of the west. This object passed almost directly over our position then turned at about 45 degrees and headed SE in a direct line to Portland. We noticed that the object made no sound that we could hear, glowed in a white light that did not change color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object went directly to the center of what we believed was the glow of Portland lights and disappeared into that glow. As we were commenting to each other about what we had just seen and what it might be, about 15 or 20 minutes went by when we noticed that the bright object was comming out of the Portland glow in about the reverse direction it went in. We also noticed after a minute or so that there was another bright object behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As both objects got closer to our position we realized that the lead bright glow was the flying object or sphere we had initially seen and the second bright object was a USA fighter aircraft chasing the first object. We estimated the distance between the two at about 1/2 mile apart.  The sphere came over us as it did before with the fighter aircraft close behind.  The fighter aircraft had his forward landing lights on and we could clearly see the front part of the fighter aircraft and the pilot.  Both of us having military backgrounds we knew by the sound of the fighter aircraft that he was going as fast as he possibly could but did not gain on the sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With these two together we could esitimate the glowing object or sphere at about 5 to 6 ft in diameter. Again the object did not make any sounds that we could hear or change colors.  The sphere followed the same course it came in on with the fighter aircraft chasing it.  A few minutes later two more fighter aircraft following the same flight path came into our view.  Both flying as fast as they could. The sphere, the initial fighter aircraft and the two fighter aircraft all came over our position, turned about 45 degrees and headed west out of sight and sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we returned from our hunting trip about three days latter we checked all the local papers for any stories of Unidentified flying objects and found none.  My brother called the airbase and received the usual answer &#34; no unusual activity the last 5 days&#34;.   At the time of the incident we both had law enforcement background and training.<n>

This was at dusk. I was inside informing her when reception was clear. She came down off the roof, walked in the back door and told me she just saw a huge UFO. She described the incident to me and to be honest, I dismissed her story as a &#34;mis-identification&#34; of a known aircraft. I&#39;ve always regretted that. Her depiction of the event is as follows: While adjusting the antenna, she looked up and saw a huge kite (diamond?) shaped aircraft, hovering silently, just a few blocks north of our house, near North Star Mall. She said it was about the size of two football fields, the structure appeared black in color and the bottom had numerous white colored lights. It hovered for a few seconds about 600 ft. off the gound then very quickly, shot off to the west and out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From her description, the object was very, very large and I couldn&#39;t understand why we never heard any reports about the event. She can recount this even, in detail, anytime. Let me add that a couple of years later, while driving in San Antonio one evening, we both saw a mysterious craft, traveling slowly, a low altitude, near the intersection of I10 and Loop 410. My wife said, &#34;there it is!&#34; Just like the other one I saw. My reaction again, was sort of like &#34;well, whatever!&#34; I think what we saw was just so bizzare, we had trouble accepting it. Now, years later, I do accept it and would like to know if others witnessed these events, the same time we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I filed another report a few minutes ago of an incident that I experienced in Alpine, TX. In error, I listed another witnesses name(Russ Davis), rather than mine. Sorry, I didn&#39;t think of myself as the witness.

my mate s caravan trailer at the end of the site and the site was located in the country style invironment i mean it was covered with fields and trees and canals so i knew i could get better view because my street had lots of light so it was hard to look up even though u could see the stars it would be better in darker place to see more clearly anyway even though it was late i knocked on his caravan door i remember he s dad saying whos that because i was outside in dark anyway his caravan door opens right up and i say because i know what i can see so i wasnt worried about how late it is even though it must of been beetween nine at night to about ten thirty that was late to me i didnt want to knock but i could still see these things high up faintly, so i thought they would want to see so anyway they look up and i had to show them because the object were hard to see with naked eye but i had no problem an d now me my mate his dad are all outside there caravan looking up from iver towards uxbridge area at what i can describe as looking just like normal stars i mean they were same size, same brighness, just like a star but fainter but there were three or four wen my mum and dad and me saw them first down our street but now because of the darkness and quiest u could look and study them bettter and there was now 8 or nine and they seemed so high up they looked like stars but i knew they was not because they were flying i presume really fast, well faster than any plane because it would take a plane 2mins to turn, at the speeds these objects were moving they could fly inall different directions but these did circle rings aroun each other then u could see couple more apear outa nowhere it was scary because ive never seen object realy high up i mean they were probably on the edje of atmosphere thinking we couldnt see but they kept flying in rings circles and all sorts of flight movement mostly ciculer paterns similer to olypic ring logo shape they were definately not aeroplaines because no flasing light plus u cant have a ! 14 or so plaines do circles and hoops im sure airlines will not alow that where as these object movedand sort like stars but wen u looked closer and studied u think they look like something out of starwars film u know like the fighter spaceships small in size than the big battle ships it looked like those but really far far away im not meaning to be funny there, that just happens to be best descibe my ufo experience when they went in circle or upside loops they did have like tail of what a football would leav behind it u saw someone hit hit fast u see slight fainty effect behind it, all this happened on a winters night of 1989 in berkshire area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

When I was about a mile or so from the local airport I noticed a bright light, brighter than I remember the beacon light to be.  I drove on not paying it much attention, assuming it was the airport beacon.  As I neared the airport, approximately 1/2 mile away, I noticed that there were two lights present.  There was the beacon and there was another, brighter light just behind and to the side of the beacon light.  When I  got to the point where the unidentified light was I was able to determine that it was a UFO.  I pulled to the side of the road and got out and stood by the side of the road looking at the craft.  It was just above the level of the trees, about 60 feet off the ground and it was less than 100 yards away.  I was saucer/ elliptically shaped, with bright white and other colored lights around it and underneath it.  It was making absolutely no sound.  It was about 100-200 feet in diameter.  As I was watching another vehicle drove by on the road which did not stop.  I would guess the object hadaa height of about 20-30 feet.  After watching it for about 1-2 minutes, I glanced down the road to see if another vehicle was coming so that I could possibly stop the vehicle and get a witness (no vehicle was coming)  My head was only turned for one or two seconds.  When I returned my gaze to the area of the UFO, it was gone.  I t never made a sound and when it left it must have left quite quickly and it MUST have known I was watching it, so I am under the impression that it waited until my gaze was averted before it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I’m not sure of the exact date, but do know it would have been a Monday or Tuesday. I was driving west on Taft Street when I noticed a lot of people in the local Wal-Mart parking lot (132 west Taft St.) looking up and pointing toward the sky. I looked up and say a Dark triangular object hovering in the sky. It had 3 red lights on the tips. The lights were not flashing. After watching it for a moment a strange haze (bluish gray) emitted from what I assume to be the back of the object (facing the East side). The object then began moving west at a decent rate of speed. Then It emitted a bright reddish orange light and started moving incredibly fast (seemed to be moving higher too) Then 2 or 3 helicopters flew over the area, then 4 or 5 jets flew past the helicopters chasing the object. I lost sight of the object, then the jets, and finally the helicopters were no longer in site. A local radio station was broadcasting information for a brief while about the object, then no more mention of it. The next day there was no information in the paper or on the local news about it. The radio station denied any broadcasting info about any flying objects the previous night. I know what I say, and I know that I’m not the only one who saw this object, but I have never found any more documentation on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We watched the still floating object speculating that it might be a weather balloon. However, the size and the stillness of the object lead us to believe it was not a weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained in the sky and did not move for over 45 minutes. It was unaffected by the breeze in the air.  It filled a good part of the western sky and did not make any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We joked about being abducted and went into the house to put our children to bed.

My chair was facing north when during my breakfast around 11:30 a.m.  I noticed an object in the completely cloudless sky.  It appeared at about 70 degrees in the sky.  It was in the shape of a long cigar or cylinder shape. It&#39;s color was somewhat like that of a cloud or very light grey.  I used a chimney on a building across the street as a reference point.  It seemed to be a very great distance in the sky maybe 30 miles away.  It did not move for the approximately 60 minutes I watched it.  I thought it would move or be blown about by the wind but it didn&#39;t move an inch.It had perfectly outlined and smooth sharp edges.  I stayed as long as i could to watch it hoping it would disappear or move away but it didn&#39;t, and at this time I had to leave my table.  I would have asked someone to verify the sighting but I thought people might think I was crazy so I didn&#39;t.  Maybe I should have.  Sincerely, ((name deleted))<n>

I was on my way to school, myself and my cousin,approximately 5:30 am. We were waiting on our school bus to arrived.  However, something magnificent, unexplainable happened.  We were standing about 100 ft from were the object lifted from the ground, and travelled into the sky.  The object we saw was small,shape as a cylinder with a shine colour (silver)  it looked like a space ship and it took off with fire at the bottom and  had this blueish, reddish colour.  The object made no sound and it travlled with such speed.  We both stood there and watched it as it tavelled into the sky and out of sight. We had no of taking a picture of it, by I can have a picture drawn from memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been asking questions for all these years about this object , but no one can answer, or explain what we saw.

11/10/89 23:00|Phoenix|AZ|Light|10 seconds|Very High star-like dot of light, high speed, crossing sky, then abruptly 'shot' into space, faded out.|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77038.html|22|ndxe198911| Very High star-like dot of light, high speed, crossing sky, then abruptly &#39;shot&#39; into space, faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two events occurred in 1989 and 1995 respectfully (approximate) in Phoenix AZ.  I lived North of the city, pretty dark in those days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first:  Facing South, a white, star-like solid light, like a medium size star, appeared in the sky very, very high up, at an almost-directly-overhead latitude and crossing the sky coming out of the East to West. I immediately thought it was a satellite. Way too high to be an airplane.  It was either already in space or just on the fringe. And faster than a satellite I was use to seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But just as I told the person I was with to &#34;look, it&#39;s a satellite&#34;, the object stopped crossing the sky half way, almost directly overhead, and literally stopped on a dime, and then went straight up into space, fading out.  It didn&#39;t continue across the sky like a satellite would and then instantly &#39;blink&#39; out when it went into earth&#39;s shadow.  This object went straight up.  A 90-degree instant &#39;turn&#39; up into space.  I verified this in my mind by acknowledging that it did not &#39;cross&#39; any more stars in any direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a private pilot, university graduate and voluminous readings, I know of nothing that would act like this, particularly that it was so high to start with, traverse half the sky, and then abruptly stop and go into space and fade out, not suddenly blink out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now here&#39;s the kicker:  about six years later, my wife and I were standing in my backyard, same house, facing North this time, looking up towards the horizon, not straight up.  I had told her my UFO story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, There...I instantly knew it was the same &#39;object&#39;, probably because it’s so different then my ‘normal’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It suddenly appeared coming at us, from North to South this time, crossing the sky towards us at a very fast speed.  Both were traveling much faster then the satellites I&#39;ve seen crossing the sky.  So, from first sighting it near the horizon to it going up into space took about seven seconds and then another two/three seconds as it faded out)   Without taking my eyes off of it this time, I told my wife, &#34;see the light coming at us?&#34;   Watch...it’s going to come almost overhead, stop, and then go straight up into space and fade out!   And it did just that as I was describing what it would do to her!!  Again, never went &#39;by&#39; any more starts verifying that it did indeed go &#39;straight up&#39; into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And now I have a witness who&#39;s always with me (married). so now it&#39;s &#39;we&#39; who saw it!  Ran across your article in the SOCO Magazine here in Boston MA and thought I&#39;d send you this &#39;tale&#39;.  I&#39;ve seen rockets launched in the Air Force (I worked on Minuteman Missiles), saw the shuttle launch in Fla., a missile &#39;blowup&#39; just after launch in New Mexico (from our backyard in Phx) leaving the colorful contrails from the rising morning sun, we&#39;ve seen satellites, the shuttle, the space station (as I acknowledged, they cross the &#39;entire&#39; sky then suddenly blink out when they go into the earth&#39;s shadow) but I’ve never seen anything this high in the sky, just a &#39;bright&#39; dot of a light, that initially looked like a satellite but traveling much faster, stop on &#39;a dime&#39;, and go straight up into space and just fade out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any ideas as to what these/this could have been?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

When I returned outside the light (sort of a glowing round redish orange in color) was  on the ridge across from my house. This ridge is app. 1/2 mile from us and follows at a straight line with a full view of 5 miles in length ( we live in a rural area with no other lights around).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere followed the ridge silently in the tree tops, sometimes in front of the trees, sometimes a little above, and sometimes it was behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trees here are oaks, bl. walnut, standing 50-60 ft. tall on the adverage.  As the sphere traveled it would stop, back up, and procede forward again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had our father come outside as well, he was somewhat of a sceptic on such matters, he watched with us and stated, &#34;well I know what it&#39;s not, it&#39;s not an airplane, or a helicoptor&#34; so he did decide it was unidentified.  We watched it for app. 20 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1 &amp; 1/2 hours later I went outside again, and it had returned, following the same path as it had previously taken, doing the exact same thing, following the same ridge, very slowly, this time taking about 35 min.  We called a neighbor, about 1 mile away in that direction, and he had seen it the first time, but it was low for him and he thought it was a cars single brake light. He watched it as well the second time, only it was higher this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He told his wife, who had been traveling that night home from the same general direction of the light, and she stated that while traveling home she had observed several times, a light coming down from the sky onto the hills beside her, no sound, very fast, like a white search light going on and off. She could not see where it was coming from but saw it 4 times very fast.<n>

Other witness was driver.  Object was seen around the Mt. Tipton Area north of Kingman.  Driver looked out drivers window (to the east towards the Mountain) and stated &#34;Whats that&#34;.  I leaned over towards driver and looked out his window and saw a medium green (medium-nor bright nor dim)object (about the same color as a traffic light)round object at approximately a 40-60 degrees angle in relationship to the ground.  Object was stationary and I was unable to determine size.  Best description would be that it was about 1/4 the size of a full moon when straight overhead.  Looked at object for approximately 20 seconds, looked away,(to undo my seatbelt) and then looked back for about 20 more seconds.  Object then markedely increased the light intensity enough to where I was able to see the entire landscape surrounding us including the slope of the distant mountain.  This lasted for about 3-5 seconds.  Light then &#34;shut off&#34; and object was nowhere to be seen.  I determined thea object had to be between us and the mountain (probably about halfway)due to fact that entire area between us and mountain including the slope was illuminated.  Illumination can best be described as approximately twice the brightness of full moon night on clear night.  At time of sightning, there were no clouds and weather was clear.  When light increased, I could no longer see the object, just the landscape lit up.  Landscape and surrounding area was lit up the same green color that object was seen as.  Light was not emitted as a beam or anyting like that.  It was as if someone just turned on a dim to medium light that lit up surroundings on an otherwise dark winter night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/5/89 02:00|Groom Lake|NV|Egg|12secs|This is a little long, so please hang in there. On Nov.5th,1989, I, along with cousin, were listening to am radio KFI in Los Angeles.Th|11/30/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11152.html|25|ndxe198911| This is a little long, so please hang in there. On Nov.5th,1989, I, along with cousin, were listening to am radio KFI in Los Angeles.The guest on the show was a man named Bill Cooper.He was stating that he knew why John F. Kennedy was assasinated and he was giving a speech on it at Beverly Hills High that night.Well my cousin and I attended out of curiosity.At the meeting he revealed many things including he was ex Naval intelligence and found out things.His reason for going public was to protect his life.Mr Cooper stated that JFK was taken out by the CIA because the CIA was hiding the fact that aliens were here and JFK was going to use that fact to break up the by then  way to powerful CIA.In short, Mr. Cooper said if you did not believe his story you could venture to this valley on the other side of a mountain range to this not yet known then, but now famous place called GROOM LAKE and watch UFO&#39;s fly out of a base they had there!Well my cousin and I took him up on that and next wednesday we drove up from Palm Springs and got up off of what I believe is Highway 95 and went down the dirt road towards Groom Lake and parked our car about 24:30. The sky was unlimited visibility with a full moon lighting up the desert.I state the clarity because of the bizzarre activity of what I think were special forces personel running in Dodge Ramchargers on the dirt roads around the valley.They obviously spotted us and drove right up to the back of our car and took what I think was our Licence Plate.We got out to confront them and they put it in reverse and peeled out of there.Under the full moon I could see them spying on us driving around without there lights on. This went on for an hour then stoped.Then at about 02:00 while kicking back in the car, I looked over towards the Groom Lake area and saw this super bright light heading towards us.I awoke my sleepy cousin and shouted &#34; THERE&#39;S ONE&#34;!! It was the shape of an egg with a sparkly tail behind it coming right in front of us. We jumped out of the car to try and take a pitcure.It lit up the whole desert overpower! ing the full moon and made no noise whatsoever.Just as it got in front of us (about 3/4 of mile) and just when my cousin tried to snap a pitcure it changed color from bright white to burnt orange with its sparkle tail sucking in.Then to our amazement, it grew transparent from the center out and vanished into thin air right in front of us!! Thats my story<n>
