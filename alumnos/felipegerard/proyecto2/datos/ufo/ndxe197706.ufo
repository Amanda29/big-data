6/30/77 23:45|St. Joseph|MI|Oval|5 minutes|Detailed Observation of  Hovering UFO in St. Joseph, Michigan on July 30, 1977|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36352.html|1|ndxe197706| Detailed Observation of  Hovering UFO in St. Joseph, Michigan on July 30, 1977<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were in my car driving down our parents street just before midnight. We both noticed a bright light at the end of the street.  I initially thought it was the street light.  However, as we drove closer, I saw that it wasn&#39;t the street light.  It was a very bright light about 75 feet to 100 feet or so above and just behind the homes at the end of the street.  It appeared to be in a stationary or hovering position just behind and above the homes.  I parked my car in my parents driveway and walked down the street to see if I could get a closer view of this bright object.  As I walked about 100 feet or so down the street, the bright object slowly (less than 5 mph) began moving toward me.  The bright object was about 75 feet to 100 feet up and made absolutely no sound at all.  As the object moved closer towards me, one of the first things that I could make out was that the craft had an opaque whiteish colored dome. There were red and white lights at the base of the whitish dome that went around the base of the dome in a counter-clockwise direction.   The craft was oval shaped, brass colored and about 15 feet long and 10 feet wide.  It also seemed like there was something like very very faint light blue lines that were emitted around the perimeter of the craft (there was just something about this I can&#39;t explain or be sure of).  The craft was so close and I could see it so clearly that I couldn&#39;t believe I was actually seeing it right before my eyes.  It looked like nothing I had ever seen or experienced before in my life or in this world.  I got this feeling of exhileration and excitement that I never felt before in my life and have never felt since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object slowly crossed between our neighbor&#39;s lawn and my parents lawn.  I walked a few feet off the street and stood under a maple tree.  I saw the underside of the craft.  The craft was oval shaped and brass colored.  It had an opaque whitish colored dome with red and white lights at the base of the dome that went around the base of the dome in a counter-clockwise direction.  The perimeter around the base of the craft curved slightly upwards.  The underside of the craft was a brass color and had ridges that ran across the base of the craft (like a ridged potato chip).  It had four bright warm lights (one in front, one in the rear, one on the left and one on the side).  The lights were cylindrical and imbedded in the base of the craft.  They had a very warm yellowish white glow.  At this point my exhilaration started to turn to being a little afraid.   I started to get a little afraid because the craft was almost directly overhead about 100 feet up.  I stood under the maple tree and observed the craft through the leaves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft slowly began to pick up speed as it hovered silently over our lawn and across the field behind our house.  It slowly picked up spped from less than 5 miles per hour to about 10 mph to 20 mph.  It traveled across the field toward I-94 in a southeasterly direction.  I went in the house and told my mother about it.  I then called the Michigan State Police Post in Benton Harbor/St. Joseph.   I told the State Police trooper what I had just seen and the direction it was traveling in.  I told him I had never seen a UFO before and that I was not mentally ill or drunk.  The State Police trooper treated my call like it was a joke and said what I had seen was probably a &#34;weather balloon&#34;.  I told him it was not a weather ballon and that the object was headed in a southeasterly direction from St. Joseph, Michigan towards Niles, Michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I was reading the Herald-Palladium (local newspaper) and on one of the back pages, there was an article about a UFO being reported by residents in the Allegan, Michigan area the night I observed the UFO in St. Joseph.  Allegan, Michigan is about 60 miles from St. Joseph in Southwestern  Michigan.  An Allegan County Sheriff&#39;s Deputy had responded to the calls from local residents and also observed the UFO himself.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I attracted attention to my nearest uncle saying look at that. The object was totally silent and its distance from us was about 400-500 meters. It situated about 100 meters from the edge of forest and went horizontally about 300 meters to the west according the edge of forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were watching it, the object suddenly stopped and stayed a moment in place. Then it landed very slowly and slightly diagonally to the forest and disappeared finally there..

6/30/77 16:00|Whittier|CA|Triangle|2 hrs.|Huge Triangle over Whittier in 1977|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50013.html|6|ndxe197706| Huge Triangle over Whittier in 1977<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been looking at many UFO sites for years and have even had a photo posted a few years ago of a UFO I got a picture of while in Washington State.  I even submitted photos last year that showed objects in front of me and around me while driving from Texas to California.  Needless to say I have had a few sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What brought me to write today was that I noticed a few reports from the 1977-78 period of pretty much what I saw myself in the city of Whittier.  I am in my late 30&#39;s now and at the time I was in 6th grade.. The time was close to 4pm because my friend&#39;s mom was the manager of a donut shop and we would go pig out there everyday after school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got to the corner of Lambert &amp; Colima when one of the kids yelled &#34;hey look a rocket&#34;!. We looked up towards the Hacienda Hts area.  There is a big hill you have to go over that leads into Hacienda Heights using Colima Rd.  We saw the object in plain sight but at first all we could see was a flame coming out of something.  It was right above Colima Rd at the top of the hill.  That is a major pathway for planes coming into LAX.  They come in every few minutes so someone had to have seen something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued watching the object and then it started to move high into the sky but towards our direction and settling directly above.  As it got above our heads (several thousand feet in the air), I could see it perfectly, it was a huge  Triangle with different colored blinking lights on the side (specifically blue &amp; red), a flame coming out of the back, and a bright white light at the tip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed up there for at least 2 hours.  Didn&#39;t move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was now way after 5pm and it started to get dark. The triangle was now blending in perfectly with the stars.  I remember still faintly being able to see the red/orange flame coming out the back and not really being able to see the red &amp; blue lights on the sides anymore.  My neck was hurting so badly from looking straight up for all that time that I finally had to take a few minuets rest.  When I looked back up I couldn&#39;t find it but all the kids were saying &#34;it&#39;s right there&#34; and pointing it out to me..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I just couldn&#39;t find it anymore because it just blended in with the stars so well. I ran home to tell my family but who would believe a young kid saying such a story.  I mean, if it were that big, flying in LAX air traffic space, in plain sight, then why was there no news covereage or any mention of it??<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I never did hear anything about it but I know what I saw. It is fresh in my memory to this day as if it just happened yesterday.  Who knows maybe since we were kids, the er uh &#34;visitors&#34; only allowed us to see them.  But whatever it was, it was huge, it was close, and it was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also like to add that a few years later (early 80&#39;s) I was watching a UFO documentary and they told the story of a man in either Wyoming or Montana that shot at a UFO that was chasing him.  Well guess what?  He drew the exact same thing I saw that day.  The triangle, flame coming out the back, bright white light at the tip, and different colored lights on the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got excited and called my brother to come watch and asked him if he remembered the UFO story I told him about a few years back, I said &#34;that&#39;s exactly what I saw&#34;.  He just basically said &#34;are you sure&#34; and I said &#34;I&#39;m positive&#34; (to which he replied &#34;what a trip&#34;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess I got so excited because someone other than the group of kids and myself actually had an encounter with this thing and drew it in all exactness of what I saw that day.. I read about the enormous Chevron craft seen by a woman over the 605 fwy that same time period as well as another story relating to the same info and I knew I had to include my experience as well.  The area over Colima Rd is a sort of UFO hotspot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1998 after leaving a friend&#39;s house just before midnight, I drove up Colima Rd coming from Hacienda to Whiiter, and as I neared the top of the hill a White light just shot across in front of me. I sped up to try and get another look but it was long gone.  It was just like a Blip but I saw it and it was not a reflection from any other lights because for those who know that hilltop, there is a small area where there are no street lights, that&#39;s where it flew across.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel relieved in a sense to hear that other people have come across what I saw that day back in the late 70&#39;s.  Although I know what I saw, it&#39;s just so relieving to know that I wasn&#39;t alone and that others came across some big, weird stuff they can&#39;t explain either.  I gotta tell you, seeing something like that is better than getting your first bicycle on Christmas - it really is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We lived right on Scenic Hwy.  My sister said to me, &#34;Look at that&#34; and I looked up and saw a silver saucer shaped large object hovering just above the pine trees.  We both just stared at it for a minute.  There was no sound, it was stationary.  I remember noticing some type of lights that went around the middle of the object.  The object had a large saucer shape topped by a smaller section on top.  I ran inside to get our older brother but when we got back outside, the object had gone.  My sister said it zoomed off fast just like that.  Our older brother never believed us and still doesn&#39;t to this day, even though we both described the same thing independently.  My dad told us it was probably something from Dobbins AFB.  To this day I can see the object as clearly in my head as I saw it then and so can my sister.  I have approximated the dates as I can&#39;t remember the exact time.  I just know it had to have been 77-78 since I remember it well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Two fuzzy glowing orange lights, aligned horizontally, about 45 degrees from the horizon, grew gradually larger and brighter, and merged into a single enormous trapezoid shape, at least 15-20 times the size of a full moon. Not a distinct object: It remained a fuzzy-edged bright orange light. There was no sound. Scared, I went inside. My friend claimed that the light gradually shrank and disappeared. When I went out again, maybe 10-15 minutes later, there was just a faint glow in the sky. My friend, who&#39;d lived there several years, said he&#39;d never seen or heard of anything like this. I&#39;m a professional photographer, but was too scared to photograph this phenomenon (a big regret!). I was age 23.<n>

THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THE LIGHT WAS THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A GIGANTIC FLUORESCENT TUBULAR LIGHT IN THE FORM OF A CIRCLE.IT APPEARED THAT THE LIGHT WAS BEING EMMITED FROM A LARGER SOLID OBJECT ABOVE IT, TO WHICH IT WAS ATTACHED. THE LIGHT WAS HOVERING ABOUT 15 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND, PROBABLY 40 FEET FROM THE HIGHWAY. I SLOWED DOWN TO TAKE IN THIS PROFOUND SIGHT BUT WAS DEEPLY TROUBLED AND DROVE QUICKLY HOME AFTER LESS THAN PROBABLY 30 SECONDS.

The phenomina included a single sphere of light ranging from light gold to pure white and varied from barely visible to, at one point, bright enough that it lit up the entire harbor so that we could see our shadows from what could have been several miles away! 	Mostly flying in linear patterns which at times teased what appeared to be military fighter jets, the ball of light seemed to accelorate and decelorate either immediatly or at rates reflecting an absense of enertial consequense. When it finally left the area it did so at a constant rate of acceloration far beyond the capability of the jets. The demonstration of so many inconsistancies with what I had previously considered possible left me sure i was being left out of some informational loop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date is best guess<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My family and I would go to Bay Springs Cemetary Road, park on the side of the road looking west towards an area we called Sunk Hill. There we would observe several balls of fire streaking across the sky. Sometimes the lights would follow one another, they would combine to make one seemingly larger object, the lights would sometimes seem to hover and then take off into many different directions. The lights were not bound to any certain direction or mode of flight. They would move across the sky in a vertical, horizontal and diagonal direction. The objects were bright orange resembling a fire ball and that is what we called them. The light show usually lasted for approximately 30 to 90 minutes. Since I now reside in Texas, I have wondered for years if this is still occuring in the Chopin, Cloutierville area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was warm and the night was very clear with lots of stars out.  We went outside to look at the constellations and spotted a very bright star which we thought was Venus as the last glow of the setting sun lit the horizon a bright but dark blue which made the &#34;star&#34; stand out.  As we watched, the star got brighter and bigger.  It was moving slowly towards us.  As it came closer, there was not a sound to be heard.  The shape was triangular and it was low enough we could see lights across the bottom in a V shape, red on one side and green on the other.  There were no flashing lights, all were steady and the bigh white light on the front of the V shape.  There were several other people at the laundra-mat as well as some residents across the street that witnessed the event.  We were all puzzled at what we were looking at.  The main item being that it did not make a sound but just sort of glided slowly across the sky.  It was traveling from west to east in a straight line.  Accord NY is about 30 or so miles from what was at that time Newburgh Air Force base.  The thought of it being a new military craft crossed my mind, but at that time we did not have anything &#39;known&#39; that would resemble the craft.  The zip code is for Stone Ridge NY, where we were living at the time, not Accord.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The car was stopped at an intersection and the 2 adult occupants got out and stood in the roadway in front of the car and watched the &#34;ball &#34; for a min. or so.  Not knowing exactly what it was , the car zoomed to Lantana road and went east .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other adult passenger and child watched as the &#34;Ball &#34; also turned east and then became a &#34; Cigar, &#34; huge, at least the length of a football field, with some red fire or smoking glow.  It also had portholes.  As the car advanced in speed, the craft flew up &amp; out to the east, over the ocean until it was out of site, at a rapid speed .<n> <n><n> <n><n> All 3 of the witnesses had never seen such a display and are worthy citizens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personally, as one of the witnesses, I could not sleep that night, or for a few nights afterward and told my wife who scoffed at me about it.  But the other witnesses also had sleep problems for a while and have sworn to the truth of what we saw that night .<n>

Rotated west and moved on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was orginally sited as only a light in the distance. Traveling east.  Didn&#39;t have any flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their was a full moon, I was facing the full moon observing an aircraft traveling in the same direction. The aircraft and the object could be seen at the same time.  They were perhaps 45 degrees apart from my position. The aircraft did have a beacon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving slowly compare the to aircraft.  I wanted to observe it as it crossed the path between me and the Moon, but sense it was moving to slowly, I decided to wait untill it crossed the Moon.  I thought that perhaps I could see it&#39;s siloate against the Moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I resumed my observation of the aircraft.  And competely forgot about the object.  When I remembered, I looked in the direction of where it would be given it&#39;s speed.  But, I didn&#39;t find it.  So, I searched the sky.  Nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I decided to observe the Moon.  It was larger this time of the year and I could see a lot of detail.  But, as I was watching the exact center began to brighten. I realized then that it was the object I was observing earlier.  It was not only coming in my direction, but coming at an angle toward me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached, the one light, became two.(like a car coming toward you) There was no sound coming from it, even when I first sited it, though I could clearly hear the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then became excited and ran to the rear of my house to the back door to call my siblings out to see it. (We normally keep the front door locked)  We lived in the country.  12 miles east of Columbia, in a neigborhood called Alligater.  A small community of about 20 to 25 houses.  On old Hwy 64 a half mile from the intersection of old and new 64.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We returned to the front of the house.  By that time it was clearing the three pine trees.  One of which was maybe 50 ft tall. The base is about 4ft in diameter.  It was maybe 60ft above that tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came to a stop above the front yard.  It was hard to see,  It almost blended perfectly with the night sky, though it had lights on each side, the lights didn&#39;t illuminate the craft.  If it wasn&#39;t for stary background of the sky, I wouldn&#39;t know it shape.  And the full moon didn&#39;t help.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My decision to call my family out, was a poor one.  They began to scream at it.   And soon, lights started to come on in the neighboring houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time the object rotated west, and began to slowly move away picking up speed.  I followed on the road which parolelled it&#39;s path.  I followed to the limits of our street lights, too scared to go beyond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is farm land across the road in front of my house. Which allowed me to observe without obstructions. The craft looked to be about 30-35ft in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at the time intersted in science and technology.  And read and viewed many books on aircraft. And read a few books on astronomy.  There are two other events, I&#39;ll list them later.  My cousin had a close encounter of the third kind. A few times, it has affected his life negitively.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It seems now is the time to talk about it, why now?, why you?, who knows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving south on a summer night when all of a sudden, I felt like I had a close encounter with whatever it was.  At the time, my now exwife was sleeping beside me in the car, so she new nothing about it, as it was happening and when I woke her up after this event was over, she shrugged it off as a figment of my imagination even though she noticed that I was flushed and sweaty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What occurred was that I saw an extremely bright and very large light that reminded me of a locomotive train light just behind me about 50 yds just appear suddenly and it followed me at the same pace but its movement was so strange to me because it didnt fluxuate with the contour of the road and there was no sound as if a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to alert my wife but I felt controlled as if in a trance or some hypnotic mind control and the only thing I noticed was that I could only use my eyes to just look in the forward direction but I kept glancing in the rear view mirror from time to time and I also noticed my palms were sweaty but for sure this was all I was allowed to do, I felt like I could only keep my hands on the wheel.  I felt like it seemed for ages that this strange event was happening or maybe time was standing still or whatever, I dont really know, even to this day, its always in the back of my mind, haunting me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed that there were no cars in either direction until it was gone which also seemed strange but anyway the years have passed and I was watching the history channel and it talked of ufo&#39;s and strange sightings so I was compelled to go on the net and do a little surfing and your site came up and well now you know mine.  I never felt comfortable about talking about this subject even to this day but it seems like alot of people are coming forward, so why not I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But after this episode my life literally changed around me, it steered me away from the RF communications (New Products prototype engineering) and into the New Products or unusual products of Defense electronics as well as travelling into far away lands for Defense Corporations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s funny how a strange experience can help drive you into different arenas or was I being driven by something else, but anyway, I have had a lifetime of experiences working in and around the unusual, which has lead me to either live or travel into 16 countries, why me?, but they are finished with me now and its only a matter of time before I fade from existence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh by the way, when I was around 15, a few of my friends and I were just hanging out late one night and we all saw what I can only say was a flying cigar shaped craft with no wings and lights around it travelling across the sky and we noticed it for at least 5 minutes but we just shrugged it off and by the way I went into the studies of Electronics after this episode at this young age, was it my choice or was I being driven, who knows?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was early in the evening; still daylight, but close to dark.  My friend was talking and she suddenly stopped mid sentence.  Her jaw dropped and she just pointed.  I turned around just in time to see a flying saucer go over her house.  This thing was very low to the ground.  You could see the lights or windows around the saucer.  It was moving quickly and silently and it appeared to be as big as her house.  We told her parents and they said it was probably a weather balloon.  I also told my parents and they too thought it was a weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked her about it when we were grown and she accepted that it was a balloon.    I told my ex-husband about my experience and he told me that he had a similar experience in Baltimore when he was about the same age.  He recalls the same type of aircraft.  I am telling you, this was not a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/15/77 01:00|Barstow|CA|||Man and son are approached on the highway by a cigar-shaped craft with windows along its side.|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20003.html|21|ndxe197706| I am a 55-year-old male with no ambitions of notoriety and certainly not a prankster of any kind.  I simply feel the story I have to tell should be discovered by those who study such things (in a scientific way). You see I feel it might be important because &#34;it&#39;s different &#34;.  What I saw and the way I saw it, seems not to bear any similarity to all the other things I&#39;ve ever heard about sightings in the general media.  It&#39;s not a subject I study; moreover, what I know is not material. WHAT HAPPENED WAS REAL!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened over twenty years ago in 1977 as my son (then about 10) and I were traveling by car from Alabama to California.  I&#39;m sure I might have been tired, for I had made that 2,000 mile trip many times over the years, but never without getting tired somewhat.  No, I wasn&#39;t &#34; dreaming &#34; or &#34; hallucinating &#34; or anything likes that.  With the experience I had making that trip, I knew when to rest and never to push myself to such a dangerous degree of instability; remember I HAD MY SON WITH ME.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It must have been after midnight, as we were fifteen miles north of Barstow.  I was driving a moderate speed of 50-55.  It was one of those beautiful nights of perfect weather.  The stars were bright without a single visible cloud in the sky, unlike the soon to be Los Angeles.  Being more reminiscent of my birth home in Alabama, I was particularly alert with my surroundings.  Enjoying it all with my driver&#39;s side window down; not knowing if I might ever see such a perfect night again.  The silhouette of the far off mountain range was very visible against the sky.  Even the nearer hillsides were visible with the outlines of trees and shrubbery.  THEN IT HAPPENED!<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my left I noticed the frontal approach light of an airplane.  Advancing from a ninety-degree angle, the light was pretty bright.  I know the distance of approach lights can be very deceiving in the night sky, but this light was near.  I had worked on the flight line and runway while in the Air Force and I had observed this very distinctive look many times at night.  It was much the same kind of light anyone might see around an airport except this one seemed to be heading straight for us.  The stars shone bright under and all around &#34; it &#34; as there wasn&#39;t a single cloud for reflection.  &#34; The light &#34; was definitely airborne.  I could see it was descending, as the space between “it” and the mountain range grew narrower.  Was it a private plane landing at a private runway? Was it a helicopter? Is there an airport near? Where are the ground approach lights? It seemed to quietly get nearer and nearer as I could detect no sound while it continued to descend.  With the relation of &#34; it&#39;s &#34; speed to mine plus perceived distance, whether illusion or not, &#34; the light &#34; appeared to be on A COLLISION COURSE WITH ME!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not acting irrational, but with an instinct of self-preservation, I began to rapidly slow down.  Glancing down at the speedometer, it was showing 20- 25 miles per hour.  Looking back to my left, &#34; the light &#34; appeared as though it had slowed down its descent.  My perception was that “the light” and I were about to reach the same place at the same time!  I shifted and gave it the gas! The fuel-injected sports car I was driving was fast. As I glanced down again, I saw I was doing 80.  When I looked back at &#34; the Light &#34;, I was shocked.  &#34; The Light &#34; had sped up! Definitely on the same collision course as if it was<n> <n><n> &#34;locked-in&#34; or using me in some way.  In the next moment, &#34;the light&#34; dropped below the outline of the horizon and reached ground zero.  In the rough terrain approximately fifty yards from me, just over the other side of the road, &#34; the Light &#34; made a ninety degree left turn while traveling exactly 80 miles per hour.  It was now moving parallel to me at the exact same speed.  &#34; The light &#34; illuminated forward no more than about twenty feet, while lighting up the closest shrubbery in front of the it.  There was now the outline of an object behind  &#34;the Light &#34;.  The rounded cigar shaped object could have been anywhere from twenty to fifty feet in height, for I could not determine how far the terrain might dip below the adjoining roadside.  There were six to eight small square windows visible down the near side with even spacing.  Each window had an off-white lightning, much the same as you might see from your own house while outside at night.  Toward the front of the craft, there were two obstruction type lights, one red and one blue/green.  I was unable to see any outline of the rear of the craft; but what I could see, covered about fifty linear feet.  The object now made a distinctive sound like I&#39;ve heard before.  It was the sound of a turbine.  A turbine and jet engine may sound similar to some but as I have been around both many times, there is a distinct difference.  After it traveled along side of me about a half mile, it began to slow.  It appeared to be stopping as I KEPT DOING 80!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After traveling another five miles down the road, I felt I must have been nearing the outskirts of Barstow.  I could see an industrial plant or factory up ahead.  The lit blaze of a tower or smokestack was very evident yet over a mile away.  It looked no different than what most people may have seen around such factories.  I believe I&#39;ve heard it referred to as a&#34; Burn-off &#34;.  As I drove nearer, I could see there was more than one stack or tower.  Behind one blaze was another blaze. Closer to the blazes it started to become apparent that something seemed strange.  There were no stacks or towers beneath the blazes. The stars and sky were the only things between the blazes and the hillside.  Even closer now, the blazes began to take on a definite shape.  They were round; they were perfectly round, like &#34; fireballs &#34;.  After arriving parallel to the &#34; fireballs &#34;.  I decided to stop and observe.  There was a convenient clearing to the right of the road.  The clearing was large enough to allow me to back in and observe comfortably. Seemingly five hundred yards or so off the road and perhaps one to two hundred yards above the ground, still shining and flickering above the horizon outline with stars beneath them, were three &#34; fireballs &#34; of the same diameter, at equal spacing from each other, appearing to be of equal distance from the ground.  One would extinguish or go out and then come back on.  Then another would do the same, but with no apparent pattern to length of time for staying off or on; never knowing which one would one would go out next.  Could these be flares of some kind? Was this some kind of military exercise? After all, some kind of craft just landed back up the road.  But what kind of craft could make a ninety-degree turn at 80 miles per hour? Especially not straight at someone like that thing did to me, right? We could have been killed! The strangest thing about these &#34; fireballs &#34; to me was the way they would always be in the same place when they came back on.  Never changing in height above the ground or distance apart, they always maintained the same diameter and perfect round shape.  They certainly couldn&#39;t be swamp gas.  They had to be controlled by an intelligence of some kind.  What kind of technology would it take to control these things the way THEY WERE BEING CONTROLLED?<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing almost an hour, I believed I wasn&#39;t going to see anything any different.  Leaving the strange lights, I drove on to our destination without further incidents, except for one thought----right before seeing &#34; the light &#34;, I remember seeing the headlights of another automobile in my rearview mirror about three-quarters of a mile behind me.  From then until I stopped to observe the &#34; fireballs &#34;, I saw no turn-off on that road.  You know, that car never did catch up to me. . . . .<n>

I was looking to the south and spotted a bright light moving to what appeared to be north. I didn&#39;t think to much about it cause we have Forbes Air Base and a police helicopter in town, but what caught my eye was that it was changing colors, like most of the rainbow colors, not flashing just changing but the intensity of the light stayed the same. NOW I was wondering why our police helo was changing colors as I have never seen it do that before. It was about the same brightness as Jupiter is on a good night but slightly brighter. I watched it for about 7-10 seconds then it stopped in mid-flight. When it stopped it also stopped changing colors and changed to a VERY brilliant white light, like twice the brightness of Jupiter. That lasted about 4-5 seconds and then all at once this thing took off to the stars so fast it was gone in less than 1 second, if I had blinked I would have missed it leaving. It did not go OVER the horizon it went straight up at about a 70 degree angle to the way it was flying when I watched it before it left. It went UP INTO the stars, not leaving a trail of any kind except a light trail, the kind you see if you move a flashlight beam across a wall VERY fast. At that moment I knew it wasn&#39;t something of earth as I have seen aircraft fly all my life and none ever acted like this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was too far away to make out any shape so can&#39;t give one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in June 1977 is approximate.

The only other witness I know of is a guy from Walla Walla, WA. who I met in the campground we were staying, but they left before we woke up the next morning, so any actual confirmation would be from someone I never met before or saw after. You&#39;re the only ones I&#39;ve ever submitted this to, although I&#39;ve told many over the years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After having dinner on the beach this guy and I went around a pile of driftwood to do some stargazing (nothing else!). We watched what looked just like a star &#34;moving around other stars&#34; in erratic sharp turning patterns, except it would get brighter and fainter as it &#34;moved in &amp; out of light range.&#34; We looked away and then back minutes later and it was still there, but it started to arc toward the south then stopped and continued its erratic movement. We continued to watch until it started to arc again and met another similar light which traveled straight in the opposite direction.(probably a satellite)   We watched it straight above for about a 20 min, looked away for about 5 min, watched again for 10 min before it started its 1 min arc to about 10:00 in the sky, where it stayed for 10 min and we looked away again for 5 min then back for 2 min until it moved to intercept the other northerly arcing light. We left after they were straight above us, it got way to weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just to point out the important parts again. It was star like and was constantly moving in a sharp erratic pattern around and past fixed stars and in and out of light range indicating depth in space. We watched it for an hour or more.

A friend and myself were about to smoke a bowl of marijuana (no, we had not yet lit up..., that&#39;s why we were there, it was easy to view police coming.) when the whole sky, and the interior of our car lit up bright turqoise blue. Probably closer to the color of plasma that anything else I&#39;ve seen. I was in the passenger seat facing west, and somehow, I knew to thrust my head forward into the windsheild area an look straight up. Not an easy task in a volkswagon bug. There about 300 feet up was an unmarked bright blue sphere hovering motionless. I know it was 300 feet because it was in the cloud cover which was rather dense but still had enough patches to see the moon. (Almost full or full) From my perspective, it appeared to vanish. From my friends perspective, he saw it take off from the south...which was sometype of aerospace facility, now abandoned but still in place, 2003. Six other persons came racing down to the base of the cul-de-sac and exclaimed &#34;Did you see that thing fly by the moon?&#34; They said it had done so in about a half second. Pretty fast. We all sat around in shock for a while and then dispersed. We did not exchange names, I guess it&#39;s not the first thing that come to mind in such an &#39;alien&#39; situation. To be clear, I don&#39;t know what it was. It just wasn&#39;t of this world. Perhaps a UFO, angel, advanced being. It could have been anything. Although I did get flashbacks of having been onboard a craft of some type for several years after the event. The disappointing thing was that the next day, even though people in a sixty mile diameter had seen the sky over San Diego light up, the news claimed &#34; The strange light in the sky last night was a power station explosion.&#34; I&#39;ve never trusted the media since that night, and suggest you don&#39;t either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As we kept on driving we could see it get closer. Suddenly it appeared at treetop level, it was as big as a house, with very bright lights coming from rows of windows. They were so bright we couldnt make out the exact shape, but seemed to be saucer or disc shaped. It was completely quiet, it seemed to just float slowly over the treetops. It passed directly over our vehicle, across the road, over a golf course &amp; just kept on going.. There were other cars on the road that had to see it too, we just kept on driving, my husband stuck his head out of the window as it passed over, he saw colored lights on the bottom. I was so scared that I literally got in the floor of the car &amp; started praying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My wife-to-be (let’s call her Jan) and myself were out taking an evening walk by Lincoln High School (on Lincoln Way).  We both sighted a UFO within 150 feet of our position.  These are the details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Environmental conditions: The evening was clear with very few, if any clouds.  The sun had set about 15 minutes previously.  Only the brightest stars were beginning to show.  There was no wind that I can recall; it was very still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The story: Jan and I walked by the high school and noticed that it had a fountain in the center of the group of buildings which were in a &#34;U&#34; shape, open to the street.  We went to the fountain and were looking into it.  I was saying something to Jan and she interrupted me by simultaneously nudging me in the ribs with her elbow and saying &#34;look at this.&#34;  I looked up and saw a large white triangular shape shoot over the roof of the west wing of the building traveling at a slightly upward angle (the ship was travelling southeast, almost parallel to Lincoln Way).  Almost immediately the ship nosed downward at about a 20 degree angle and looked like it was going to dive into the street.  As it passed the corner of the High School’s west wing, a very large &#34;spark&#34; shot out of the back and almost immediately dissipated, the way plasma dissipates.  The ship left a light (perhaps even slightly bright) well-defined vaporous trail as it moved through the air which dissipated almost immediately as it came out the back.  At it’s lowest point I estimate that the craft was flying about 40 to 50 feet above street.  As the ship continued to move on its path, I could see the back side of it. There was a diamond-shaped opening from where the vapor trail was coming and it was brilliant.  A moment later and the ship dissappeared behind a large tree. With the sky dark enough to see a few stars, I knew that I would be able to see anything bright.  I ran quickly to a place where I could get an unobstructed view of the horizon or at least as unobstructed as I could manage, and I still saw nothing moving in the sky. The ship had vanished.  See diagrams below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Final details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ·The &#34;fly-by&#34; of the ship took about 2 to 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ·The ship was white but not glowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ·It flew in a &#34;wobbley&#34; manner as if it was almost out of control ·This craft was TOTALLY silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ·I was vaguely aware of seeing small details on the hull; my impression was that it was like the lines formed by plates fitting together on the fuselage of an aircraft but I could be wrong on that description. I was not focussed on such small details at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

The object captivated me.  I could not take my eyes off it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instead of going home, I followed the UFO as it moved slowly across the tree tops in the wooded area that surrounded the development.  I followed the UFO, for approximately 15 minutes, to Quince Orchard Road, and it continued straight into the woods across the road.  (At the time that area was all wooded).  I could not follow it any further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO looked oval/dome shaped.  It was very large.  It was dark colored like gray/black.  It had windows along the top dome section.   Not all windows where lit, but there was some light coming from some of the windows. It traveled very slowly, because as I followed it, it stayed ahead of me but I didn’t lose sight of it until it went into another wooded area where there was no road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to see if I could continue to follow this thing, so I caught a ride with a car that came along just after losing sight of the UFO- the fellow that stopped to give me a ride said he saw something.  I jumped in and told him I had seen it too, that I had been following it from Quince Orchard development.   He drove a little further to the little shopping center at the end of Quince Orchard Rd. but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know who that fellow was or if he ever reported the sighting.  But I never said anything to anyone about it until I had been married for awhile.  I told my husband and my four children.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder if the occurrence seen in approx June of 1977 was the same sighting I saw!   I think the UFO came from what is now the Seneca Park area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

She was only able to see it by putting her face close to the glass and looking up.  Thinking that she was talking about something attached to my car, I pulled off the highway by taking a left exit and pulled into a parking lot, where I found about 25 cars already there with everyone out of their vehicles looking up in the sky.  I got out of the car, but my passenger was too afraid to get out.  She could see the object plainly from inside the car, as it was now huvering over the parking lot.  I could not tell for sure how high it was because it made no noise.  The structure was not completely discernable, but appeared to be round with very bright white lights on the bottom completely around the perimeter.  The lights were sequencing in such a manner as to make a revolving appearance around the bottom of the craft (similar to a marqui sign).  In fact, it may have been only one light blinking and revolving around the bottom of the craft.  The object would huver for approximately one minute, and then move at a very fast speed in a northerly direction, aparrently following the highway until it was out of sight.  When I asked a man in the parking lot &#34;What the hell did I just see?&#34;  he replied something like &#34;stick around, and you&#39;ll see it again.  It&#39;s been doing this for quite a while!&#34;  I stood and watched with him for a minute, and then the object re-appeared over the highway, moving very slowly from the north until it was over our parking lot again where it huvered.  More cars pulled into the parking lot.  Then it shot away again and I left.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My specialty, Aircraft crewchief. My security clearance was secret. The exact date was approximately June 15,1975. The reason I say this is because the movie &#34;Jaws&#34; had just came out at Drive-ins and Theatres. I was double-dating with a friend of mine and we decided to go to the drive-in to see &#34;Jaws&#34;. The Drive-in had Four Screens which were positioned North &amp; South, East &amp; West. My friends and I were waiting for the movie to start, we were facing the East Screen. The Sun was beginning to set below the Horizon which at that time the movie that was playing on the West Screen started. I had turned around in the car and was watching it when I noticed a bright object approximately 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon, West by Southwest. I thought to myself that it was a bright star. I watched it thinking to myself that this was kind of odd because it was still light. I watched it and it began to move at a high speed from West to East. I thought I was possibly watching a SR-71 aircraft from Beale A.F.B. stationed at Marysville, CA. and it was in full afterburner and this was why it was moving so fast. At the time I knew the SR-71 was a Mach 3 Or Mach 5 acft. I told my friend ((name deleted)) to check this out. As we were watching it, it stopped suddenly and turned 90 degrees North toward us. It came straight toward us and hoverd 300 feet above and than dropped behind the Eest screen. People got out of their vehicles and watched in amazement. It raised up behind the screen to about 600 feet and traveled north at an incredible speed. No Sound!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/15/77 20:00|New Orleans|LA|||Father and son witness V-shaped formation of lights move quickly overhead.|2/5/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27512.html|35|ndxe197706| E-mailed Report:<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness alludes to an illustration on the NUFORC homepage, a V-shaped formation of large, yellow lights.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed the attached photo on the index page of your site.  About 25 or so years ago I saw a remarkably similar sight over my house near the Mississippi River in New Orleans.  I had a small telescope set up for observation of a total eclipse of the moon that was occurring that early evening.  My father was visiting, and I called him to come see these mysterious lights that were moving over us apparently very fast in a wedge-shape or V shape formation.  But they were out of sight before my father could see them.  About 10 years later, when I was leaving work on Canal Street in New Orleans, I saw a similar sight.  I was alone again, and it was just after sunset.  But this time just before the &#34;lights&#34; disappeared from view I saw that they were actually high-flying birds of some kind - probably geese.  I had been convinced for years I had witnessed a &#34;real&#34; UFO and would have dismissed as impossible any attempt by anyone to tell me these lights could be birds who were flying high enough to reflect the light of the sun even though to us in darkness at ground level the sun had already set.  But I saw with my own eyes these mysterious lights resolve into something not so mysterious at all - or at least not any more mysterious than everything is all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not trying to convince anyone that the lights in the attached photo are birds.  I don&#39;t know.  I can only say that what I saw looked exactly  like that.  I have several relatives who are solid people with their feet firmly on the ground who have told me of things they have seen for which I see no ordinary explanation - things that certainly were NOT high flying birds - a star, e.g., that is very bright and suddenly breaks into several smaller stars that shoot out in different directions and then return to form a single star again!  One of my relatives swears he saw such a sight one night many years ago in the deep woods and swamps of central Louisiana - and I believe he did.  So I know there are things happening that we can&#39;t explain in any ordinary way.  I wouldn&#39;t at all be surprised to find in the near future that we are able to confirm in some way acceptable to most people that some of these phenomena are in fact extraterrestrial in origin.  But I think we owe it to each other to be as accurate as possible in our observations and to exhaust all ordinary explanations before entertaining thoughts of any extraordinary ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Much thanks for your wonderful web site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

I was 7 at the time.  We left the KFC that was on Northwest Hwy going NW in our car.  As we got closer to the intersection of Northwest Hwy and Euclid, I spotted an object that hung in the sky and was getting brighter.  It was &#34;dropping&#34; out of the sky in the north.  I pointed it out to my sister who was in the car.  She then asked my dad to look at it.  I then replied that it was a UFO.  My father, refused and brushed it off as an airplane.  To quite us he turned at the intersection prior to Euclid as to keep us from jumping around in the back seat since the streets he was taking had trees that over hung the road and obscured our view.  As was were going down Sigwalt St. the craft was now closer to the ground, 100 ft or so.  as we drove west on Sigwalt St. to the 7-11 store to get soda pop for dinner.  We pulled in and my father still refused to look up and cater the whims of his children.  He went in and as we stayed in the car, one of the other children and her frien who lived up the street from us saw the UFO, hovering with no sound, only the wind had picked up.  The wind was strange, blowing almost upward in direction and in a circular motion.  The face that she made was horrific, as in disblief that this could not be happening.  Her knees caved in and her friend dropped to the ground.  What I thought at the time was a &#34;neat&#34; thing now was burned in to my memory forever as a horror.  My sister and I were now wanting to go home, not in a panic, just a rush to get home.  The disk moving slowly was now above the intersection of Sigwalt St. and Wilke St.  My father exited the Store, as did the attendent.  My father finally looked up to see the disc and was amazed and puzzled as to what he was seeing, as we all were.  It moved over Rolling Meadows and slowly climbed upward, as fast as it came down.  It was about the size of one and a half houses (for the area I live in) it was black on the underside, blacker then the nig! ht and not reflective of any light, other then the lights that it had moving on its edges.  All diferent colors, but mostly yellow, red, orange.  As it climbed it the night sky, it was tilted in a way we saw the top.  It looked like a classic &#34;Bell&#34; shaped saucer, and the top was reflecting the lights on the edges so we were able to see the surface reflecting and giving away the top sides shape.  It never moved quickly and as far as I know no one else saw it.  At the time in Arlington and Rolling Meadows when evening came most people were inside, I am not sure if this was covered at the time in the papers.  My father pasted away in 1991, and my sister being sick, I thought I had to at least post this somewhere and see if anyone else knows of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I told her to &#34; Look at that&#34;, I said &#34;no-one is ever going to believe us.&#34; It couldn&#39;t have been more than 4-5 feet above the roof of the house.  These houses were very small three bedroom houses in comparison to the houses I see now.  It was pretty much exactly the same size as the roof of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt it knew I saw it and it took off towards the sky FAST up and off to the right, it made no sound at all and had two lights on the bottom, but I&#39;m not positive what those colors were. In one blink of my eye it was so far up in the sky, in two blinks it was a dot and by the third blink it was gone.  I couldn&#39;t believe what we had seen. I wanted to go to that house and ask what had happened to them, but was too scared.  I was a teenager at the time and it was very strange that my friend and I only walked around the block to our friends and by the time we got there had forgotten it.  It took  thirty years to remember. I wonder if it could have done something to my memory.  I know without any doubt it knew when we fixed our eyes on it and took off. I have told many people in my lifetime and they all give me that &#34;look&#34; and I have to remember that just because they are my friends doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s easy for a person to swallow.  Anyway, I feel at fifty that it would only! be fair for whatever it&#39;s worth to whoever may want to hear it and listen.  I don&#39;t know if it was from here or somewhere else, but they are there..most uncomfortable to see. I think now that I&#39;m writing this I&#39;m going to go back to that house and see if I&#39;m lucky enough to find someone who lived there at that time and ask them if something happened to them that year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

After sitting up and turning round I looked out of the window and this is what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 50 yards away directly in front and almost level with our floor was hanging in the sky motionless and silent an &#34;Alien spacecraft?&#34;  Well, it was saucer or maybe cigar shape.  It had two rows of windows there were &#34;People?&#34;  Well that&#39;s what they looked like to me,  All wearing what the nearest I can discribe looked like those early Beatle jackets without the collars, some dark ones and some were wearing white.  The ages of the occupants appeared to range from 10 to 60 years some men had beards there where also women.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to wake my wife but then noticed she was already in the same position as me looking out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She started waving at them, they waved back some smiled, they were sort of coming and going to the windows.  After what seemed like 15 minutes it either shrunk or sped off rapidly and in silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Hours later we had another encounter but this time   with a surface contact travelling appx.70 miles an   hour and frequently submerging without slowing at all.We were never able to visually see this contact  and it finally dived to the deapths of the atlantic  and disappeared off our sonar and radar screen.The   next morning we were assembled on deck and ordered to forget everything we saw.The explanation we were  given was we saw an experimental Russian helicopter. No helicopter could have done what we witnessed.     After the encounter our ship experianced severe moral problems.The objects appeared to be about 15 or 20 feet across and appx.10 ft.in height.The way   they maneuvered from horizon to horizon across the   sky in a split second and could completely change    direction without slowing or circling was beyond our known technology as well as the Russians.That our    commanders expected us to believe their helicop! ter   st ory was absured.<n>

Before this sighting I was in a building the base command had given me to set up a Ham Radio station. I was on the air late into the morning till around 2am or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been transmitting and talking to another ham radio station. During the end of the converstion with the other station I noticed a large drop in the power line voltage. It dropped to the point that my ratio equipment would not functin correctly. I then shut down my station and left the building to go back to the building where I lived and go to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I left the building with where my radio station was, I noticed a bight, perfectly round shaped light hovering about 100 feed above the ground close to the runway that was on the Coast Guard base. This distance from me was maybe 300 yards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the object it moved up to an altitude of about 500 ft and down several times. I continued wo watch it. It then hovered perfectly still and then began moving in strange angles back and forth. It then climbed up to several hundred feet, and suddenly shot away into space like a flash. The acelleration was very rapid and the movement was very erratic....It was gone, I mean gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there completely stunned for several minutes, shaking in awe. I then went back to the barracks and woke up one of my buddies to tell him the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it might be a light from a hellicpoter, but there was NO sound, and the movements were too sharp and erratic to be any normal aircraft. Was this craft attracted to my radio signals in the moments before I came out of the building? Was it attempting to communicate with me by messing with the power?  I have wondered about this for years?<n>

6/15/77 01:00|Stillwater (west of)|OK|Light|1-2 minutes|Three of us saw a high flying jet/airplane begin zig-zagging across the sky for about 30 seconds.|9/6/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/007/S07711.html|44|ndxe197706| Three of us saw a high flying jet/airplane begin zig-zagging across the sky for about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened so long ago that I have never considered reporting it until I heard you on the recent sightings on radio show.  At the time I thought that ufo&#39;s had to be a &#34;flying saucer&#34; to be a real event. But some months ago, I read a recent report that sounded much like mine. I never forgot what happened but I didn&#39;t commit the entire night to memory either.  The date I gave is a pretty wild guess based on who I was with and when we would have been together. Here is what happened. My two friends and I were college friends/roomies off campus at Okla. State Univ.  It must have been early Saturday morning and we had been out chasing the ladies and the bars had closed down so we  decided to go out about 5 miles west of town to Lake Carl Blackwell where we liked to go to watch the stars for meteors.  We were just lying flat on the ground looking straight up.  I was laying with my head facing west and my feet to the east.  At some point I saw what I thought was a high flying airplane or jet (i.e. a point source of light, like a star) moving across the sky at a semmingly normal speed, from west to east. I saw it near my zenith and fixed on it for some reason. After it passed my zenith, it began zig zagging.  It was not &#34;arc-ing&#34; but was making definite hard angles. The relative distance the object moved from one &#34;cut&#34; to the next was about the size of a dime at arms lenghth. It did not speed up or slow down, it just zigged for about 30 seconds and then returned to a straight line until it passed out of sight to the east. I did not say a word and neither did my friends but about a minute after it had slowly disappeared I just asked &#34;Did anybody see that?&#34;  Both of my friends raised up and said in unison, &#34;Did you see that too?&#34;  I asked, &#34;Dale,what did YOU see?&#34; Dale described exactly what I saw.  DeWayne agreed that he saw the same thing.  We scratched our heads and then let it go. Now, we HAD been out on the town earlier but we were not intoxicated, certainly not to a point were it effected what we saw. I have never seen anything act like that before or since and spend alot of time outdoors wathing the night sky.  I&#39;ve seen &#34;satellites&#34; just sort of fade in and then fade out, but never saw anything zig-zagging in or even arc-ing in any manor. I still wonder what it was.<n>
6/15/77 01:00|Fort Worth|TX|Sphere|1 minute|Orange ball objects seen near Ft. Worth, Texas twenty three years ago.|6/21/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13125.html|45|ndxe197706| Orange ball objects seen near Ft. Worth, Texas twenty three years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date of this even as listed above was never recorded, and even the year 1977 is uncertain.  The witness to this event was driving a station wagon containing his wife and three young children - all of whom were asleep at the time, which was around 1:00 AM.  The vehicle was headed east along IH-20 about mid way between Ft. Worth and Dallas.  After passing some low hills located not far north of the highway the vehicle came to an area which was relatively flat and which perhaps sloped slightly downward from IH-20.  Immediately upon passing the hilly area the driver&#39;s attention was called to a location about one mile distant where  a series of lighted orange globes were rising up from the earth - one behind the other - in an arc which brought the string of orange globes to a flight level with the earth at perhaps 1000 feet altitude.  The orange globes were 20 to 30 feet in diameter, around 300 to 400 feet apart, and seemed to be moving at about 30 MPH.  When first seen, there were two globes rising along the arc following five already in single file behind one another.  A new globe arose about every 6 to 7 seconds from the same spot. The area from which the globes were rising seemed to be part of a large wooded residential area, but the witness could not tell what kind of buildings were present because of the trees and the distance.  However, there were no structures evident which were higher than a two storey building. The globes were about the same color as the orange color on a package of Hewlett Packard black ink for printers.  They seemed to be solid and rigid (unlike a balloon), and they were completely round with no appendages, attachments, windows, portholes, or other features.  The orange color was uniform over all the object, and the objects seemed to be lighted as if the surface of each globe had a dim glow.  They DID NOT appear like a balloon with a light source inside.  They appeared to be lighted from within their surface, and NOT as if lighted from outside the globe.  The globes travelled in straight, constant-speed flight - not moving up or down at all. No attempt was made to stop to observe the globes because it seemed dangerous to stop along that segment of IH-20 where there were no houses or businesses, because it was around 1:00 AM, and because the witness was tired from having driven for the previous four hours.  Because there were some major aircraft industries in the Ft. Worth area the witness at first assumed that he was witnessing the testing of some kind of air craft which carried a large light of some type.  But it now seems the orange ball itself was the craft being tested.  But why so many?<n>

While driving down a fairly busy street(now 4 lanes), a friend and I (both 17) noticed a very large black boomerang shaped object rapidly approaching. At first, we both thought it was a plane about to crash, but then it just stopped in mid air and hovered less than 100 ft. over a house, giving off a low humming sound. My friend was driving, and it scared us so badly she just stopped her car right in the middle of the street.  We were so scared that we could not speak or move, we just sat there staring at this huge object with approx. 8 lights around its bottom perimeter.  I just kept wondering why there was not anybody else on that street at that time, there was usually more traffic. It seemed like everything just stopped and stood still.  It then took off at an incredibly high speed until it disappeared in the Northern sky. Since we were only two blocks from my parent&#39;s house, we drove over there and ran inside crying because we were so scared. My mother called the local radio station to see if there were any other reports, but we were the only ones who reported it. It was such a strange thing that it left me asking &#34;did I just see that?&#34;<n>

The home sat near a lake that was surrounded by tall pine trees. We were cleaning fish that we had caught earlier in the day and suddenly we heard a low rummbling noise and we heard something scraping through the trees. It made quite a mess and initially I thought perhaps an air plane had crashed into the copse when suddenly at tree top level a vehicle emerged from the pines. It looked like a large cruise missle except it was wider and it had a black glass cab. It was blunt in the front and honestly it put in the mind of the space ships on the TV series Battle Star Galactica. Right down to the dirty white color of the fuselodge this craft with it&#39;s stunted wings and snub nose and its glistening black glass, hung in the air hovering, just over a palme tree that sat in my cousins side yard, in just the way that cruise missles don&#39;t. It hummed and the flash something seemed to explde from under the black cockpit glass and suddenly the thing was gone. A bright flash of blinding blue light the static smell of ozone and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A US top secret aircraft flying over downtown Stockton.This was not the Nevada desert.Whoever controlled this craft cared not who saw it...Which brings up the most perplexing question to me.Did anyone else see it at all? And how could they not?..I am 60 yearw old now.I have a family and grandkids.I am retired from the Army National Guard.My word is my bond.I would neve lie about anything like this nor would my family.I have no reason to.I have told this stories to numerous friends.My real fiends believe me.Others scoff and roll their eyes.My nature is not to jump on any bandwagon.I am very skeptical about any eye witness report.Ten people can describe an object ten different ways.Nuts and kooks abound.I saw what I saw.My family saw it.It proves nothing.That is my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I am unsure what happened between the time we saw it and when I arrived home. We never talked about it together again.

I do not have contact information for the witness presently, but I can get it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1977 the witness (age 17 at the time)and his cousin were returning home to obey their 12 a.m. curfew.  As they were heading up a road towards the Heights in Montgomery Village, MD, near Gaithersburg, the witness saw a light through some trees at the top of the hill and asked his cousin &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34;. His cousin replied &#34;They&#39;re digging a lake up there; it must be some construction lights.&#34;  They continued up the hill, came around a bend in the road, and saw a cigar-shaped object hovering over a telephone pole approximately 40 feet in the air and 50 feet in front of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness and his cousin stopped the car and got out to look at the object, which he described as shaped like a &#34;one-manned submarine&#34;, being about the size of a school bus, and as having a metallic skin, 2 beams projecting from the &#34;front,&#34; and a row of &#34;portholes&#34; and non-blinking red and green lights around the circumference.  The object was completely silent and stationary for approximately 20 seconds, then made a soft, mechanical &#34;verrrt&#34; sound and began to move slowly away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness emphasized 2 things: how &#34;man-made&#34; and &#34;nuts and bolts&#34; the object seemed (&#34;like an airliner with no tail, wings, or jet engines&#34;) and the strange way that it appeared to move away slowly, yet diminished rapidly in size until it disappeared.  He had a difficult time describing exactly how the object departed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said that the surface of the craft was visible from the glare of the projecting beams (&#34;kind&#39;a like laser beams, not spreading out like headlights&#34;), and that it was metallic.  There were also dark patches above the view ports where he thought there was some movement visible (as in something moving inside the object).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses&#39; car exhibited no electromagnetic effects from the close proximity of the craft; the engine continued to idle and the headlights remained on, and neither witness suffered any physiological effects.  He said that he and his cousin were open-mouthed in amazement, but never felt frightened during the encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What also astonished the witness was that this sighting took place shortly before midnight in the middle of a suburban bedroom community with many houses in the area, but no one came out of their home to investigate the bright lights above their neighborhood.  He looked in the newspapers, but failed to find any reports of UFO sightings in the next several days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

As we were walking a circular object rose from the tree line and abruptly stopped at a few hundred feet high.  The object was semi-transparent and glowing a white to blue color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all froze in our paths.  The sky was overcast and snow was on the ground.  The object hovered for a few seconds then suddenly accelerated and streaked over our heads at an incredible speed leaving a light trail and disappeared thru the cloud cover. Instantaneously we all looked at each other and said”did you see that?”<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the shock waned we talked and decided not to call the police for fear of ridicule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few months later I saw a similar object from my bedroom window toward the same wooded area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event has been on my mind my throughout my adult life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

He said the patrolman wanted him to witness with him a UFO.

It was not there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then went to a lake to go parking.  While we were parked, in complete darkness, I noticed that it was light in the truck.  We looked out the back window and saw two small craft, I would say the size of 3 cadillacs.  They were oval and dark except for amber lights around the base.  The lights were very soft but iluminated the area well.  They were about 30 feet in the air hoovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for about 10 minutes. Then both of them slowly went over the truck to the road.  At that time one appeared to land in a field and the other went down the road and it just speed up and disappeared.  Although speed up is not a correct description.  It zipped, zoomed or what ever out of sightand left a trail of light.  It was there one moment and we were watching it, then in a second it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back to the field where the other landed and shined our lights in the direction where it should have been.  It was not there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other strange thing about this was that my boyfriend and I never ever talked about it until I contacted him 20 years later.

It|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03546.html|59|ndxe197706| While driving south on Route 53 with my brother, we were exiting a thunderstorm.  Leaves, trees and branches were moving violently.  It had been raining hard.  It had stopped raining.  As we were coming up on a plateau where a silo, cow barn and cow field are located, we saw a light hovering above the cow pasture.  We saw this light at 1/4 miles from plateau.  My brother and I watched the light as we approached the plateau, not saying anything. Almost like we were in shock, I mentioned &#34;What was this?&#34; He acknowledged the same.  We sped up and started approaching the hill to the plateau. As we came to approximately 100 yards, the object started to move. It had been hovering approx. 75-100 yards above the cow pasture. The object was round and orange-yellow in color. It was maybe 5-6 feet around. There was no sound.  It took off and sped toward the ridge.  I sped the auto to app. 85 mph to catch up.  I was flashing the lights of the auto and blowing the horn.  Personally, I felt as if our metallic presence of the auto was making the object move.  It moved as we made our closest point of approach.  Unusually, the object stopped at the ridge.  It could have been our perception, but it appeared to stop before going out of sight.  I had stopped the car and got out and yelled at it.  I told my brother that if it were extra-terrestial, then I wanted to meet them. My brother and I travel down into the valley to cross another ridge. I had presumed that if it did land, then it was on top of the hill. We went down into the valley and lost sight of the object. My brother became terrified to go up on the hill to look for it.  As we looked for something, I had felt that something was there and maybe it had landed. My brother did not want me to get out of the car.  I did and I felt a strange sensation believing that there was something outside, possibly that this object had landed. This was many years ago in the 70&#39;s in approx. 1977 or 78.  I would have cast off this sighting as something not worth mentioning but my brother had another sighting of the round object recently.  He delivers newspapers in the early morning before dawn.  I will get more info from him if you want. I did not see it recently but I always remember the sighting.  I just got out of the Navy and I never knew where to report objects.  Thanks and you can write back if you want more info.  Thanks. ((Name deleted))<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is an unfiltered account of communications and interactions between a teenage human and a group of ET&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened 25 years ago  during a well documented UFO flap in 1977 in Gisborne New Zealand and the Waimata Valley near Gisborne.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I experiences seems quite different from what people talk about but this is how it happened., nothing is held back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m free to talk about it now as this information is publicly available in space so it may as well be publicly available here too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here it is, complete with spelling mistakes and typos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Here is what I wrote on an sighting report this year about the ET&#39;s experience with me:  they had the misfortune of trying to control a highly excited, disobedient teenage boy that was loose on their spaceship. It was fun for all of us and probably put the ET&#39;s off having human teenagers as children.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t need hypnosis to recall this. The ET&#39;s memory erasing methods didn&#39;t work on me, which also meant they couldn&#39;t control me while I was with them like they were used to controlling humans. By time they learned that is was too late for them to do anything about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please write an account of what happened This can be CSV delimited for your database.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date, 1977 Location, Waimata Valley NZ - I lived there on our family farm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event Circumstances, It Happened during a UFO flap that centred on Waimata Valley and Gisborne at the same time UFO&#39;s were filmed from a plane over the South Island of NZ.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Main Event, I was a guest on a scout UFO and was taken into space for urgent medical attention on a larger space ship when the operation in my nose went wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;d had UFO sightings reported for over 2 months along Waimata Valley Road near our house So I decided to sleep with a torch and the next time one flew over our house I&#39;d get out my window with the torch and start signalling it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One flew over our house and I jumped out the window and began signalling it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two ET&#39;s in a window looking down at me. I could read their telepathic conversation to each other, one was saying lets carry on, this is of no interest and the other said to wait, this could be of interest. At this point I was flashing the torch and waving at them like any excited kid and I thought &#34;yes - I&#39;ve won them over&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one that said this might be of interest immediately telepathically told me I had not won them over and next thing I remember I&#39;m in a corridor on the scout ship jumping up and down going it&#39;s true! it&#39;s true! you are real and there were at least 2 Et&#39;s just standing there looking at me trying to get a handle on the sight of an over excited teenage boy in pyjamas going off in front of them. What was of interest to them was that I could read their telepathic conversations to each other. I also learned they have ways of telepathically talking one on one and ensuring on ET nearby can listen on to the one on one chat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I&#39;d calmed down from hyperactive to just animated the tall one walked asked me why I had been unsure if they were real and why was I out there flashing my torch at them.  I replied that we&#39;d been told they weren&#39;t real and others were saying if they were real they were here to harm humans. I said they&#39;d been over our house for the past few months and I was still fine so obviously they were not here to hurt us so I decided to attract the attention of the next one that flew over our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The tall one asked who was saying they were here to harm them and I said - the Americans said this all the time but I stopped believing that when they&#39;d been over our house for a few months and we hadn&#39;t been harmed by this. The Tall one was not happy to hear that I&#39;d been told ET&#39;s were here to harm humans. The tall one told me they&#39;d met humans and had not received a friendly reaction from humans. Humans had not made them feel welcome on Earth. I said well on behalf of humans they were welcome here. I think the Tall one and short ones were trying not to telepathically laugh at a human child welcoming them on behalf of humanity but I was so excited and I&#39;d blurted it out as I really wanted them to feel welcome.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They told me the Russians were just like us and that I had to like the Russians as well as the Americans as we were all one species. This freaked me out and I had a stand up argument with them saying the Russians were not our friends as they were communists and if they were our friends why were they building so many more weapons than they needed and the Tall one kept saying we (communist or capitalist) must get along as we were all the same. I just couldn&#39;t accept this concept so we dropped the conversation and went to a room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A some point they put me in a trance to keep me in one place while they went to another room. I snapped myself out of the trance and went wandering around the corridors. A little ET spotted me and was surprised as was the Tall ET but the tall ET told the little ET I was safe so to let me look around. The little ET followed me everywhere during this phase. Then my time for medicals began so I went back to the room and got on the table/bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There the tall one told me that they had not been offered much co-operation from Humans and it would like my assistance, by this time it was standing over a bench in the corner of the room preparing some hand held instrument and I was lying on my back on a body temperature metal or plastic table. I said I&#39;d be happy to help it, it could take off an arm if it wanted as long as it didn&#39;t harm my ability to think as that was important to me. It was touched by that remark and laughed that it didn&#39;t need an arm but would do other things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did whatever it did then began to put a powered instrument up my nose. I said it looked like it would hurt me and it said if I liked it would stop any pain and I said yes please so it gave me the image of a moth crawling up my nostril while the instrument went in. While the instrument was up there doing whatever it did the ET dropped their guard and telepathically I picked this up so I seized the moment and jerked my head back violently with the instrument still active deep in my nostril. The ET was quick to stop the instrument but the damage had been done, it had sliced me up wherever it was inside my nostrils. The ET asked &#34; why did you do that&#34; and I said now you&#39;ll have to take me with you, you won&#39;t be able to fix that in time. There was a mini conference with the ET&#39;s in a corridor and the scout ship bolted to space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was allowed out to watch as I felt the motion and I was over the moon as I felt this meant I was going with them to their planet. I saw the big ship as we approached it and was transferred to it to be repaired. Sometime during the repairs I realised I was to be returned to home and I was really upset by this so I tried to persuade them my parents didn&#39;t love me and I really wanted to go with them. They said I couldn&#39;t live with them and wouldn&#39;t explain why I couldn&#39;t then they showed me footage of my mother panicking in the house as she&#39;d gone to my bedroom and couldn&#39;t find me. They used this to show me my story about not being loved by my parents was not true as my mother was panicking so I had to be returned to her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I accepted defeat and went back to the scout ship to be returned. I asked them if they&#39;d visit us and would they please come for dinner and meet my family. The tall one asked if we would cook vegetarian and I said we had vegetarians but they were not normal, we all ate meat. The Tall one was not impressed with meat consumption. They said they would definitely be back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They dropped me off in daylight just in time for me to go to school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While wandering around the scout ship I&#39;d pocketed a small item. I&#39;d kept it with me and the little ET knew I had it. The big ET one either didn&#39;t know or pretended not to know that I had it. As I was being let out the door of the scout ship the little one said to stop me as I had an item of theirs. I was asked to stop so I did, no force was used. There ware about 4 of them grouped around me in the corridor and the tall one came over and said &#34; have you got anything&#34; I said no an the tall one immediately flashed me a telepathic warning that the others couldn&#39;t hear which said &#34;this is important - hand it over&#34; so I conceded defeat and handed it over and tried to justify it by saying &#34; I had to do it you know&#34; then I was transferred back to my bedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father saw me being returned and wouldn&#39;t touch me until Mum made him. My mother was in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unusual observations? Movements, sounds, lights, odours, etc Nothing unusual, it was a metallic disc that hovered quietly and had windows which I could see into when I was standing below it and I could see out of when I was in it. There were no surprises in the interior, it had corridors, separate rooms, a flight control area which was ergonomically correct for a 16 year old and which would have been relatively easy to learn as it looked conventional and uncluttered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The temperature was normal and the furniture was functional for humans as well as ET&#39;s. Any human would feel comfortable inside it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ET&#39;s each had distinct personalities. The tall one who did the nose operation on me in the scout ship was very familiar with humans and was relaxed around me. I could chat telepathically with it and it loved talking, it was very enthusiastic about humans and their potential and was surprised humans had not been as positive in their attitudes towards ET&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also a short ET that was a bit shorter than me. It didn&#39;t trust me and kept following me around. It nearly freaked when I wandered into the flight deck and was leaning over the instrument panel/console. I told it when I grew up I was going to fly these (I meant planes as a pilot but it thought I meant fly UFO&#39;s - it dismissed the idea of me flying UFO&#39;s when I grew up as ridiculous). The short ET had very limited experience with Humans and felt we were barbarians - not to be trusted. It was watching me to learn more about this human species that it had been warned about but had not had not seen first hand before. That&#39;s the impression I was getting from it. I didn&#39;t help improve it&#39;s attitude as it caught me trying to steal a souvenir and it kicked up quite a stink when it looked like I was going to be released with the souvenir still in my procession.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Describe your location relative to the sighting When the ship stopped above me it was say 10 - 20 metres above me and in front of me so I could easily see into it&#39;s windows and see the 2 ET&#39;s discussing me. It never landed I was in one spot one moment and in the ship in the next moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other people? Names, contact details Here are other events reported on the web concerning the UFO flap at the time 1. THE U.F.O. BBS - http://www.ufobbs.com/ufo  Originally dated 5 Aug 1993, 17:29 In the Waimata Valley, New Zealand, Decemebr 2, 1977, a farmer was awoken by his dog barking and, upon investigation, saw a landed &#34;flying saucer&#34; on the ground.  Two humanoids were carrying one of his dogs between them and moving towards the object.  They were 143 cm tall and wore close fitting, metallic silver overalls and white, opaque helmets.  These overalls were gathered at the ankles with elastic cuffs which extended over red glowing boots.  On the entities&#39; hands were large silver gauntlets with flared arm coverings extending half way up the forearms.  The white helmets were rounded like large motorcycle helmets and extended from shoulder to shoulder without any markings or openings.  Alarmed my this sight, the farmer fired a shot and apparently winged one of the entities for the two beings dropped the dog and the wounded one ran off into some nearby bushes while the other ran into the craft which took off at speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened to a near neighbour a couple of miles up the Waimata Valley road from us. It happened about a week or two after the encounter the ET&#39;s had with me. We knew of it at the time and can believe is as both the residents and the ET&#39;s seemed comfortable with each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The residents accepted the UFO&#39;s crop circles and occasional dead cow as &#34;just another day at the office&#34; and left the ET&#39;s alone and the ET&#39;s were quite cheeky with the frequency of their daytime as well as night time appearances and the evidence they were leaving around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The farmer probably shot the ET as he&#39;s shoot anyone who was stealing and hurting his dog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A story that went through Waimata Valley as that a couple of days after the event a distressed ET stepped on the road to flag down one of our neighbours as she drove to town. The silly lady floored it and left the ET by the roadside rather than stop and offer assistance. She missed an opportunity there 2.(1. Original investigation by Bryan Dickeson. 2. Retrospective investigation by Keith Basterfield &amp; Bill Chalker. 3. Dykes, M. (1981). &#34;Strangers In Our Skies.&#34; INL. Lower Hutt. pp46-49.) Three women were involved in an abduction case in the midst of a large UFO flap near Gisborne which began in 1977. One night they were lying on a hillside watching the skies, and felt that a period of &#34;missing time&#34; occurred. Shortly after the event a regression hypnosis session was arranged and an abduction scenario revealed. In 1989, during a retrospective investigation by Keith Basterfield and Bill Chalker, a regression session was conducted with one woman. This revealed an account of being drawn up a beam of light; of seeing one of the other women inside the UFO, and of talking to a male entity. All three women were then back on the hillside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven&#39;t been in touch with the above organisation but I probably know the girls involved in this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3&#34; In late December 1978, air freight pilots reported seeing unusual bright lights hovering over Kaikoura, N.Z. Two weeks later, in January 1979, the mysterious lights returned and were videotaped by Australian and New Zealand TV news agencies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Following the sightings, the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RZNAF), the police and the Centre Observatory in Wellington cooperated in an investigation, the results of which were stamped Top Secret and lodged in the National Archives in Wellington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Calling the report &#34;a whitewash,&#34; Hassall was quoted by the New Zealand Press as saying, &#34;They discussed how to deal with the problem of (UFO) reports and they all agreed to cooperate and investigate... but not tell the public they were exchanging information. Secretly they were trying to figure it out. No one wanted to deal with the problem of UFO reporting. They didn&#39;t know what to do about them, partly through a lack of resources to adequately investigate them<n>

It rests in a small valley surrounded by hills on both sides and a small creek runs about 30 feet to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Late in the evening, what looked like a helicopter search light suddenly beamed straight down over our campfire.  My husband noticed it first.  He said, &#34;((name deleted)), it&#39;s a UFO! There&#39;s no sound!&#34;  The margins of the light were well defined and shined from about 80 feet up at tree top level.  After about 10 seconds it began &#34;searching&#34; the area in a mechanical sort of way.  It shined on us for about 10 seconds and disappeared. I could not see the shape of the craft due to the brightness of the light.  There was never any sound.  My husband was terrified but calmed down quickly.  I remained calm the entire time and told him that there must be a logical explanation for this.  There was an eerie quietness in the air afterwards I felt slightly whoozy.  Soon after the incident we went to bed.  My husband made mention that it was very weird.  Oddly, we never spoke of it to each other again. That was about thirty years ago.  It wasn&#39;t until recently that I came to realized just how strange that whole event was including our odd behavior afterwards.  It is especially strange in view of the fact that I find the subject of UFOs facinating and always have.  I don&#39;t know what to make of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

She gasped and got everyone&#39;s attention by saying something about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was large, big enough to cover the entire drive in.  It was oval to oblong shaped and had a glowing reddish-orange light.  It was silent and moved very slow and consistent.   As it passed over head my mom was telling us to duck down and don&#39;t look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I was curious and tried to watch it as much as I could.  As soon as it was flying over people panicked and tried to leave the drive in.  So we did too but we wanted to try to follow it but had no luck.  As we had seen strange lights, usually white float on by nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night we spent an hour or so driving around trying to keep an eye on one.

Then all red lights went out and a few stayed on others blinked making it look like a plane as it went south towards a rocket engine testing sight called Rocket-Dyne, as it got over Rocket-Dyne all lights once again returned as it hovered for a few min. The object appeared to be disc shaped with a sail shaped rotating apparatus on top with lights at the points. This object never made a sound and was no more than 1000ft in the sky. As this object moved south it did so at about the speed as a plane. When it left it did so very fast, looking like a blue streak, you could not follow it, it was gone in a second, still never making a sound. This has been a long time ago, but I still remember all the details, this is really the first time I have had an opportunity to document it. Hoping there are others who witnessed the same object.<n>

This was a spot I had camped at several times, just off of Route 302.  I had always been there with others previously.  This time I went up alone, on a motorcycle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The campsite was in a wooded area, but by the river there was a clear view of much of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was probably the latter part of the evening, so it was dark.  No rain.  I think it was a reasonably clear sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went down by the river, maybe to get some water, and I happened to look up at the night sky, as I typically do.  I noticed a round white light.  It was maybe twice the size of any of the visible planets.  It was stationary, until it moved, with no acceleration, from where it had been to another point, stopping immediately with no deceleration.  This sequence repeated itself a few times over the next several minutes.  It was hard to tell how high the object was, because there was no way to tell how large it was.  It made no sound, but the river runs rather fast along this section, and is shallow and rocky, so the noise of the river may have muffled any sound.  Nothing other than this transpired.  No one else was at the site, so I couldn’t get anyone to corroborate.  It was getting late, and no new developments seemed likely, so I went back to the campsite and ultimately to sleep.  But I was wondering who else in the area may have seen this, so, the next morning, and the mor! ning after, I checked all the available newspapers, but to no avail.  I didn’t report anything myself to any authority, though I’ve told the story to various people over the years when I thought they’d be receptive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My best guess is the late 70s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My then sister-in-law (She is no longer my sister-in-law and unfortunely have lost contact with her.) and I was coming out of her apartment which was a two family house at the end of a dead end road in Meriden to go to the car.  It was just around 8 p.m.. I am unsure as to were we were going but I think she was giving me a ride back to my house in Southington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked down a set of steep steps going down to the car (at that time, noticed nothing in the sky even being up at a higher level).  By the time we got down to the road at the car, we started seeing some very large object in the sky which was moving very slowly and seemed to just appear from a set of trees to the right.  As I said, I was a child at the time so details are sketchy.  What I do remember is it was very large 200-300 feet, it was oval in shaped, many lights around the edges and I believe the object was a dark gun metal color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my sister-in-law were pretty scared at the time.  The object just appeared to be hovering or stopped.  Then ever so slowly it would move.  We got in the car and started to drive down the road.  As we were driving down the road, we saw someone walking on the side of the road.  My sister-in-law stopped and said to this guy who was probably about in his 30s &#34;Do you see what we are seeing?&#34;.  I remember he said &#39;Yea, What is that?&#34;.  My sister-in-law said &#39;We don&#39;t know but we are going to follow it&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued down the road keeping the object within our vision at all times.  We got on the 691 highway heading towards Southington as that appeared where it was heading.  The object picked up some speed but was still flying low.  When we were on the highway, we saw a bunch of cars slow down and put their brake lights on as I am sure they were just as curious to what this was.  It was getting a little more difficult to follow it once on the highway because the object did pick up speed. As we went by high cliffs (that were near Hubbard Park) that were on the right side of the highway we lost track of the object.  After we got past the cliffs, we looked in the sky to see where it was and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said, unfortunetly, I am not in contact with my now ex-sister in law anymore as she would probably remember more details of the event then me because she was mouch older. Even years after this happened, I remember her saying to me....&#39;Do you remember that night we saw that thing in the sky?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then, I&#39;ve always been curious as to if any other reports came out around this time and saw the same thing as we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

After at least 2 hours of staring in amazement, the (rain-bow) ships, I can see why their referred as a fire-ball, were doing grid-pattern manuevers, I was told that the mother-ship that these came from would send a blue light over this old alter,installed by a person in the 1920&#39;s that I should not mention.  The transparent blue light, over the alter, got slowly brighter and brighter.It was still transparent when 1 of the 2 other people already there held my friend by the shoulders and past his head though the light.  I immediately got right behind my friend and tried to look up at the light.I was told that it and was told that it would damage my eyes.  So he past my head though the light face-down.

At first I thought it was a Goodyear blimp or an airliner, but it was too close to the trees tops over head. The object was motionless. The large object appeared to have a row of light on its side and made a deep humming sound. There were a number of smaller lights that appeared to be surrounding the object. I have no idea what the object was. My friend and I watched the object for a few minutes and proceeded down the mountain. It has been a number of years since this observation and I can still picture it in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I didn’t think anything of it as I thought that there was a radio tower in that direction. We continued south on University and after we left the light at Sunrise Drive I noticed that the red light was still off to the east. I remember thinking, “That’s weird, that light should be behind us by now.” As we dove further south, maybe around Cleary Blvd, both my wife and I noticed that the light was moving SW and furthermore it looked like it was on an intersect path with University Drive. As we approached the traffic light at NW 5th St. and University Drive we both commented that the “light” was coming directly in our direction and was very close, within a few hundred yards. I stopped the car at the traffic light and we both looked out our windows and watched this ‘thing’ fly directly over us at a very slow speed...maybe 25 MPH, if that fast. The craft was also at a very low altitude, maybe 500-750 feet. The strange thing was that neither of us heard any engine sound at all. Not a prop engine, jet engine or chopper engine was to be heard. There was no sound at all that either of us could make out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After sitting there for what seemed several minutes, probably in shock, I made the turn east onto NW 5th St. heading toward 70th Ave where I had to go south one block to the entrance to our apartment building. As I made the turn I asked my wife something to the effect of “You saw that right?”  Yes was the answer and started to talk about what we had just seen. Although neither of us could clearly make out a distinct shape, we knew that we had seen “something” and whatever it was it was strange to say the least. This discussion continued for another minute or so when we both went quiet. There, dead ahead of us, out in the eastern sky, was another red light. This was probably around the 73rd Ave block of NW 5th St., just west of the new city hall. As we approached the intersection of NW 70 Ave this red light suddenly erupted into a display of different colored lights. There were red, green and yellow lights flashing on and off in no distinct pattern for maybe 10 seconds and, again it returned to just the single red light. I pulled over onto a swale area where there was a mailbox on the right side of the road. I told my wife to get out of the car as I wanted us both to make sure that we were seeing the same thing. The red light seemed to be stationary for a minute or two as we stood there watching. Again I asked my wife if she had just seen the light display that I had seen. She answered yes and then we both observed that the light seemed to be moving toward our position. We stood there on the side of the road watching as this craft passed almost directly overhead. It was, like the first craft, about 500-700 feet altitude. The night was still, not a car in sight and I had cut the engine of the car. This time we both could make out a distinct, but faint, low toned hum as the ‘thing’ passed over. We both could also make out, against the night sky, that the red light was on the bottom of the craft and that it was circular in shape, almost a perfect circle it seemed. The craft again was moving very slowly, 20 M! PH or so , and heading south by southwest. When we noticed this we both said, almost simultaneously, that it looked like it was heading to meet up with the first craft that we had seen just a few minutes earlier at University and NW 5th St. We watched as long as we could see the light, got into the car and drove the block south on 70th Ave to our apartment. I immediately went to the kitchen phone and called the Plantation police department to ask if anyone had reported a unidentified craft at either of the intersections where we had witnessed these things. The officer kind of laughed and said no. I then called the Ft. Lauderdale airport and asked if they had anything on radar out in our area. Again the answer was no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither my wife or I ever made an official report of any kind during our time together. We separated in 1989 and divorced in 1992 and lost contact so I don’t know if she has ever reported it. I have only told a handful of people about this until now and am only reporting it now because my current wife found this web page. After reading a few of the hundreds of reports I felt compelled to add my own story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/1/77 02:00|Hanna City|IL|Cylinder|2-3 minutes|Encounter with small UFO drone-type object|6/23/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75884.html|73|ndxe197706| Encounter with small UFO drone-type object<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> This was an unusual encounter unlike any that most people describe. For the 13 years that followed, I assumed it was just a bad dream, that was until my Mother described having had witnessed something exactly identical that had also occurred to her 13 years prior, in the same location but on a different night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening in 1977, in a small apartment building in Hanna City, Illinois, I as a 5 yr old child, had been awoken to something that was incomprehensible and terrifying.  This particular night, I went into my Mother’s bed to sleep which was not routine for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime during the night, I was awoken by a strange cylindrical, machine-like object. It was approximately the size of a coffee can, maybe a little bigger. It hovered 3 to 4 inches off the floor and spun silently as it moved around the bedroom. There was a slight glow around this object and it seemed to almost have intelligence about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How it got into the building, I don’t know. I was positioned on the right side of my Mother’s queen-sized bed, and she was asleep on the left. She never awoke during my witnessing of this object. I first noticed it as it entered through the bedroom door on the right hand side of the room. It was metallic and appeared to have sharp edges. After it made its entrance into the bedroom, it hovered in front of the foot of the bed going right to left. I could see its glow cast just below the foot before it had emerged into sight. It then proceeded to come back and make a turn around the right front portion of the bed and slowly approached me along the right side of the bed still hovering/spinning approximately 3-4 inches off the floor. As it made its way to just below where I was sitting watching it, it ascended up to my level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was paralyzed with terror, I could not scream or move. I lost all consciousness and never had another experience like it again. I have no memory of what occurred after that, what it was, or why it was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 13 years later, when I was 18, the experience came up in conversation between Mom and I somehow, and I learned it was not just a dream. She had the exact, identical experience, same description, and same outcome as I did. Since then, we have been completely at a loss for an explanation of what it was. We have been trying to find other’s with the same experience/sighting. I have a feeling it may have been some type of alien drone or probe, for it wasn’t much like a ghost or apparition. I have read about hundreds of E.T. and UFO sightings, but nothing is described to like what my Mother and I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had only one actual, “typical” UFO sighting since that thing in the bedroom.  In February, 1994, at  Ft.  Leonardwood, MO.  Between the hours of 10:00 &amp; 11:00, on a clear day, there was a silver, diamond-shaped UFO in the sky moving in all sorts of sharp angular directions, and traveling from one end of the sky to the other in just fractions of a second, which must have been at least 200 miles ground distance. I had no other witnesses, but I was fully coherent and aware of what I was witnessing. It was visible for maybe about a minute, and it took off and disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no question about the UFO sighting in Missouri, for it seems to be like one of thousands of accounts. But nothing compares to the mechanical-cylindrical object that both my Mother and I witnessed on different occasions without knowledge of each other’s experience of it. I would love to know if anyone has an idea of what it really was, what its purpose was, and why only my Mother and I had the experience with it. To this day, I’m baffled but open to any explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident in 1977 is approximate.  PD))<n>

After just seeing a show about a UFO sighting in 2000 in Illinois by some guy and 4 police, I have to share this with people who are actually interested in this sort of thing as I’ve always felt I should have documented it some how.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up in south Florida but have lived in another state for over 20 years.  I am a 47 year old professional and I am an outdoor enthusiast. I am in to nature and have always had a keen awareness of my environment and surroundings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Twenty nine to thirty years ago I saw a huge wedge shaped object fly directly over me in Coral Springs FL.  At a very late hour, 1 AM, 2 AM or somewhere there about, after dropping a friend off, I was east bound on Sample Rd and was stopped at a red light at Coral Hills Dr. Back then, populations were less and there were no other cars on the road.  While sitting at the light, it was like it came out of nowhere but suddenly appeared over the tree tops heading due south at about a block west of University Dr which was one block east. It was so low that a shot from a shotgun would have easily hit it.  It was so long I leaned onto the passenger seat and could see the bottom as it came over, but then sat back up and could still see it on the driver’s side and it moved slow at maybe 30 mph. It probably took at least 30 seconds to pass completely over me. It got about a mile ahead of me by the time the light changed and I could run up and turn south on University. It never seemed to speed up but gradually got further as I kept catching red lights and after several miles, I stopped following and turned around but noticed it appeared to be starting to turn toward Ft Laud airport. That fact has always made me question what I absolutely know I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always described it as being as long a football field and wedge shaped. Like on the TV show it was an elongated triangle shape. It had the 3 white lights, one in each corner, and the red flashing light rear of center. It was not black like in the 2000 sighting. It was more gray color and I remember it having what looked like steel plating. It made NO noise what so ever and I don’t remember the lights being overly bright. It was fairly pointed at the front and about as wide as a four lane road with a median. I remember the rear once it passed over was thick or tall (it had huge mass) but I don’t remember it being lit across the rear. It had no wings and the fact that I could hear nothing as it passed over still makes no sense to me.  Another thing that’s always made me question my own eyes was the tree tops didn’t sway or bend what so ever, but as close as it was I’ve always thought there should have been at least a breeze if not wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never stopped having a hard time believing what I saw that night until seeing that show on the 2000 sighting in Illinois.  The descriptions and 3D images were so similar, I got goose bumps while watching and it felt like I was seeing my experience all over again. All these years I’ve wished I would see one again to prove to myself I wasn’t nuts and that TV show was like I was seeing it again. That show ended by noting secret military craft stay secret usually around 10 years. Well, like I said in the beginning, I saw mine 29 to 30 years ago so maybe I did see what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was between 6 to 8 feet long and and about 4ft. in hieght. There is only about 12ft of distance between both houses so it couldnt have been very wide.We could see them looking at us as we looked at them. it just hovered there for at least ten seconds until it zipped away with flashing speed.My parents got divorced later that year.My older brother had to see a shrink due to his fear of the dark/ufos shortly after. Ive never spoken about this outside of the family before.My brother gets very uptight whenever I bring up the subject.My mom also avoids the subject.We all know what we saw and I at least have no doubt.                           NOTE: the craft had  a humming sound to it<n>
6/1/77|Clements|CA|Changing||Once again we forgot the event happened, until years later, looking back I realized we have missing time. 500 Lights On Object0: Ye|1/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86712.html|78|ndxe197706| Once again we forgot the event happened, until years later, looking back I realized we have missing time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1977 Members of our family start discussing the UFO events in our life. Other family members have had their own experiences. But we are discussing the Fricot City event and our reaction during the event and afterwards, the next morning, (we as a family, all have had visits but have never been comfortable talking about those event even to each other.. Its an overwhelming feeling we arent suppose to speak about the visits! So we finally do, began asking each other why us, why the cover ups, what really going on, what the Aliens want with us, what does our family have that they need.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was a child we lived in a car, traveling from one end of the west coast to the other including Oregon. We camped out a lot. But they still found us.! So we were contemplating how they knew our where abouts and seem to know every thing about us.  Other the years I have done research lots of reading and I learned about the implants from other abductees and it’s the only way the Aliens could have found us!! So the same night after our family discussion at my brothers house, (we had never told our children about The UFO until this night)  the kids and I are  going home, traveling  down hwy 12/88 as we approach the intersection of Hwy 12/88 we see lights in the alflefa  field next to the road,, red, green, blue, pulsating  lights appear in the field next to the road, one of the children ask if it’s a UFO, Im teasing the kids, we are all laughing and I tell then maybe, mean while the UFO is moving very very fast back and forth and I made a turn onto Tuttle Rd, the UFO passed over the car, the lights and engine died while the car is now moving in the dark night, when I become aware again the car is passing over the train tracks the lights and engine come back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
