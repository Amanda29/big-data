12/23/73 16:00|Colorado/Oklahoma (in flight)|CO|Disk|1-5 minutes?|Metallic disk with rotating orange lights seen from the window of a commercial aircraft between Dallas and Denver.|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54065.html|1|ndxe197312| Metallic disk with rotating orange lights seen from the window of a commercial aircraft between Dallas and Denver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was flying home for Christmas from Florida via Dallas/Denver on a commercial aircraft probably Braniff or American. We were at cruising altitude (30,000 ft?) between Dallas and Denver. I was gazing out the airplane window towards the west when a light from behind the plane caught my eye. I looked back and saw a saucer/disk flying parallel to the plane a couple of hundred yards from the plane and slightly lower. I watched while the disk caught up to the plane, passed it, and continued on ahead of the plane until I lost sight of it due to the angle of my line of sight out the plane window. The disk was fully visible and relatively close so that I had an unimpeded view of the side and top of the disk. The disk itself was a silvery, metallic color and was shaped very much like an upside down saucer. Around the circumference of the disk, there were rotating bright orange lights and stationary orange lights, looking very much like the wooden spokes of a vintage car when it travels at a certain speed and it looks like the spokes are stationary. There were no markings or external features of any kind on the surface of the disk and no signs of a vapour trail or obvious propulsion system. My feeling at the time was that the disk was about 40 feet across and 15 feet high. During the sighting I glanced around the cabin of the plane to see if anyone else had seen it, but there were very few passengers aboard and of those, no one seemed to be looking out my side of the plane. I would be thrilled if the captain and airline crew on this flight contacted you and made a report of their sighting because they could not have helped seeing this disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m only sorry I didn&#39;t talk to them after the flight or remembered the flight number but at the time I was quite satisfied with the fact that I had seen this disk. I thought at the time that this could be some kind of experimental aircraft but I have to this day not seen anything like it. I submitted a report to one of the UFO agencies back in 1983 or 84 and it was published in their journal, Alan Hynek wrote a little comment on it. But since it isn&#39;t in your database I thought I should send it to you as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
12/15/73 01:00|Olympia|WA|Diamond|appox 10 mins|Diamond shaped object flying south from Seattle towards Portland with 1 light on each corner and a red beam rotating from underneath.|2/11/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27298.html|2|ndxe197312| Diamond shaped object flying south from Seattle towards Portland with 1 light on each corner and a red beam rotating from underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 15 and was staying the night at a girl friends house along with another friend.  Her parents and grandparents were playing bridge in the dining room. One of my friends had her car there and we were going to go to the store but her battery was dead.  Another friend down the road about 3 blocks had jumper cables so we were walking down to get them, when one friend pointed to the tree tops and said &#34;What is that?&#34;  It looked like 3 head lights coming over the trees. Before I had time to think she yelled &#34;oh my god&#34; and we all started running back to the house.  When we go to the porch I looked out from under the over hang and saw a large diamond shaped craft flying just above tree level.  There was a bright headlight colored light on each corner with a red light in the middle that had a red beam shining out and rotating around.  It was grayish in color with no apparent seams.  The sound was similar to an electric razor hum but not as loud.  It flew about 5 mph in a straight line with no sudden movements or turns.  We watched it until it disappeared from sight.  My best guess is that it was about twice the size of a football field.  We try to get my friends parents to come and look but only her little sister came out. When she looked up she let out a blood curdling scream and ran in the house. My friend refused to talk about it and I have not seen them since that year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

IT&#39;S WINGS WERE ON FIRE. WE STOPED THE CAR AND WATCHED WHAT AFTER A CLOSER LOOK WAS A BLACK WING. THE CLOUD COVER WAS AT 10000 FT THAT EVENING. IT WAS JUST UNDER THE CLOUDS. THE FLAMES WERE REENTRY HEAT FLAMES. WING SPAN WAS ABOUT 600 FT. WITH A DEPTH OF ABOUT 100 FT. WE BOTH THOUGHT IT WOULD CRASH. IT JUST KEPT IT&#39;S HIGHT AND VANISHED WEST OVER THE OLYMPIC MT&#39;S. I WAS EXCITED THAT WE HAD SEEN A UFO AND BEING NEW YEARS I WAS SURE OTHERS HAD SEEN THE THE SAME THING. WE TURNED ON THE RAIDO AND SURE, OTHERS HAD SEEN THE SAME THING. I FACT THE RAIDO STATION SAID THEY HAD OVER 600 CALLS. THE RAIDO STATION CALLED THE AIR FORCE BASE THAT THE WING WOULD HAVE PASED OVER AND THEY SAID THAT IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN SKY ROCKETS OVER LAKE UNION!! IT TRAVLED SO SLOW AND THE SITING WAS SO CLEAR THE COVER UP SO WEAK. WE CAN&#39;T TRUST ARE OWN PEOPLE. THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

12/5/73 19:00|Glen Rose|AR|Light|20 minutes|Followed by a bright light .|9/24/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31645.html|4|ndxe197312| Followed by a bright light .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were coming back from Malvern on hwy.67 going to Traskwood and we saw a light that looked like it was riding along aside of us, about 30,000 feet up in the sky. It followed us for 7 or 8 miles,then we took a right on the Glen Rose, Traskwood cutt-off road and the light was still beside us about the distance up in the sky. It followed us 3 to 5 miles and my brother that was driving started to flash his headlights and then stopped in the middle of the road. The light stop when we did and stayed where it was about 1 minute and the light went straight down real slow behind a house about 1/2 mile behind the house until we couldn&#39;t see the light any more. I was screaming go, go, go, and was crying. I was seven years old, so it really shook me up. We never heard anything about it from the news or anybody.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
12/3/73 19:00|Avoca|IA|Unknown|1 hour|Stationary bright white light that turned red and appeared to envelope the object once it started to move at a high speed.|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16404.html|5|ndxe197312| Stationary bright white light that turned red and appeared to envelope the object once it started to move at a high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occured in a rural area 4.5 miles west of Avoca, Ia. I was home on leave from the Coast Guard, and was visiting my mother and step-father who lived on a farm. Earlier in the day I went to visit a friend on his farm. My friend&#39;s farm is located in a hollow area between two hills, therefore I couldn&#39;t see much of the surrounding sky. I drove east 1.5 miles to a road that runs north and south. When I turned to go north, I started looking around, and noticed a bright white light low in the southwestern sky. The evening was crystal clear, because we had an ice storm the night before, and the night after an ice storm is usually clear. At first I thought it was an aircraft moving toward me with its landing lights on. To the southwest is Eppley Airport in Omaha, Nebraska, and Offut Air Force Base which is near Omaha. I am also an amature astronimer, and I know there were no planets or bright stars in that area of the sky on that date. I stopped the car and watched the light for a few minutes, then I drove onto the next road and turned west. As I drove home, I noticed when I crested the top of each hill, the light was still in the southwest. The object didn&#39;t appear to have moved any, because I took visual measurements using the farm yard lights near the object. When I got home I took out the binoculars, and tried to see if I could make out what it was. All I could see was a very bright white light. I put the binoculars in the house, and went back outside to watch the light. My step-father came out of the house, and wanted to go to town. The town he wanted to go to is Shelby. As we drove west down the hill I saw the bright white light go out, and the object turned to what appeared to be a reddish glow which appeared to envelop the object.  The object went from a standstill to a very high rate of speed in just a few seconds. I watched it travel north and inside of a minute or two it was gone. I said to my step-father that the bright white light that I had been watching was acting strange. It was bright white and dead still one second, then it turned red and sped off in the next second. I said to my step-father the U.S. doesn&#39;t have any aircraft that can do that. He who is one not to believe in anything strange unless it can be proved, said it was just an airplane or something. I thought it was an &#34;or something&#34;. The next day on the front page of the Council Bluffs Nonpariel newspaper was a story about the object I had seen the night before. A woman was driving with her children down a country road to her father-in-law&#39;s house to stay with him, because her house didn&#39;t have any electricity. The woman said she was driving west and saw the object. She said that when she went over the next hill, she drove right under the object. She said when she drove under the object the bright white light went out, it turned red and sped off to the north. This is occured exactly at the same time I was watching it. I will never forget this sighting as long as I live.<n>
