I looked up to the East sky and first noticed a light which was moving from south to north.  It looked like a star but it was moving straight and then became very irraticate.  It then disappeared so I looked away and looked again to the East when I saw something very large moving very slowly.  It was totally black and was the shape of a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had three lights on each side at the wide side of the V.  It was a solid object and there was absolutely no noise at all.  It was going about five miles a hour and was only about thirty to forty feet high.  I tried getting an approximate height by comparing it to our house and the neighbours house.  It came right over our adjoining driveways.  I could see it was black because the street light and our light on the side of our house gave enough light just to reflect light off the UFO.  We have a park behind us but I was too afraid to go to our backyard to see where it went.  When my cab came I told him about it and we both looked for it but it was gone.  I would estimate it to be between 60 - 70  feet across and about 40 - 50 feet long.  I could have hit it with a rock - also the lights were not lit up but were sort of florescent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a truly amazing UFO and I am very glad that I can finally share it with other people that have had a similar experience.<n>

I WAS 17 YEARS OLD AND CAMPING WITH MY SISTER AND SOME FRIENDS AT A LAKE IN SOUTHERN WASHINGTON CALLED CRATER LAKE.  AT APPROX. 2130 HRS., WE WERE SITTING AROUND A CAMP FIRE WHEN WE NOTICED A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT COMING OFF OF THE MOUNTAIN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE.  THE LIGHT LIFTED OFF OF THE MOUNTAIN AND FLEW ACCROSS THE LAKE IN A STREIGHT PATTERN.  A FEW MINUTES LATER ANOTHER LIGHT DID THE SAME THING EXCEPT THIS TIME I FLASHED A FLASH LIGHT AT IT.  WE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A HELICOPTER LIGHT OR AN AIRPLANE OF SOME SORT BUT THE AIRCRAFT DID NOT MAKE ANY NOISE THAT WE COULD TELL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> LATER THAT NIGHT, AND I DONT KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS, I WAS SLEEPING IN AN OPEN SCREENED ROOF DOME TENT WHEN I WOKE UP.  IM NOT SURE WHY I WOKE UP, BUT AS I LOOKED UP, A TRIANGLER SHAPED AIRCRAFT HOVERED ABOVE OUR CAMP.  IT WAS VERY LARGE AND APPARED TO BE ONLY A FEW HUNDRED FEET UP.  THE AIRCRAFT MADE A SLIGHT HISSING AND ROARING NOISE BUT IT WAS VERY FAINT.  I COULD NOT MOVE OUT OF FEAR BUT I DID NOTICE THAT THERE WAS A BRIGHT ROUND LIGHT ON EACH CORNER OF THE AIRCRAFT.  I ALSO NOTICED THAT THE AIRCRAFT HAD A ROUNDED OFF EDGE, KIND OF LIKE A TIRE TUBE.  I COULD SEE A CROSS BEAM TYPE STRUCTURE AROUND THE AIRCRAFT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I JUMPED UP OUT OF BED AND RAN OUT OF MY TENT YELLING FOR MY SISTER.  AS I STARTED YELLING, THE AIRCRAFT SLOWLY FLEW OUT OF SIGHT OVER THE MOUNTAINS BEHIND US. THE NEXT MORNING MY SISTER WAS TELLING ME THAT SHE THOUGHT I WAS TRYING TO PLAY A JOKE ON HER THE NIGHT BEFORE.  SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS WOKEN UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BY SOME COLORFULL LIGHTS SHINNING IN HER TENT.  SHE THOUGHT IN HER SLEEP THAT IT WAS A COP CAR OUTSIDE AND FELT FRUSTRATED.  SHE TOLD ME IN THE MORNING THAT SHE REALIZED THAT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A COP CAR BECAUSE WE WERE ON AN ISLAND WITH NO BRIDGE ACCESS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A LITTLE BIT OF MY BACKGROUND:  I HAVE BEEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR APPROX. 2 YEARS.  I HAVE SERVED IN THE US MILITARY AND IM NOT SAYING THAT THIS THING WAS FROM ANOTHER PLANET, BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYHTING LIKE IT BEFORE OR SINCE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I heard a friend who was sitting at the top of the stadium talking loudly and I looked in his direction.  My eyes were drawn above the top seats of the stadium, where I saw three craft flying in a V shaped formation.  I thought little of it since there is an Air Force base near the school and I have seen airplanes fly out of the base under cover of darkness and escorted by quiet helicopters before.  Later on I began asking people who are familiar with military aircraft if they had seen or were aware of the type of aircraft I had seen that night.  They all said no.  The craft were different than anything I had ever seen before in that they seemed to be flying at a speed and height comparable to a regular aircraft when approaching for landing, made absolutely no noise, and had lights which moved around the bottom of each craft in a broken triangular pattern.   The lights were white.  I saw no landing type lights in areas where I would expect wings to be.  I could not see a definite shape to the crafts, only the shape of the lights.  I am curious whether anyone else has seen aircraft similar to these/this, with lights in a broken triangular pattern on the bottom.  Do we have military aircraft with these types of lights?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I mean that the light was not coming in the the window, but just hitting the window.  The room was not lighting up at all with these colors.  There was no sound coming from outside.  The blue and yellow light would alternate about every 10 seconds.  This window was facing our backyard.  There is a 7 foot fence that blocks any car lights from the street.  I did get up as soon as the light stopped to check the backyard for anyone in the yard playing a trick, but there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It glides by quickly and silently, then disappears<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I had just finished dinner at the restaurant at our Honeymoon Resort when we decided to walk along the beach back to our rooms. Most of the resort guests were at a barbeque on the nearby (50 yards away) island called Kokomo, so the resort was fairly quiet and we were alone, except for maybe an employee now and then. We decided to stop and enjoy the stars. We were both silently enjoying the view when I noticed a huge black object. ( I cannot however, determine how far away it was) it cast a slight reflection on the underneath side of it, as if the moon were glowing on it. The only way to describe the shape is to say it looked like a large stingray without a tail sailing through the sky. It did not make a sound, and it lasted only seconds. I could not figure out what I had seen, I hesitated, and then asked my husband if he had seen it too. He said yes, and said he was glad I had seen it because he though it was his imagination. We tried to explain it to ourselve!s, but the only thing we could come up with was that maybe it was a large black bird gliding over the water. But the only birds we had ever seen near the bay were totally white. The bird would have also had to have been within 5 feet in front of us to appear so large. We would have seen the bird clearly because the resort had small lamps that lit the nearby walkways, and we were able to view a gazebo that stretched out in front of us about 25 feet away. We tried unsuccessfully to see the object again, and finally gave up after about 15 minutes. I don&#39;t really recall the exact moment of the sighting, because it happened over a year ago, but we did immediately tell our family about in when we returned home. My husband and I are both college educated, 25 years old, and are successfully employed in the Washington, DC metro area. Please use this information as you wish. If it means anything to you, or is similar to anything ever reported, then please feel free to let us know, other!wise we just wanted to tell our story and remain anonymous. Thank you.<n>

Tyrone, Northern IrelandOctober 1995<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear enough night in October 1995 as far as I remember and myself and my girlfriend at the time were walking up to my friend’s sister’s house as he was babysitting and wanted some company. He lived up in the country above my village in Sion Mills, Co. Tyrone so it was a really dark road with no street lights at all. We were walking along the road hand in hand talking and I was looking at the ground just to see where I was going when I saw what looked like two circles of light on the ground about a foot in front of us as if someone was standing over us pointing two torches at the ground. As soon as I saw this I squeezed my girl’s hand in fear and we both looked up to see what looked like two suns flying over our heads at a good speed. They were only in view for about three seconds but I still remember them to this day as they flew over our heads and over the hill at the top of the lane. I cant remember if they made any sound although I don’t think that they did and I’m not sure how high in the sky they were as I don’t know what size they were but they were about the size of two suns and that’s  the only way I can describe them. They were bright and orange in colour though not so bright that they lit up the countryside just bright enough for us to see them shining on the ground. I’ve never forgotten this and although my girlfriend and I have split up since we still talk about it whenever we see each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My wife being directly underneath saw a dome shape on the belly with white lights going around it. After the incident we  went about our usual business without remembering it for well over an hour. Also, there was no updraft or even a leaf moving on the ground. My wife also had a rash on her neck shortly after the incident.<n>

I was at 5500 feet msl traveling at 115 kias.  The weather was clear and the wind less than 10 knots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 miles west of Syracuse I noticed an object off my left wing.  It was keeping pace with me about 100 feet off the wing.  It was shaped like two convex plates one on top of the other wih the two plates being seperated by a row of bright but not dazzling cobalt bule lights.  The row of lights was about 2 feet tall. the ufo was about 7 to eight feet thick and about 35 feet in diameter.  The skin of the ufo was a metalic silver color.  It was a dull almost brushed steel finish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought that is was from Griffiss air force base just north and slightly east of my path of travel. When I called Syracuse airport (the controling agency in that piece of sky) they were showing no traffic near me.  The Ufo then moved directly ahead of me and still kept pace with me.  There was no wake turbulance from the ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned off all of my external and internal lights even my instrument panel and radio lights in case it was just some sort of wierd refelection.

I had a similar sighting around or on that date.  I cannot remember the exact time or date but the sighting is pretty much the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading home from my girlfriends house in Hilton NY between 2200 and 2300.  I was driving along the parkway, east to Rochester.  I noticed off to my left (north) a blue light over Lake Ontario. The light was moving south and then it banked to the east when it got to the edge of the water. That’s when I noticed the blue windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The more I looked at it the more it freaked me out.  It was saucer shaped with 5 or 6 blue windows or lights in the middle of it.  It was shaped like two convex plates one on top of the other with the two plates being separated by a row of bright but not dazzling cobalt blue lights.  The row of lights was about 2 feet tall.  The UFO was about 7 to eight feet thick and about 35 feet in diameter.  (I am using the dimensions from the other sighting because they are the same).  The skin of the UFO was a metallic silver color.  It was a dull almost brushed steel finish.  It followed along side of me over the edge of the water for a few miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to get really scared so I decided to get off the parkway and take some back roads home to my dad’s house.  After I got off the parkway I couldn’t see the object anymore. I was coming around this corner when I saw the object hovering over some trees off to my right (south). Then I was really scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started driving about 50 miles per hour in these residential areas. The object followed me for a couple more miles until I got to the power plant.  Then it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing really scared me and I am freaked out right now just writing this event down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am going to email a map of the area and try and make a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At the time of this incident, I was working as a receptionist for a law firm, and I was thirty years old. I grew up in North Carolina, and I am very familiar with our weather and our roads. I&#39;ve always considered myself to be open-minded, but at the time that this occured, I was very skeptical of ufo sightings. It was about 8:30 p.m. on a Sunday. My former wife and I were leaving town after visiting my grandparents. It was raining especially hard as we reached the stop sign where we would turn onto highway #1, so I was watching the road intently (I was driving) while my wife was looking at me and telling me some family business. There was &#34;nothing coming&#34; so I turned left onto the highway, into the closer, left lane, and began to accelerate. I was responding to my wife&#39;s comments when I noticed what looked like something dark moving at the edge of the right lane about a hundred feet ahead. I thought it might be a dog, so I took my foot off the accelerator (we had only gotten up to about thirty miles per hour, and we immediately lost a good deal of that). When the dark spot moved into the middle of the road and was thoroughly illuminated, I was shocked to see that it was not a thing but the absence of something. Moving into my lane, was a circle about four feet wide of dark pavement, upon which the rain was not falling. I imagined an updraft or other weather anomaly was responsible, but a gust of wind rocked the car, and at the same time, the circle went slightly oval in shape--then back to circular as the wind eased off. I thought it would fall apart at any second, but it didn&#39;t, and as it grew closer, I leaned forward and peered at the edges of the circle. They were perfectly defined by the rain pummeling itself into mist outside the circle, giving the rest of the road a gray/white look. There appeared to be no transitional area-- absolutely no water was entering the circle. I remember my mouth falling open in shock as I saw this (about fifteen feet away). Before I could react, our paths were intersecting. I experienced time dilation at that point--the normal kind, caused by adrenalin, which seems to make every- thing go in slow motion. I watched the rain stop pounding on the hood, saw the circular edge move onto the windshield, and then heard the gap in the sound of rain hitting the roof--it was if we had gone under a bridge. Instinctively, I hit the brakes and stared into the rearview mirror. I saw only the area of road behind us lit up in the red glow of the tailights and that another car was cresting a hill about a mile back. Just as instinctively, when I saw the area lit up with my brakes, I took my foot off the brake pedal out of fear of alerting IT, and sped very quickly away from there. As I did this, I turned to my confused wife, and in a shaky, excited voice, said, &#34;Did you SEE that?&#34; And she responded, &#34;See what?&#34; I tried to convince myself it was some sort of weather anomaly and made a mental note to check into it. About a year later, I read some ufo literature and was shocked to find out how often craft of four feet or under are reported--up until that time, my chief point of scepticism was the small size of the unseen object. (i.e. Who would come across interstellar space in such a tiny craft?) This could have occured in October or November--I&#39;m just not certain, but I could probably pin it down if I compared my calendar from that year with meteorological data for the area. Three notes: The area the circle seemed to be coming from is a kudzu- covered swampy forest. There is a pond nearby and a line of high voltage towers.If the circle was caused by an object overhead, it appeared that this object was moving under its own power when I first saw it, but after entering the illuminated area, it appeared to be at the mercy of the wind. I think this shows intent--I think we surprised it, and it cut out power movement until we had passed under.<n>

My boys and I were setting up camp.    All of us had gone inside to get our beds ready.     All of  a sudden the inside of the camper started to light up.    It was a white almost blinding light.    We all  jumped out of the camper to see what was going on.     While getting out of the camper  we could see something in the sky.   It was coming out of the northeast.   A large bright ball of light was coming towards us  high in the sky.    It seemed as if small part  were falling off as it passed overhead.    In addition,   as it passed over us,    it lit up the whole mountain side just  as if it was daylight.    After it had passed overhead,    going southwest,  it disappeared over the mountain top.   We did not hear any kind of noise when it passing overhead.  It  seemed as if it had ( landed / crashed) on the other side of the mountains from us,   or at least part of it did.    We did try and look for it,    but could not find anything. We called down into town on our CB radio and had people say that they had seen it to.  They told us the the news had said it was just a meteor and that it had landed off the coast of Calif.   We also heard people say it was suppost to be a rocket that had taken off from southern Calif. and crashed in the sea.  However ,  approx. one week later,    at about 10pm, we spotted lights on the mountain side.     The lights were white and appeared to float around as if they were looking for something.    We thought it might be a car/truck at first,    but we could see car lights in other parts of the mountains.    The car lights shifted around as they drove on the dirt roads.    They had two headlights that move togather.    These lights were three seperate lights that did not move togather.     They moved in random order,     in straight lines.    They were flying in the same location we saw the meteor / rocket go down.     We watched the three lights fly around for approx. 20 to25 min.  after that,     they flew up above the mountains and straight away from us until they disappeared.<n>

We were heading home toward I 85 in Cummings I believe the road was named 365 back then. It was a two lane back road. It was a very dark clear night. Driving around 55 mph. I notice my three children were looking out the back of my van and I could not see behind me. I asked them what they were doing and they said Mommy we are kind of scared there is something following us it is a bright white light. I asked how long it has been following us? They said shortly after we got out side of town where there was no lights. I looked and seen what they were talking about and I slowed down to about 20 miles mph. It did get closer quickly and it was following us. This road was a back road and we only seen maybe two cars pass by.  The kids stared screaming Mom it is getting closer I looked and it was. I started speeding up to about 55 mph it did to I went 70 mph well it did two. I noticed that the oval shape light was moving in and out in between trees and an unbelievable amount of speed. I knew I was about 30 miles from the interstate I85. I speed up to 80 mph and it speed up to still weaving in between the trees. It scared the scrap out of me. Being chase and not knowing what in the world this craft was. Kids were scared and crying by this time. I increase my speed to 95 mph it did to. Now it is by this time to close and still doing the zigzag through the trees. I was to scared to slow down and scared of going to fast. I saw a light tower ahead and I knew we were getting closer to the interstate. It was almost as time just froze in place a deer just jumped in front of the van and I don’t know why but I hit the head light button and turned the head lights off and the deer eyes locked into my eyes and it jumped really high and continued to the woods when it landed I had just hit my brakes at that time but not enough to even come close to stop just an attempt to but the deer was on the side of the road in perfect condit! ion and looking at us like we were crazy.  I then saw a car on coming going toward the light it had no more passed my and it slammed on breaks and stopped the car half on the road and other half off the road they got out with doors left open and they were heading for the ditch. I had hit my brakes during this and slowed way down. I think because we were so close to the interstate and lots of lights and activity it retreated and disappeared within a matter of seconds. I stopped and the car that those people that had passed me stood up with their hand in the air pointing at the object. It disappeared. I have never felt so much relief in my life and a since of calmness came about the children and I. Weird it was actually chasing us. Those people got back in their cars and continued going in that direction. I will say I have never been down that road again! I have never experienced anything like that in my whole life and I am now 50.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The technology of this aircraft light or what ever you want to call it to be able to travel at such unbelievable speeds through the tree zigzagging. I don’t even want to know or think about it?  This really happed! People looked at me as if I was crazy when I told them what had happened but I told them to ask the children what happened on the drive back from North Carolina. When the children came up to me I told them to ask they did and all three at the same time all chimed in telling them the same things I had just told them. The look on their faces was priceless. I was glad that the children were with me but at the same time I wished they hadn’t been with me. I don’t even want to think what would have happened if I had of stopped long before we got to the expressway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

You could see the beam from 50 miles. The source was in a small valley in the hills at the end of the Wood Ranch Parkway. The beam looked like a blue white laser and shot up five miles with no flaring out or diffusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove to the nearest place I could and found several other cars driving past a guard blocking a fire road into the hills. I asked the guard what was going on, what was that light?  He said they were making a video for MTV and told me to leave.  He had no badge, no plates in the car, no logo on his jeep, he was not a cop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three days later I walked up that fire road and found a warning sign, &#34;International Security Corp., AMSEC&#34;.

I was out back at about 1:00 am, just looking at the stars with my binoculars. There were some light clouds to the south but no moon, so it was fairly dark and quite a few stars were visible, at least for this area. (I live in Colorado Springs, CO, and city lights tend to block the stars.) I was browsing in the area about 5º north of Capella (about 50º above the horizon), when some lights came right through my field of view. There were about seven or eight distinct lights, all the same color, a dim yellow. They were shaped like four-pointed stars, all in the same orientation, but not point-to-point. They were in almost a straight line formation, with the line perpendicular to their direction of travel. Two or three of them near the ends were behind the line. They were quite close together, but not in what looked like a normal flight formation--just a group. They were traveling in a straight line, and fairly quickly. My first thought was that some low-flying object had crossed my field of view and was very out of focus, so I quickly tried to focus on the object, but discovered that it was in fact already in focus, and that the lights were really shaped like that. Also, I have very high-quality binoculars, and when lights are out of focus, they don&#39;t become star-shaped, they become blurry dots. Just to confirm this, I studied some real airplanes and stars later, adjusting the focus to both extremes. I could not make them look anything like the lights I saw. Furthermore, when I looked at them naked-eye, I could still see the star-shape. The lights traveled from the northeast to the south-southwest, passing almost directly overhead. They traversed about 90º in about ten seconds, keeping a constant speed, as far as I could tell. Their formation changed slightly; I believe they moved a little closer together, with the ones behind the main line moving a little toward the middle of the line. It&#39;s possible, of course, that the apparent change in the formation was just a change in the perspective as they passed, but my impression at the time was that their positions relative to each other did change slightly. I would guess they were no higher than an airliner&#39;s cruising altitude, and probably quite a bit lower. I may have the impression they were lower because I could see the shape of the lights (not just pinpoints of light like an airplane), and because they traversed the sky so quickly. If they were higher, they would have been huge and extremely fast. This is possible, of course, but my impression was they were somewhat lower in altitude. On the other hand, I never heard any noise, and if they were a normal aircraft traveling at a normal altitude, I would surely have heard the engines. As they passed overhead, I had to momentarily look down while I turned to face them. Since I knew what to look for and about where they would be in the sky, I found them again naked eye without any trouble. But I realized that they were faint enough that if I had not seen them through the binoculars first, I doubt I would have ever noticed them naked eye. While looking at them naked eye, the line of their formation was about the width of a finger tip at arms length. In trying to figure out what they might have been, I&#39;ve been trying to eliminate possibilities. I do not believe the light could have been reflected from the sun or earth, because the object or objects were almost directly overhead in the middle of the night. They would have been in Earth&#39;s shadow. The moon did not come up for a few more hours, so I don&#39;t think they could have been reflecting light from it. It seems they were generating their own light somehow. (Admittedly, though, I may not understand the relative positions of the sun, the moon, and the Earth well enough for these assumptions to be correct.) The lights did not appear to be exhaust from rocket engines because of the star-shape and the fact that they did not leave an exhaust trail. They also left no contrail, even though an airplane that flew over just a couple minutes later left a contrail that could be seen for several minutes. I could not see any vehicle or structure connecting the lights. They looked like separate objects. I did not, however, think to look for stars passing between them. The pattern and color of their lights was clearly not that of a conventional aircraft such as an airplane or helicopter (no wingtip lights, the wrong color, and not blinking). Also, they moved too quickly to be an aircraft, unless it was quite low. If it was that low, I would have been able to both hear it and make out its shape. I don&#39;t believe it could have been multiple aircraft, first because of the pattern of lights, and nobody but a precision flying team could have been that close together. If it had been a precision flying team, I also would have heard their engines. If they were high enough so I could not hear their engines, they would have been a much smaller formation, and the lights would have been pinpoints, not star-shaped. It was clearly not either a meteor or satellite. If it was a military craft (which we see a lot of around here), it was not heading toward any of the local military installations. In fact, if it was any conventional aircraft, it was not following any of the usual flight patterns we see here. In short, I have not been able to think of any conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon that this could have been.

10/15/95 22:15|Woodstock|CT||5 seconds|Young couple witness large glowing craft streak across the night sky, as if it were "exiting" the Earth. Craft was followed by a trail|2/22/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02694.html|48|ndxe199510| Summary : Young couple witness large glowing craft streak across the night sky, as if it were &#34;exiting&#34; the Earth. Craft was followed by a trail of pearlescent light, objected started in NE hor.streaked to about 1/2 way across hor. Then apparently flew straight out of the earth! Without a trace.  It took a total of three quick &#34;oh my gods!&#34; and it was over. Definitely not a comet!<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 15, 1995 my boyfriend and myself were on our way to meet some of our friends. It was roughly around 10:00-10:15p.m. We realized that we were a bit early to meet them so we decided to just drive around for a while.  The radio in the car was on but very quietly.  We drove around for about 10 minutes or so and then decided to start heading to meet our friends.  We were traveling north on Senexet Road in Woodstock, CT.  I was the passenger, my boyfriend was the driver. My eyes were suddenly drawn to a small glowing light, seemingly the size of a street lamp, but much brighter.  Almost as quickly as I noticed it, it started heading in a southern direction (towards us). It&#39;s speed was phenomenal, never in all my years (26 to be exact) have I ever seen anything in the sky (day or night) travel at such an incredible speed. The closest that this ball of light came to our location was within about 1/2 mile.  Upon reaching that point the object appeared much larger than I had originally thought, it was then that I realized that this was not a plane, helicopter, meteor or comet.  All of which I have witnessed before in the night sky.  If one were to get close enough to be able to measure the size of the object my guess would be that they find it to be probably close to a 1/4 of a mile long and about half as wide.  Once it reached the closest point that it had come to us,it came to an abrupt stop. Then, in less than a second, it turned, as if effortlessly, 90 degrees toward the west and continued at the previous rate of speed until about half way across the horizon.  It then again stopped abruptly and turned another 90 degrees, this time to the north and as quiclky as if it had never stopped it took off, again this time it appeared as if it left the earth completely!  Once the object made its first turn towards the west we noticed that it had an incredibly long, pearlescent colored trail of light traveling behind it.  This was perhaps the most striking thing that I remember about the object.  It was the most beautiful yet strangest light we have ever witnessed. The trail of light, judging by the distance and size from our location appeared to be atleast 15 to 20 miles long!  And as bright as the daylight!  We didn&#39;t tell that many people what we had seen for obvious reasons.  When I finally contacted a U.F.O. investigative firm, They said there was a bright meteor in that area around that time of the month.  I told the guy he was nuts, that I know a meteor when I see one.  I said to him,&#34;besides, meteors fall down, not up! And they don&#39;t travel at speed in excess of thousands of miles per hour!&#34;  He asked how I knew how fast it was going? I told him that in order for that object to travel from one end of the horizon to the middle of the horizon and then out of the atmosphere in less than 3 &#34;oh, my gods!&#34; it had to be traveling faster than anything humans have thus far invented. For a plane to travel the distance that this object traveled in less than 5 seconds, it would take about 20 to 25 minutes!  When the object made its first turn and we saw the trail of light for the first time, I had the most incredible tingling sensation come over my body and my eyes started to water and my muscles all felt tense, my boyfriend experienced similar sensations. We are both in our mid-twenties have two children, good jobs and absolutely no reason to make anything like this up.  Feel free to post this event, I am no longer worried that people will think I&#39;m crazy.  After all, maybe I am crazy, but I&#39;m definitely not STUPID!  I know what I saw was without a doubt a U.F.O.<n>
10/15/95 22:00|Washington, D.C.|DC|Light|10 Minutes|Million Man March had visitors?|1/20/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27066.html|49|ndxe199510| Million Man March had visitors?<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 15th I drove to our Nation&#39;s Capital to do some vending at the Million Man March. I parked my red GMC SUV right behind my vending spot, set up my tables, and began to unload my supplies. I had several people working with me and I also saw many other venders that I know setting up as well. There were alot of people walking around the area, shopping, eating, and just taking in the scenary. I took out my VHS camcorder and began to talk and film people in the area. At some point I looked up into the sky and noticed it was full of stars. I&#39;ve always enjoyed looking at the stars and have never seen a more spectacular night than this one. I noticed a &#34;star&#34; moving slightly back and forth. I was fatigued this evening from the long drive and other things I had to do that night and at first I thought I was just seeing things. After another look I was sure I wasn&#39;t seeing things. I made a comment to somebody standing close to me if they had ever seen a UFO and pointed towar ds the object. His response was &#34;if that&#39;s a UFO..what&#39;s THAT?&#34; and pointed the opposite direction. The star he pointed out was making little circular motions. I began to tell other people in the area to look up while I scanned the sky for other stars. I saw at least 50 other stars making subtle movements. I tried to catch this on video but my camera barely works with good lighting. The only thing I caught on tape was our voices and reaction to the sighting. I watching the stars moving for about 10 minutes and then continued to unpack my supplies and later fell asleep in my jeep. When I woke up the events at the Million Man March had already begun and I was late getting started. I sold out everything I had in just a few hours and never looked up even once that day. I have friends who did and saw close up in the day what I probably saw that night. They described them as looking like clouds and changing into silver metalic disks.<n>

My parents live outside the city limits.  I was almost all the way home when I drove out of a clearing of trees when I spotted the primary colored lights in the sky.  As I approached the lights I slowed my car to a halt.  I was nearly underneath the lights.  It was a clear and cool evening.  I turned my car engine off to listen for any engine noises. there was no noise coming from the lights which were to my guess about 150 foot up in the sky.  I can judge this by the 50 foot tree that was near.  The lights were very large circular and were in groups of primary colors of red, yellow, and blue.  I left my parking lights on and flashed my headlights at the colored lights and the colored lights began to slowly fade and brighted but in a pattern of the grouping of the colored lights.  I rolled down my window and got out of my car and shut the door.  I continued to flasth the lights for a few more moments.  I was startled when I heard an older couple in a luxury car slowly approach from behind me.  I heard the lady in the passenger seat say to her husband &#34;What is that?&#34; and I noticed her red painted fingernair pointing up at what I was seeing.  The couple being frightened drove off rather quickly.  I tried for the life of me to get a shape of a craft of a length or color of one and I could not see any lines or shape.  The lights which were in perfect focus and were not the little twinkly lights a person would see on a plane or helicoper far away were easy to see.  The thing that puzzles me to this day is why I could not make out a shape of a craft.  I looked near the colored lights and far away from them as to see if I was not looking far enough out.  I believe there was only one craft because the lights must have got bored with my light flashing and slowly turned clockwise together and then slowly went in a direction to my right.  Because there were no immidiate roads to chase it I did not chase it.  I then w! ent home which was only a few hundred feet from the sighting and told my parents about it.  They believed me mainly because I was brought up not to cry wolf and they knew I would not do such a thing.  If someone feels that they need to contact me for more information about the sighting please feel free to contact me at ((address deleted)) and ask for ((name deleted)).  I am not afraid of what people think and only want to let people know what I saw.<n>

I was driving south on Highway 11 towards Highway 24 where there&#39;s an overpass. It was pre-dusk. I was about a mile away from the intersection when I noticed a strange looking cloud hanging low over the overpass. It was a grey, cloudy day but the cloud that caught my attention stood out from the background. It didn’t look right, it looked too dense. Suddenly five strobe-like lights flashed from the cloud in a 1-2-3-4-5-5-4-3-2-1 horizontal pattern. It was over in a second. I immediately flashed my headlights five times and kept driving. I exited at the overpass and drove under the cloud and stopped. I looked up but couldn&#39;t see anything. Weeks later my husband said he was on his way home less than a mile from the overpass. It was just past sunset, a clear night. He said he saw what at first looked like a brightly lit semi trailer-truck cross Highway 24 in front of him. Except, it was about 30 feet up in the air. Seconds later, by the time he got to where it had crossed the road it had disappeared behind a fire tower and some trees. There&#39;s no cross street there, only pasture and a dirt driveway to the tower. He said he wasn&#39;t sure of the shape of the object, only that it seemed about the size of a semi, 40-50 feet long or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two interesting reports from same witness, who describes himself as working in the newspaper trade.

10/15/95 15:00|Lawton|OK|Sphere|2-3 minutes|Silvery orb hiding behind  cloud!|5/14/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22757.html|55|ndxe199510| Silvery orb hiding behind  cloud!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I have always struggled with the whole U.F.O. phenomenum, real or not? After this sighting which was my first and last good sighting of an U.F.O. i tend to beleive in them a lot more. But still feel that this could have been man-made, but a U.F.O. none-the-less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nice bright blue sky, with about 10 to 15% of it dotted with puffy white clouds that you can not see through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just pulled up to a stop light, facing south and was just looking at the sky, when I saw a Fairly bright silver, apparently reflective type orb emerge from one of the clouds moving east at a very slow rate and then it appeared to stop. As I looked at it I knew i had never seen anything like it before and had this really odd feeling of being watched. I looked around and remember seeing only a couple of cars to my right and the people had not noticed it, and I felt the urge to call out to get them to look up at what i saw, but as I looked back up, the orb was moving back to the right, (west), and went back behind the same cloud it came out from behind to begin with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not reappear on the other side, and when the light turned green I crossed the intersection and pulled over on the side for a few minutes keeping an eye on the cloud I saw the orb emerge from, but did not see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I live in a military town and on top of that there is a small airport to the south of my town so I have seen many different types of Aircraft over 30 years of my life in all different weather conditions and of course there are times when you see things that are a little different but always upon closer examination you knew what they were, jets or copters or flares, and commercial aircraft of course. From the size of this object and comparing it to all the other flying aircraft I have seen in the skys I would say the object was 10 to 15 ft in diamater, of course its hard to be sure of that aspect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But this defied anything common to say the least, the clouds were moving just perceivably to the west, so the object actually stopped or slowed down emensely and retreated back to where it came from even though the cloud was moving away from it. But that was the closest cloud in range to the object. Also the object made no sound that i could hear with my windows rolled down. Which was also very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my wife and little girl when i got home and they were slightly amazed because they know i do not get excited over anything, and also told a couple of friends about it, and then about a year or two later, we saw an episode of sightings on the fox network that had a video of an almost identical sighting as mine, but in a different state and different time. And I said there it is that is exactly what I saw! And the object on the video behaved in exactly the same manner.<n>

Very little cloud cover. I witnessed at least one craft silver/grey in color, very reflective.  I cannot give an estimate of the altitude of the craft in question.  It flew across the sky from E to S.  At a point around SE it disappeared from the sky.  It had not changed direction or speed.  I did not take my eyes off the object.  Upon scanning the sky, I discovered the object in question back at the original place in the sky at compass E.  Around this time of that year, I witnessed several craft having the same characteristics both in behavior and appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most notable sighting of these craft occurred around this time as well.  I saw one of these craft while in the backyard of my house.  The cigar-shaped craft crossed the sky, then stopped in mid-air.  A blue light came off of it, shining brightly even in mid-afternoon.  I don&#39;t recall exactly what happened that day, other than two odd things that I cannot account for.  One: I seem to have blacked out, but I came out of it standing upright in a different part of the yard than where I was when I saw the light.  Two: My clothes seemed in dissarray, my shirt was on inside-out and my pants&#39; zipper was down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since then had a dream about that day.  I do not consider the dream to be 100% reliable.  It may be the actual events of that day or merely my imagination.  However, the dream started out exactly like my real memories of that day.  In my dream I see the craft come down and hover over my house.  The next scene is me sitting naked in a white room with sophisticated equipment on my right and 2-3 &#34;greys&#34; in front of me.  There is a being to my immediate right holding an instrument in his hands and he moves behind me and I feel a pain behind my right ear.  Since that day, I have a noticeable lump behind my ear.  I have not had it taken out or seriously evaluated by a medical professional.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have other accounts of odd sightings but will file them according to time/date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

When I realized that the ball of light seemed to be suspended there for a few seconds it caught my full attention.  The &#34;ball&#34; moved quickly to the left, and for a brief moment &#34;sat&#34; in the center above the neighbor&#39;s roof.  I was trying to make sense of the unknown light and look for the source from where it could have been shining from.  When I did this, I moved my body so I could have a better view out of the windshield.  I believe I caught the attention of the &#34;ball&#34; and then it *immediately* made a bee-line for what seemed to be my face.  The &#34;ball&#34; came at me diagonally from the neighbor&#39;s roof area.  I screamed aloud.  Just then, the light came upon the top of the car.  It seemed to spread itself out atop the hood of the car.  It moved from the grill area all the way up over the windshield. The shape was almost that of something gelatinous or vaporous when it came onto the car.  In other words, it didnt move as light would move. It seemed to fill the car in a white light with a green tinge to it.  It was *extremely* bright at this period.  I recall feeling very warm and somewhat disoriented. It felt like the light consumed the space around my body; that I was no longer in a car; that I was now by myself in the light.  Then all of a sudden it was gone.  Now, to go back to the point where I screamed--at that time, my friend also screamed for he was reacting to my scream.  He did not see the light in the ball form, nor did he see the light on the hood, nor in the car. In fact, he was not sure why I had screamed. However, he did see the light move down the back window of the car and then vanish.  I did not see the light in the back window nor did I see the light vanish. I wanted to mention that my house is on the east side of the street.  Our vehicle was parked inbetween my house and the neighbors house to the left.  My friend was seated in the drivers seat and I was laying across the passengers seat and my head was on his lap--and yes, I was facing upwards looking at him as we spoke.  We were quite still in movement and I dont think that this &#34;ball&#34; of light knew we were there until I made movement to look closer at it out of the windshield.  I wanted to mention that the radio was turned on at a very low volume.  After the green &#34;ball&#34; of light left, it increased in volume.  This could have been because my friends knee hit the radio knob, yet I am still uncertain.  I will also mention that I did check the time when I went into the house and was quite surprised to learn that it was *much* later than I had anticipated, although the experience seemed to only last seconds. The entire event felt draining and exhaustive.  After six months or so had passed, I began to notice that I had a marked increase in my ability to learn and my ability to understand analytical issues.  I had wanted to report this experience when it had happened, yet I was too shy or perhaps still questioning what had &#34;really&#34; happened that night.  I have since witnessed another &#34;green ball light&#34; experience in the same city at a different location with a different witness.  This time, there were 3 balls of light and much further off in the distance.  The experience this time included only the sighting.  This sighting was approx. 11/10/97.  I will be happy to give you the details should you be interested in that experience.  Now it seems to me that I know what I experienced the first time was &#34;real&#34; so I have decided to finally report the incident. I will be more than happy to supply my background information to you upon request.  I am uncertain as to what you would like to know in that regard.  Thank you.<n>

I called my wife out to see it we figured it was a good 200 feet long going by the spaceing of the lights and the point of our observation. The lights looked like a door way turned side ways there was a small round light a ways behinde it that kind of bobed up and down. We were standind in our drive way when it pased over Lindy Lake Bar we were looking at it through our gate post which is 20 foot wide we were 60 feet from the gate Lindy Lake Bar is a 1/2 mile west of us. Two of the lights just fit inside of the gate post with two outside of the post that is how we figured it was at least 200 feet long. it made a low huming sound not very loud. We live in a wooded area there isn&#39;t much around here but woods. The next day I talkerd to my sister who lives 5 miles south of here and ask her if she seen any thing that night.She said something come over her house about 22:30 headed north and it lit up the woods like it was day time but she couldn&#39;t see any thing else or where the light come from.<n>

We started talking about the good old days and hours passed without us even noticing. It was a clear night filled with many stars covering the sky. There was a variety of stars that night; some were larger than others, some were brighter than others, and some twinkled while others didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 6AM the sun began to rise and the stars that didn&#39;t have alot of light began to fade then disappear completely in the Sun&#39;s light. I watched as the light of the Sun rose and more and more stars vanished until there was only one star left. This was the brightest star that night and I thought it was the North Star. Several minutes passed and the Sun was now almost completed visible. What I thought was the North Star did something I can&#39;t explain. It moved from one side of the Horizon to the other side in a matter of seconds and then vanished out of view.<n>

I can give a vivid drawing but I dont know how to send it,would you contact me please?<n>

I noticed this because it looked very uniform and clean (like precision flying). As I approached, driving from W to E, I rolled down my window to look closer at this very cool sight. As I approached the leading edge of the &#39;formation&#39;(a very clear night), I looked up and saw nothing but the point of light, as I continued driving, I remember how clear the stars were. As I past the last series of light on the Eastern edge, I remember thinking how odd that there was no sound, and that I couldnt see the &#39;helicopters&#39; just the lights. As I drove I looked back several times to see that it had not moved. It was perfectly suspended from beggining to end 1500-2500&#39; off the surface. A perfect rectangle 1/2 to 3/4 mile E-W long, 1/4 mile N-S wide. If you have ever driven the bridge from New Orleans East across the Lake to Slidell, the object started about just where ... if you look left you can see the train tressel, beyond that basically going E, and extended up to the area before you ascend the large hill of the bridge. Any way thats it...The odd thing, I didnt think about what had occured until I was into Mississippi, then I realized I saw something and that ... well I dont know what I saw. I wasn&#39;t scared ... But like an event where an innocent curiosity takes place you act natural, unsuspecting, non biased, moronic even. Then you talk about it the same way. It looked like a grid, a guide or a reference of some sort.... It was perfectly rectangle, very big, clear, and low! I have never seen another thing before or since.<n>

Then that&#39;s when I also noticed there was another object below the helicopter. The object seemed to be moving in a very fast circular motion making a whipping sound. The object appeared to be thin, small and white colored about the size of a small compact car with a red light on top.  The FWPD helicopter appeared to be observing this one object with curiousity at a close distance. As I watched in amazement I noticed that this object moved within a 3 block radius at the speed of a few seconds. This went on for about an hour and a half. As I left my friend&#39;s apartment headed southbound for home, object still in motion, after about 4 blocks distance the strangest thing that I noticed was after all that time no one else seemed to have noticed the event other than myself and 2 other friends.  Oddly enough, a month later in November I was at home with my son asleep in bed when I was waking up from my sleep I heard soft whispers that sounded like &#34;He is waking up&#34;, when suddenly I was struck by a jolt of electricity on the right side of my ear and as I opened my eyes I saw a bright flash and I heard an electrifying, popping sound.  After this I must have passed out for about 30 minutes and I woke up feeling very nauseated and weak as if my energy had been sucked out of me. A few days later I discovered on the back of my ear a red mark which looked like a spider bite. Whenever I would touch the mark it was sensitive to the touch and it felt like to me that my head would explode!  In the month of December while watching the news on tv they were discussing a man who had walked in the VAF building in Waco, Texas at gunpoint declaring a standoff. This man had previously appeared on a talk show discussing his daytime experience that occured at his home in Cleburne, Texas.  He had videotaped an object similar to the one I saw in October hovering over hi! s stable s.They disclosed on the show that this videotape was in no way altered.  I&#39;m led to believe that there might be a connection in our stories about this object.<n>

First it was flying from south to north, heading in a direction overhead. The lights were dim, amber and didn&#39;t blink. So I watched as it approached rapidly. As the lights got closer I could see the formation wasn&#39;t a line but a triangle with one light in the lead. The lights were also round and not pin points. The diameter of each light being roughly 1/4 the length of one edge of the formation. As it flew more overhead, and it being a clear starry night, I could see it was moving quickly. I didn&#39;t notice any sound. It looked as though it was very high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called to my friend in the car and said he should see this. I heard him say something like &#34;see what?&#34;. While keeping my eyes on the lights I walked around the back of the car and glanced down at my friend with is head sticking out the car window, quickly looked back up. The lights were still there except they were now almost directly over our heads. I pointed up at them but he still said he couldn&#39;t see them. At this point the silence, speed and odd lighting really had my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it ended here I could have dismissed it as an airplane, or whatever and not have given it another thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it fly rapidly, relative to the stars in the background, almost directly overhead, it rotated. Rotated quickly so the two previously trailing lights were now leading. That sent chills through my spine. No airplane does that. I started yelling to my friend something like &#34;holy #%#%#, look at it!&#34;, his head still looking out the window, in an awkward way, facing up. I glanced down and slapped him on the forehead to get him to look in the right spot. When I looked back up I could not find the lights again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were travelling westbound towards Exeter.  I was in the front passenger seat. On the opposite carriageway, just above treetop level, their appeared a group of lights.  The lights were in a definite formation, and at first it appeared they were part of an aircraft.  However, we could see there was no substance between the lights, although they were all travelling in a very slow, but perfect formation.  They were a normal orangy colour.  What really caught my attention was the light that was adjacent to the formation, either blue or green, that was moving about totally randomly.  The lights were not a reflection, they had substance.  I alerted my family who also watched them as we passed them and they then appeared to change course behind our vehicle and cross the motorway.  We lost sight then as we travelled on.  There was no audible sound.  Although the car windows were closed, if this had been a helicopter or larger, there would have been considerable noise as we were so close.  Again, I reiterate there was no substance or form between the lights.  Because it was dark at the time, we could not observe the reactions of other road users.  It was very strange, and we were in a sort of denial of what we had seen.  We racked our brains for a logical explanation but could not come up with anything.  I do not know if there were any reports of this sighting made by other people on the road that night.  Exmoor National Park lies in the direction that the UFO would have probably travelled from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We saw a large object in the sky moving slowly.  It was travling north from the Williamsburg area.  I stopped the car along the side of the road east of Short Mountian.  The object was rectangular in shape and had very bright light coming from all sides.  It was black and flew very slow just over the tree tops. We watched it fly over my car. We saw it through the moon roof in my car.  Nobody believes we saw this object.  We were going to see a movie in Altoona and were not drunk or on drugs.  We did not see any beings or space men.  I looked at all of the local news papers and none of them had any thing on this event. We did not hear any noise coming from this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the eastern sky I notced a metallic saucer shaped object travelling towards the north at a fairly high rate of speed.Being inside my automobile and on a busy street, I have no idea if the craft could be heard or not. It did not appear to be close enough to the ground to hear any sound anyway.I was amazed at this scenario as I am absolutely certain it was no conventional aircraft of any kind. I immediately began to honk my horn and even rolled my window down in an effort to garner another witness to this phenomena. Despite the volume of traffic on that busy thoroughfare(13th Street), I was unable to attract anyones attention. To this day, I find that circumstance very peculiar to say the least. I continued driving and abruptly pulled into the nearest parking lot so as to watch further. By this time the object had disappeared behind some trees only to reappear as two having split in half.There also appeared to be what seemed to resemble smoke trails behind each component.  They also looked to have been closer to the horizon, but I cannot be certain of that fact due to the possiblity of them being much farther away than they appeared. (due to the curvature of the earth). They simply disappeared below the horizon. I find it very difficult to believe that I was the only witness to this, nevertheless, I have been unable to locate any other witness(es). I do not consider myself a UFO enthusiast on any level. I have had 4 sightings in my lifetime, this was by far the most intriguing of them all. I do not read on the subject with the exception of the &#34;Gulf Breeze Sightings&#34; back in 1992. I did however report this to a guest on the Art Bell show a number of years ago (perhaps 2 or 3) and he replied that it was probably a meteor. I am certain this was no meteor. I am an amateur astronomer and have seen many meteors. Aside from that fact, again, this was in a bright, cloudless, sunny sky. I never really made the effort to report it to anyone else after this experience. In fact, I reported it then as I am doing so now only after the happenstance of venturing onto an interested party of which I never really sought out. The first reporting occurred after I had listened to an ArtBell show during one of my many bouts of insomnia. This time I ventured onto your website link from the CoastToCoast website. As far as my background is concerned, I am a college degreed individual, seriously and sober minded, and not given to hyperbole or fantasy. My exposure to any occult activities have been passive only as I have never practiced any form of occultism, but I have read somewhat concerning the various phenomena within this realm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.
