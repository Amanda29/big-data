The craft was silver metallic in some areas and dark gray metallic in other areas.  There was no center light on the bottom.  There were small lights on the bottom and on one row in the side of the craft.  The lights changed color in intensity and in hue, but not dramatically.  There were no green lights and there were no red lights.  The craft was a perfect square as seen directly from the bottom.  The craft was a flattened diamond shape as seen from the side.  The craft clearly had three or four levels on the bottom and on the top, each section smaller than the larger primary section which formed the main body of the craft.  There was absolutely no sound.  There was a feeling of static electricity in the air close to the craft.  The craft came upon us fast.  Then it hovered over our heads, about thirty feet away.  Then it slowly moved away, returning in the same direction that it had come.  The craft appeared to be about 50 feet X 50 feet square, each side being about 50 feet long.  The craft appeared to be about 25 feet from the bottom tip to the top tip.  If it had windows, we did not see them.<n>

The exact same thing happened to me.  It was a fall evening sometime between 2000-2100 Hrs.  I went to our front door to get some fresh air.  As I opened the door, the moon (or so I thought) took up almost the entire skyline.  It sacred me so bad that I ran back inside to get my mom.  I could not find her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I ran back to the front door.  It was gone!  I know what I saw.  It was not my imagination.  I was wide awake.  It was so large in the skyline I thonght someone had to see this!  I never heard anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has never ever left my mind nor will it.  It puzzles me today.

There were scattered clouds here and there that were moving rather briskly across the sky at the time. We stood there for a while and some passers-by saw us looking and looked up as well wondering what it was we were looking at. About a minute or so after that it started to slowly move from its 10 o&#39;clock position ( from our POV ) across the sky to about 2 o&#39;clock ( against the wind ) where a small cloud was, like some others in the sky, moving briskly. Well, it entered into or behind the small cloud and the cloud just continued moving. I expected to see this object emerge from behind the cloud but it didn&#39;t although we stood there for a while until the cloud passed out of sight. The sun was low to our backs during this sighting. This was the first and only time I have clearly seen anything like this. We never reported it ( to whom??) but it is significant in that it was just a day or so before the &#34;Great New England Blackout&#34; so my approximate date of sighting can be narrowed further. I don&#39;t remember the exact day of the blackout. I think it was a week or so after that Life Magazine came out with their famous &#34; Week of the Flying Saucers &#34; issue. So there you have my, until now, unreported sighting fo your records for whatever its worth. At least I&#39;ve finally gotten it of my chest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/9/65 18:00|Middletown|NY|Sphere|one second|Posssible UFO seen near Middletown, NY on the November night of the great northeastern black-out of 1965.|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74184.html|5|ndxe196511| Posssible UFO seen near Middletown, NY on the November night of the great northeastern black-out of 1965.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am inspired to submit my report after reading two recent reports on NUFORC, one from a man reporting a sighting that he witnessed 37 years ago, and another from a family in Pennsylvania reporting a &#34;fire-ball&#34; shaped object which parallels very similarly to what I observed many years ago in November of 1965.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to look up the date of the great northeastern black-out on Wikipedia.  I couldn&#39;t remember the exact date on which it occurred.  On the evening of November 9th just before sundown I was traveling between Middletown, NY to Pine Bush, NY to attend the open house in the school where I taught. On the way I observed to the east an extremely bright blueish-green ball going in an arcing trajectory passing from one cumulus cloud to another.  It left no smoking trail and it was to me the most spectacular and unusual &#34;meteorite&#34; I had ever seen.  It was lost from view for a moment while I was driving and as I regained an unobstructed view I was anxious to see where it had made impact.  But there was no indication of an impact... which I expected to be quite spectacular!  When I arrived at school the power was out and we were all sent home.  While I was there, however, I overheard conversations about people seeing a UFO hovering over the railroad station in Middletown.  While driving home, I kept my eyes to the sky.<n>

There was NO SOUND and no definitive shape other than a cluster of lights. They hovered for approximately 2 minutes, then abruptly ascended up and out of sight in the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Blackout occurred on November 09, 1965.

A little over a year before I went to pilot training, I was and electronic warfare officer on B-52s.  We departed Loring AFB approximately 2300 and the sighting occurred at 35,000&#39; on an approximate heading of 230 degrees while transiting southern Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts for approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  There was a bright moon and at that altitude, very clear.  The object appeared as an intensly bright point of light at an azimuth of about 60 degrees and 30 degrees left of the nose of the aircraft when first noticed by the pilots.  As they were discussing this over the interphone they noticed movement.  The navigators went to the cockpit thinking it was a star.  After consulting their charts and tables they concluded what it wasn&#39;t!  Sirius, the brightest star, was below the horizon and they stated this was far brighter than any star.  The gunner and I went forward to get a look and I have to agree that it was extremely bright, blue white in color and appeared far above us.  Note:  The gunner sat forward in the crew compartment and operated his equipment remotely in the B-52G.  While in the cockpit, the four of us watched the object change position from about 30 degrees left of the nose to almost dead ahead without changing its elevation.  The gunner and I returned to our positions to accomplish mission requirements.  Interphone conversation included speculation and keeping the rest of the crew updated.  It disappeared after five or so minutes.  After all these years, I don&#39;t remember how it disappeared.  As I recall, this happened just before the great blackout the night of Nov 9-10, 1965.  I can&#39;t nail down the flight date, however I flew on the 27th and 28th of October, the 1st of November and the 17th of November and sat alert from the 5th through the 12th of November, 1965.  As a crew, we decided not to report this as this sort of thing was a career ender in the military and yes, I am familiar with AFR 200-2 as it was called back ! them.<n>
11/1/65 19:00|Billerica|MA|Cigar|20 minutes|Cigar shaped craft shines spotlight for me to walk towards it|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67369.html|9|ndxe196511| Cigar shaped craft shines spotlight for me to walk towards it<n> <n><n> <n><n> My experience happened in the fall of 1965 or the spring of 1966.  I believe it was the fall.  I know it was that time frame because I had just bought my first car a new 65â VW.  There was no snow on the ground and it was not real cold, so I believe this was maybe November of 1965.  I know the dates are important to you but this is the closest I can come.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was living with my grandparents in Concord so that is where this story ends. It begins however on Rt 3 (the highway) in Billerica.  I was coming from Lowell and approaching the River Road exit.  I think that is what it is called, the jail is/was there.  Not sure if it still is.  It was 7 to 8 PM I would say and the traffic was not heavy, thank goodness because I would have caused an accident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my right, hovering above the trees was an object, cigar shaped. It had 3 lights as I can remember, one blue, one red and I believe one white.  The light part is the vaguest of my memory, but there were lights on the bottom area. The object was dark, but there was enough light out to see the shape.  I watched it as I was approaching it and it did not appear to be moving so the closer I got the slower I went.  I almost stopped beside the spot but just drove slow.  I was very excited to see this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father and I had a few discussions about UFOâs and he said if I ever saw one that I should mentally talk to them because they would be advanced and could be telepathic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So that is why I was excited!!!  I was 21 and eager to explore.  I asked them to pick me up and take me with them, mentally.  I kept watching to see if it would move as I passed it and as I took the exit I turned to watch but saw nothing.  I drove over the highway and took a right onto the River Road going towards Billerica and to my surprise on my right hovering over a house set way back off the road (now a church) was this object or craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No traffic, so I pulled over fast.  As I opened my car door a spot light went on from this plane/craft hovering the house, it shown a path for me.  I started walking around the car towards it and saw another car coming down the road so I rushed back into my car and just sat there. The spot light from the plane/craft also went off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened 3 times, each time a car coming to interrupt me going towards the spotlight.  It was dark but I could see the space over the house between this plane/crat thing.  I sat in my car, not afraid at all and then the plane/craft just swioohed up and over me as though it were tired of waiting.  It was silent!!! Complete silence, jaw breaking silence. I opened my window and watched.  I heard nothing.  I also think I yelled &#34;wait&#34;!!!  I was so excited I could hardly breath.  I took off in my car towards Billerica Center, took Rt. 3a South towards my parents house.  Driving down that road I look up to my right and there it was again following my path, or just ahead of me, so I went fast trying to chase it.  It disappeared though.  I began thinking maybe it was following the river for some reason.  This all started near the river. I donât know why the water idea came to me but somehow I felt they liked water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt angry afterwards that I was so slow getting out and back in my car and caring if any other cars saw me, because they finally flew off.  I think though that I did not want to share my experience and I think I felt that other people being there would interrupt them taking me.  That is why I kept getting back into my car and pretending nothing was going on.  But the plane/craft did the same thing with the spotlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After visiting with my parents and telling them the story I had wanted to drive around with my father.  I believe we did drive around, but also went to visit my brother on the other side of the town.  I was so distracted though, just looking up unable to pay attention to anything else.  We had a nice visit, which is important in my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later about 11 PM I arrived at my grandparents house in Concord, went upstairs and got into bed.  As I lay there I heard a plane.  Not uncommon for that area either because the Bedford Air Force base is close and they fly by. Not over, but close by.  But this plane I heard stopped right over the house and hovered, the house shook. The motor was very loud this time, it was not like a plane flying by, it stayed there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew it was them.  I spoke to it mentally and told it I had changed my mind.  I felt that if I went with them I would be lonely for my family which I had not considered earlier being young and impulsive.  I was also a little scared by then since it seemed to have FOUND me. Then it flew off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was one of the first of many unusual   experiences I have had in my life.  I have had other encounters.  Thanks for listening, I have wanted to write this at your site for a few years now.  Every world of this is true, except perhaps the dates.<n>
