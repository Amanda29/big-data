We slowed down and observed as it flew through clouds and descended then reascended. The craft then headed our direction low silent and rather slowly. once it got closer it was approx. 50-70 ft high and moved directly over our vehicle. as it moved closer it appeared as three yellow\orange lights in a black triangle. It followed over us briefly and one friend\witness described 4 lights and pyramid like shape. It then passed over us towards the other direction, picking up speed, still silent, until it was out of view. afterwards lightning strikes were scene in the area for approx. 1 1\2 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to capture video with a small ipod touch, the object had already passed us on its way into the distance when the recording began. The object in the video is extremely small, without reference points of detail of lights or shape. (in other words the video was useless)<n>

Absolutely no sound heard!|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87432.html|2|ndxe201202| Close, BRIGHT, Slow-moving lights seen in Greenwood, SC!!! Absolutely no sound heard!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I were in the car, driving down a road that we often do. I saw very bright lights, that looked like stadium lights, above the trees. I asked my son, &#34;What is that?&#34;  He said, &#34;Lights?&#34;  I said, &#34;Yes, I know that, but where are they coming from?&#34;  When we reached the stop sign, we couldn&#39;t see the lights because of the trees.  I was puzzeled but tried not to be alarmed because I knew my son would say I was a nut.  We made a left at the stop sign and then went about a quarter of a mile and turned right. As we made the right, we saw the very big, very bright, slow moving lights. The lights were so bright that we couldn&#39;t make out any shape until it crossed the road and we were able to look at it from an angle.  My son exclaimed, &#34;Oh my God! It&#39;s a circle!&#34; I was driving and could not take my eyes off of the road for too long. I wanted to stop and turn around but there was a car behind me. We went to the next stop sign and made a left to try to circle aroun! d and find it again- it was so slow moving. But it was gone. We never heard any sound, like you would from an airplane. I have never seen any plane move that slowly. I wish now that I had stopped the car to watch it!<n>
2/29/12 21:00|Plantation|FL|Sphere|2-3 minutes|Four orbs flying over Plantation, FL flying N-NW from FLL airport area.|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87431.html|3|ndxe201202| Four orbs flying over Plantation, FL flying N-NW from FLL airport area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped outside to make a phone call. Look straight out to the horizon,  S-SE, looking towards FLL [Fort Lauderdale Airport about 10 miles away (I google mapped it)] From that direction I saw four Orbs.  The orbs appeared to begin from the ground, perhaps since they were coming from a distance. At first I thought they were rockets or perhaps fireworks, because they were flying almost straight up. The altitude was, I believe about that of a helicopter hovering.  The orbs where headed our direction, I would say N-NW from the airport area (I guess).  They began to fly over head, gaining altitude. At first they were flying in an unorganized manner.  But as they came closer, and gained altitude, they made a U formation.  We took a video of this.  By the time we took the video, they were in the U formation and high over head.  They slowly began ascending until they were out of sight.  The orbs themselves had a reddish orange glow and were whiter toward the middle of the orb.  There was four individual orbs, they moved independently but still in a formation.  There seemed to be one that was almost, mockingly, zigzagging a couple of times.  To note, there was a commercial airline that was either landing or taking off when I first saw the orbs.  (This was seen from the community houses on Peters RD and University DR)<n>

The lights were yellowish-amber in color and were very bright and strong.  I observed some of the lights turning off so to speak or disappearing only to reappear in the same spot.  As one would disappear, another one would appear on the other side.  So at times, there would be only four lights showing, then three, then five again, etc. It seemed like there was an intelligent pattern to the lights turning off and on.  I watched this for several minutes until one by one they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed the dogs whimpering as well. These lights were so bright that it seemed almost like large car headlights in the sky and approx. a quarter the way up from the horizon.  The following morning I saw on the local news that several others saw these lights and called to report them.  The newscaster said that the Army was claiming that they were flares.  I am a former police officer and have worked with flares many times in the past.  These were definitely not flares due to the fact they could turn off and on at will.  They also stayed in a perfect diagonal line while hovering in the same spot.  There was also no sign of smoke.<n>

I even called the manager of the coffee shop to come out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 20 (another person looking at them counted 21)orange color lighted UFO´s began flying slowly and far, from south to North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since tonight is very cloudy, the objects began disappearing once they reached heavy clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were all going slow, so we could look at them for a space of maybe 4 minutes? But the last object was going faster than all others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A small plane was going the opposite way (morth to south), and I guessed they were checking those objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued checking from my balcony, and did not see them again yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very, very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were NO planes. My balcony looks at the airport, and I am accustomed to watch planes all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By other hand, comparing the speed of them to the small plane and 1 big plane leaving the Miami Int´l Airport allowed us to compare speed: planes were going faster.  (The small one and commercial one),  These objects where lighted, dark orange, in the shape of an ¨l¨or thin cigar, vertical shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anybody saw them , or have an explanation, pls. inform.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THanks.<n>

The ball of light illuminated the entire night sky, it appeared to descend into the wooded area across the street from the stop sign. As the ball of light went over the tree line it appeared to flash without making a sound.  It then dissipated and transitioned back to natural darkness.  I proceeded to work and returned home and informed my husband. He was intrigued and I thought it was a weird occurrence.  I thought I would report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter joked it was the end of the world and my son was sure it was an alien with a wink and a nod.  Like I said before, I thought it was weird. My husband was curious but not all that moved by the event.  He joked that we should get the flashlights and go investigate the crash site. Needless to say, we were fast asleep shortly thereafter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hopefully this sighting was a mere meteorite and not the beginning of the return of the ancient aliens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.

This is the same light I&#39;ve seen out there before, yet again, above the fields along M-50, between Monroe and Ida. I am still not sure what the shape is, I tend to think it is either a disc or saucer shape, but it is hard to make out.  The colors of the lights are white, red and a greenish or green/blue color that seem to be flashing and spinning on the object.  I watched it above the field across from my house for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I did hear some sounds this time, but I don&#39;t know if they are related to the UFO.  The sounds were coming from the field, and they were like weird, loud chirping and squeaking sounds, but not like any animal I&#39;ve heard out there.  Maybe we have some loud birds out there that I don&#39;t know about.  Don&#39;t know!  Well, the sounds kinda scared me, so I went inside and then came back out later to check, and the UFO had moved to my ! side of the road, but was further down.  At that point, it was hovering between M-50 and Dixon Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen this thing out here so many times lately that I now go outside every night to see if it is there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet??

I was standing on my deck facing north when I noticed a formation of dim lights traveling from east to west.  The formation was more of an offset T then a V and moved fairly slow.  There were approximately 12 lights that were not blinking.  As I watched the formation move across the sky one of the lights shifted from one side of the T to the other and back, it only did this once.  I called my 16 year old daughter outside and she watched the formation with me until it had passed out of sight.<n>

I looked up at the stars as I normally do at night and noticed a foot-wide beam of what appeared to be dim light shining across the sky.  I traced this beam to the moon where it seems to originate from.  There was a cloud around the moon, normal enough, but when this beam passed into the cloud, it had changed color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the beam shone across the moon-lit cloud it turned to a black color, almost as if the light had turned to shadow. The beam ran from the moon off into the horizon, towards the constellations of the Little and Big Dipper, Ursa Minor and Major.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching this beam for approximately 10 minuets it, for lack of a better term, pinched off at the moon and and began to disappear from left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this sounds crazy and isn&#39;t exactly a UFO, but this is the only site I know of where I can get some confirmation; what did I see?

Then when the other two came closer, they turn heading east and the lights when off slowly.  NO sound was emitted whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were flying about 3,000 to 5,000 feet AGL (above ground level).  This is the second event in one month.  The first one was only two lights.   Yesterday was three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sending some pics for your consideration.<n>
2/26/12 21:00|Chicago|IL|Rectangle|15 seconds|Low flying brown rectangular object|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87383.html|40|ndxe201202| Low flying brown rectangular object<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were out for a cigarette on his third story porch enjoying the crescent moon with Venus and Jupiter near it shining in the clear night sky.  We were in the Lakeview neighborhood looking west.  We were commenting on how many airplanes were in the sky waiting to land at O’hare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed a dark shape moving low in the sky trending N/NW.  At first I thought the moon had given me a sunspot and my eyes were deceiving me.  I pointed at it and my brother couldn’t see it at first.  It then passed above a street lamp and he saw it as well.  In the light it appeared brownish.  It was closest to being rectangular, long and thin, but instead of the “wingspan” being in the horizontal direction it was longest from top to bottom.  It was very low, appearing to be perhaps ten feet above the 3 story apartments across the parking lot. It flew very steadily and without much change in elevation or speed for about 75 yards before we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no lights on it, so I at first thought it may be an owl.  It seemed too large to be an owl and did not ever flap its wings, not to mention it would be gliding in a straight line, completely on its side if it were a bird. From my perspective I would guess the object was between 5 and ten feet from top to bottom and maybe 1 to 2 feet in width.  We had no perception of its depth from our view point, but I got the impression it was thin like a wedge.  It was moving between 10 and 20 mph on a night with winds out of the SW at 2-11 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a street below, but there are far too many trees for something to be attached to a car on the street or for someone to fly a kite.  There is also an EL train that trends in the same direction as the object moved.  It is unlikely we would be able to see something attached to the top of a train from that distance and viewpoint, but we are close enough to be able to hear trains go by with ease.  There was no train going by.  If it were something attached to the train it would have to be 30 feet or so above the train to be able to see it from that spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of us are UFO watchers or enthusiasts of any sort.  I liked the movie Independence Day, but that is about as far as I go with UFO’s.  I would appreciate any suggestions on what we might have seen.  My brother thought maybe a large trash bag was blowing in the wind, but he and I agree that it was far to steady in its shape, trajectory and speed to likely be a trash bag.  It also seemed to be going faster than the wind would allow.  A trash bag would probably undulate, while this object seemed rigid.  Any ideas?<n>

He missed it again and finally i had him watch with me. he missed it a third time and then on the fourth time he seen it and we both had chills going down our spines as it made no sense as to what the hell it could be. we saw it another time before grabbing his cell phone and using the stop watch to see if we could time it. We learned that every four minutes ON THE DOT it would flash out a single strobe which looked like a very bright star being turned on then off quickly. we r! an and got my father and other brother. they came out and missed it twice then the third time seen and and neither could come up with an explanation. My father who has watch the night sky for over 40 years was baffled. it continued to flash once every four minutes for atleast an hour and half . at first we thought it was moving away from the direction of orion then we realized that orion was moving out of our view due to earths rotation and that the light was remaining in the same spot, meaning it could not be a star or sattelite. finally the light flashed no more and i havent seen it since. if someone at the website has any ideas as to what the hell this could have been please explain. i have seen a UFO last year and had 3 witnesses then, but i have not seen anything like this ever in my life and whatever this was had to be further away than our sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Because of trees,  I can look straight overhead, a little bit to the west, and a little bit to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jupiter and the Moon were westward as was Venus closer to the horizon. To the SSW high in the sky was M45 the Pleiades open cluster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, I would estimate that it was about 7:18 or 19PM; I was sweeping the sky just west of the zenith, when I caught sight of an airliner - probably a  Boeing 747 or maybe an Airbus A380 because it had 4 engines on the wing cruise climbing almost directly in a western direction (more later).  I could see a lot of detail including the wing tip lights, strobe light on the belly - it was lit up very well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was tracking this airliner heading west; a silent, brownish, rectangular (about 5 or 6 times wide as it was long - flying wingish but with no appearent taper to the ‘wings’) craft flew underneath this airliner going about 15 degrees more northward but still on a westerly course.  It crossed the airliner&#39;s course in a shallow X.  It is hard to judge its speed - a lot depends upon its actual altitude - but its appearent speed seemed a lot faster.  I tracked this new craft for maybe another second or so, then it disappeared behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the Enroute L-28 chart, there is a marked airway that goes directly over where I live simply marked 281 between Detroit Wayne County VOR and HARWL intersection which confirms that the airliner was below 18,000 feet, and this UFO was somewhere below him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another clue was the fact that this airliner was perfectly in focus, but this UFO was a little out of focus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a light brown in color, rectangular shaped (no taper!), no exhaust seen (it was very clear on the airliner), no lights, silent, flying a straight course, going really fast (left the airliner like it was standing still).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a purely visual report by just me.  But, I thought I’d report it anyway.  Just in case somebody else seen it, or maybe somebody else on that airliner made a report of it.<n>

It moved very smoothly and was not a bird.  It did not resemble a plane or a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not think much about it and assumed it had an explanation.  With the naked eye it was only a tiny spot.  Upon reviewing my photographs later, I saw through the series of photos an object moving across the sky - and in one photo there is a clear disk shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur photographer so the photos are not great but I would love an expert to analyze them and determine what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am shaken by this - the photos are strange indeed.

Three more bright lights appeared overhead and moved upwards, left and right until either settling in a fixed position or slowly continuing in their direction.  At last check two of the three &#34;stars&#34; that appeared have since disappeared and one is stopping and moving slowly upwards (and this is not an illusion of star movement based on the earth&#39;s rotation, it&#39;s much too rapid).  This follows a sighting in the same location, one week prior, of a USAF fighter chasing a bright orb, and the orb rapidly increasing in speed and disappearing into the sky.<n>

They were just sitting in the middle of the street in their car. I asked my dad if they forgot something and he told me to look at the orange glow in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very cold evening about 27°.  All the stars were visible and the moon was a big sliver in the western sky. As I looked up in the southern sky I could see an orange glow that appeared like a planet that we close. But it got smaller and smaller and started to move in a north easterly direction towards us. I thought it was a plane on fire but there was no sound. It appeared to be flickering like something on fire but it moved very slowly. It kept getting smaller and smaller until it suddenly disappeared. I suggested to my dad that maybe it was a meteor? But that didn’t explain why it moved so slow? Just as we were discussing what we saw another huge bright orange orb was glowing in the southern sky. My dad said it came from the same direction as the one we just saw. It rose right above the tree line and continued to climb into the sky. I went into the house to tell my wife and my daughter and we watched it just hover in the sky. It too got smaller and smaller until it just vanished. Just like the first one we saw? The whole thing lasted only a few minutes. (Maybe 3-5 minutes.) I am 51 years old and have never seen anything like it? My parents are in their 70’s and said they have never seen anything like it either. (My dad is a retired police officer.) I came into the house to watch the 10:00pm news to see if anyone else reported seeing anything like we had but they didn’t mention anything in the news. (Our news comes out of Cincinnati, OH) I would be very curious if anyone else in Bright, Indiana saw the same thing on this evening of February 25th, 2012?<n>

Strange group of pulsating lights-<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend &amp; were driving to Tucson from Phoenix on Saturday night around 9 pm.  Heading south on the I-10 before the first rest stop my boyfriend asked me what were these 3 lights, in the sky, forming a triangle-  When I looked over (West)I saw 3 bright, very distinct lights in the sky.  I assumed, at first glance, they were stars.  He then said, “those are not stars”, &amp; when I looked again, the lights took off, going south, at a rate of speed I cannot even predict.  Faster then anything I have ever seen in the sky-They were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued, driving south on the I-10 when we both saw these unusual, lights that were moving very slow, going north.  When they were directly over us we could see that each object was 2 lights, (I don’t know if they were 2 different objects flying next to each other or 1 object with 2 lights) they did not blink but most definitely pulsed,they were a very bright, bluish light and they were going slower than any aircraft I have eve! r seen.  Two of them flew over, and when we got to the rest stop and got out we noticed the third one, flying north in the same direction as the others, same characteristics, no sound, and then it was gone.  Very strange, (and I saw the Phoenix lights &amp; KNOW they were not flares)  I am not alarmist, this was as weird as the Phx. Lights.  I don’t know. Hope someone else saw them  or can explain them.<n>

After stopping to focus on this, the object whatever it may be has a beam of light that shines and goes from side to side very slowly almost like a light house.  There is also a blinking light on this same object.  The object is stationary and is in the same position; at least it has been since I began observing.  The longest it has stayed in the sky is around 3 hours. After that time, it is no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Jupiter and/or Venus, we suspect.  PD))<n>

I was at work and me and my manager went out to smoke and i always look at the sky at night just to see if i see anything .We both saw one red dot that was flashing.we thought it was a plane and i watched it and i didnt see the green light that normally blinks or flashes and this object was going faster than any plane ive seen or a helicoptor,there were also no sounds following behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two crafts my fiance saw was two bright white lights in the sky and they flew next to eachother very slow and eventually came together and flew that way for a few minutes.eventually they separated again then stoped and it joined another light and  stoped.they flew for a couple of minutes as a triangle and eventually disapeared out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> we have had many sitings at our apartment and have caught one video but when i played it back it was completly shaken then got distorted so it wasnt even clear to see . if you would like to hear more my email address is ((address deleted))<n>

The local news NBC 5 St. Louis said they would all be out tonight and the sky would be very beautiful.  As we walked out the door and looked up we saw an odd airplane way up in the sky and thought look at how fast they are going.  It was moving from the southeast to the north west. (our front door faces south)  This was way up in the sky headed toward the big dipper. It was moving very fast, and was way, way up in the sky. We thought it might be the russian kosmos satellite, because kosmos was suppose to be out tonight also, so we looked at the thing on our i phone and it was not available or identifiable and it was not a satellite. This thing was triangle in shape with a thin line around the triangle and also had white and red lights flashing on it. Man it was moving super fast from s.e. to n.w then it looked like it shifted or b! lurred and it took a direct norht path. then another immediate jog to the due north. then it shifted back to the left or the west and right back to the north and then back to the northwest again. we watched it dissapear into the northern sky. we could see it until it went behind the horizon.  This was big, fast and way up there.  Moved much faster than the space station when it comes over. We have never reported a ufo we look at the sky often on with our i phone apps because we know what we are looking at now, most of the time.  This thing was big, fast and simply fantastic.  I think it was very special. I kept saying to my friend, this is something very special until it disappeared.<n>

I thought nothing much after I lt sort of followed the geese with my eyes I turned and that&#39;s  when I saw what I saw it was shocking but exciting at the same time I saw a light which was white really bright not like a plane and it wasn&#39;t blinking then like 3 seconds later I sort of took of straight and while it did that the  light turned green as if there was a green laser it was super fast so fast I couldn&#39;t keep up with it with my eyes no plain or jet is that fast I have common sense but after that I saw something even more surprising I saw another similar light coming in the opposite direction as the other one before it and then I saw two of the same white lights going left to right simultaneously with the green laser looking thing there&#39;s no aircraft in the world that can go that fast and turn back 180degrees! instantly back and forth that fast it was beautiful it was like some thing you see in a movie after several seconds it just vanished in the air  it sounds funny but that&#39;s what  I saw and not only that this isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve seen it I&#39;ve seen it years ago about maybe 9 years ago coming out a factory in the early morning by again a green laser looking UFO flying back and forth then disappears I wasn&#39;t the only one who saw it actually about 4-6 other people saw it I was scared to say something but this time I googled how to report a UFO sighting which lead me to this form  I hope other people saw it To..

My friend, fiance, parents, and I all ran outside to see what she was talking about.  When we got outside there were only three redish orange orbs in a formation pattern.  They began to move in an elliptical direction and changed to a blue color and then back to red.  As soon as it changed back into the red color it slowly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we came back inside we asked my sister what exactly happened, she said that they heard something in the sky and looked up to see around seven shapes in the sky moving around in a weird way.  She mentioned that it sounded similar to a helicopter before they started to go away.  She went on  to say that one on the outside of the formation shot something out away from where they were standing.  I am certain that these were not helicopters.  The way these were moving is not something that any helicopter could imitate, especially the shape.  The objects that I saw were brighter than any star, or meteor that I have ever seen.<n>

I firstly thought it was big bright star that looked like Mars.  It looked very bright orangish with two light spots.  It was very slowly and very lower with no noise over the trees.  At the same time I looked other aircrafts higher over it with flicking lights.  Most aircrafts have flicking lights for safety purposes.  That ones I earlier mentioned with no flicking lights.  It moved very, very slowly over 8 minutes from facing east (from Avon mountains) to west (going to Torrington).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stood on the balcony and at about 9:35pm I noticed unusual glowing dots in the Luxor light beam at an estimated hight of max. 400-500 meters, maybe closer to ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a shining 3-light and a 4-light formation. They were „dancing“ around each other in the light beam, always keeping some formation. When they moved out of the light beam a few times they were still visible, but barley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Those motions went back and forth into and out of the light beam. Always in a pattern and always in an unnatural movement – up, down, even standing in mid-air, which I with my knowledge only can call unidentifiable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very clear night, no clouds, stars were bright, airplanes and helicopters clearly visible and distinguishable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes, there was air traffic from the nearby airport – but by its motion airplanes, helicopters, birds reflecting light, remote-controlled toys like octocopters etc. can be exempt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 5 minutes of being baffled by it I called my friend outside to the balcony – he confirmed the sighting, but couldn’t explain it to me logically either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another 5 minutes of watching the spectacle I went inside to get my phone, wanting to film it. As I came back outside those formations were gone, not to be seen again by me that night or the other nights we stayed in Las Vegas.<n>

While I can&#39;t say how high it was, it was definately very high above the clouds.  It looked to be about the size that the moon would look in the sky.  I  had a bay door above my head and used it as a reference to assure that this was actually moving and that I wasn&#39;t seeing an optical illusion from the moovement of the clouds.  It was most definately moving in a northwesterly direction. And it was most definately gigantic.  I hurried to retrieve my camera from my car but it was behind the clouds by then.<n>

In the southern sky I witnessed a cross shaped craft glowing white streak across the sky.  The angle of flight was horizontal traveling much faster than the jets which frequently train in the area.  The jets sometimes break the sound barrier nearby and make a tremendous amount more noise than the jets flying slower.  The craft I saw tonight made no sound. It also had no fire-trail while the light it emitted was very bright white with the same aura as LED lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft quickly vanished leaving nothing but a light misty trail in its wake.  The trail moved with the wind which was coming from the south at around twelve knots.  The cloud passed overhead two minutes later.  A small passenger plane flew around 2000 feet above the trail which was about 2000 feet overhead, much lower than the clouds above.  The craft was well within the atmosphere when it began its sprint and exited from view in plain sight. The trail it left behind was about half a mile in length.<n>

I call it an object because I am familiar with commercial aircraft and some of the common military aircraft which flies over and this was huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited about 30 seconds as it approached not quite overhead but a little off centered and that is when I saw a red element at it’s leading edge not on what would be the left side of the aircraft.  I wanted to see if it passed a star to be better able to see some shape on this but it did not pass any visible stars because of the time so I do not know what shape this was.

All I can say is I saw a flying object and it was HUGE.

This is plausible although I do not live in North Las Vegas where the N Las Vegas Airport is and is known to have blimps there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was asked to contact the FSS at Las Vegas and since I do not have a phone book at my home, I went on line and was given some phone numbers but it was not the FSS so after half an hour, I looked at the facts below and wrote this off as a blimp which makes sense.  I am satisfied with that because a that could explain why it was running dark and the light configuration was not your typical fixed winged aircraft and the low humming sound I heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Believe me when I say I do not normally do this and was not looking to cause any problems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for responding so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I originally wrote: I was in my backyard at 1823 when I heard a low hum (not a commercial aircraft engine type or helicopter) and looked towards the NW and saw a green light (like an aircraft on its right wing) approaching and I looked for the red element which would indicate the edge wing.

They would appear dark and then get increasingly brighter. We watched for about 1 minute and a half and then watched some break of and form another cluster lower than the first and then some more break off and form another cluster higher up.  They just swirled around in a spiral motion and then recollected and flew off into the sky getting brighter once more and then disappearing. My boyfriend and I really want to know if any one else in the area saw this or if anyone may know what it could have been. I know it wasn&#39;t a flock of birds or anything like that, it&#39;s nothing I have ever seen before I hope this explanation is clear enough. Thank you!<n>

At first I thought that it was a classic geese or duck flying formation as one of the sides even seemed to collapse momentarily.  The factors which changed my mind was that there seemed to be lights coming off of the formation. There was absolutely no noise coming from this object on a perfectly quiet morning.  There was a good southerly tail wind that morning and the object seemed to pick up speed as I continued watching it.<n>

I am someone who is very intelligent, as I go to a very prestigious school, and I question nearly everything I learn.  Growing up in a Catholic family, I always questioned things, such as my religion and its truth, because I like proof-hard facts-for things before I can truly believe something to be true.  I took an English course my freshman year of college that was centered on supernatural happenings, and sure enough, one of the main topics we focused on was extraterrestrial life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It sounds silly, really; however, when you think in the grand scheme of things, it is only logical that there is life somewhere else in our universe, as Earth is just a grain of sand compared to the universe as a whole.  But, the idea of UFOs with flashing lights that are flying all over our sky to me always sounded dumb and unbelievable.  I had the impression that people reporting these &#34;sightings&#34; were uneducated or perhaps literally on drugs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am saying all of this solely because I just stepped out of my car ten minutes ago, was a little creeped out because it is 1 in the morning and a dark, foggy night...sounds all too cliche and typical.  But as I opened my trunk and unloaded my bags, something caught my eye in the sky.  I am not kidding, this silver disk/saucer looking thing with orange lights on it was inching across the sky. I could see it so distinctly, this object was so complex and large and not high in the sky whatsoever. It was traveling so slowly, I didn&#39;t know what to do. I can honestly say I have never experienced such a feeling like this before; I was absolutely astonished. I thought I was hallucinating. I didn&#39;t move a muscle and starred at this &#34;UFO&#34; if you will, slowly cruise along the hazy clouds, and in the split of a second it was gone.  I am shaking and don&#39;t know what to think.  I wish I could have reacted more calmly and took out my phone, but in the moment I was absolutely speechless.<n>

I called my wife to look at what I was seeing, she saw it as well. No noise came from them as they went over. about 1 minute later a second group came from the same direction. this time 2 of the lights preformed what I can only describe as high speed &#34;dog fighting&#34; manuvers.

At first, we thought they were search helicopters, with how bright the lights were, but there was no sound, kind of ruled that out. Then may be a plane or jet, but as we observed them moving, it was very slow in a Northerly direction. As we watched 4 different jets came in and out of sight. One of the jets actually flew under the lower object and blotted out a part of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lower object was closer, it had 3 lights in triangular shape with a ring of light connecting them together. It turned when they started to moved, which was when it changed to on big light.

As we drove through downtown Cold Spring Minnesota, we traveled east towards Rockville, Minnesota where our church is.  As we drove through downtown, we both noticed two crafts flying to our south about two blocks away and at about the height of the water tower.  The two crafts were south of the water tower.  So they were to our right as we were driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both transfixed on them because it seemed so strange two crafts flying that low and slow.  At first we thought they might be helicopters, but they there were flying very close to each other.  They were in a formation with the lead craft slightly ahead of the other and stayed locked into that pattern.  They both had flashing lights on them which then again made us think they were helicopters.  They were flying way to slow and low to be planes, and planes would never fly that close together.  I have seen the Blue Angels perform and they would be the only ones who could pull off a maneuver like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we traveled along main street, we intersected with Hwy 23 that runs through town.  Hwy 23 runs east/west and the crafts were flying parallel to the Hwy.  When we reached the intersection (probably 20 seconds from once we first saw the crafts), the traffic light was green for us and we crossed onto Hwy 23 and we were now traveling East on Hwy 23 to Rockville.  Just then the two craft made an abrupt turn to the North East and slowly traveled right over our car.  This is where it gets really strange.  We immediately rolled down our windows to see if we could make out the crafts.  We noticed that there was no noise.  A helicopter at that altitude would sound very loud, but these did not make a sound.  Also, I can’t be 100% sure because it was the end of twilight, but we both thought we saw the shapes of the craft and they looked like triangles.  In addition we saw a dark blue light underneath one of the crafts.  This dark blue light did not flash.  We’ve never seen anything l! ike this before.  We watched as they drifted off towards the northeast.  Very strange.<n>

In one of the photos that I later altered with photoshop elements a vapor trail appeared.  My first thought was that I inadvertently created it with photoshop, but I am not sure so I am submitting the photos for an expert opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vapor trail does not appear to be that of a commercial aircraft since it has many sudden direction changes and the dissapation rate is not that of a commercial aircraft.  The trail also seems to go in and out of different altitude clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am submitting the original digital photo and the altered photo in hopes that you can give me a simple explanation of this anamoly.  If you need more information feel free to contact me in whatever way you deem appropriate but I would, very much, like to have an explanation from someone more experienced with this matter.<n>

Our home is approximately one mile south of West Wing Mountain which is located in the West Wing Mountain Preserve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5:15am this morning, Wednesday, February 22, I took our three dogs out into the backyard.   Looking north, towards West Wing Mountain, I noticed a blue light which appeared to be hovering several hundred feet above the highest peak.  One of my dogs seemed to notice the light as well, as he gazed towards the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After maybe twenty seconds, the light increased in its intensity for about five seconds before returning to its previous lower brightness.  I would say that the light increased its brightness by a factor of four or five.  It repeated that pattern of temporarily increasing its brightness three times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, after another twenty seconds or so, it suddenly disappeared as if a switch had been thrown.  My dog then acted very agitated and wanted to go back! inside our home.  The light did not move at any time we were watching it and there was no sound of any kind coming from its direction.   A few seconds after the light disappeared, a commercial jet aircraft flew over our home headed from Phoenix towards the northwest.<n>

It was like twisting at me. I freak out and lduck by moving to the far right side of my seat and slump down.  There was no way in the world it was a bird, a bat, or a piece of trash.  There were no cars near me, nor did I pass any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, there wasn&#39;t any light near where it appeared from.  This is how I knew it was glowing.  It didn&#39;t make a noise when it went by. It either had to go straight over the top of my car, or go straight up in the air.  Well, or disappear...<n>

The lights went in separate directions and I proceeded to record, I noticed several other lights in the sky but was unable to record all of them.  Shortly after this event which lasted at least 45 min  it appeared to be followed by what appeared to be military craft observing the area.  My camera work was shaky at best because of my sheer excitement of trying to figure out what i was looking at.  At one point I drove under the light and nearly dropped my phone trying to capture the uniqueness of the object.  I am completely convinced this wasnt an aircraft but I will leave that for someone with trained eyes and a amplifier to decide.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got into my car and watched it as I pulled out of the parking lot, then it just vanished.    It appeared to be higher up than where helicopters fly.  It was not balloons.

He went out to see what it was, and over our neighbor&#39;s lawn headed to south there&#39;s this huge plane or ...... something.  He called for me to come and look.  It was 3 white lights, one at 12:00, and one at each 10:00 and 2:00. In the center area (kind of below the 12:00 light)was a red blinking light.  It was shaped somewhat like a stealth fighter jet.  After the initial noise, It became silent.  No noise, no wind, no smell from exhaust, nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband said it was probably 100 ft. wide at the wing (if that is what they were) span.  It went south just over the treetops, not very high. It got to about ½ mile from here.  It stayed right there for what seemed a long time, but was probably about 5 or 6 seconds, hovering.  It started moving and faded. Anyone know what it was or what&#39;s going on? I don&#39;t remember ! having air craft around here.<n>

I had decided to bring my pair of binoculars along to see Venus which was quite bright.  I saw Venus in my binoculars and saw what I thought was a private jet or small airplane.  I focused in on the object and I noticed it was the shape of a classic 1940s-50s &#39;Flying Saucer.&#39;  It was a dark metallic color with about 5-7 porthole windows in the middle/side of the craft.  It was relatively close to the ground and there was no sound.  I believe there was a white strobe light on the top but the bottom of the craft did have a slow pulsing red light.  I moved slightly from west to the east towards Lake Michigan then I lost sight of the U.F.O.  I have seen (and reported) strange things in the sky that were simply unexplained...and I guess this is one too.<n>

I hadn&#39;t recalled seeing a bright star in that area before and decided to watch it. I went inside and got my video camera and came back. I observed the object for about 10 minutes and decided to continue observing inside as it was cold. After a few minutes inside I noticed the object dim and completely fade out.  This only took a few seconds. About 5 to 8 seconds later, it came back into full brilliance again, not like a light turning on, but from dim to full brilliance in about 3 or 4 seconds. I went onto the back porch and tried to film this several times, but it was difficult keeping my hand held camera still, especially at full zoom.  I decided to go back to the driveway and rested my arms on my car. I was finally able to capture a clear portion where the light fades out. The camera seemed to continuously re-focus itself and the next few times that it appears to fade out it! is really just the camera re-focusing. However, the first time on the video, it does completely disappear as I was literally keeping one eye on the camera and one eye free to watch the light. It faded several times as I watched with the naked eye as well prior to filming. I determined that this was not clouds blocking the object as has been suggested. I observed several other dimmer stars that could be observed through the thin clouds that were present. Also, the clouds were moving much too slow to cause the light to fade so quickly and return so quickly. I checked the skies about 1 hour later and the light was gone. I will re-check the area tonight at 8:30pm and if the skies are clear and no light is visible, this will eliminate the possibility that the object was a star.<n>

These jets came from E to W.  Wondering what they might be searching for, I ran inside and grabbed my camers- just in case.  When I went back outside and began looking around, I saw a strange, brightly-glowing fluorescent object hovering  to the SE of my vantage point, and it appeared to be not very high in the sky (where a normal plane might be.  This object was not moving, either.  Took a quick picture, and watched the glowing object for about another 2 minutes.  Then, just like somebody &#34;turned a light switch off&#34;- it was GONE.  I have the photo, and have reported it to MUFON.  The pic is on their website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  May be an evening sighting.  We have amended the time above.  PD))<n>

I was hiking in the foothills of Morrison, Colorado, when I saw three lights in the southeast sky hovering over the city of Denver.  I ran to my truck, grabbed my camera, and by the time I started filming, only two lights remained:  they were amber-colored, they glowed unlike commercial aircraft, and they stayed still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, one of them began to move:  it split into two, raced across the sky underneath the other one, and then transformed into three objects.  It went behind a hill and I lost sight of it.  The whole event lasted about 20-25 minutes  Please see the video here:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9qRnuqm7jA<n>

As the clouds moved past the object, different portions could be seen (photos attached).  What does not show on the photos since they were taken with cell phone, other dark masses of the same object or others, could be seen as the clouds moved.  It appears that most of the object was within the cloud layer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have known the witness who submitted this report for 55 years.

2/20/12 17:00|Eudora|AR|Light|3 minutes|Very, very bright motionless light in the daylight.|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87341.html|103|ndxe201202| Very, very bright motionless light in the daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Monday, February 20th, my daughter and I were driving from Greenville, MS to Lake Providence, LA. About 5 miles North of Eudora, Arkansas I noticed a very, very bright light in the sky to the east and approximately at a 60 degree angle from the road I was driving on.  This time of year, the days are longer, and even though it was partly cloudy it was still bright out. THAT is what made me question what it was that I was seeing. The brightness of this light, it was sooo very bright for that time of day. It also did not move and it didn&#39;t blink or anything. The only way I can explain it is a very, very bright star, but not twinkling. My daughter also saw this light. We watched it as the clouds moved behind it, making us believe it couldn&#39;t be a star/planet if we could see the clouds moving behind it. I continued to drive, we both watched it for a good 3 to 5 minutes before it went behind a cloud. We never saw it again. I continued to look in that general loc! ation in the sky, however, never saw anything else that I could pass off as being what I saw during the daylight. I came home and googled planets, read that we should be able to see 5 planets this month, but all of which would be in the west, and rising at dusk or later. I don&#39;t know what we saw, but thought that it might be interesting to report it here. I&#39;ve seen other things and so have friends of mine and this is my first time to actually tell anyone outside of my small circle. And amazingly enough, as I&#39;ve been reading your reports, I came across one that gave me chills because it described an exact sighting my daughter and I had in the same town, the same year, the same month...almost the exact same story as what I have to tell. So, again, if what we saw last week was just a planet or a star, then that&#39;s fine...i would like to know what it was just for curiousity&#39;s sake. Thanks and I find your website fascinating.<n>

Thety have been around 2 days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> February 19, 2012 I was outside and notice to very bright lights close by my home. Later that night around 9:00pm the lights had moved but were still present.  One light had a gold color and the others were bright lighs with flashing red lights.  I thought maybe I was not correct and possible it was a star.  The next night February, 20, 2012 I went outside and the two bright lights were close together and very close by my home.  The Other light that was a gold color was up higher in the sky. Later that night I went outside to check and the lights that were close by were no longer there, and had moved directly in front of my home but higher in the sky.  I am not sure what it is called but there is a high post by my homw with three red lights.  The object was next to this rod with the red lights, I sat outside to see if this would move.  I watch it move away from the lights and lower itself. Later that night I came out again and the light b ut the pole was gone and t! he brioght gold light had moved as well.  These lights are not stars, I am not insane and what i saw was to me I believe UFO. I will be curious if they are back tonight again.  These lights have been lingering in this area now for two days/.<n>

I was just watching, when next thing I know,  What looked like a shooting star came flying away from the direction the UFO came from, shot directly towards the planes/jets,  The object seemed to appear out of nowhere, and then disappear out of nowhere,  When the UFO Zipped off, from my perspective it looked to be going 100-150 MPH, and the object it shot seemed to be going twice that.   The UFO was Bluish/Whitish, and the object it shot was white.<n>

Within a second or 2 after it appered it took off EXTREMLY fast in a downward directon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen ANY object in the sky move that fast or be that bright.  I&#39;ve just never seen anything like that in my life.  I stood there in shock for a good 45 seconds before running back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see any type of aircraft body because the light was just so bright.  It just looked like a extremly bright white light in a perfect circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it took off it lost the perfect circle shape.  It kind of looked like a tadpole (except MUCH bigger), round head with a tail coming off of it.<n>

Then appeared in the night clouds like a wafting plastic bag caught in a drift in upper atmosphere, but it moved with purpose.  As it traveled west through the clouds, it looked dark and solid; when it came into a little cloud clearing, it looked white like the color of the cloud but had shape.  When it moved into another thick patch of cloud it took on the denser color.  The shape at the top was bulbous.  It didn&#39;t jet, it floated but with purpose.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights came close to right above our van and I rolled down the windows thinking I would hear the helicopter but there was no sound.  We pulling into the movie store parking lot and they were directly above us, again no sound, very orange round lights, one each, they seemed super super close above us, I thought the two lights were attached but one light stayed directly above us and the other moved north which was freaky, then would stop like it was waiting, then continued to move north again.  Two men in a car came bouncing into the parking lot at a high rate of speed, jumped out and said are you seeing what we are seeing I said yes, I can’t believe it, no idea what it is.  They thought it was very strange that there was no sound what-so-ever too.  Shortly after the two men arrived ! the second orange light moved north/west and finally disappeared from our site. I’m still kind of in disarray, still in shock wondering what these lights really were.<n>

2/17/12 23:00|Newburgh|NY|Triangle|5 minutes|On 2/17/12 a Massive burning flash turned into a triangular ship in Newburgh NY.|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87567.html|128|ndxe201202| On 2/17/12 a Massive burning flash turned into a triangular ship in Newburgh NY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I would like to start off by saying that this is not a hoax or a joke. I do not want to waste my time nor your time. I live in Newburgh NY. I have believed that there was some kind of life beyond this world but never looked in the sky or anything like that. Newburgh has a ufo problem. Whether alien or military there are abnormal crafts in the sky and i have the videos to prove so. Here is my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 weeks prior to the major sighting I was driving home from Planet Fitness in Newburgh Ny around 7:00 pm toward my girlfriends house who lives in Plattekill NY. Plattekill is only a couple of minutes away from Newburgh. So im driving and i see a burnt orange light in the sky. I remember saying to myself wow thats a weird color star. As I am driving I cant help but still look at it. I noticed there was like what looked to be glitter falling from this star. The glitter stops and then the star starts to rock back and forth like a cradle. It does it very slowly and then it just fades out. I pull over and then i cant see anything. That was the first time i ever saw anything weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 weeks later it is 2/17/12 and me and my girlfriend are coming from Poughkeepsie NY driving down 84 east heading towards Newburgh NY. We are driving on interstate 84 when me and my girlfriend notice a burnt orange thing hovering in the sky. You could tell it was a craft but u couldnt make out what it looked like. We just dismissed it as a plane and kept on driving. We kept driving and got to the Beacon Bridge which connects you from Poughkeepsie to Newburgh. Thats when we saw the craziest thing that i have ever seen in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a craft flying and then all of a sudden a huge burnt orange flash. I mean this flash was huge. So big i slammed on my brake and pulled over on a bridge.  I thought that a plane had exploded and i was ready to dial 911. I go to grab my phone and then realize that noone else was stopping. No sirens....no ambulances....no nothing.  We are standing outside looking around trying to see if we see any thing and all we see is the same craft continue to fly off into the night.  I thought it was so weird how this craft look like it exploded and then all of a sudden it flies away unscathed. We get back in the car to see if we can follow this thing but it went off way to high.  So right now me and my girlfriend are stunned. I cant believe i just saw something blow up and then fly away like nothing happened.  We sit back and think to ourselves well where did we see the huge flash of light at and we determined it to be right over Torches on the waterfront in newburgh.  This waterfront ha! s a whole bunch of restaurants but it doesnt open until the weather gets warmer up here so very few cars were there.  We then said lets go down and see if maybe some stuff dropped on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we go down and park.  We see nothing no marks or anything. I take out my camera and start looking into the sky. Nothing.  We stayed for about 15 minutes and still nothing.  So then i said forget it and lets leave. We turn around and then i felt sonmething.  I cant explain what i felt but something told me to turn around one last time.  Thats when it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to start off by saying it was the MOST BEAUTIFUL THING I HAVE EVER SEEN.  It was a light that I swear could pierce right through your soul.  A huge flash of light like the sun was breaking the night beamed from beneath the clouds.  It was so bright and wide. I couldnt move or speak.  i just stood there......amazed.  This big flash stayed in the sky and then started to get smaller.  The brightness of the flash never left but it got smaller. at first I thought it started shrinking but then i realized it wasnt shrinking but it was moving this way. I grabbed my camera off my neck and started recording. This light became a ball of light and it was moving slowly over the water from Poughkeepsie and into Newburgh.  Me and my girlfriend are standing in the Torches parking lot.  This light is still moving and then it starts to split into two lights.  It split kind of like when cells do under a microscope or something like that. Now its two lights but they lights are not split. the two lights are side my side to each other. The two lights then turn to 3.  The third light appears on top the two lights like a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can see that it in the first video.  The videos are shaky in the beginning because i couldnt capture it.  It was so weird. With our eyes it was moving slow but on camera it was so fast that i had to constantly keep focusing in and out on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the other videos you can see more lights appear. I am still recording this thing come over the water and then it starts to get really close.  And so now its half way over the water and there is like 6 or 7 lights around this thing.  Whatever it was was completely flat. Its moving so slow and then i start to realize that it was way bigger than i thought it would be.  This craft had to be about 150 feet in the air.  Which i thought was real unusual since you dont see airplanes that close. The craziest thing about this ship was that it was so quiet. I have seen smaller planes that that thing make noise and be further away. So it didnt make any sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this ship is coming over us and thats when i seen that my amazement turned to fear. This was not American made. I tried recording it but for some reason it would not show up. It was 11:00 pm and it was very dark outside so i know that didnt help. Whoever is reading this please understand that what i am about to tell you is 100% what me and my girlfriend saw and ill take a lie detector test to prove so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ship was in the shape of a triangle like a pizza slice. One corner was red, the other was blue and the tip was orange. In the middle of it was about 5 to 6 huge orange lights. This ship made no noise and was flying but flying so slow. It was black or maybe even a dark gray. It was very wide. The lights were the most amazing part. because it was so bright. I couldnt see any writings or lettering on the ship. It then pasts us and starts to tilt into the sky. So basically from the time it left Poughkeepsie and got to us it seemed to be flying straight. But once it passed it and it started to tilt into the sky. It was still moving slow and flew until we couldnt see it anymore. Right off into the stars. My girlfriend can recant the whole story word for word. I turned around to look at her and she looked as though she saw a ghost. Everything was fun until it passed us. I always thought it would be cool to come in contact with a ufo but it didnt feel so. i felt terrified. That ! thing was massive. It was so silent. I couldnt believe noone seen anything. We were the only ones on that dock. Please listen to this. I dont know who you are or what you do. I am taking alot of risks by writing this to you but it needs to be told. Something or Someone is hiding something here. Because since then i continually see these bright orange lights. i see these lights rocks back and forth and some fade and then others come back. I have seen these lights make triangles and then dismember themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know what you guys can do or what you guys will do. But i am telling you this is no hoax. after i typed in google ufo by beacon bridge ny and saw some amazing stuff. it was a forum called MUFON. I had posted my story and then someone commented and told me to write this. I am not looking for fame or money. I want answers. Because this stuff is real and scary and i see on the news all the time about other places seeing the kind of things i saw. As of late they have been happening more and more than ever before. i feel as though something apocalyptic is going to happe and happen soon. Please respond to this. i know contact is not feasible but if you are serious my post is on the http://forums.mufon.com/index.cgi?board=general&amp;action=display&amp;thread=350. I refuse to let my story be swept under the rug i am not crazy nor delusional. i am a graduate of 4 year university with a great job and a wonderful girlfriend and an amazing family. I am a ordinary person and a couple of ! months ago i would have laughed in someones face if they told me I would do this. I know what we saw.....I dont want the joke to be on us. Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be sending a video titled the 17th of February Sight.<n>

There were about five volleys of missiles shot.  There was the sound of jet craft coming from the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were hiding in the mountains so that they could not be seen but we could hear them.  There were three distinct squadrons of jets that went to intercept the craft.  They went by about five minutes apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually we saw the light start to dodge the jets; they had finally appeared some 80 miles, a guess, away.  The light finally went behind the mountains and away from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the squadron follow the craft and a few minutes later we saw a cigar shaped light descend from the sky and start to follow the jets to the west until it too disappeared behind the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports were submitted to our Center.

I notice one solid bright ball of light moving very slowly in a clear sky above Kenmore East High School from west to NNE.  I&#39;ve seen this type of light in the sky the past couple of years traveling in the same west to east direction.  The lighted ball was large in size and very bright.  No sound, no strobe lights as seen on aircraft.  It maintained a steady slow speed, light remained the same size.   As the light maintained the same altitude as it moved across the sky, a few commercial aircraft traveling at a higher altitude in a east to west direction passed above it.   As this object traveled farther east, the light dimmed.  It seem to have dropped below the reflective light of the setting sun.<n>

The object was very bright it pulsed and moved at a very rapid speed. In the five minutes or so we witnessed this object it moved from left to right across the sky until it was no longer visible. Then it came back into view moving right to left until it was out of sight. Then this object came back into view left to right and hovered in the southern sky before moving lower below our line of sight.  Then it climbed back into our line of sight and continued to clime straight up into the sky until it was so high we could no longer see it.  Then the object came back down to its starting point hovering in the sky about 100 feet above the tree line.   At this point it just disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was gone we were all on the deck of my parent’s house wondering what we had just seen and that is when we heard the noise of an aircraft.

The jets made several passes over the area at very low altitude, so low that we could clearly see the lights inside the cockpit, a soft green glow.<n>

Tonight is another clear night, and there was the same bright white light I&#39;ve seen before, just hovering over M-50 and the fields. It seemed to have a bit of an aura around the light this time.  It was hovering the air for a while, I would say between 8:00 and 10:00 pm.  I saw a LOT of other aircraft flying by it. I lost count of how many airplanes I saw coming through the sky and flying near this hovering object.  There were also other white lights blinking around it in the sky.  The planes were higher up than the object, but flying all around it, so that means this ufo was much closer to earth.  I think there might have been a few helicopters. I got my binoculars out in an attempt to get a closer look. It was still hard to see the shape of the object because of the light, but it almost looked like it was flying saucer shaped! But like I said, I am not absolutely certain of the shape. Any! way, I had my mom come out and look at it, so she saw it too. I went inside and then came back out a little later. The light had moved further away, and instead of being white, it had change to a red/orange color. I used my binoculars again, and watched it move further away. It got far enough to where I could no longer see it with my own eyes, only with the binoculars, and then eventually completely disappeared from my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the amount of airplanes and helicopters I saw moving around this thing, I am convinced that others are looking into this. I did see one car pull off the road, and I saw some other cars slowing down, so I want to assume that other people are seeing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Jupiter and Venus??

It was cloudy but the jets were flying low enough to cause very loud noise and we have always been able to see the jets clearly because we are only seven miles from the landing strip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the jets landed, we saw two bright orbs, what we thought were very bright stars high up in the sky, higher than the jets.  The one on the left was zig zagging back and forth and the one on the right was just drifting slowly towards the left.  This went on for about five minutes, zig zagging from here to there and then the lights just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no fading of lights, no sound, and absolutely no tracers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watch the jets come in every night and have never experienced this kind of thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is a non-believer in UFO&#39;s.

Gray V shape object with 3 circular patches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tend to walk in the golf course behind my home everyday and this one day I was actually playing golf. The situation I was in called for a different golf stick so I had to make a short trip back. While walking towards my house I observed what looked like to be a moving star with a illuminating light heading north as I was facing south.  It looked like it was moving slow because of the distance of the object. As it moved, the light that was on it appeared to be getting larger and larger to the point where it was a huge ball of light in the sky.  It made no sound whatsoever. As it continued moving the light began to be getting smaller and smaller until it turned its &amp;quot;lights&amp;quot; completely off. I observed a gray V shaped craft with a chevron look to it hovering in the sky.  They were circular patches on each corner where I believe the lights were coming from before.  I lost track of the object.  I believe I witnessed the same object 09/04/2012 as I reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They appeared to be about a mile apart, and the same shape.  The shape appeared to be similar to a zeppelin with the rear end of a conventional aircraft&#39;s tail section.  They did not move at all.  In relationship to distance, these objects were much too large to be a twin rotor helicoptor, and too uniform in shape to be clouds.  The same object was also documented on 02/20/12 in almost the same location at 3:15 pm.  The same exact shape and never moved.  Was seen for about 30 minutes by two witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After using the restroom, I came back to my room and laid down.  I had my bedroom window open.  I got on FB via my cell and was checking my status at this time.  Then I laid back down, and I couldn&#39;t fall asleep so I began looking out the window from my bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when I saw a fireball drop from the sky, I immediately went to the window, to see where this object came from and saw, a silhouette of some type of plane gliding silently in the sky.  I could not make out what it was as there were no lights on this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireball was falling, as it fell it split into about seven smaller fireballs.  They look white with a tail, actually they look like falling stars or rather balls of fire.  I thought it was a bomb and that we were under some terrorist attack.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was facing East, towards my parents home.  Actually, the white balls of fire, never touched the ground but, just stayed floating then they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to wake up my roommate as I was afraid.  Then, I could not sleep, I was worried as my friend wouldn&#39;t wake so I stayed in bed looking out the window.  I didn&#39;t close it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed a small plane circling the area of where this occurred for about fifteen minutes and then it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, it was almost morning, around 4:30 to 5:00 a.m.  Now it is almost daylight.  Again, this object, came back to the same spot and dropped another fireball down.  I can only tell you that even though it was almost daylight, I could not see clearly the object that dropped this fireball, but only that you could faintly make out that it was some sort of craft, but invisible, no color, no lights and you can see it gliding away right when the fireball drops from it.  Again, this ball of light split into approximately five or six smaller balls of light, they were white.  I can say, I thought it was a comet, or what looks like a comet as when it moved or rather glided it had a tail emitting from the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then I saw these balls of light flying around, and then disappeared for a second time.  Shortly after, now panicked I kept calling my mom, and she was up.  She said that, the only thing she has noticed for the past three days at this hour, including the day of my sighting, was that her house, kept losing power that it felt like something had been draining the power from her home and her lights kept coming off and on and her battery back up would come on.  The lights though would dim she said as if it was being drained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are several You Tubes that were captured and you can see clearly that they are in the direction of where I stated.  Almost above my parent&#39;s home, but high in the sky.<n>

The night was cold, clear, and many stars in the sky.  My dog started barking wildly, which she doesn&#39;t do unless something is about. There is a large tract of wooded land beyond my back fence, and this was where she was directing her focus.  I let my other dog out and she proceeded to the same spot beyond my fence. I saw nothing so went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dogs were now barking more so I went back out; at this point they were barking up a tree at the back.  I shone a flashlight up the tree and saw a raccoon staring down.  This was the first raccoon I had seen in twenty years of living here.  As I was looking up at the raccoon, I noticed a very bright light to my left, coming from the SW and heading NW, at an altitude of about 1000 ft., much lower than commercial flights into Warwick State Aiport.  The light was orangy-yellow, about the brightness of Jupiter, and was ! surrounded by multi-colored smaller lights. There was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to pick up speed greatly as it passed to my north...a very smooth gliding but fast pace. I watched it through the pine trees until it was out of my sight to the NE.  It was much faster than any plane heading toward the state airport and was much lower in the sky than the usual planes.  The brightness of the light did not change during my total viewing, nor did the brightness of the colored lights that surrounded it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not my first sighting in this area (Perryville section of South Kingstown). Three years ago I stood right under a large bright yellowish light, only 200 feet above me and just over a power transformer,  that had an electric-like green light at the &#39;tail.&#39;   This object also smoothly pioted and glided away as I watched it dumb-struck outside of my car.  I believe this area is a &#39;hotspot.&#39;<n>

It caught my attention because it was so beautiful, the colors were white, red, blue and yellow, but it was spinning clockwise and it flew so fast the I only saw it for about 3 seconds and it was out of sight, then I heard a noise like the sound of a jet--but it was not jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My window faces North, but the object came across from a easterly direction.  I felt compelled to run to the window to see it as it went by, but it was gone before I could move.  I am on the 5th floor of a 9-story apartment building and my window is even with the tops of most trees.<n>

We saw a stationary bright light that almost looks like Venus, It&#39;s so bright it creates what looks like a cross of light in the sky. It is low in the western sky below &amp; to the right of Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could see a red circular ball like light that appeared to be circling around the outer center of the stationary bright light as it would flash red on the far left &amp; then red on the far right of the light.  The red ball like lights size was less than 1/4th of the size of the stationary bright light it was encircling.  Not sure how long it&#39;s been there, watched it for 10 minutes &amp; came to write this. I just went to check &amp; see if it was still there &amp; it&#39;s gone.  It&#39;s now 12:25.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time that I &amp; my friend have seen this in this same place only last time it was a little higher in the western sky &amp; it was about a year&amp; 1/2 or so ago.  My friend noticed it first last time &amp; said it was the same thing he had seen in Nashville sometime between 1998 &amp; 2000.  Last time we saw a red light travel up to the stationary light &amp; then leave it....he said that happened when he saw it in Nashville too.  Tonight we didn&#39;t see any red light coming or going. However, when I first noticed the light there was a small red light shining for a moment to the upper left of the stationary light about a foot away from the light. I looked away for a moment as I was driving at the time &amp; when I looked back the small red light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weird.<n>

I was working on Feb. 15th 2012 from 1800 to 0600.At exactly 2047 hours I was on the phone with my brother just talking about work.  As I was sitting here I started to hear a very loud noise outside of the guard shack.  I then had thought to myself that it was a big rig truck coming on to site to drop some sort of equipment to drill, I had then proceeded to tell my brother hold on so I can go sign the person driving the truck in.  As i walked outside to look, there was nothing outside at all and the noise kept getting louder and louder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had at that point thought maybe a helicopter was flying very close by so I thought nothing of it at all and continued to talk to my brother.  As I sat back down, I looked out the window and screamed to my brother what the F*@&amp; is that.  He said &#34;What are you talking about&#34; I told him I will call you right back i need to get a picture of this.  I ran outside exactly at 2049to try and get a photo of this very big flying aircraft of some sort to show others.  I took two photos of it...  Nothing showed up except a very distant 3 white dots.  This thing was HUGE! If i were to put it next to the moon it probably would take up about 1/10th of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked almost identical to a Stingray of some sort.  It had 3 lights that flashed from blue to white. It was very very close to me, I&#39;d have to say about 150 yards away and about 10 stories from the ground.  It was very loud and moving very slow, and lets put it this way it was so loud that the ground was shaking and it was moving slower than a car traveling roughly 30 MPH on a highway.  I don&#39;t know what to think of this sighting which is why I’m writing this.  I hope to find some other people with a similar sighting, somewhat close to where I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where I saw it:  Smithton/South Huntingdon, PA.  Who saw it:  Just me, myself, and I When I saw it:  2049 (8:49PM) for about 60 seconds What I saw:  UFO Description of what I saw:  A very dark triangular shaped aircraft flying very low to the ground and really loud (as loud as a Helicopter but not the same sound), It had 3 (maybe 4) blue and white flashing lights.  About as big as a football field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Direction it was traveling:  About 125 Degrees Southeast<n>

Although I didn’t note the time in my car, I called my wife on her cell phone when I was stopped at Bourdeaux Pl about a couple of minutes after the initial sighting. Her call log indicates 7:45pm for this call. The sighting was on the route of my daily commute since August 2002.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duration: At least a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving at the time. There was one car very close behind – probably because I had slowed down considerably. I was frustrated by the proximity of this car which forced me to continue out of the line of sight of the object (now behind me), down a hill and up the other side of the valley. It was probably close to a mile later when I was able to safely pull over into a right turn lane for Bourdeaux Place (probably about 2 minutes later) – see map (UFO_sighting_location_Feb_15_2012_1.PNG). At this location I could look across. I could still see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: Appearance: Apparently triangular with closely-spaced twin red and green lights (one set at each apex). The lights spanned Goshen Rd. The central light appeared somewhat higher than the ones to the right (East) and the left (West). The lights were not strobed and appeared similar in separation from my viewpoint. When I first saw the object I was at the STOP at Warfield Rd, traveling North on Goshen Road. The object was to the North of me. For a brief moment I thought it was a commercial airliner at a frighteningly low altitude, but immediately afterward it appeared like the triangular object was floating and seemed to be canting slowly. I could not make out for sure if there was matter between the three twinned light sources because it was very dark. I got a good idea of the distance between the three light sources because within a few hundred feet, just after passing Lochaven drive, I had passed underneath the object and all three points were behind me. The central apex lig! hts passed right overhead. The lights on the other apeces were perhaps over the houses on each side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reconstruction (from memory): Unfortunately I do not have a photo or video. However, I have used an image of the approximate initial viewpoint of the object in front of me from Google Maps. The daytime view of the location would be approximately like this:  SEE E-MAILED IMAGE scene_Goshen_and_Lochaven-day.PNG  I have tried to sketch what I saw (and the scale) by using the above daytime Google Maps image and inking out the sky. It was a very clear (cloudless) night, but dark – no moonlight I think. The object then looked something like that shown below: (I cannot be sure if the green was on the left or the right of the red and the lights may have been slightly closer together and more aligned in a fixed direction than I have indicated. Also this reconstruction shows definite sky between the points, whereas in reality I could not make out any sky between the points - only blackness – but the illustration gives an idea of what I saw).<n> <n><n> <n><n> SEE E-MAILED IMAGE: approx_reconstruction_UFO.PNG  Scale: From the fact that I had passed underneath all three points of light within a few hundred feet at low speed, I could tell that these lights were at low altitude, perhaps 100 to 150 ft up and that the object spanned perhaps 150 to 200 feet on one edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sound: I did not have any windows open but detected no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Action taken immediately afterwards: The first place I was able to safely pull over with a line of sight to the original location of the sighting was in a right turn-only lane dedicated to a residential street (Bourdeaux Place, just West of Route 124). At this location, I got out and walked a little East to gain a sight around some trees. I could see the tree line on the other side of the valley and the three points of light just above the tree line, but now planar (horizontal). It seemed like the object had moved somewhat East and was no longer tilted up. Looking at the Google map later, and the orientation of Bourdeaux Drive relative to the initial location, I would say that this assumption was accurate. I got on my cell phone and called my wife to tell her that something weird was going on and asked her to put on the local news to see if anything had been reported. I then got back into my car and continued home. At little later (on Howard Chapel Rd - the Montgomery County part) I again pulled over to look ba! ck across towards Gaitherburg but didn’t see anything unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Action taken on Thursday February 16, 2012 I decided that I would take no further action until I returned on my morning commute the next day in daylight. This would take me on the exact reverse route through the location of the sighting. There was nothing visible that could possibly explain what I saw the previous night and everything appeared normal. Once at the office I decided to call the Airport Manager at: Montgomery County Airpark 7940 Airpark Drive, Gaithersburg, MD 20879 Phone: (301) 963-7100 An answering machine kicked in so I had to leave a message for the manager. I tried to describe what I saw in a way that wouldn’t be instantly dismissed as a “crackpot call”. I left my name and my NIST office number and requested that they call be if they could explain what I might have seen. As of today I have not been contacted. I also told a colleague, who happens to live on Lochaven Drive, about my experience.  She and her family were at home but had not seen or heard anything.  She said she would ask neighbors who walk their dogs at about that time. I am guessing that perhaps dozens of others may have seen what I saw on that stretch of road at that time, so I have checked the internet periodically to see if there are any similar reports.  So far I have not seen any but I want to log my experience.  Who knows? Maybe someone else saw this and either dismissed it or failed to report it.<n>

And about 10 seconds after I initially saw the first 2 a third one appeared.  Same red bright light as the first 2.  They were hoovering a little bit and once the cloud cover came they &#34;dimmed&#34; out, like as a light goes out.<n>

They were together briefly and then the plane traveled ahead while the ball of light continued to move across the sky more slowly (perhaps at a different altitude?).  My partner came outside just in time to see the ball of light traveling - and we both saw its light begin to diminish and change from bright white to reddish to pinkish then it disappeared.  There were several small planes traveling across the sky at the time; they all looked and sounded very obviously like planes.  This ball of light was very bright, no lights flashing -  no wing definition - no sound.  It looked nothing like the airplanes that were in the sky during this event.<n>

It was around 5:00pm and I was traveling in a northerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just about to take my exit from one expressway to another when I noticed to my left an odd little cloud that was lit up from behind and was displaying rainbow colors.  I kept looking at it trying to figure out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition, right in front of me was a huge ball of beautiful pale yellow light, not moving at all, just hanging there in the sky.  At the time I thought was the sun.  It was massive and it didn’t hurt the eyes to look directly at it.  It was like looking at the sun through a gauzy haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The oddly colorful and brightly lit cloud to my left captured my attention.  As I continued to drive, I was looking from the ball of light in front of me, to the anomaly on my left.  I was observing other drivers to see if anyone else noticed anything out of the ordinary and no one seemed to.  Unfortunately, I was unable to pull over to examine it more closely due to heavy traffic and the lack of a safe place to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the next day while traveling home at the same time of day and the same route that I realized that the anomaly to my left I had witnessed the day before was actually the sun shining through a cloud; and that the large ball of light was the true anomaly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still marvel to this day about what it could have been; and I regret not pulling off the highway to get a better look.<n>

That day I was home from school that day; I had a fever and was puking badly. It was noon to one-ish, and I was a sleep on the couch in the living room and the tv was on. There was a loud bang, that came from the window in the kitchen almost like a shot gun blast outside the wall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up to see what it was. As I went to the window I could see something out the window, so I went to the self and got my mother’s camera because mine was upstairs in my room. I went to the window and took three photos of a craft that looked like a spudnik with 3 legs, and a strip on the center but the bush was blocking the way so I went out onto the deck of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And I had saw that the craft, it was hovering up about a foot off of the ground. A took another picture, then the craft moved straight up into the air, making no sounds what so ever, as I tried to take another photograph the ship had gone up past the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked down to the spot the ship had landed. I saw that the grass was burnt in the spots the legs of the craft were at, there was also pressed down grass in the center with a white goo on the grass, I took some photos of the circle, I went to go touch the goo and when I did my hand became cold, and num. so I went back into the house then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day later, at the same time I had saw the craft, turkey valtures circled the mark, there was about 20 of them. They were there for about 60 seconds and then the were gone, in seconds and I can not tell you were they went. They just left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> email me if you would like to see the photo graphs- i don&#39;t trust people seeing them after a flash drive holding the data was stolen from my house, when better flash drives weren&#39;t<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This report concerns two  -  [2] sightings – within the confines of my bedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> •	The first incident occurred in December 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While asleep at approximately 0230 – 0300 I awoke to the sight of about 4-6 white balls (the size of a Ping-Pong ball, swirling in a clock-wise motion and exiting my bedroom, through the venetian blinds which were closed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As one can imagine, I was mystified at the sight of those luminous balls of light, vanishing through the closed blinds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound associated with the incident.  I perceived no “communication” of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> •	A second similar incident occurred at about the same time of the morning in February 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was awakened by the sense that something was happening.  I cannot describe the feeling, other than ‘something’ was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I raised my head from the pillow to observe one [1] single, white illuminant white ball, the approximate size of a Ping-Pong ball, ‘dancing’ up and down the entire length of my dog, which was sleeping on the floor approximately six feet from me.  The light reminded me of the sing-along ‘bouncing ball’ at the bottom of the television screen when a song is being sung with subtitles provided for the lyrics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was astonished at the sight!  The light started at the dog’s nose and ended at the tail.  The light then vanished, and presumably exited the room.  The lights in the bedroom were - off.  I then drifted off to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within what seemed to be a matter of minutes, I felt as though I was now being observed!  I opened my eyes without raising my head from the pillow to observe the same white luminous ball now directly in front of my face, at a distance of perhaps 2 feet!  	When I opened my eyes the ball began to ‘dance’ from my head to my toes – the full length of 	my body.  There was no communication, there was no sound, and the light/ball seemed ‘programmed’ to do so, without any concern at being observed by me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball of light in both cases remained constant, without any increase or decrease in brightness.  All motion was constant and consistent in both cases.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never before personally seen or heard of such a thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

2/15/12 01:00|Storrs|CT|Light|20 seconds|Stable, then darting small, bright, red light, suddenly sped away out of view within 1 second.|11/14/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115223.html|170|ndxe201202| Stable, then darting small, bright, red light, suddenly sped away out of view within 1 second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was star gazing on a clear night around midnight or 1:00am in Storrs, CT, in the cemetery on campus.  Lying still on the ground, l was looking up at the various stars, planets, planes, shooting stars, etc. for roughly 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, I noticed 1 small and very distant bright red light slowing moving in a line across the sky.  The light itself shone steadily and did not blink.  The movement had caught my eye.  After about 3 seconds of steady movement, the light turned in an arc and slowed down. I thought that was strange.  Then, over the course of about 15 more seconds total, it proceeded to halt, dart up/down/left/right with extreme precision and speed.  Finally, it halted for half a second before suddenly speeding away as suddenly as it had appeared.  It completely disappeared within 1 second.  It had sped so far away so quickly, that I lost sight of it within a perfectly clear night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I was dumbfounded by what I had seen. I hadn&#39;t even had time to blink during the whole entire time I witnessed it. It was not a shooting star (which would have been white-yellow in color, and follow a more brief and linear path before disappearing).  However, I would describe the speed of its travel similar to how fast a shooting star would move – “blink, and you’ll miss it!”  The precision of the halts and turns is what really astounded me. No shooting star, comet, or plane could move with that sort of instantaneous, precise movement, or come to a dead halt that effectively.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very eerie, yet very interesting.  I immediately texted my best friend to let her know because I was so excited!  Needless to say, I got up and went back inside to the safety of my dorm to process what I had seen.<n>

They were bright orange and a strange formation, some in the back formation caught up to the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to get someone else to witness it and they had no idea what it was.  We watched it for at least 5 min, till they reached a spot in the sky and started to disappear a few at a time or one at a time.  The final one slowed down in the same area as the other and almost like flickered out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they were gone.…<n>

It appered to be a large bright yellow object which caused some kind of electrical interferance with my tv signal of which i only became aware of its cause by walking outside and looking skyward and observing this glowing object on the evening of feb 14 2012 around 7 to 7:20 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure it was neither a star or human craft but perhaps some unknown object yet to be if ever determined<n>

My girlfriend and I observed the same type of object a few days previously about 40 miles away in West Valley City (flying over Valley Fair Mall).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both fireballs seemed to originate from close to ground-level starting above the city of Palmyra, Utah (appx. 40.148832,-111.719799).  They ascended gradually in the air at roughly a 35 degree angle.  I&#39;m guessing the objects were 10-20 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object headed due north and reached an altitude of approximately 10-15,000 feet (slightly higher than half the altitude of commercial jets that frequently fly above the path of the these two objects).  After approximately two minutes I lost sight of the first object as it passed behind trees a few yards from my balcony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object seemed to arise from the same area traveling somewhat north, northeast.  It flew for about 3/4 of the distance as the first object but abruptly faded and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate their speed to be faster than a twin-engine plane or transport military helicopter, but traveled about as fast as the life-flight helicopter which frequently flies in the same area to and from Utah Valley Regional Medical Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to record the object with a Sony DCR-TRV11 digital video camera.  The objects looked to be active balls of flame changing colors from orange to yellow.  There were no blinking lights and no other observable lights coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkVN67GDzgs<n>

That is how I am sure it couldn&#39;t have been normal aircraft.  They had red flashing lights and moved very slowly at first.  They seperated and moved farther apart. Then they started moving at a rapid rate.  It was very odd.  They also seemed to orginate or start around a yellow light. It was not the same color as a star, much brighter and very big, like the North star.  That object remained in place and did not move that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

This was accompanied by power outages across the city.<n>

Through the telescope we could see all different colors just constantly morphing.  It was not really moving. It was more hovering in one spot.  It did start to move away from us and get harder and harder to see.  It also came closer one time. We recorded the sighting with our phone through the telescope and just aimed toward the sky so we could get every vantage point possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were possibly 3 to 4 more UFO&#39;s that we saw at the beginning but they quickly disappeared.<n>

I do not have a precise date of this event, but I can cay that it was night time, around 8:00 p.m. P.S.T.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting at my computer watching videos on YouTube, when I looked to my left out my window, and saw a small single engine plane, traveling northeast; below the plane was a bright gold colored object not unlike a star.  The object appeared to be following the plane at approximately three to eight hundred feet below the aircraft.  The object accelerated at an incredible speed ahead of the plane, then reversed at a slightly slower speed.  The object then accelerated at a fantastic rate of speed, and within an almost imperceptible period of time, split into about five separate objects of the same bright gold color and disappeared in less than one second.   This event lasted about 4 seconds at the most.  I can say that I do not believe this was a reflection, satellite, or a shooting star, of which I have personally seen many.  Its behavior was unique.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Respectfully,   ((name deleted))<n>

A formation of lights appeared in the sky in front of their car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were self-illuminated, constant in intensity, white; no other colors were observed.  They were moving only a little faster than the girls were driving, perhaps 80-100 miles per hour maximum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While they were watching one object spiraled down and disappeared while another disappeared suddenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The girls did not attempt to follow and did not alert any authorities.  All the objects eventually disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects each varied position relative to each other like a dance.  The brightness of each these objects did not vary until they disappeared...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The girls did not think that these were flares.

And the two lights would move, then stay still, then literally dissaper and reappear.  At some points the circle objects would look like two or more circles making sort of a shape and fly slower then they would go straight back into perfect circles again and fly off slow.  At one point the craft was visible it was metallic and had one light flashing white for a little, then the craft looks like it shape shifted into green and purple lights then back to a diskish shape with the one white light and flew off and we lost it in sight, throughout the night lights were coming from all angles, aligning, communicating, in a weird way it seemed like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have not seen the footage, but we a star or planet.

I was talking to her (she was standing with her back to the road) I saw a flash of light and it wasn&#39;t like a car of any sought and it was shining through the trees I was freaked out! I told my sister straight away and she said its just car lights (she believes there some other beings out in space on different planets but not to the extreme I do so she&#39;s a bit sceptical about the whole incident) anywho I was trying not be afraid and tried to convince myself it was cars or a car but no car came within the next 20 minutes we were there. Anyway as we were driving home my sister was making fun of me pretending she was an &amp;quot;alien&amp;quot; clone of my sister which hurt my feelings because I know what I saw, but later that night my sister and I were watching a movie and I fell asleep about 10.30-11 pm and I have no memory to how I got to bed except her yelling at me and being angry before she slammed her bedroom door. I woke up the next morning which was a Saturday and watched th! e rest of the movie as I fell asleep while watching the night ! before, so about an hour through the movie my sister comes out and said what the fuck were you on about last night and I replied with I don&#39;t remember anything what did I do, she went on and told me that when she tried to wake me up and I got up and said &amp;quot;where is everyone&amp;quot; and she told me she said that they were asleep and she was going to bed then she told me I asked where (fake name) dahlia was which was her &#39;name&#39; and she said she replied I&#39;m here? And I said no seriously dahlia where the fuck is dahlia and she thought I was joking but when she was telling me she said it did t seem like i was joking because I would have smiled by then anyway apparently I continued on the the kitchen and she was so scared I was going to have a knife when returning that she followed me stopping at the door she said she watched me and I stood in the middle of the room for about 3 minutes until I went to the light switch and turned off the light, she said I was angry and swearing when I wa! lked past her to the lounge room where I turned off the lights leaving her in the dark and she she said she got angry saying &amp;quot;I can&#39;t turn off the lights on her&amp;quot; she told me while telling me what I dd last night that she was so scared because I was so angry and that I&#39;ve never acted like that to her, then she continued on saying that she went to her room yelling at me saying not to turn the lights of on her which then she slammed the door at that moment I said that I remembered her slamming her door and her being angry but that was all, not even going to bed it was like I was in a trance, after reading a book on people&#39;s reports of aliens I thought I should so that&#39;s why only now I&#39;m reporting my sighting Oh also the next day I read on Facebook someone&#39;s status quote &amp;quot;Aliens visited (my home town- she said the actual name though) last night&amp;quot; In conclusion I believe I had an alien encounter as it was not only me that felt the weirdness<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in February 2012 is approximate.

It was a simple, bright white light that was moving faster than any plane or helicopter we&#39;ve seen.  We saw it travel across an arc of ten or 15 degrees in the sky for about one second before it abruptly disappeared, like a light turning off.  I&#39;ve seen helicopters and meteor showers and this just didn&#39;t fit what I&#39;ve seen before. It moved exactly like a meteor, but there was no streak behind it, and it was as bright as Venus, and it caught our eye right in the middle of town among all the street lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

2/12/12 19:00|Norcross|GA|Light|all night|Followed by Unidentified Light Objects on multiple occassions whether walking or driving|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87248.html|201|ndxe201202| Followed by Unidentified Light Objects on multiple occassions whether walking or driving<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday February 12, 2012  Me and my granddaughter were on the way home and I looked out my window and saw what I thought was a plane like beside me like it wanted to get my attention.  It was low but I could not actually see anything but a white light.  It was like it was racing or keeping up with me.  I mentioned it to my granddaughter and she looked over and saw it.  I told her I was only going 35-40 miles and it would pass us when we stopped for the red light.  When I stopped it stopped. (on a dime). When the traffic light turned green I started it started.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in shock I was afraid to go home so I went to Walgreens the plane or whatever stayed in the sky until I began to drive again and followed me to the post office.  I called my son and daughter and another friend.  No one answered.  I went in the post office to get some stamps and returned to my van. The plane or whatever was still hovering in the sky.  My son called me back and I told him what was happening.  My son said a plane could not stop like that.  I heard no sound from the flying object.  I only saw a big bright light.  I proceeded to 24 hr Wal-Mart about 15 miles away.  On my way there I asked my grand daughter if she saw it following us.  When she looked up she said yes and another one has joined it, but it had a smaller white light flying right  next to it.  When I pulled into Wal-Mart parking lot there was another flying object that had a red and green light on either side.  I could not see what was in between the lights. It hovered over Wal-Mart as we entered the store.  We stayed in the store for about 1 hour and came out the doors at the opposite end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to exit Wal-Mart from the opposite end from where we entered. When we stepped off the curb and into the parking lot the object with the red and green lights followed us to my van.  The other two were still at the end of the store where we had entered at just standing still and very close together.  When we got inside the van my daughter called and I was explaining to her what was happening.  Then I began to see more of the objects with the green and red lights. There were approaching from the North. So I began to tell her “here comes another one and another one and another one”.  She asked me what was going on and I said I don’t know.  I was freaking out but trying to stay calm for my granddaughter.  Then the smaller lights began to arrive as well.  When I pulled out of the parking lot there were approximately 6 objects with the red and green lights and 12 of the white smaller lights that were following me.  This time I traveled the expressway.  We could still see! more and more white lights coming toward us from the left and the right.  I pulled on the median on the expressway and stopped.  When I stopped they all stopped.  It was late and my grand daughter had school the next day, so I told her we would just go home.  We went home and the lights followed us all the way home and was hovering over the parking lot and my apartment.  The big white light was right on top of my apartment.  We counted approx 30 of the white lights and the red and green lights stayed on the perimeter.  We went in and I told her not to cut the TV on or any lights.  We closed all the blinds.  I went back outside with my camera and took 4 pictures, because I thought people would not believe me.   I went back outside around 3am and they were still in the sky.  I went to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not think about them any more until Thursday night February 16, 2012 around 7pm, we were leaving a restaurant and my granddaughter told me to look up and there was the big bright light.  I said not again!  As were on our way to bible study the white light was following us.  Then came the smaller light beside it.  Then we could see more lights begin to follow us down the expressway.  When we got off at the exit we say the red and green lights but only one of those this time.  We proceeded to our destination and got out of the van and counted 9 white lights that followed our every driving move.  Bible study was over at 8:30pm.  We came out and counted the white lights again it was 12.  We proceeded home and we could see more and more joining the other lights.  When we arrived home we counted 20 of the objects with white lights that had followed us home.  I called another of my friends and was counting them.  Then people from the other apartment building came outside to! smoke and the lights lifted straight up in the air and just appeared like stars.  I told my friend what had happened.  They were no longer visible, just faintly.  But I could still see the one with the big bright light.  When the neighbors went inside, the white lights descended again.  They are not spread out like planes would need room, but these are close together.  And the one with the big bright light appears to be the leader, because it always appear solo and first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday night February 17, 2012 when it got dark outside I looked out the window and called to my granddaughter to come and look.  The white lights were back over the apartment again.  She said I’m going outside to see.  She came back in and said there are more than before.  I put my shoes on and went outside and looked up there were more than before.  I did not bother to count them.  I walked up the street to the mail box and they followed me to the mailbox and back down the street.  My daughter in law came over to pick up my granddaughter and I told her what was happening. I told her to watch as the lights followed me up the street and back down.  She just stood there with her mouth open.  She had no explanation.  She was wondering if it were good or bad.  I don’t know but I wish these lights or whatever would STOP following, watching or whatever they are doing. As me and my daughter in law were looking up a normal plane flew over and we could hear and make out that it was ! a plane. We saw the body and wings on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called another of my friends and she suggested that I call and report it.  So that is what I decided to do.  This is an eerie feeling because I don’t know why me of all people in the world why me?  If you have any information you can help me know what or who is following me PLEASE let me know.  I was calling them planes at first but planes can’t stop on a dime and go that slow and stay in the air and just hover for long periods of time.  I need some logical explanation of what is happening and why I am being followed by all of these light things.  This is very serious and I am concerned for me and my granddaughter’s safety. Thank you<n>

They were very bright lights that could have been mistaken for planets.  I had a hard time focusing on them.  They seemed to have a trail coming off the bottom at the 7 o&#39;clock position.  I was not able to distinguish enough of it so I went and woke my 10 yr. old son.  He looked and said they were planets.  I said&#34; do you see tails?&#34;   He said they were just planets again.  I disregarded til the puppy had to go again at 11:05.  I looked for the lights and they were not there.  Seemed really strange to me.

PD))|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87178.html|206|ndxe201202| 4 year old son sees and draws flying saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 4 year old son seen a ufo near the small town of Metlakatla, Alaska.  I was outside with my son reading the news on my phone and watching him and his friends playing tag in a playground right outside of our house.  My son runs by me and I see him in the corner of my eye he comes to a dead stop.  I don&#39;t think nothing of it and continue reading the news on my phone.  My son says a couple seconds later  How did that happen?  I look over at my son and hes looking up in the sky with a confused look on his face.  Glancing up where hes looking at i see nothing and ask him How did WHAT happen?  He was kind of a loss for words and eventually says, &#34;It was there then it dissapeared.&#34; He says this 2 times trying to explain the best a four year old could. after the second time saying this his eyes got a little bigger and he says with excitement &#34;I seen a spaceship.&#34;  I was caught off guard and now I was at a loss for words.  I say, &#34;What?!  What do you mean?&#34;  Then with more conf! idence and having a better idea of what my son was talking about he points up in the sky and says a spaceship was there then disapeared. I then ask him, &#34;You seen a spaceship?&#34;  He says with excitement, &#34;Yes!&#34;  It was right there!  I immediately start walking my son to my house which is across the street from the playground and tell him with a big smile and trying to make him agree to come with me and say, &#34;I want you to draw me what you seen. OK?&#34; halfway to my house  I stop my son and tell him to close his eyes and imagine the spaceship after 2 seconds or so I ask him if he sees it.  He responded, &#34; Yes.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then pick him up and rush him in the house  As I&#39;m looking for a pen and paper I explain to my wife what my son is claiming he seen.  She was looking at me like I was crazy!  When I finish explaining to my wife what just took place I lay a pen and paper in front of my son and tell him to draw what he seen. He draws a flying saucer!! I draw with my son almost everyday we have never  dre! w a flying saucer  or anything of the sort. The closest thing ! we have ever drawn to a flying object is a small float plane which we see everyday. As his father I can confidently say that his reaction was a REAL reaction. His look on his face was a REAL surprised and confused look on his face. His story when he was trying to explain it to me was a REAL story that was coming from what he really did see. I have the drawing hanging up on my fridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of the report, and he seemed to us to be both quite sincere and credible.

We both observed two orange lights moving across the sky from approximately West to East, keeping a perfect distance from each other.  As these entered a cloud bank three more of these lights came over the horizon.  Then a group of five came over the horizon in the exact shape and size of the big dipper.  These lights just kept coming and I did manage to take a video on my camera though the quality is not great.  The last object we say was hovering in the sky, un-moving for about ten seconds. In all honesty, at times we were not sure if some of the lights were separate or part of one large object...<n>

It was clear, very cold cloudless night and being in rural area with no street lights there is excellent view of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Standing on my front walk and looking approx. due west (275&#39; confirmed through google earth) at patch of sky through a wide gap through stand of trees there was one star that stood out on top left of gap and was very bright but clearly a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sooner had I looked at that star that I then noticed a flashing white light that was moving to the upper right of the gap and disappearing behind tree limbs and out of sight.  I assumed it was a small plane but no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#39;plane&#39; then immediately moved into the upper middle of the gap (moved down and to left in diagonal)and showed to be 4 white lights in a somewhat single, level row that were flashing across from right to left.  It was then that I thought to myself that I had never seen a plane move that way or have that kind of light display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sooner had I thought that to myself, the object then quickly moved up and to the left to the top left side of the gap, lights still flashing in same manner. It then moved to the right horizontally, lights still flashing.  The object then moved to right and up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Knowing that this was something very unusual, I ran into house to grab camera and ran back outside. On the way through I told my wife to come outside and take a look at these strange lights.  Took approx. 12 secs or so to get back outside but by this time the object was gone or at very least had shut off lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate that this object was within 5 miles of my viewing location (not Fairdealing... that is approx location of object from my location) but I never saw object, only it&#39;s lights which were bright white and flashing and no noise.  I see and hear small planes, helicopters, commercial and military in sky here all the time.  This object I have no good explanation for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a college degree in the sciences and consider myself level-headed and observant. This event happened just as I have described.<n>

The craft came from the South East and were heading North West.  Another craft came about 30 seconds later.  There were 4 that moved past our house spaced very evenly apart, and about 30 seconds from each other.  Then there was a pause and  two more came into view and then went past us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to get the binoculars and during that time one and possibly two more passed over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each looked exactly the same.  A bright orange and yellow light that flashed on and off.

I figured it was Venus, which I&#39;ve heard is very bright in the winter.  I could not see any other stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, while it was on my left, I noticed a new light over the tree line directly ahead of me to the north.  It was green, and very bright.  There were red lights along the tree line which I knew were tops of cell phone or radio towers.  This green light was well above the red lights - much higher than the red ones.  I thought it was strange, so kept my eye on it until it suddenly disappeared.  There was no visible direction that it went.  It was like it was just turned off, which leads me to believe that it moved off very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t see it again.  I confirmed that the star I believed to be Venus was still to my left (west) to be sure I wasn&#39;t just seeing it.  Minutes later, I saw a plane fly in the general area I had seen the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t able to draw my wife&#39;s attention to the light before it disappeared because I didn&#39;t think it was worth pointing out to her until it was too late.<n>

It was not lit up.  It was traveling across the sky from the North East direction to the South West direction.  I was able to keep my eye on it as it flew through the sky and faded into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the object was flying I compared it to other planes that were lit up in the sky.  The planes were much higher and had blinking lights. This object had none of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was very cool, crisp and clear.  The stars were very visible as well as several planets.  The area I was walking the dog is dimly lit with yellow ornamental street lights.  I was approximately 100 ft. from the lights in a darker area so my night time vision was very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object  appeared to be slate gray in color.  There was only 1 object.  I imagine I was the only one that saw it, although there was a steady stream of cars passing on the nearby road. (100 ft.).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be shaped like a scalene triangle.

Looking up at sky while driving to see if I could observe any stars to determine if I thought it would start to flurry before I arrived home (Catskill). Road is not highly populated w/homes &amp; street lights are few and far between so it was quite dark.  I was the only car on the road.  As I looked up, 2 triangle shaped objects went right over top of my car in a northern direction (I went back next day w/compass to check this out). I was shocked at how low they were - barely higher than the trees lining the road - and that I hadn&#39;t heard their engines.  Put my window down a bit to see if I heard anything but it was completely silent - as if they were gliding. They weren&#39;t going super fast - again, just kind of gliding thru the air. One was behind the other so close they were nearly touching. I hardly think any type of planes would be flying so dangerously low or that incredibl! y close to each other. There was a light on the front tip but I cannot remember color.  On the tips (wings?) yellow lights for sure. I believe a light on the back as well but am not positive about this. Went back next day in daylight to see what was beyond the trees to my left (the direction they were headed) &amp; if it looked like a place where 2 planes could have been gliding in for landing. It was a field but I couldn&#39;t imagine these large objects could or even would land there in total darkness.  I&#39;m so mad at myself for not grabbing my iphone &amp; taking a picture. But it all happened so unexpectedly the only thing running thru my head was a bunch of confusing questions and the inability to look away - I was awestruck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

2/10/12 18:00|Haines|AK|Diamond|30 minutes and longer|A bright multi-color flashing object soared across night sky, until it made an abrupt stop, only to roam around in any direction|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87161.html|226|ndxe201202| A bright multi-color flashing object soared across night sky, until it made an abrupt stop, only to roam around in any direction<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, my friends and me were just driving around. We all stopped and got out of the car to marvel at the stars. We were naming the various constellations that we could identify when we noticed this obviously flashing, rather than twinkling star, cruising across the night sky at a notable pace. I thought nothing of it just as my friends did. But as my curiosity faded, the flashing object (which was flashing blue-red-blue-white-blue-red-blue-white) had stopped suddenly right above the horizon.  I noted that this “thing” was no longer a satellite.  It was just stationary for maybe 2-3 minutes, until it started to bounce around in a bumblebee-like manner, almost if it were pacing in an infinity symbol or figure 8. It continued to just roam around the sky freely. Back and forth up and down side to side. This “satellite” then came to an abrupt stop. It just dropped very slowly and consistently downward and then to another stationary position. My friends were still sol! d on the idea of it being a satellite because, “Dude, satellites are advanced now the have propulsion. They can do whatever they want.” I argued the point of earth’s infinite orbit and how something in it could not have the capabilities to just stop. After that we were done marveling. I got in the car with a confidant feeling of “ I just saw a UFO!”<n>

The sky was still blue while the horizon was turning orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking at the moon with the two children, we saw two orange lights appear just below it.  We watched the two lights move slowly in unison across the sky.  It did not leave a contrail.  We watched it until it was too far away to see.<n>

I often sit in my sunroom to watch the birds feed at our feeders; however, strangely there were no birds.  My neighbor in the back of my home has a very large yard with some trees.  Between his shed and a very tall pine, I saw a multitude of lights, at first thinking it was a helicopter.  When the lights dimmed, a small battleship gray triangle, resembling a stealth bomber, floated slowly about 30-40 feet in the air.  The white lights that I had originally thought was a helicopter were off, and only 2 red lights were lit on each side of the craft.  It proceeded very slowly above one of my trees and I heard a very faint droning sound.  Since I could no longer see it, I went to my front porch to see if it had come out on the front of my house.  There were no signs of it anywhere.  It was still daylight, though darkness was starting to fall.  I have only told my family about this, since I fear the repercussions would be humiliat! ing.<n>

I believe that we are not alone and I read a lot about UFO`s and all my intrests..<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I looked up in the sky.  It was really clear no clouds it was just horrible cold we have right now -14 degrees in my country (ask me to get information) I saw a really fast triangle flying from East-West..at this moment i just wonder me what can fly so fast..there was no way that it was an Jet or any other Army-Jet because it make no sound no noise!  It had also 3 lights one on the top one (red) on the front (dark, i never saw a light like this it was reflected trought the moon) one on the heck (behind) (white).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights flashed very fast on out on out every 1/3 seconds it was not very hight so I saw it really good not more than 4-6km  I can t say it 100% but 4-6km no more no less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It were so long as a Boeing 747 or a bit shorter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is absolut impossible that it was an light reflection or a satelite or a chemical process or something other I had clear view,I do not take Alcohol before or after or other drugs!  And i repeat it were a clear view this morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were nobody at this moment at the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i saw it I was confused can t move me a feet hold my dog on the line hard so that he also stands still and i just looked up.  As it disappeared in the West i looked 10 min after this in the sky nothing passed, but i saw a normal plane and it does make a lot of sound, at this moment i just wanted back at Home.  I had a strange feeling don t feeling me anymore good and I smoked two cigarettEs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I even do not know how i got back home.  It take normally 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the 2 cigaretts i searched a place to report it, but I don t found anything can&#39;t call in th USA because it don t worked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After searching and searching I found this site made an e-mail nobody respond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I post it here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think today nobody interest that people view UFO s its a shame and a blame for the human.  I know a lot about the UFO s and other Thema`s but to report it,thats really (a word i don t write).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I had also the feeling,that this flshing of lights was not meant, &#34;Hello we are Aliens do you all can see us?&#34;  I think it was an scout UFO and Im 100% sure no other theory were explainable even I m not an Expert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone has a question I&#39;m open for everything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Expect critic - I know what I saw - Don t forget it - I was confused yes and paralyes some way but I can (re) paint the UFO excatly 100% as I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was no optical error, no reflection, no satelite, no fallen comet, no chemical process, no  Plane or whatever   So read this before do any critic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  For various reasons, we are unconvinced that this is a serious-minded report.

I woke up several times that night and it was Friday morning about 3:15 a.m. when I looked at my clock.  I turned over to get comfortable again and settled in when I heard a very faint noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it might be my own breathing so I held my breath then heard it again.  As I listened it appeared to get louder which is when I realized it was getting closer.  The noise was always whisper quiet and almost sounded like heat going into a hot air balloon but not as harsh.  It was consistent but not rhythmic and not fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my head and could not see any light around the edge of the window curtains and heard no noise from the wind chime on my front porch.  At the loudest point (which was not very loud) the house groaned as the air pressure seemed to change like something was passing overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then noise began to get softer again as it seemed to move away until I cou! ldn’t hear it any more.  When I looked at the clock again it was about 3:45 a.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Lakewood, Washington, which is close to JBLM.  Could it have been a military craft or something else?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m hesitant to say it was a UFO because I didn’t see anything, but I’ve never heard or experienced anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have you heard of any similar experiences?<n>

We saw 8 rounded shape lights in the sky that were scintillating between a fire-orange and white colour. They were all regrouped together above in the sky at the left of the port entrance of Puerto Vallarta _ a bit higher then the 3 ~10 floor buildings just at the entrance of the port at Puerto Vallarta. They all came as one group and then spread apart at the horizon in the sky, but stayed within a kind of close formation. They were all 8 the same shape (round ball of fire) and same color changing from a dark orange to white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started by one of those 8 lights that all the sudden flew closer toward our direction, and slowly drop down (within a fraction of a second and absolutely no noise at all) what seemed to me to be like maybe a few 100 feet in the sky... then another object all the sudden kind of detached from this first object and slowly went down to the water vertically, directly below that first objet, but very, very slowly dropping down into the ocean. At the time that it detached itself from the first object I noticed some kind of sparks or flares coming from the point where both separated from themselves. It was now two big round objects and it looked like metal in fusion sparkling over, which lasted only a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the new object was dropping into the water (in about 3-4 sec) and again totally without any noise, the first ball went smaller like it was going away from us and up at the same time, then it disappeared totally. Two other rounded objects then did the same thing, but this time there was no flares or sparks as they released each another their own object, They also seemed to stay at the same level and position, while each one were releasing a new object, which were dropping too into the water directly underneath them.  Once the last of the 3 round balls went into the water, they all vanished in the sky. It was like within a fraction of a second they all became very tiny dots then vanished completely...<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it would have been only flares, I would have seen lights or glares coming from down below and up, but there were no lights below at all. By the time 3 of those objects drop each 3 other objects, about 4 of them were spread apart to what I would say, half of the bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They were in an up and down row but the 3rd one started to move in front of the other 2 just as i lost sight. I would say they were roughly about 50 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was 3 of them moving up in the sky independently of each other.  I was able to track their slow, upward movement for about one minute until my view was obstructed. They were traveling upwards way too slow for them to be any kind of objects that were thrown up in the air.  I instantly got goose-bumps all over my body due to the fact that i could not explain what i was seeing.  They were translucent amber-tan colored spheres and the inner part of the sphere was less translucent than the outer edges.<n>
2/9/12 22:00|Hartville|OH|Triangle|2 - 3 minutes|Large triangular craft (size of com. jet), flat black, bright white lights on points, hovered/rotated 180 degrees & moved away slowly.|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87142.html|235|ndxe201202| Large triangular craft (size of com. jet), flat black, bright white lights on points, hovered/rotated 180 degrees &amp; moved away slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter, a new driver, and I saw an object while driving north on route 43, just outside of Hartville, Ohio.  It was just after 10:00 PM, on Thursday, February 9th, when we were just coming out of town, and I first saw three bright white lights which were pointing down, and a single flashing red light.  From a distance of about a half mile, it looked like a hovering and rotating helicopter, which was at about 300 feet off the ground.  I asked my daughter if she was seeing the lights and she was seeing them too.  I asked her what she thought it was and at first it seemed to look like a helicopter, as I said before, but neither of us could really distinguish what we were seeing.  As we got closer, we realized it was not a helicopter, because it was way too large.  It was as big as a commercial jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it rotated, I thought it might be a very low commercial jet liner, and the bright lights were the lights you see on jets during low visibility, but there were no clouds at all.  The moon was very bright, since the night before was the full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer, we realized it definitely was not a commercial jet either.  Yes, it was as large as one, but at last, we could see it clearly.  It was a large (isosceles) triangular craft, muted or flat black, with the bright white lights on each point, and the fact that it rotated flat, while hovering in the same place, quickly ruled out a commercial jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first saw it, it seemed to be pointing east and slowly it rotated 180 degrees and as we got nearly underneath it, the lights turned and pointed outward and it began moving, silently to the west.  It was huge, and there were lights underneath, alternating red and white in a row from the tip or front, to the center of the rear, and these lights pulsed in a line from front to back.  It began moving slowly, but seemed to gain speed as it moved, but I never saw it accelerate fast. As I said it seemed to gain speed, or momentum, as it moved towards the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we entered the first turn (left) in an S turn on route 43, north, and as my daughter continued driving, I watched the triangular craft move towards the west and as we entered the right turn, I lost sight of it because of the trees and the fact that it was moving west as we were moving north. The whole event took about two to three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered out loud, with my daughter, whether we just saw a new type of blimp, since we were a few miles south east of the Wingfoot Lake Airship Operations Hanger for Goodyear.  I truly wondered if that could be what we saw, and I did not want to freak her out, either, if what we saw was not from here.  It was truly a UFO, and it was just too weird, no noise and we did not see any windows either.  We saw the color, the shape, the size, the unusual flight characteristics and movement, but if we did not see the lights, we probably would not have seen it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our backgrounds are as follows:  I am a college educated IT professional, an entrepreneur, a coach, as well as a city board member and my daughter is a high school sophomore, honors student and a two sport varsity athlete, preparing for a post secondary program and a possible major in the medical field.<n>
2/9/12 21:30|Troy|MI|Light|5 min|Orange tinted orbs observed over Troy, MI (along with star-like light to the east) ((NUFORC Note:  Possible "Chinese" lanterns?  PD))|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87324.html|236|ndxe201202| Orange tinted orbs observed over Troy, MI (along with star-like light to the east)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 9:30 p.m. (+/-)  Noticed two orange tinted orbs. In the distance, to the east, I saw one orb approaching as if it were 1/2 mile away. It proceeded west across the sky from the east, with the path crossing approximately at Square Lake Road. (It would have crossed Rochester Road as well.)  The second orange tinted orb followed the same path about 5 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Height was approximately at 4 or 5 stories high.  (I viewed them from 2nd story.)  Reason I saw the orbs: I was watching the eastern sky due to a brilliant full moon, and very bright skies; spectacular night. However, it was curious:  There were a star-like object in the east, about 3 to 4 inches above tree-line to the east; I cannot determine how far away, perhaps a mile or two?   (There is no way to determine.)  The object does not seem to have been a plane because it hovered for 3+ hours; I was checking it every half hour.  It would move up and down, and over about 3 inches every so often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two orbs came from the same direction of the star-like object to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe the objects were Chinese lanterns, which was my first thought.  (I saw what I guess were Chinese Lanterns in this same area during early fall of 2011; a few neighbors saw them, too.  I observed about 4 or 5 orbs that night; they all following a similar path, and seemed to be moving at wind speed; they passed by about every 10 or 15 minutes.  The neighbors saw 21 of them over a few hours, so we all thought perhaps they were for a birthday celebration--with Chinese Lanterns.)   They did look like they could be floating paper bags of some sort, higher than tree level, but not as high as airplane level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At any rate, I explain the Fall 2011 suspected Chinese Lantern event for comparison purposes:  The orange-like tinted light orbs of 2/9/2012 did not look the same as the lanterns; they moved faster, were detected much farther away, and had a more intense light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was this evening that I googled orange orbs over Troy and discovered this website. Today, I read that others saw the orbs, so I have decided to report the event.  (I was trying to dismiss the event somewhat these past few weeks; but the star-like light low in the east was quite intriguing.)<n>

This object had to white flashing lights and a red light.  They moved very quickly and were too high to be landing at the airport but also to close together to be two planes flying in a identical pattern.  This went directly over my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I video taped with our Iphone but you can only see for a brief second both lights and their close proximity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then called my brother who lives in OCR, AL and told him to go look outside and sure enough he saw it come over the mountain and it appeared to be hea! ding in a South/West direction.  He to agreed this was not two planes flying that close together.<n>

It seemed to be flashing a few different colors of light. live on M-50 in Monroe, close to Ida, MI.  I went outside to have a cigarette and I noticed a weird light above the fields across the road from my house, in the direction of Ida.  It looked like it was hovering and moving around slightly.  It seemed to be flashing a few different colors of light. The main color was white but it was also flashing red and blue or green.  I couldn&#39;t tell if those colors were part of the white light or if they were separate lights.  The lights seemed to move around the white.  I attempted to take photos but my camera was acting wonky.  It kept changing the settings, and I kept trying to take pictures, but no matter what I did, it wasn&#39;t showing up on the pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside, and then went back about 15 minutes later and I didn&#39;t see the light in the sky anymore, but I saw something lower on the fields.  Being very intrigued, I decided to get in the car and head out to Ida and see if there was anything.  On my way down M-50, I saw a very bright light, then it disappeared.  Then I saw a light take off from where Dunbar road is.  I don&#39;t know if that was the same light I saw above M-50, or if it was separate. Kept driving until I got to Ida, and didn&#39;t see anything, so I turned back.  Then, on my way down Ida-Maybee road, I looked at the fields, and suddenly saw what I think was a landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped the car and pulled over to look for a minute.  Yeah it&#39;s probably a dumb idea but I really wanted to see! I saw 3 big square white lights right ON the field flashing one after another.  They looked like they were attached to some kind of object, but since it was dark, I couldn&#39;t tell the shape of it.  I watched it for maybe a minute until I heard some weird sound that I can&#39;t even describe coming through the radio in my car.  It was definitely not a human.  It was like a really weird voice saying something in another language.  This scared the crap out of me me, so I got the out of there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must admit I have seen similar a similar light before, above those fields, multiple times.

I had glanced at the moon for just a second and I saw a very big, bright, and fast moving object in the eastern sky dart very quickly from South to North (right to left) at a 60 degree angle directly from the moon; it could&#39;nt have been far a way as it wall low flying and I could see it well.  It was shaped like the fuselage of an airplane with two bright orange glowing balls that were at the center but spaced together to make the shape of a cigar with a pointy nose.  It went so fast and was a soft dull glow, and then just disapeared in a matter of seconds.  It happended so fast but made such an impact on me that I will never forget it.  I thought, how could this be a met! ior when there were two seperate balls together forming a shape moving at an angle so fast that it reminded me of a jet airplane flying low at an air show.  Didn&#39;t look like one though it was very strange and the lights in the middle seemed to cast an outer ring around it that was a whitish green (I think this was a reflection off the fog)it literally gave me chills and would love some kind of explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Feb. 8, 2012, I was sitting in my backyard looking into the western horizon above Marana, Az.  I saw an orange light appear that appeared to be floating into the sky.  Immediately after the first light caught my eye, I noticed another appear.  Then it was two or three at a time lighting up until there were 20 of them.  They moved across the sky in a smooth manner fading in and out intermittently in a random pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in the house to get my camera and when I returned the number of lights were down to about 10.  They were in a formation that appears to be stable with a light at rear that seemed to float a mile or so behind the others.  The lights were far in the distance but they seemed to span maybe a mile or so from the light at one end of the group to the cluster of them on the other end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I originally saw them, I was describing them to my sister (on the phone) as looking like floating Chinese luminaria lanterns.  I was able to video the lights for a bit more than a minute, during which the light eventually faded out one by one until they were suddenly just gone.  Never going up into the sky, or down towards the ground.  They just vanished in mid flight. I have no explanations for what I saw. It was not plane(s), helicopters, or the like.  The entire time that I watched them was approximately 10 minutes.<n>

2/8/12 19:15|Madison|WI|Triangle|5 minutes|Two air crafts both with huge red circular lights.|2/10/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87106.html|252|ndxe201202| Two air crafts both with huge red circular lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking home from work on the evening of February 8, 2012.  About a block away from my apartment I looked towards the sky straight above.  I also looked to the right and noticed that the stars were extra vivid and crisp on this night.  I looked farther ahead of me and saw two abnormal bright-like stars. I assumed that they were planets but I have never seen two so close together.  Then, again, I look to the right of me and up above I notice a very huge circular red light.  Also accompanying the red light were smaller white-amber-ish lights on each side of the bigger red light.  The sequence of the blinking lights were unfamiliar to me and extremely close to the ground; hovering, in movement. I do not exactly remember how long each blink measured but knew immediately they were unfamiliar.  At this point I was in shock.  I was less than a block away from my home and instead of going straight home I followed in the direction of the red light.  It seemed as ! though the entire craft was a red sphere as it drew away. I turned a left on the street before my block and realized that not only did these lights look foreign but also they were headed in the wrong direction.  Had they been lights from an airplane, the craft should have been traveling more East towards the airport.  Instead the craft was traveling SE. It definitely could not have been an airplane because it was too low to the ground and I heard no sound from where I stood. Through my vision the craft could have been traveling at a speed of maybe 40 MPH…?  I did not get a good look at the shape of this particular craft because as I followed it, it traveled further away flying over tall houses and apartment buildings which blinded my sight. The duration of the craft siting was about a minute long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I walked towards my apartment. It took less than two minutes to get to my front porch. I immediately sat down and just stared into the night sky. Not one minute had passed when I saw another red light coming towards my direction from the NW. It traveled over Lake Mendota toward my apartment building. I cleared my eyes completely amazed. This craft also had a sequence of odd blinking lights not like the sequence of lights you see on planes or helicopters. The lights also had short awkward pauses and then would resume to the blinking pattern. These lights were also very close to the ground. As the craft got closer I could kind of make out a shape. It was quite dark but my best educated guess would be that the craft had a shape of a triangle prism. The craft also looked like it had a disk-like base and the lights were blinking on the front of the base. As the craft traveled over the apartment building next to mine, I noticed that the underside of the base of the cra! ft looked like half of a sphere. I could not make out any color of the craft due to the time of the evening. Interesting to say, the craft traveled SE just like the first had. I was much closer to this craft than the first but I would assume the speed of travel was 50 MPH.<n>

There was clouds moving through but this was bright enough to shine through the clouds.  It was very unusal and something I&#39;d never seen befor.

It wasd over marco island, a bunch of small fireballs!! I have NEVER seen anything like it in my life!! We shouted for our other neighbors to come out too. We all just stood there!  Then they just kind of fizzled out.  They were pretty much stationary and were not blinking, just there for a minute or so!

I noticed something with three red lights on it all connected in a row... all on one craft. it was stationary so I thought it was an antenna tower... until it began slowly moving in our direction. as it was heading our way we noticed a very small green light above the three red lights. the green light was lit constantly while the red lights were blinking in a random pattern. as the craft got about a few blocks away I could start to see a grayish sillohette of something but it stopped just outside the range for.my eyes to make it out. it was stopped for a good minute. it didn&#39;t hover at all just stopped in mid air. the two red lights on the outside of the three began blinking one then the other back and forth. as it was stopped ! i heard the sound of an exhaust or something like that. but when it moved again it didn&#39;t seem to turn around but took the same flight path back and the red lights were back to all three blinking in random patterns. but the green light was now orangeish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft was leaving another person kept pointing out about 7 more with the same light setup all in the sane small area but farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on about ten minutes later I seen higher out about the size of a fruit fly up close but it seemed far away almost just outside the planet maybe ... but there were two crafts with two red lights and a white light between the red ones and above those three were a triangular pattern of 3 white lights. the red lights stayed solid but the white lights all were like a strobe light. everytime they flashed the crafts seemed to be a little off their flight pattern as if they were zit zagging upwards. then the two began going from left to right and were moving very fast at the distance I seen them. from one end to the other I. about ten seconds. the two crafts when going upward were all over each other. but when traveling they never broke their equal distance from one another  they also made the sky glow a little around them.<n>

But as we moved further south the thing quickly appear to both of us as a small hang glider or experimental aircraft.  My wife thought she saw the operator underneath but that was when the UFO made a deliberate left bank and from about 30-50 feet up in the sky, crossed over the top of the North bound freeway lanes to the Southbound lanes and came right towards us (and everyone behind us in heavy traffic).  It was then we both got an incredible close-up view of this thing as follows: only about 4 feet in length, and about two feet across, dark dull gray in color with kind of like a tear drop shape, the rear being much smaller than the front.  There was something hanging just under the body, like a camera mount but no markings on the craft.  I was stunned at the proximity to us and failed to turn on my camera phone function.  It was traveling about 50 mph…I say this because the speed limit was 70 in that area and it was coming from the North bound side of freeway but wasn’t quite a! s fast as the traffic.  Since my wife was driving, I turned in my seat and watched it fly right over a semi-tractor and make controlled right and then left banking, then into a completely straight path.  At that point my wife said, “ what the hell was that? “ I told her I think it’s some kind of new surveillance machine the state patrol was using, because I’d read that there are new technologies emerging for military and police applications, that this might be one of them.  I called my son in Nevada and asked him to look these things up on the computer.  He said there were some discussions abut a year ago that the Oregon department of agriculture was thinking about using drones.  Later that night, I got on the Internet myself and looked it up, only to find a ridiculous looking octopus shaped device with eight little helicopter blades which would be Oregon&#39;s drone.  What a laugh!  What we saw was actually sleek, quick and beautiful in a weird sort of way.  There was no visible means! of propulsion at all and as I said, no markings.  Please, I would love to have someone reading this correct me and tell me that what we saw can be easily explained.<n>

At first I thought nothing of it, dismissing it as a bright star, but I noticed as I moved on the porch, where tree limbs in the distance covered it up, it would suddenly not be so hidden by the trees.  I purposely moved several times to where the tree limbs covered the light, only to see it a second later.  This went on for about two minutes until the object stopped hovering and began moving toward the city of Birmingham.  It moved slightly faster than I’ve seen planes fly, but not so fast as you often hear of UFOs ‘speeding out of sight’.  I waited for the light to emerge through trees that were blocking my view, and when I finally saw it again about a minute later, I noticed a few red lights moving in a circular direction, like circling the earth.  These red lights were not visible when the sphere was hovering.  I lost sight of it after that.  I am not a UFO skeptic, but I have never witnessed a UFO, nor sought really to ever see one.  I see planes all the time in my area, the airport isn’t very far, but I’ve never noticed a light just hovering, and I was really surprised and even somewhat spooked that it seemed to emerge when I was purposely trying to ‘not see it’ by attempting to obstruct it from my vision with the tree limbs.  I’m not sure if it was even a UFO, it just seemed like a very strange occurrence to me and I’ve never seen an aircraft do that before.<n>

I was looking over towards the training city of Abu Layla and saw this group of bright orange lights.  Looked to be about 14 or more lights in a triangle form.  The lights were just hovering above the road out there. After 10 minutes of watching this the lights headed east towards the I15 freeway and you could see the glow of this object silhouette the mountains.  When it took off it had to be going faster then 600mph becuase it only took about 5 seconds for it to disappear (figuring the speed by the time and distance).  When it took off it went from a stand still position.  This is my 3rd time seeing it here in the same spot.  I work in this area every day, and there is nothing but Desert out there.

Opened the door my body facing and looking directly south because I saw an orange spherical object brightly lit from the center spinning horizontally in the clear night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where I stood, I saw three more objects @ a further distance from me directly to my east was the Seattle space needle in the clear night sky.  The other three lit spheres were hanging there in the skyline two to the north of the needle one to the south all positioned without movement in a offset triangle.  The spherical orb coming from southeast traveling west to meet the other three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this night the moon was very full and close.  The moon  directly to my east still and about level with my ear and very large, basketball size.  The orange sphere which flew over me was at least the size of a baseball, to my sight and perception it seemed to be flying low.  Straight, horizontal and @ a moderate speed spanning the city in a minute or so to reach its destination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were aircraft, planes in the distance, tiny specks in comparison also helicopters dropped in on the far three aggressively and with there bright lights just before the orbs of light disappeared.  The sphere which I saw most closely seemed to be revolving as it passed.  There was an energy similar to fire coming from the very center and shining so brightly that it lit the otherwise planet looking object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not seem to move like anything made by man. it was silent.  It was beautiful.  It seemed to be made of a rock matter like the moon looks, only a bright energy beamed from the center, a nucleus which propelled it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted my best friend by phone and she was in south lake union.  I alerted her to it and she and another got out of the car looked up in time to catch the same experience as my self.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a thirty five year old, esthetician and business owner born and raised in this city.  I have never seen or experienced anything I can relate to as similar to this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness on several occasions, and she seemed to us to be quite eloquent and credible.

At first I thought it might be 5 hikers spread out in a long line on the ridge south of Adams Canyon.  But the lights were too bright to have been flashlights at the apparent distance, so I wondered if they could be 5 camp fires.  Then I noticed the lights were moving slowly.  When the top one went above the top of the mountains, I realized they were flying.  The group was moving west or slightly south west.  It was dark, the sun having set around 6:30 or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were an orange red color.  I figured it must be 5 people in ultra lights or helicopters.  But the lights were not blinking; they were steady.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near the top, east end, of Oak Hills Drive.  When I got home, I stood outside to watch them.  I called my wife out to see them.    There was no sound coming from them.  They stayed somewhat together as a group for a while, but started to drift apart.  Each one either moved at a moderate speed, or appeared to hover for a while.  Several individuals went towards the west, and then circled to the north and back east into view.  Then 2 headed out of view towards the south, south west.  Then 2 more moved out of view in that same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The remaining one came back from the west, and appeared to be coming east towards me, but it gradually grew dimmer and dimmer until it disappeared overhead.  It appeared to have moved up in altitude until no longer visible.<n>

It looked liked it rotated and glowed brighter for a second when I first noticed it.  The sphere then started moving North (left) towards and directly in the middle between the two stars Mabsuthat and Maculosa.  Half the distance from the Moon and the two stars it turned into a dim point of light moved a little more left (North) and then disappeared before reaching the two stars.  There seemed to be a round patch of sky that I couldn’t see through that it disappeared into.<n>

There was also a full moon at the time.  At first my husband and I paid very little attention, and then we both noticed that it was not moving, but staying perfectly in one place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled in our driveway and continued to watch it.  It moved straight down at one point, and then returned to its original hover position.  The light stayed pretty constant for most of the sighting, then it began to dim and come back brightly again.  As we ran to the house for the telescope, my son yelled to me that in the blink of an eye is was entirely GONE!!  Very strange.  I never saw anything behave that way before.<n>

They would be on top of other lights, blink again then been off to the right, blink again and return in triangle form and so on until they were out of sight. My younger daughter was with me and of course she really wasnt interested but she did see them.  We continued to watch for 5 minutes or so, I went to get my husband to show and when we returned they were gone, imagine that.<n>

I was standing in my driveway with a friend when we noticed what at first appeared to be a star, but began streaking across the sky headed in northern and slightly eastern direction.  My friend thought perhpas it was a satellite.  But as the object moved directly overhead, it appeared to grow in size (perhaps descending?) and the light became much more intense and brighter.   The object then continued moving northeast and faded in intensity, but moved in a non-linear path, curving from a norhteast path to a northwest path, until it faded from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a bright single light in the western sky not far outside our subdivision.  The light first appeared to not move like a satellite.  It was obvious the light was not a star.  I started to notice it moved in the direction I was walking.  I would walk down the hill and it moved with me as I’d come back around the loop toward the top of the hill it would be at that point and then move with me again down the hill.  Then (really freaky) when I walked up our driveway it came toward the house like it was getting a closer look at where I lived.<n>

UFO !I looked up and there were two huge lights ahead and 2 smaller lights beside them over about three telephone poles off the ground(that high) the way the lights shined you could see a circular shape. I rushed for my cells phone and quick hit my camera button, I could get a good picture so I hoped out of the car, as soon as I got into focus it drifted up into the clouds, I know for a fact this was not an airplane, no way an airplane would be that close and you would hear a huge airplane beside you.<n>
2/6/12 16:50|Dennis/Yarmouth/Barnstable|MA|Chevron|10 minutes|Unusual thing in the sky, could have been a cloud but I'm not so sure about that.|2/10/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87081.html|282|ndxe201202| Unusual thing in the sky, could have been a cloud but I&#39;m not so sure about that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ll start out by saying that my son and I were taking a late afternoon walk on a Dennis beach along Cape Cod Bay, on the north side of the mid-Cape area.  As we were appreciating colors of the western sky, we saw nothing unusual, and no clouds of any kind—the sky was crystal clear.  We left the beach before the sun set and soon I was on the highway heading west toward the setting sun.  As soon as I got on the highway, I noticed an unusual thing in the sky.  This was around 4:50 p.m., maybe 4:55.  It could have been a cloud, but 10 minutes before there was nothing of the sort in the sky when we were on the beach.  It was located to the left of the setting sun and a bit higher in the sky but low enough so that the trees along the side of the highway prevented me from seeing it most of the time.  But I got a good look at it on several occasions.  It was the only thing in the sky except for the sun.  It was shaped like a “V” but the arms were puffy and the “V” ! was not upright but tilted over so that the hinge of the arms was on the left side of the thing.  The puffiness of it made me wonder if it was a cloud, but there was something unusual about it.  It was about a quarter of an inch at arms length.  The color was unusual in my opinion because it was intensely white, not opaque.  I was thinking that it should be reflecting some of the golden/orange sunlight, but there was no hint of any other color other than the intense white.  This is subjective, but it seemed to be so white that I thought it was glowing of its own accord.  I lost track of it for several minutes while on the highway due to the trees and trying to drive safely.  I got off the highway and headed south toward Hyannis, trying to catch a glimpse of it but I couldn’t see it for 2 or 3 minutes.  Still heading south, I saw it again as I came to a place where the trees were thin along the right side of the road and it opened up into the flat expanse of the airport fiel! d.  This was maybe 7 minutes after I first caught sight of it.! It sti ll was “V” shaped but now the hinge was on the bottom (like a V) and the arms seemed closer together and thing seemed to have turned so that the right arm was behind the left, closing up the empty space between the arms.  The sun had set and the sky was glowing, but the “cloud” still seemed white but dimmer, not as intensely white as it had been a couple of minutes previously.  Clouds morph and this could very well have been something like that, but it was unusual, appearing rather suddenly and so intensely white.  I lost track of it as it was obscured by the buildings and trees of Hyannis.  When I was on the highway and had a good look at it, I did not get the sense that it was close by, so I think that it would have been visible over a large area.  It was to the south west, on a line with Nantucket Sound, then Martha’s Vineyard, and then the open ocean to the south of Block Island.  I don&#39;t think I can offer any more than this.  I am an avid sky watcher, and I can say that! this was unusual enough for me to provide this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light appeared to be very fast moving and also appeared to be dropping down in altitude.  I assumed it was an aircraft headed for Buffalo-Niagara Intl Airport.  However, I then realized that it was moving too fast and in a more easterly direction and could not be headed for the airport.  It appeared to be headed for the ground in the near vacinity. It passed directly in front of me as I was passing the Home Depot which is off to the right side when eastbound on the Thruway.

She immediately observed a large triangular craft hovering what she thought was east of Emmett, Idaho (at the time she lived approximately five miles west of Emmett).  She observed the craft for about 30 minutes as it simply hovered.  It gave no rotor noise or other prop or jet sound, but she heard (and had the sensation of feeling) what she described as a &#34;humming sound&#34;--as though considerable energy was coming off the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She observed three white lights near each tip of the triangle and a red light in the center.   She also observed small orbs leave the bottom of the craft and fly away.  She had the presence of mind to video the craft with her cell phone, and while the video is not of the highest quality, one can certainly see she captured a strange craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter is in her mid-thirties, the mother of two children, a housewife and a primary school teacher.  She finally went back to bed; however, she told me of the event the very next day and provided me with a copy of the video.  I am a retired ((rank deleted--senior official)) (Army National Guard).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately contacted a particular deputy sheriff that I know and showed him the video.  He indicated that this type of craft comes often to the Emmett Valley, as he has seen it several times while on duty during the &#34;grave yard&#34; shift.  On one occasion the deputy said he called the Boise Air Traffic Control Tower to ask if they had a craft hovering over the Black Canyon Dam, east of Emmett, to which the person on the phone replied in the affirmative.  The deputy asked the person if he could tell him what kind of craft it was. The deputy was told that the Tower would get back to him.  As the deputy indicated, he&#39;s still waiting for the phone call.<n>
2/6/12 01:30|Maineville|OH|Triangle|4 minutes|Strange Craft seen in middle of night, silent, that hovered a moment then flew away at incredible speed|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88512.html|290|ndxe201202| Strange Craft seen in middle of night, silent, that hovered a moment then flew away at incredible speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1:30 AM, I sat on my front porch like I do several times a night for a few years, to smoke a cigarette.  I think I live on a flight path, because just about any time you wish, you can go out and look in the east sky and see planes.  Most travel west, but sometimes there are planes that go east on a similar path, but possibly a mile or so south west of the east to west path.  On this particular night, I had been out for maybe a min or two, I spotted a flying craft and it immediately caught my eye.  I was shocked because of how low to the ground it was flying, MUCH MUCH lower than all planes I had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came from the North West and traveled more quickly than any other plane I had seen.  The closer I got, it seemed to move slower, but still faster than my mind expected to see a plane flying. I noticed that it had lights in a triangle figure (one in front, and two in rear).  When it came closer, I could see the lights were not on wings, and the one in front was not looking ahead, they were all three facing down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept waiting to hear this craft but it had approached with no sound, and then seemed to slow way down to what I would consider a “hovering forward motion”.  It passed over top of me, and seemed to be slightly higher than the tree line, and maybe twice as high as the homes it was passing over.  The craft looked black, but it was dark outside so if it wasn’t black, it was a dark shade close to black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed level the whole time, and while over me, the lights gave it a triangle appearance.  I could not see any hard edges or sides to the object, but judging by the length of dull, non shiny material between lights, I would guess it was about 40 ft long. And about 30 ft from left rear to the right rear light.   I watched it as long as I could, and it didn’t seem to speed up, but it was gaining altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 30 seconds of passing me, it was gone!  It sped up so fast that it was almost instantly out of sight.  I have nothing to compare the speed to what so ever.  I have never been so baffled before and honestly was too embarrassed to tell most people.  My one friend I did tell, said it sounds like what others have seen also, and instructed me to report it, even though it’s embarrassing.  I don’t want people to think I am a quack, but I know that whatever I saw was like nothing I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The fact that it disappeared behind the treeline, which was a good 1.5 2 miles away, and that it was still rather large told me it was very big.  The best way I can describe this thing was a glowing blue jellyfish with VERY short lash-like tentacles, or just a brighter glow underneath.  It wasn&#39;t bright flashing lights, it was a faint glow.  The closes thing I could find online, was a moon jellyfish, which of course isn&#39;t known to fly in the sky... and the view I had was from the side.  It had the swirling center just like the jellyfish, but I only saw two, instead of the clover pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No noises heard, but it was too far away to hear, even if it was.  I drove in that direction it went behind the treeline for another mile, and saw nothing.  After finding nothing online to explain what I saw, I told my mother the next day.  She said she had seen something also the day before.  On the 5th of February in the early morning as well, and she was a globe-like red object in the same area in the sky but a mile further way.  Then a few days later after our conversation, she saw it again, in another area of the sky, closer, and it just hovered for a little bit, then the dog distracted her for a second, so when she looked back up it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As the last one faded out, an object moved closer by through the sky, silently, and moved all the way across the sky.

Though I do not denounce the fact that there is more than a good chance for intelligent life outside our solar system.  However, I cannot say either way if this was not of this world or if it was some Government aircraft testing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below is my account of what I saw tonight:<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving home headed east bound towards Elmira, NY, I noticed a very bright light out on the horizon that seemed to be flickering at about 30 degrees away from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I didn’t think much of it, but as I was driving past Sayre, NY, I noticed it was still in the sky, only slightly brighter and unmoving.

It was moving pretty fast, traveled up the mountain side from bottom to top within 1 minute, and then flew into the air, moved to the east for about 30 seconds and then disappeared into thin air.  It moved like a helicopter, but had no flashing security lights.  It was just a golden/yellowish light and was too dim and the wrong color to be a spotlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So I called my mom outside to see it. Well upon further observation I realized that it was not a star because it was a lot lower than any of the other stars. In fact, it was in the air space as many planes flew by it and it, I live in Southwest Atlanta off of Sylvan Rd.  The object was moving at a slow pace and the thought of it being a plane was quickly dismissed because the light did not match the direction in which it was headed and there were no additional lights.  The object was in my view for a good 45 minutes to an hour before it was no longer visible.  I do have a video recording and picture that I will send as soon as I find out how to upload it from the camera to the computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Monday 2/6/12, I saw the same object again also during the eight o’clock hour.  I again called my mom to verify that she saw it and then called my aunt who lives a few blocks away, to look outside and see if it was visible to her.  She didn’t see it so I went to get her so she could have a look and give me her thoughts of what it could be.  She saw it and we presumed to follow it to try and get a closer look, but we were unable to keep visual contact due to the object moving and trees blocking the view.  We did spot it again hit and miss with a clear view when we got to Cascade Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason I am reporting it is because we could not come to a consensus of what it could be and thought maybe someone else will help us figure it out.<n>

It had a red light on one side and a white light on the other with a flashing red light.  Because of the flashing red light I thought it was a helicopter at first.  The shape and size (smaller then any helicopter I&#39;ve ever seen) is what drew my attention.  It took off faster and smother then a helicopter would.  I thought maybe it was a remote control hover craft because of it&#39;s size.  I wish I hadn&#39;t been driving so I could hear if it was making noise.  As low as it was you would think I could hear it even in the car if it was a helicopter.  The flashing light makes me think it was something man made, but it was small and triangular shaped.  It didn&#39;t look like anything I&#39;d ever seen before.<n>

We immediately pulled back into the driveway and got out of the car (which I left running).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued to ascend higher and higher into the atmosphere while a second object appeared slightly closer to the horizon compared to where the first object initially appeared.

Then what appeared to be a third object (or the return of the first) tailed the second object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the two objects lost their firey appearance. They could still be seen on their easternly trajectory but now as soft, white objects with no illumination.  They almost had the appearance of white party balloons but they moved like jellyfish. They appeared to be spinning, but not in a perfect circle, a very wobbly circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them until they passed us to the north and disappeared over the horizon to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We actually saw a very similar object moving the opposite direction (west from east) over our house just a weeks ago, but did not report it.  We live very close to Sky Harbor and are quite familiar with standard aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a musician and videographer, my girlfriend is a painter and graphic artist, and my sister is a recent graduate of U of A.<n>
2/4/12 22:43|Bangalore (India)||Fireball|8 minutes|Seven bright orange-red flashes emitting  aircrafts steadily moving across the Bangalore sky|2/10/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87013.html|313|ndxe201202| Seven bright orange-red flashes emitting  aircrafts steadily moving across the Bangalore sky  Me and my wife had just returned from the Big Bazar shopping mall, and were just opening our door-lock when we saw these two bright orange-red lights in the sky.My wife ignored them saying those were just lanterns in the sky and entered the room, I found the movement of the lights quite different from that of simple lanterns.Both the lights were moving at an uniform speed almost side by side(one slightly ahead of the other), but maintaining the angle throughout. The brightly lit objects were flickering and the colour was changing from orange to red in frequent random flickers.There was absolutely no sound from these crafts(can&#39;t be only &#39;flying lights&#39; for sure)I stay at Domlur, but these UFOs were coming from the Old Airport direction. They were at a distance of 200 meters above the ground.I stay at the 3rd floor, so they appeared even closer.I could say they were moving fast enough to cover the Domlur sky from the right to the left within 1 minute..I called up my wife and asked her to get the camera fast.I took the snaps,which were getting blurred or leaving streaks/trails as it happens when you shoot a moving light with a hand held camera, without a tripod.  So, I took a video as well with my canon automatic.Zoomed 16X to get a closer look, but the lights went far away..  Suddenly my wife pointed out,saying two more are coming.this time I took more videos.  Same uniform speed, coordinated acceleration, and the flickering of lights.  These were followed by another one, and then when I was giving up hope, again two of them appeared, and travelled across the sky.  The airport and the airforce bases are near, so these could be some experimental aircrafts also. But I have never seen an aircraft emitting flickering lights like these, moving across the sky, without making any sound!   So far I have heard a lot about these (since my childhood days, saw some of them on youtube, but this was the first time me and my wife saw such a fleet of UFOs across the Bangal! ore sky at Domlur.  I have the snaps and videos which I will upload on youtube soometime,first I need to have dinner,as I&#39;m quite hungry! Hope other people must have watched them as well, they were so bright, no one could miss them!Anyone wants the videos, or the pics may contact me.Wish I had a DSLR with Zoom lenses!<n>

About 3 min before reaching our exit we both noticed a relatively large white light (compared to all the stars that were visible in the sky at the moment) hovering over the sky.  My boyfriend had seen strange lights close Lagunitas, CA two times in the past 2 weeks.  However, this was my first time seeing anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What seemed to be the one large white light split into three lights, like a cluster, and hovered in a random motion.  Seconds later, the light began flashing blue, green, and then white again.  The lights proceeded to head west across the sky in a rather accelerated speed.  As they quickly moved west, they began to drop into the horizon.  No known aircraft would go this fast across the sky and its movements did not resemble any craft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time, we were nearing our exit in San Rafael.  Our eyes were glued to these lights in disbelief.  I then asked my boyfriend to hang a right (west) to follow the lights.  Unfortunately, we drove west in hopes that we would see them, but they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It all lasted 2 to 3 minutes.

It was not completely dark yet, but more on the dusk side so I walked over to the door and peeked out the window to take another look as it did not appear to be an airplane.  What I saw were these incredible bright, huge lights, bright and deep blue, and a bright almost pink red, the lights appeared almost bigger than the craft.  The craft seemed to be very large and a disc shape.  I would say it looked about half the size of the moon if I were to try and compare it to something.  I think what startled me were the huge beautiful lights, then I realize no planes ever fly in this path, nor helicopters, the object also sat still without moving and then it moved to the left and back very ! quickly.  I ran out the door onto our street and started to scream for my daughter to come outside (although she is young I wanted her to see this as well) as I turned the object was so bright barely moving and then it shot down toward earth, and when this thing came down it was if it were going thru a tunnel at the speed of light.  I have no idea what happened but it did not look like it was in the midst of a crash, and I have no idea if it even landed, all I know is it shot down toward earth and that was the last I saw of it.   It was absolutely unbelievable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where I was standing and where our house is located I can guess that this object was over the mountains and or close to if not over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was really the most unbelievable sight I have ever seen!!  I am not one to go around talking about aliens or ufo’s but I can say without a shadow of a doubt that what I witnessed tonight was not a plane, not a helicopter, and not a balloon.  The way this thing moved, how fast it moved, and the fact that it would move side to side and then sit still in the sky tells me it was without a doubt a ufo/unidentified flying object.  Not to mention the size of this thing and the colorful huge lights that were surrounding this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to know if anyone else out in Marin looked up in the sky tonight and witnessed something strange as I did?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Both purple in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (The following happened near sunset over a large farming area.  There was many large and puffy clouds in the sky. They were pink as the sun went down.)   While four wheeling in our field my son heard a loud humming noise.  Thinking it was his four - wheeler he stopped to see what was wrong.  That is when he looked directly up and saw this huge  cockpit coming down out from a cloud toward him.  Then the rest of the UFO also came out from behind the cloud.  The UFO was purple, the back of it was round and a long neck was attached to it with a cockpit on the end.  It had 3 white markings on its side.  My son said the UFO was enormous in size.  It was longer then our 10 acre field.  Almost at the same moment of spotting the UFO a smaller one came out of it.  The smaller of was the size of our Cape-Code house and shaped more like a plane.  This one went in a westerly direction.  Then the large one did a dip toward ground, brought itself up vertical and started spinning in a 360 degree motion and had a blue shield around it.  It made some kind of noise that got faster as the UFO spun faster.  Then with another noise  the UFO shot straight up i! nto the sky.  It was gone in a matter of two minutes.  While the UFO did this, my son’s four- wheeler started to idle roughly and almost stalled.  He also is trying to describe something with the clouds.  Some how the UFO was able to make clouds while using its engines and used to hide in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son is eleven. He was very scared and in tears. He hasn’t changed his story.  Every detail, from start to finish, he tells the same regardless how many times you ask him about it. He is a good kid, who would never make this up. He thought he was going to die right there in our backfields.<n>

I looked at it, and the lights were sporadic and bright, but I noticed it wasn&#39;t moving and remained stationary for quite a bit...maybe 10 minutes.  I had my fiancee come out and look, and my son noticed it as well.  To me, it looked to be triangle shaped, but my fiancee said that he thought it was changing shapes.  Not long after spotting this one, a long cigar shaped like craft was flying up and towards the south east.  It seemed pretty close to the earth, we could see it fully with our bare eyes, it made absolutely no sound and it flew out of sight range.  The first craft was still in the same spot. After about 10 minutes it slowly started going up further into the sky, but still flashing.  Then it picked up speed though still extremely slow it started flying east, until it wasn&#39;t able to be seen anymore.  I wonder how many others in the area may have seen i! t...<n>

It was one of 3 UFO&#39;s.  As my girlfriend and I sat outside tending to our garage sale waiting for people, I glanced into the sky.  A shiny object flickering in the clouds caught my eye and so I told her to look at it. We both looked at the object for about 5 minutes while it seemed to shimmer or flickering the sun light while staying perfectly still in one spot.  I told her to go get her Camera as my iphone wouldn’t be adequate to actually get any discernable video out of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one we took video of was Stationary for 20 minutes  in the sky around the same height or a little bit higher than the Chemtrails that were being sprayed at the time of filming.  Looking at it intently we made out two films before the fully charged camera stated running low on battery then the cam died, but we kept watching.  The Object then started drifting northwest very slowly becoming obscured by trees. I walked down the sidewalk heading east and found the object to be still visible from a couple houses away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started wrapping up our garage sale and I went around the neighbor hood in my car to go fetch the signs. When I arrived back, I went to go check if I could see if I could see the object again.  I had found it again this time further away than I had last seen it.  I walk back to our original viewing spot of the first on and now in the sky was a 2nd object that looked identical to the first appearing around where the first one had appeared.  I put up a piece of wood and aligned it with the power line as a reference point to see if the object was moving in any direction so I could determine its movement pattern to rule out if it was a balloon or something caught in the upper winds.  While looking at the 2nd object after a minute or two it started drifting southwest at a slow steady pace in a completely different direction from the original object.  As it started drifting I noticed a very faint 3rd object to the right of it that slowly dimmed out after 4 minutes.  Then the 2nd ob! ject that was traveling southwest slowed coming to a stop.  It was at this time while I was observing the 2nd Shiny Silent shimmering object being stationary once again, that a 4th object seemed to appear right where the 2nd object was.  This 4th object seemed a bit closer and started moving at a much faster rate.   I moved off fast in a more westerly direction through the clouds off into the distance.  The 2nd UFO stayed in it&#39;s respective spot indefinitely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since we had got the original footage and looked at all this action for about 45 minutes or more, we felt we had gotten our fill of these objects.  We cleaned up the rest of the garage sale stuff and went on about our day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m post a video of the first object.  The camera ran out of battery after taking 8 minutes of footage. This is around 2 minutes of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Funny thing about this day was, that we had gotten into a conversation with some one whom stopped by at the sale, about 2012 and the new age that is beginning.  Although I believe the action we saw was more related to the Super heavy tandem planes spraying the skies this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=3208984744436<n>

2/4/12 02:20|Marysville|WA|Light|1 minute|I was standing outside the front of my house having a cigarette. I looked to the east and saw a light which I first thought was a plane|2/10/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87007.html|332|ndxe201202| I was standing outside the front of my house having a cigarette.  I looked to the east and saw a light which I first thought was a plane but later thought could be a helicopter because it wasn&#39;t traveling in a specific direction very fast.  It soon became apparent that it was neither because it didn&#39;t have flashing lights like a plane or helicopter.  It sort of pulsed a red orange color.  I thought it was getting closer but I noticed soon after what I thought was a direction of flight was actually just the craft gaining altitude and it went higher and higher and then disappeared.  This object was in our atmosphere and it was close I would say within 10 miles when I first saw it and it went strait out and disappeared.  The strange thing was when I went outside after telling my girlfriend what I saw I saw another one and I called her out and we both witnessed another craft traveling in the exact path as the one before it.  I have been a skeptic my whole life but after what I witnessed tonight I am sure I saw something of an alien nature flying through the sky. It kind of just weaved back and forth as it flew.  It is probably the most amazing thing I have ever witnessed because I thought it was all untrue.  I know this was not a satellite you can track them passing over the earth in a direct line and altitude.  And what I thought was a aircraft traveling through our atmosphere was actually a craft gaining altitude at several thousand feet per second.  Hopefully it happens again I will get it on video.<n>

I was out fishing in my boat and it was approximately 1:30 am .The temperature was around 38 degrees with a clear sky. I like going out on cool nights because I have such a great view of the sky and often see quite a few meteors every time I go out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fishing, something caught my attention out of the corner of my eye. Coming in from the NW part of the sky was a seemingly very unusual meteor traveling in a SE direction. It was seemingly very, very big, was traveling in what i thought was an unusual trajectory and was moving extremely slow for a meteor. If I held my arm out at full length, my thumb would have just covered it up. I didn&#39;t at the time, but it seemed as though I could have counted to 5 easily as I watched it and it was coming in at maybe around a 15-20 degree angle. It looked like a perfectly round shaped ball that was a very bright white color, but instead of fading out as the myriad of meteors have that I have ever seen, this seemed to get brighter as it got closer. I would guess now it just seemed brighter because it was getting closer ? I would imagine it was much further off than it seemed, but when it was seemingly over the town of Estill Springs, it looked like it exploded into a thousand bright pieces,! but the pieces did not fade away or dim, they were just there, then they weren&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly thought I had just watched a nuclear missile coming in on an EMP burst. I waited for all of the lights to go out but nothing happened. I sat there for a good 5 minutes wondering if I had maybe just watched a plane crash etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now looking at the, about 5 minutes after the first one, a 2nd one started coming in on what seemed like the same trajectory and path. Again it moved very slow, was the same size and repeated exactly what the 1st one did - seemingly over the town of Estill Springs exploding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Okay I thought, the first emp blast failed and this was the 2nd attempt. Again the lights stayed on and i had all kinds of things going on in my head trying to figure out what i was witnessing. It just seemed so strange for a meteor, unlike anything I had ever witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20 minutes with everything seeming normal, I went back to fishing. About 10 minutes later, keeping an eye on the sky, I saw a third bright round &#34;ball&#34; coming in from the same part of the sky only this one seemed much higher up. Again moving &#34;slowly&#34; like the others, it traveled in a south easterly direction only this one went much further south. If I had not seen the first 2 I probably would not have been able to understand the &#34;explosion&#34; as it was much further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came home the next morning and told everyone I knew that I had seen the strangest &#34;meteors&#34; in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe a month ago, reading Coast to Coast news, I saw an article about a &#34;flaming fireball&#34; over Georgia on I believe February 14th I believe. Apparently a woman saw something very similar to what I had seen over a small town in Georgia. The scientists said what she had seen was a very unusual meteor that came from the meteor belt and described it as a &#34;rare&#34; event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made me wonder if that was what I had seen because the time could have been right and the 3rd &#34;ball of light&#34; seemed to me like it would have been in that general direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So it was probably the &#34;flaming meteor&#34;, only it was described as rare and I saw 3 of them in about a 40 minute time span, 2 of them seeming to take the exact same path with the 3rd traveling further south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the army on tanks and have seen my share of missiles and rockets (peace time warrior, a section sgt in a calvary platoon) and i would have to say whatever it was, it was the coolest thing i have ever seen. Just seemed to travel soooooo slow for a meteor plus if anything, instead of dimming it got brighter as it came in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It appeared to fall within ¼ mile from my house.  When I went outside and looked to the south eastern sky I noticed a bright reddish/orange light moving horizontally across the sky.  I watched and noticed that the object was also moving up, down, sideways and directions that would have been impossible for even a helicopter to move.  It would change directions at right angles very quickly.  I called my son and father in law to watch and we all agreed that whatever we were seeing could not be a conventional aircraft of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object stayed around for about twenty minutes then just vanished from the sky?<n>
2/3/12 21:00|Boskruin (Johannesburg)( South Africa)||Disk|3min|Disc shaped craft fly directly overhead|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87893.html|337|ndxe201202| Disc shaped craft fly directly overhead<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9 pm CAT I observed a flash of light in the sky in a SE direction looking towards the horizon. I had observed a few interesting lights which I interpreted as aircraft during the evening and twice saw satellites pass directly overhead in low earth orbit.  I&#39;m mentioning this as I know the difference between aircraft, satellites and astronomical bodies in the sky.  The light that caught my attention was like a flare of plasma or when a gas (like methane) ignites.  It was bright and reddish white colour to it. What was interesting is that this plasma looked to have flames only at the edges.  At this stage the object was very high and my first reaction was that it was a meteorite entering the atmosphere. I realised pretty fast that this was not the case as I heard no tell tale sonic booms or streaking tail of an object burning up on entry.  Instead the object &#34;drifted&#34; like a leaf down and to my left, paused in this position briefly ( causing another &#34;flare&#34;) then ! drifted down further to the right, paused again (another &#34;flare&#34;) and drifted down and to the left again.  Whilst falling in this manner the object became more visible as a disc and glowing like hot metal out of a furnace.  The glow from this heat  like effect was making the object stand out nicely against the dark night sky.  It had descended about 25km in altitude to roughly a kilometre above the ground.  At this stage it stopped the falling motion and moved in an arc towards the west where I was standing observing it (arc went towards the north ending with the object moving westwards right towards my position).  It continued to move towards me until it passed directly overhead. At this stage it was about 800m above my head and had a diameter of 80 to 100 meters.  This plasma flare with fire at the edges would occasionally occur (mainly when the object changed direction or hight). It remained looking like hot metal the entire time I observed it not changing colour at all.  Having observed military and civilian helicopters fly over during t! he course of the evening I KNEW that this object is NOT a helicopter. It made NO HELICOPTER RELATED SOUNDS. It was NOT A FIXED WING LIGHT OR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. IT MADE NO AUDIBLE PROPELLER OR JET ENGINE SOUNDS. Furthermore it HAD NO NAVIGATION LIGHTS ( RED,GREEN,WHITE LIGHTS THAT ALL AIRCRAFT ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO HAVE ON AT NIGHT). It took about 3 minutes for entire sighting from beginning to end and ended with the object moving westwards at LOW altitude IN COMPLETE SILENCE WAS NOT OF ANY TECHNOLOGY I KNOW OF. IT WAS TOO BIG TO BE A TERRESTRIAL AIRCRAFT. IT DISPLAYED NO CHARACTERISTICS OR DESIGN FEATURES OF ANY KNOWN MAN MADE CRAFT. IT WAS COMPLETELY SILENT AND ENTERED SA AIRSPACE FROM A LOW EARTH ORBIT HEIGHT TO ABOUT 800M ABOVE MY HEAD WITH RELATIVE EASE. The object was witnessed by myself and 2 friends that both work for the government at local and national advisor levels. Both of them failed to understand what we had just seen, what was even more upsetting is the fact that ! hey both refuse to talk about the event AT ALL and have remained silent to the present. I know what I saw, i can draw this object and show its flight path accurately if needed. It was a disc-like craft, 80 to 100 meters in diameter and passed 800m above my head in ABSOLUTE silence emitting no light except for the glow of &#34;heat of the metal exterior&#34; marking its presence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will testify to these facts IN ANY COURT.<n>

They noticed a bright light to the west, and thought it to be an incomming aircraft.  The light remained steady in brightness, but changed from Red to Green, and at that point, they realized the object was actually moving away from them.  The object seemed to continue floating to the west. They continued to observe it for aprox. 10 to 15 minutes.  My father in law called me and I observed the object far on the horizon for about 2 minutes before it disappeared.  It did not appear to be an airplane or satellite.  It travelled quite far to the western horizon before it softly flared out.<n>

It had the strangest metalic color and crazy looking round lights at each corner, kinda weird blue color.  the strangest thing was that it didn&#39;t make a sound as it hovered over! well friday night I noticed the same kinda of object catch my eye again so I stood on my back deck and just watched for about 20 minutes with camera in hand cause I knew this was it! but it was so far away and it kept moving left and right and down real slow and to far for a camera. then its light went out and a hugh ball like a shooting star slowing fell to the ground glowing real bright, it scared the hell out of me!!!!  it was to fast for a camera and to slow for to be a shooting star?? when I tried to report the craft on a gentlemans website, it was shut down about a week later?? I feel that I can be a reliable witness, I wo! rk for a school system in the area and am a 10 year disabled army veteran and a god fearing man! so please believe me and what I have seen!<n>

She suddenly exclaimed, &#34;Oh My GOD, What is that?&#34;   I tried to look and saw nothing.  She described lights that were red and seeming attached by a &#39;string&#39; wobbly around each other in the tree line nearby. When I looked they were gone.  We began to walk closer and at that moment I saw two lights (white or yellow in color) zoom into view from behind the trees.  They instantly stopped about 25 feet or so outside of the tree line and then sped back in the opposite direction chasing each other.  They were around 10 feet apart and maintained the distance.  We never saw them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked into the sky for answers and we saw a strange star.... we were told it was Sirius, but the coincidence made us worry.  I have never seen anything like what we saw originally.  It was about 20 feet off of the ground and moved in perfect precision to it&#39;s partner.  Soon afterwards we saw plane trails high in the sky.

PBIA is also visible and we would see the planes coming in and out, after 3 years we would notice if flight patterns would change etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of February 3rd 2012, I was in the kitchen (which looks directly out towards the big patio window) when I saw a HUGE orange orb fireball object heading south. There was no sound, in fact, you can see on my video how loud the music and everything was but planes regularly would drown out all the downtown noise. Given how many people were in the bars and on the street I couldnt believe I was the only one to see it. By the time I was able to get my phone to record, I had been observing the object for about a minute. The fireball/ orb got first was growing in size as it approached us then got smaller as it headed south, at one point I tried to rationalize it by thinking it was a natural occurrence but the sky was clear and there werent any storms or electricity in the air. In the video you can see it start to ascend and then almost disappear. It never fully went away, i was tracking it the whole time but seemed to change and blend in with the night sky. I even ques! tioned the object at one point bc it looked like a far off shuttle launch (being from so fla we can occasionally see a night launch) it eventually gained speed and began to glow brighter again. after where my video cuts off  the object continued to head up and ascend till it was parallel and blended in with the stars, at which point it hovered and changed color to match the stars (a sort of blueish color) After another 5 min of observing it in the same position i headed back in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video captured was with my iphone that was almost dead and completely full of data at the time. so when i went to stop the video my phone was off and after I rebooted it, the video was not stored. I was pretty upset that it didnt work but about 2 days later, the video showed up in my queue (but at only a fraction of the recording was actually saved)<n>

The night sky was dark and clear as the moon had set already.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise anywhere at five-thirty in the morning; dead quiet.  It made it&#39;s way within a minute to the Shastina cone of Mt. Shasta, faded to a dim spot, and seemed to drift down into the mountain; jaw dropping.  I don&#39;t see things like this... ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To be honest I see satellites but this was just too bright and golden colored-- and too big.

At first I thought it was a Cessna airplane because it was moving at about that speed and altitude (I&#39;m used to seeing Cessna&#39;s fly around 2500 ft in our area), but the red light didn&#39;t blink so I watched it for a few seconds while it continued straight.  I didn&#39;t hear any engines, it was actually kind of eerily quiet.  As I tried to focus my eyes to try to tell what it was, I could tell that it was a shiny metallic object with the red light emanating out an angle from the center and up around the sides.  I couldn&#39;t see the exact shape of the craft but it was oblong, so it could have been cigar shaped or a dic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was almost as if it knew I was watching it because it started making small zigzags,,, then it stopped dead still.   After a few seconds it move a short distance 90 degrees left and stopped again.  It then appeared to move away  (up) probably about 500ft then stopped.  From this position it would dart left to right as if it was letting me know what it was every few seconds.  A couple times it made zigzag and cork screw maneuvers within a small location returning to that spot.  Its speed during this entire time was fairly constant.  From my point of view I would guess that it held position and did the maneuvers  within  a 500 ft area around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 minutes I decided to get my camera from the house but when I came back out it was gone.<n>

It is shiny black, appears smooth, has no vapor trail, seemed to be ‘gliding’ but in a very steady &amp; solid way. We are looking at them and then they disappear. They do not fly away, they simply disappear. They seemed to be following along behind and below the airplane. So that’s it.  One guy we told said maybe it was a military craft that they ‘clocked’ with mirrors. I have seen other things back home at night, watched one fly quickly to the left and stop, then quickly to the right and stop then same to below then stopped, then did it all again.  The lights on it made it look like a triangle shaped craft. This was back in 2002 over Olney, OK.  Watched and decided there was not a thing to be done about it because we were sure it was on radar somewhere. I admit we kind of got bored it lasted so long.  That one had 7 witnesses, 3 being adults.  One friend with an autistic child said that I was the only non-family member they would ever leave their child with.  I am educated and curious and would not be suprised to finally find that these are from other worlds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  We are not certain what the correct date of the sighting is, in January, or February.  The author of the report indicates both months.  PD))<n>

At first I thought it was a star.  I looked away for a moment and when I looked back it had moved higher in the sky towards me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon it got bigger and there was a triangular shape with four or five white lights on each side.  They all blinked off twice and back on.  The three sides were bowed outwards.  It went over my house so I ran to the front of my house but it never reappeared.  As it got lighter I noticed it was cloudy.<n>

I was looking West, towards the lake.  I do this every time I am in the parking lot because I have seen strange objects over it before.  What I first thought was an airplane caught my attention, but it seemed to be a little lower than what I normally see planes fly over the lake.  As my gaze lingered, I noticed it the blinking light pattern was strange and that the craft was faintly glowing green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The blinking lights went from left to right in quick succession, flashing red, white, red with a slight pause when nothing was flashing and only the faint green glow, which was shaped in a slight arc, was visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was heading North for at least 20-30 seconds, but it lowered a bit in the sky and switched directions so it was moving north east.  When it changed directions another light was added to the pattern.  It went white, red, white, red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it switched directions again and headed straight north for maybe 10 seconds and completely and instantly disappeared.  There were no clouds in that part of the sky and no boundaries that could hide it from me.  It didn&#39;t &#39;quickly&#39; disappear or &#39;fade&#39;, it was there one second and completely gone the next.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The first time it was between the horizon of two trees at first I thought it was a plane since it flashed the same colors but didn&#39;t move at all like a plane and moved in a small zig zag and circular movement I watched for about 2hours and went to bed.  The secound time I saw it it was about a foot to the right and doing the same thing exact same horizon line and same movements and same rapid blinking.  This time I am watching it as I type it is to the left this time and slowly moving more then it did before.  Ok so I just noticed very faintly there are about 4 more and u can&#39;t see them if you look directly at them they are blinking bright red.... I am very scared and very concerned about this as I am very very very afraid of the unknown…<n>

It was about 9:30 pm and I was looking out toward the ocean from the balcony of the 10th floor ocean front room at the Hilton.  The sky was clear and the stars shined brightly.  2 ships were on the horizon and not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seemingly out of nowhere, a straight line of 5 evenly spaced amber colored lights appeared in the sky directly in front of me.  They were in the sky; well above the ocean&#39;s horizon, and half way between me and the 2 ships on the horizon.  My immediate thought was that a very large bomber type air plane was heading right for us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called for my wife to come quickly to watch.  More lights appeared (as many as 8 total) and then the straight line started to move in a perfectly sycronized worm or wave frequency pattern.  After 2 full waves the lights simply faded out.

The fireball was much bigger than any star but smaller than the moon.  The tail was almost as bright – and just as green – as the fireball.  There was no trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Length of time:  I witnessed it for five or ten seconds.  Long enough to realize it wasn’t a flare or fireworks because it never dissipated.  Eventually, it went beyond the horizon (tall trees about a block away).  I did not see it decrease in brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Trajectory:  I was facing north.  The fireball was heading northeast.  It seemed to be moving downward at a small angle, from my perspective about 25 degrees.  It appeared to be moving away from me, so it’s hard to tell if it was actually falling towards the earth.  Basically, I saw it move across the northern sky until it disappeared beyond the treetops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location:  I was at an outdoor seating area of a food trailer park on the 2200 block of East Cesar Chavez Street in Austin, TX.  About a mile and a half east of downtown and about four miles northwest of the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute after I witnessed this, a low-flying helicopter zoomed overhead, from the direction of the airport, going in the exact direction I witnessed the fireball.  This might be a coincidence because I was relatively close to the airport.  I’m confident of the time because I was on the phone when I saw it, and the time given above is from the call history.  There were about eight other people eating in this area, (along with some kitchen workers in the various food trailers) and two performing musicians.  Nobody else saw the fireball as they were all watching the musicians or working.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable meteor, we suspect.  Video suggests a meteor to us.  PD))<n>

At first, I thougth they were stars but, I stargaze every nite and knew they couldn&#39;t be,not in that area.  This lasted 10-20 seconds then they slowly faded out, like the way the ISS does.  The only thing I thought it could be was a supply ship close to the ISS before landing but, I checked the sighting opportunities and there wasn&#39;t one at that time.  I should of stopped.  Don&#39;t know if they were moving or not.<n>

He had a headache, so he was leaned back in the passenger’s seat with his eyes closed.  I happened to look up and saw what appeared to be a moving star.  At first, I thought it was a satellite or something, so I didn’t think much about it, except that it looked rather large.  But, as I kept looking at it, I noticed that it started to spark orange, as if it were on fire. It looked like an airplane had caught on fire and was crashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hit my boyfriend on the shoulder to get his attention and told him to look, pointing at the object.  He wasn’t all that focused because of his headache, so he didn’t look and just leaned back into the seat again.  I kept my eyes focused on the object the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it started going back up into the sky, and I saw not only orange lights now, but green as well.  I hit my boyfriend again, and told him to look, but by the time he did look, a line of trees had covered the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came home and explained it to my mom and dad, but they said they had no idea what it was.<n>

The stars move in the sky,  They can create sounds, and very elegent displays.  And thats it its hard to see them until it is night time and I cant be sure for a fact if what I am seeing is a sighting but it should definitely be looked into.<n>

But then we saw what looked like a white ball gradually cruising along at the same altitude west towards new mexico.  My husband ran and got our camera and managed to zoom in on this object… This first object was pretty low and upon zooming in on it we realized it was a ball of light with what looked two matalic objects on it.. one on top and bottom almost apearing disk shaped.... Then after a while it seemed to disappear and re-appear in the sky as it got further away.....shortly after that we came back outside and noticed four more of the very same objects flying around each other in zig zag patterns....it was very unatural to me and Ive never seen anything like these things...  These four seemed to be much higher and father away. we capture and focused on as many as we could w! ith our camera at that moment but they were very hard to focus on.....when those seemed to disappear in the sky a few friends stopped by and as we were showing them what we caught on camera....another apppeared in the sky going the same direction as the first.....we caught video of that one too.... The air traffic was very busy that day but this was nothing I have ever seen before.... There were no clouds in the sky except the cem trails from the passing just we get from fort bliss. These odd objects in the sky did not make any sound and seem to fly in a most unual pattern...my close ups reveal that this is not a plane of any sorts.<n>
2/1/12 14:30|Smackover|AR|Sphere|5 minutes|Glowing spheres in thunder storms.|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90148.html|384|ndxe201202| Glowing spheres in thunder storms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wanted to share with you what I witnessed today February 1, 2012 . I work construction and I am currently on a job in the small town of Smackover  Arkansas. We have built a tower for a large vessel which is about 125&#39; tall. I am the safety manager for the site and we had a computer radar showing a fast approaching thunder storm, as part of my job I had to make sure that crane booms where secure and workers on the tower were aware of the severe weather that was coming.  I also had to climb to the top of the tower to make sure all materials were secured from the wind.  Knowing I would have to go to the top of the tower and that the terrain in south Arkansas is very flat I took my binoculars (12 x 25) so I could watch the storm moving in. As I was looking to the west at the storm I noticed what appeared to be a reddish but almost pink in color, round object about 1-1/2 to 2 miles away but only about 500&#39; above the ground.  My first thought was, what would ! a plane be doing flying in a severe thunder storm, but the orb was not blinking it was steady and unchanging and I new it could not be a plane.  It was moving at the same speed and direction with the storm.  After watching it for just a matter of seconds I saw another one of the same size shape and color about 500&#39;  directly above the first one.  I tried to looking for them without my binoculars and could not see them, I did this several times. I was able to track them for about two minutes but only with the aid of the binoculars. I had a good steady rest so I could focus in pretty good.  The light was not a shining type but just a bright glow with what looked like a dark spot in the center of the round orb.  I eventually lost track of them when I had to come down due to the rain and lightning.  The size I can only guess to be no more the 3 to 5 feet in diameter at that distance since I could not see them with just eye sight alone. They stayed exactly one above the other the whol! e time as if they were under control, because I could see wind! sheer i n the storm clouds. I guess what puzzles me the most is the color and glow, I have never seen anything like it. I listen to Coast to Coast all the time and I figure if anyone has knowledge or might have heard of these types of orbs you would. Thanks in advance.<n>

Around 4:00 p.m. a black cylinder appeared on my passenger side of vehicle. The weather was sunny but cold out.The black cylinder flew across all 4 lanes of highway. This cylinder was all black.  The cylinder was about 1/2 mile in sky to my estimate.  The object was close enough to me that I could tell it was metal looking,not even close to a blimp. It did not have wings, motor,windows, landing gear,or writing on it. I&#39;m driving trying to observe all details on it.I look to see if other drivers are seeing this.  I was by myself could&#39;nt get a picture with cell phone.The lenght seem to be 70 feet or more my estimate. The cylinder disappears over the horizon and a jet appears. Flying same direction and height as black cylinder the jet seemed to be chasing it. The black cylinder flew a straight path and not super sonic speed.This caught me off guard I knew I had to observe as much detail as I could.  This took place on 2/1/12.On I-80 ! eastbound a little ways back before Penfield, Pa exit. I wish I would have got a picture of this thing.  Can&#39;t even figure out how it was flying or what it was. This caught all drivers off guard.  Didn&#39;t notice any body pulling off side of road to take picture.I estimate this took about total of 3 minutes during the appearance of black cylinder. The black cylinder was flying from my right side towards my left side accross highway.<n>

At first I saw the fighter jet, flying very low, so as detail could be seen on the vehicle, and almost immediately after, saw a disk shaped object pacing behind it, in the jets right flanked position. The jet was flying from west to east approximately. I remember clearly that the jet had a heavy jet stream flowing behind it but this disk object had no jet stream.  The speed of the disk matched the speed of the jet exactly as if linked by a cord.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From what must have been several miles away, I saw a metallic object (reflecting off of the sun) plummeting towards the earth, leaving a smoke trail.  From my vantage point, it looked like it could have descended somewhere in the vicinity of Vashon Island, or out in the ocean.  The object appeared to be large and descended straight down vertically.<n>

There was no cloud cover out.<n>

I thought it could be maybe a B2 bomber coming out from Nellis AFB.  At the same time I had just placed an order for an early meal at a Taco Bell waiting at the drive thru facing north.  I asked the counter person if they could see the object in the sky to confirm my viewing of the object in the sky.  The counter person also confirmed seeing the strange object in flight.  Asking me what was it?   What I saw was an unusual tan color and shape flying object that almost changed into a rectangular form as it flew away into the eastern direction.  Living very close by I drove home went to get my camera and the object was out of view when I returned outside.  It was about a 4-6 minutes in total view.<n>
2/1/12 07:30|Ocala|FL|Light|1-2 minutes|This is a repeat report from Feb.2,just a few things Id like to add.The objects I seen looked like 2 little moons very close to each ot|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90593.html|390|ndxe201202| This is a repeat report from Feb.2,just a few things Id like to add.  The objects I seen looked like 2 little moons very close to each other (bigger than planets, but a little less than half the size of the moon,same color of the moon, no craters or marks.also there where no trails or blinking lites, no frills.Now the road I was driving on is in an 8 house gated community with 1 road and a cul-de-sac,and I was on my way to the other side of this road when I spotted them and automatically knew this wasnt normal(THERE IS NOTHING THAT BIG AND THAT CLOSE TOGETHER)  I know my night sky.  Why I didnt stop I am still kicking myself today,but I did roll down the window and stared as I creeped up to my neighbors driveway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS soon as I arrived they started fading out, I might have stopped at this point and watched,they didnt get smaller and it seemed they were covered by earths shadow. That same day at Silver Springs(which is the direction I saw them,NE of Ocala,someone esle ha! d strange things happen to them.All these areas are close to the Ocala Nat.Forest.But what really prompted me to redifine my report was the Gainesville couple on june 17?  How can you disbelieve that.My daughter is a gator living off campass there.If this couple is working at UF and they risked writing a report like that ,my hats off to them.I know what I saw,  They did too.I&#39;m a believer that something is definitely close out there.  Can anyone answer me, I would love to talk to the other 3.   I need to know Im not the only one seeing them. P.S. no color changes or flames,all white on a clear night.  P.S.2   When I looked at a reference star from where I first saw them and then again at the last place, I can say they were moving slowly.<n>

I KNOW WHAT I SAW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking my Canine at 0445 Hrs. In the town of Brattleboro, VT.  I look to the sky frequently as the lack of ambient light allows seeing falling stars very often.  As I looked into the sky A VERY BRIGHT WHILE LIGHT MOVED ACROSS THE SKY AT A FAST BUT STEADY SPEED.  IT WAS WHITE, NO OTHER COLORS, NO FLASHING AND JUST VERY BRIGHT WHITE.  I observed it for a period of 20 seconds and then, as it moved Northwest to Southeast the sky above had cloud cover and precluded me from observing it any further.  I have been looking at the night sky for 50 years . . . No one; No one is going to tell me that I saw anything other than what I believe I saw.  It was not the belly of a chrome jumbo jet flying so incredibly high that the sun in Australia was lighting it up from 3/4&#39;s of the way around the world.  It was NOT a weather balloon with a 98 million candle power light bulb.  Save all the hokie pokie stuff.  I know what I saw and that&#39;s final.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness amends time; concludes that the object was the ISS, which passed overhead a few minutes after the time indicated above.

They were just red bright looked like a ball of lava.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We opened the windows and did not see any fire or damage.  There wasn&#39;t even a sound made when the fireballs landed or appeared to land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was hoping someone else outside of us on the street saw it I even yelled to get attention but the streets were vacant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were bright red and the funny part is my friend has saw these fireballs land two times prior and I joked about it, until I witnessed it myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been trying to make sense of it for two years.  After a lot of research, I know what I witness was something of demonic/alien.

It was very loud and sounded like it was very close to my house.  At first I assumed there must have been an accident or something going on at the Bolingbrook Hospital nearby but then saw a very bright vertical light beyond the trees that looked like it had possibly 6 points or at least the light was illuminating in that way.  It was a yellowish-orange color and way bigger and brighter than any stars.  I woke up my boyfriend who was next to me who thought it was strange as well.  At first I thought it was maybe a really bright searchlight but then the light started to move upward in the sky like a rocket would.  I would say it did this for about 10 seconds or so.  Then the light suddenly went out and I could make out a triangular looking aircraft with red and white blinking lights that started to head in the direction of my house.  It moved faster than a plane and I just felt that it was not something normal. I looked up news stories to see if anything could explain what I saw but found nothing.  The whole experience has left me a little shaken as I have never seen anything like it in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides no contact information.
