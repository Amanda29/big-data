It was a large round saucer with revolving lights in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe this is too old to report. However in November 1962 at about 10pm as I got off a bus with quite a few people I noticed something in the sky but no one else bothered to look up. I had to walk through a small park, still looking at this object in the sky. I was on my own at this time and there was no one around. As I came to a small bridge that I had to cross the object in the sky seemed to be getting closer. As I got to the end of the bridge the object had come overhead me. I could not move. I just looked up. It was a very large circular craft with coloured lights in the middle revolving round. The thing I will never forget is the noise it was making like a humming noise. It stayed there for about 5 minutes and then suddenly lifted up and took off at such high speed into the air going in the opposite direction to the airport so it couldn’t have been an aircraft. I was hysterical when I got home and couldn’t sleep for about 3 days. I have never told anyone except my family<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/15/62 21:00|Runge|TX|Sphere|1 minute|creature in transparent sphere  panics at being seen by nine year old boy|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58574.html|2|ndxe196211| Creature in transparent sphere  panics at being seen by nine year old boy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While playing with my cousins in the front yard of my grandparents home at night, I suddenly was overcome by a fear response. The hair on my neck and arms stood straight up and I suddenly became very afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped playing chase with my brother and cousins.  I was being observed by strange looking creature in a transparent bronze sphere, fifteen feet across, approx. thirty feet in the air.  The craft was positioned next to the power lines and was completely silent and motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see the top half of the craft because the night sky was very dark that night.  The interior of the craft was illuminated and I observed instrumentation racks, three layers with space in between, a red led type light was on the middle panel on the left interior side (my left).  Left front midline was a stair with round pipe handrail, this handrail came across the middle of the craft to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The creature appeared to be seated at a control console, but I could only see the upper torso, arms and head. The bottom area, from the stair to the right under the midline center area where the creature sat, was dark except for two small white LED type lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw no movement in there.  My focus came back to the creature, and I just stood there staring at it. This lasted three to four seconds and then the creature turned and our eyes met.  It knew I was watching and I observed a panic type reaction from it.  The eyes widened, the head and shoulders moved up and back, the arms came out to each side, it looked left and then right and then down at the control area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this is where it gets interesting.  Its eyes return to stare at me while each arm independently performs eight to ten adjustments to the controls, in front and to the sides of the creature, it did this without looking where the hands were,and at speed almost to hard to follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it completed the activity it just leaned back slightly and we stared at each other.  My brother ran up beside me, I grabbed his shoulder, and for the only time took my eyes off the craft, pointing up I yelled &#34;look&#34;, he turned his head side to side but did`t look up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was moving now, due north above me at about forty feet twenty mph and in total silence.  It was still transparent and as it disappeared into the darkness the pilot turned and looked at me, t did not return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I ran into the house shouting, &#34;I just saw a flying saucer&#34; all the adults just laughed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was nine years old when I saw that thing and have spent the last forty five years trying not to think about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

And reported he had lost his canopy. Upon return to the base the jet was put in hangar two guards posted outside. and three new trainees myself included were not allowed back on base when we returned for our drill the following week.

We were star gazing.  An object exactly the shape of a boomerang which was glowing with a white light flew overhead from the west.  It hovered directly overhead above the movie theatre, but was small in size.  It appeared to be actually the size of a boomerang way above our heads.  As we watched it it suddenly broke apart into six smaller objects exactly the same shape at the original and they hovered together and then in less than a second all flashed away in different directions.  We both said &#34;Oh a UFO.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/1/62 18:00|Valparaiso|FL|Cigar||orange, glowing cigar over bayou|10/7/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31989.html|5|ndxe196211| orange, glowing cigar over bayou<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred early one evening, just after dark when I was about 13 or 14 years old.  I was walking the two blocks home from my mother&#39;s shop, heading south on Southview Avenue, when I spotted an orange, glowing, cigar-shaped object in the southwest sky over Boggy Bayou/Choctawhatchee Bay.  I stopped and observed this object for a minute ot two, when it began a kind of undulating movement, its color becoming a more intense orange shade, and suddenly it disappeared,leaving two faint trails of smoke: one blue, one pink, forming two halves of a circle.  I realize that this sounds absurd, even to me at this time; especially the movement, which I likened to the movement of an inchworm.  But I know that I saw it.  I told my mother that evening, and she said that it was probably Eglin AFB doing some sort of testing.  I didn&#39;t think that  that kind of testing was possible but I figured that maybe I shouldn&#39;t mention it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
