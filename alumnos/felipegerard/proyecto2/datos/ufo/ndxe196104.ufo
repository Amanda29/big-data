It came from our left from up in the sky and positioned itself in front of us. It was probably a quarter mile from us still in the sky at about a 45 degree angle. It hovered there (I can&#39;t give exact length of time, as we were all taken by what we were seeing ) then a smaller object came out of it and hovered beside the larger object. You could see sky between them. The smaller object then took off to the right and took a path to ground out of our sight. We were still focused on the larger object when the smaller one came back from the same path it disappered and hovered there beside the larger one and then went inside it. By that time we had seen enough. WE had been parked in a car, I was the driver, with my lights still off, I turned the car around, turned my lights on, and took off away from the object. One of my friends in the back seat yelled &#34; it comming &#34; I glanced back and so it was behind us. The next thing that happened was all lights, headlights, dash lights,etc went out. The car was still going. I was driving in the dark on a country road, I managed to feel the edge of the road and come to a stop. When the car stopped the lights came back on and the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/1/61 20:00|Shenandoah|PA|Light|few minutes|UFOs spotted coming from behind the moon|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29699.html|2|ndxe196104| UFOs spotted coming from behind the moon<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure of the year, between 1960 and 1963, the date was April 1st, time about 8 PM. The moon was full or close to being full and was in the north west sky. It was a clear night. Myself and two friends were sitting on our porch  just talking the way pre-teens do.I think we were discussing basball. One of us, and I do not remember who, it could have been me I am not sure, yelled out, What are they? And pointed to the moon. Three small bright dots were flying east in an upside down &#34;V&#34; formation. They came from behind the moon and traveled at a slow speed eastward when the one on the bottom right of the upside down V broke formation and flew back and disappeared behind the moon. We watched the other two fly  east and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember saying that we should tell someone, probably our parents, what we saw. But we decided against it because the date was April 1st and we thought and knew that if we told anyone they would think it was just an April fools joke. Remember back in the early 60s if you said you saw a UFO, then called flying saucers, people thought you were nuts and we also had our young age going against us. To give some perspective of how this looked to us, see the moon about the size of a quarter and the lights about the size of a small pea. I testify that what I said here is true and that what we saw was not in our atmosphere but had to be in space because of the one light disappearing behind the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  The full Moon rises in the eastern sky.  We have asked the witness for clarification on the latter point.  PD))<n>
