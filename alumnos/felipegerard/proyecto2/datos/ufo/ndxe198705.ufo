There was no movement.  Those traveling on near by road pulled over to join others and no one spoke.  All they did was stare into the dusk night sky and stare at this large craft with various colors, lights, flashing. The strange thing about this, no one reported it to the press, news, etc., and even though those who stood near their cars were in some sort of trance, those in the family, still do not speak about it.  When something comes up, they ignore the entire situation.  They do admit it happened, and once ran into the living area when a craft resembling the one hanging in the sky, still and quiet was shown on TV. So, a family sees this craft and others, and no one reports on the situation.<n>

I looked over to my right shoulder and there was a light on the ground. The pattern was about 10 feet wide. But there was not a shaft of light coming to the light on the ground. I look up and about 150 away from me in the tree line was a UFO just hovering above the tree tops. No sound emitting from it at all.  I told my brother in law and you believe that. We both looked at each other and kept fishing. We both are very well educated and have white collar jobs. We did not say anything to anyone in fear of losing our careers that we want to keep. So we made a pack not to tell anyone about this sighting. Until now we have not repeating to anyone what we saw. I just wanted someone to know what I saw. It was about 400 feet long and not a light on it. I could only see it by the light of the moon being behind it. I was there for about ten minutes and it took off. The craft went staight up and out of sight. Just wanted to tell my story to someone that might understand what we saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

5/20/87 22:00|Mcpherson/Lindsborg|KS|Triangle|2 hours|Triangle Shape sighted.  Two hours of time lost during the encounter.|6/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98337.html|4|ndxe198705| Triangle Shape sighted. Two hours of time lost during the encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Statement of 6/1/13:  This encounter occurred during the month of May, 1987.  I lived in McPherson, Kansas.  My parents lived in Salina, Kansas.  My husband was a sheriff’s deputy and worked the 4-12 shift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday or Saturday evenings, I would leave our home early in the evening and take my two daughters, aged 4 and 5 months old, and drive to Salina to visit with my parents for the evening.  I always left my parents home at 10:00 in the evening, and always called my mother when I and the children returned home so she knew we were safe and off the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a 30 minute drive from Salina to McPherson on the highway.  Lindsborg is 14 miles from Salina, halfway back to McPherson.  As I approached Lindsborg’s lights on my right hand side,  I glanced back at my sleeping 4 year old and also at my infant daughter asleep in her carrier in the front seat of my car.  I could see the sodium lights of the rest area, called “Stuckey’s” about a mile ahead and to my right off the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became aware that I! saw something outside of my driver side window.  I looked up in the sky.  Around 500 feet up, across the double highway a solid black shape was ‘hanging’ in the air.  I recall there was a red light, a green light and a white light and they were in the corners of the object.  I determined it was a black triangle shaped object.  It was totally silent, not moving, just hanging there, blotting out the stars and clouds in the night sky.  I rolled down my window to listen, but there was no sound except my tires on the pavement. I thought, “I should stop for a moment to see what this is.”  I remember pulling over to the side of the road on the highway.  There were cars across the grassy center on the opposite side of the highway also stopping.  One car behind me was also pulling over.  I looked over at my sleeping daughter in the front seat, and opened my car door.  I had my right hand on the steering wheel, my left hand on the top of my open door pulling myself up out of the car.  My left foot was on the road of the highway, my right still on the floo! rboard o f my car.  I looked up and this triangle shape was just THERE.  Hanging.   Silent with three soft lights barely shining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My car tires bumped up over the raised part of our driveway and I parked my car.  I took my 4 year old into the house and put her in her bed.  I returned to the car and got my 5 month old daughter and the diaper bag out of the front seat.  I set her, in her carrier, down on the couch in the living room and was surprised to see headlights turn into our driveway and flash across our kitchen window.  My husband, a sheriff’s deputy, burst into the front door, both angry and worried.  “Where have you been?” he demanded. I was rather surprised but told him, “I just left mothers…what are you doing home so early?” “EARLY?” he shouted, “It’s midnight!  Your mother has been going crazy calling the department, saying you must have had a wreck, I have half the department out looking in the ditches for you!”  I was stunned.  I looked at the clock on the stove, it said, ‘ 12:05’.  I said that was impossible, that I had JUST left there 35 minutes ago.  How could it be after midnight?   I told him what I had seen in the sky and when he calmed down a bit, he called information and got the name of the Salina Air Base and handed me the phone.  I dialed the number and a nice young man answered and I after explaining about the triangle shaped ‘plane’  I asked him if the Army was testing any new aircraft over the highway between Salina and Lindsborg.  He said he was not sure, but he would transfer me to someone that could answer my questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another man got on the phone and identified himself as a Colonel.  He was very nice at first, questioning me about who was with me when I saw this shape, what time it happened and more general questions.  He then turned cold.  “What is your name, ma&#39;am?  What is your address?”  I put my hand over the phone and whispered  to my husband, “He wants my name and address..”  My husband took the phone out of my hand and hung up.  He said, “They want to know who you are and where you live for a reason..”  This was long before the days of caller I.D. and cell phones, being 1987.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that experience, I began to develop a fear of the nighttime.  I would go in the car at night, but years went by and I continued to lean forward and search through the windshield for “something.”  I had a very disturbing auditory experience for years, a low heavy ‘droning’ cycling in and out, I told my husband for years, while holding my ears, “Don’t you HEAR that? It’s driving me crazy!”  It sounded like a very large piece of machinery, with a very large engine droning on and on, from very far away.  I watched the night sky constantly, and avoided as much as possible going out after dark.  I found a place on my right arm, on the back, right above the elbow – there was something sharp and stabbing in my arm.  I would squeeze this area and feel something very sharp deep in the skin.  I had it for years.  During this time, I would have auditory experiences – if I stubbed my toe or bumped my shin, a hot ‘zip of electricity’ would run along the back of my head from one ear to the other and a robotic mechanical voice could be heard only by me.  “The small toe is injured.”  “The right leg is injured.”  Always this mechanical, emotionless voice.  I thought I was going crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a total hysterectomy in February of 1997.  From the time I had the hysterectomy, the voice, when ever I was injured, stopped.  I continued to notice the sharp object on the back of my arm and determined to remove whatever it was, got a needle and began digging on my arm.  As I am not left handed and it was on the back of my right arm, this was awkward and not very successful.  My husband knew about this sharp object and encouraged me to try to remove it.  After considerable digging and squeezing, a piece of razor thin white ‘plastic’ came out of my arm.  It was approximately one inch long and came to a dagger point.  I showed my husband the object and he told me to save it.  That was in 1999.  I regret I cannot remember what I did with this object.  My mind conveniently ‘forgot’ whether I saved it or discarded it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my story.  My husband is now a Chief of Police and will verify under oath all that I have related.  I am quite willing to undergo hypnosis or lie detector to verify my claim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Near Koval Lane and Tropicana Ave in Las Vegas, Nevada.  While entering my apartment complex, my friend and I saw nine cobalt blue with white halo orbs in &#34; V &#34; formation approached from the west at 12:30 AM. The spped being aprox. 10 mph. When noticing the strange group of lights made no noise and were thousands of feet high in the Nevada sky. They performed an aerial maneuver most aircraft don&#39;t dare try at the speed of instant happening.They collided into one large oval exploded in a fabulous firework with no noise. Joined again in the large oval and formed themselves into a diamond formation and continued their journey east over the casino skyline. When in the oval position, these nine objects moved around as if looking at tadpoles in an embryo. The sky was cloudless with a sprinkle of bright stars. Temperature around 90 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Illustration submitted with report.  Quite graphic.  PD))<n>

It was a crystal clear night and suddenly noticed a large object outlined in red lights with a flashing amber light at the center of the object.  It appeared to be at least 150 ft. long.  I first thought it was a large military helicopter.  I stopped my Chevy Blazer in the road, cut off my stereo and rolled down the window. The object was close to 300 ft. away.  I suddenly realized there was no noise at all. It was roughly 20-30 ft above the tree tops,yet the trees were motionless.  The craft was moving about 10-15 m.p.h. I drove quickly about 200 ft and pulled off to the left side of the road.  I got out of my vehicle and stood looking at it when I suddenly noticed an identical craft around 500 ft above the first one and slightly ahead.  I have lived here all of my life and I could tell by the direction they were heading they would pass over the crest of a hill about 1 and a half miles on down the road.  I figured I would be a lot higher and I would be able to see a lot more so I started for the crest of the hill as fast as I could get there.  It took around a minute to get there and as soon as I arrived I spun my vehicle around so I could see the crafts approach, but to my amazement they were gone.  I tuned my cb radio into a channel a local coal Strip mine was working because i knew, due to their location on the hill, they had to have see the crafts. They were working as usual and did not indicate any sighting at all.  I strangly was not afraid, but after I arrived home, I started to think about what I had seen and realized in what danger i could have possibly been.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We watched it till it stopped and made an abrupt 90 degree turn moved just a little bit and then made another abrupt 90 degree turn then vanished.

We were looking up at the clear skies and remarking how bright the stars were. I am interested in astronomy so I was telling them the names of the constalations, we had a pencil beamed torch that illuminated the sea mist, enabling me to use it as a pointer. I was pointing at cassiopia, which is seen as a &#34;w&#34; shape, when I noticed that it had an extra star.  I shone the beam on it, flashing it to signify the odd star. Suddenly, it flashed a beam back at us then shot off at high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next day, I was riding my GSX/R 1100 [brand new] along the country roads, running it in at high speed when I made a mistake that should have cost me my life. I wont go into the details here, but somehow, my bike defied the laws of physics and I was able to stop before the accident [the speeds were really high, I&#39;m a very experienced rider having started riding at seven years old]. When I got back to the campsite, I was telling some campers about what had happened when someone noticed that there were tyre marks on the lower fairing where the wheel had rubbed. Anyone who rides bikes will know that this would be impossible to do under braking force. The forks were straight and true. It was as if something stopped me before certain impact! I couldn&#39;t help thinking the event was related to the object we saw the night before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

This happened for approximately eight days,and always in the evening beginning around 9:00PM.This would happen only once a night (that we knew of) and not every night.The light was so bright it would light up the entire picture window like day light, in a flash we would turn our heads to look and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night(within the eight day period)I was sitting out on our pool deck,it was about 12 midnight,when this circular object rose above the horizon about 30 degrees, without any noise it approached very slowly above my head about 11:00, a             (70 degree angle)when it stopped and hovered.It looked like the full moon only half the size, no glow just a yellow/white circle. I watched it as it appeared to stay still watching me. Before my eyes this thing exploded without any noise, concentric rings of light blasted away from this circle lighting up thr entire back yard. It was so bright you could see the veins in the tree leaves. In less then a second out from the center of this object a missile shaped object shot out and moved at an extremely high rate of speed away on a near 80 degree angle up into the stars, about five seconds it was among the stars still moving as it vanished out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

In one of my stretches, I bent over and went back up and something had caught my attention. I saw in the sky above me a saucer still in one spot.  I took a good look at it (15 to 20 seconds), it had a white, metallic color on the outside with a shape of a disk with a dome on the top.  I looked around if someone else was also watching what I was looking at.  Nobody was, only me.  I looked back up and the saucer was gone.  I tried to see it in another spot in the sky, but didn&#39;t find it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

The weather was good since I remember the car window being open.  I was on my way home to my grandmothers house driving my first car.  It was soon after the sun had gone down and it was getting pretty dark out.  To my left hovering over a large group of trees was a massive object in the sky.  It was hovering just high enough over the trees so I could see it from the road as I drove by.  I had lived in the area all my life and I knew that beyond the trees was a fairly small residential area where this object was hovering.  If I had to guess the object was saucer shaped...since the bottom part of it was covered by the trees and there were hundreds of bright multicolored lights all along the side/center of it.  If I had to guess, the length was probably that of a football field and was about as tall as a house.  It was probably about 200 yards from the road as well.  I dont know what prevented me from stopping and investigating but the image is still clear after almost 16 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Someone&#39;s mother took photographs, but burned them later because she feared they might bring an evil influence into her home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hopefully someone else will be able to confirm this incident?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.
