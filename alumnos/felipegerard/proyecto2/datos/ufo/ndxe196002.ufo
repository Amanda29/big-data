2/18/60 21:00|Winston-Salem|NC|Cigar|20 seconds|It was on a Full Moonlit night, while snowsledding, a friend called to me and said , "look Bill, what in the world is that?"|8/10/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08429.html|1|ndxe196002| It was on a Full Moonlit night, while snowsledding, a friend called to me and said , &#34;look Bill, what in the world is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Charlie a friend of mine and myself were out behind our houses, sleigh riding.  We had just walked up to the top of the hill pulling the sled and Charlie said, &#34; look Bill, What in the world is that?&#34;.  I looked to where he was pointing, The sky was very clear, with a full moon and going from north to the south was a cigar shaped object which had no wings, no high tail fin no tail fins, it was just shaped like a cigar. There were two green lights on one side and a blue light on the other side.  Coming from the back of the cigar was a beam of white light that shown to the ground in a 45 degree angle, what was so unusual about this light was that the beam was the same size all the way down,( it would look like a laser beam, which we did not have at that time) and it was white.  This cigar shaped object, was completely silent.  We rushed into the house and called the tv station, the radio station and the Winston-Salem Journal and Sentinel newspaper offices.  The tv stations said that they had many reports and would air a report on it on the eleven o&#39;clock news and the newspapers said that they would have a complete write-up on it the next morning.  We were informed that commercial pilots had seen the same thing over the Mississippi River. When the eleven o&#39;clock news came on, there was no mention of it, the next day in the newspaper, back in the back of the paper was a little tiny column saying that the Air Force had reports on it and it was the &#34;a piece of a rocket returning to earth&#34; and a few months later, the Air Force Blue Book said that they had made a mistake, that it was the &#34; tail of a comet.&#34;  Up until recently, I have looked towards the skies many a night since that time hoping to see another unidentifiable object, but never have since, I am still hoping to see another though !<n>
2/1/60 23:00|Hartwell|GA|Cigar|Approx 30 to 45 seconds|My father explained an event of a large cigar-shaped object in perfect flight|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42421.html|2|ndxe196002| My father explained an event of a large cigar-shaped object in perfect flight<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout my life, my father has described an event that dramatically impacted his perception of UFO phenomena.  He has mentioned this story many times. While viewing the ABC special with Peter Jennings on 02/24/2005, at my asking, he elaborated this story in detail.  My father was a college student in Georgia at the time.  He was travelling to Greenville, SC on US 29.  This was before I-85 was constructed.  He told me that as he approached the Tugaloo River, which is also Lake Hartwell and also flows downstream to become the Savanah River, he came across something strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was driving an MG convertible with the top up, as it was wintertime.  Before he crossed the bridge that spanned the river, he noticed a strange object that made him stop his vehicle and watch the event before crossing.  He saw a large cigar-shaped object that glided &#34;perfectly&#34; down river from his left to right.  He described the color as a distinct green.  I asked him if it was a phosphorous green like older computer monitors and he said that it was like that green, only more of an earthy green.  The object &#34;floated&#34; perfectly in the same direction.  My dad specifically stated how he noticed the precision of the object&#39;s movement.  The object continued out of sight down the river.  After the object was completely out of sight, my dad continued across the river.  He said that there was a car coming from the South Carolina side of the river that also stopped to watch the event before crossing.  He said that the driver of that car also decided to cross once the object was gone.  My dad said that he looked straight at the face of the driver of the other vehicle as they passed.  He described the driver as a white male who had an amazed look on his face.  The two vehicles continued on their way without stopping.  To this day, my dad says that he wishes that he would have stopped and spoken to the other driver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad said that he rolled down the window of his MG while the object was moving in front of him and that the object made absolutely no sound.  He said that it seemed to almost &#34;absorb&#34; sound it was so quiet.  His vehicle never lost power throughout the entire event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This description of events has remained constant throughour the many times that he has told me this.  He is older now, yet still very lucid in his description and would be willing to share this with others.  He is adamant that the event occured in January or February of 1960.  What is interesting is reading the other events concerning a green cigar in the early 1960s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is interesting to note that on two separate occasions, we have witnesses similar events at the same time over the last fifteen years while being about ten miles from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
2/1/60 22:15|St. Paul|MN|Cigar|3 seconds|A cigar-shaped UFO glided down towards the earth at a 45 degree angle, but was lost in the ground clutter.|3/16/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12254.html|3|ndxe196002| A cigar-shaped UFO glided down towards the earth at a 45 degree angle, but was lost in the ground clutter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was February, 1960 when my friend LB and I had stopped at a local dairy store on Grand Avenue, bought our candy and chatted with the owner, and left when it closed at 10:00pm. We walked over to the vocational school next to our old grade school, and stood talking about aviation and rockets and anything interesting. There had been an F-84 parked in front of the vocational school for a few years. The school had removed the jet engine and taken it inside to be used in training jet engine mechanics. The plane remained out front as an advertisement for the school. Eventually, someone must have gotten nervous about the possibility that a kid might hurt himself on it, so it was towed away. So that&#39;s where LB and I liked to stand and talk: it was near the F-84 - or at least, where it now USED to be... It was now around 10:15pm. LB and I had been talking and trying to keep warm for about 15 minutes. The conversation felt like it was winding down, which was fine with me: it must have been around 20 degrees outside. Suddenly, while LB was saying something, I saw an unbelievable sight. It&#39;s fantastic - but I swear I saw it. A huge, cigar-shaped, wingless, engineless, noiseless lighted craft appeared from behind something - I think it was an apartment house - and quietly and swiftly glided down an imaginary slope as if it were on invisible railroad tracks. Each end was tapered and blunted - like the lit end of a fresh cigar. It was silvery in color, and had 8 to 10 round portholes with white light coming out of them. I did not see anyone or anything inside the ship. It was roughly in front of me and to my left - behind LB - and seemed very close: perhaps less than a block away. I was absolutely stunned. It was huge, it was bright, it was close, and it was moving closer. I thought it was going to land or crash. I was nearly speechless and momentarily afraid to move. My left arm shot out past LB&#39;s shoulder and I yelled, &#34;LOOK!!!&#34;. LB has always been noted for his quick reactions, but for some unknown reason he reacted slowly on this occasion. He started to turn to his left (the wrong way), then changed his mind and turned slowly to his right (towards where I was pointing). By the time he was fully turned, the ship had disappeared behind ground clutter - houses, trees, bushes, etc. I yelled, &#34;It should reappear over there!&#34;, pointing and running towards where I thought it might reappear. But it never emerged. It was apparently gone forever. While I was trembling and out of breath, LB was calm, collected, and slightly puzzled and bemused. Did LB - the world&#39;s greatest skeptic - believe me? Certainly not. He didn&#39;t think I was lying - he knew I wouldn&#39;t lie to him, but he thought that perhaps I&#39;d seen an optical illusion caused by the newly installed mercury street light, a hundred or more feet away. But, as to practicality, I&#39;ve seen billions and billions of mercury street lights, yard lights and playground lights, and not once have I thought I saw a silvery, cigar-shaped UFO come gliding out of the night in their vicinity - EXCEPT for that one time. Science, to be science, must be repeatable. LB&#39;s theory is not repeatable, nor can it be science. I saw what I saw - so far, once and only once in my lifetime.<n>
