It streaked across the proving grounds at a very low elevation. below the mountainous horizon.  The object was a luminiscent pale green orb with a thin, bright yellow rim and short, sharp tail.  It was early morning with dawn just breaking.  The mountains on the horizon were dark silouettes.  I was facing east and it moved from north to south and it over the mountains to the southeast, which were many miles away.  Witnesses reported this sighting to a Dr. Lincoln La Paz, who, I believe, was a professor at the university of New Mexico.  It was speculated that this nay have been St. Elmos fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Dr. La Paz was the lead scientist for &#34;Project Twinkle,&#34; in which he attempted to document and explain these meteor-like celestial events, some of which he felt strongly could not be ascribed to meteors.
