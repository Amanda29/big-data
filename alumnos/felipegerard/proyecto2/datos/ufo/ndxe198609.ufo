It happpened on September 21, 1986 around 6:30 a.m.  I was in the bed fixing to get up to go to school (the 6th grade).  My mom woke me up all upset saying she dreamed of a tornado.  She woke up and looked outside and saw a UFO.  She said it was low on the ground making a beeping noise like it was in trouble and changed colors.  Suddenly it took off.  I laughed at her and said, &#34;yeah right&#34;.  I got up and looked out the window.  It was back!  I saw it too!  My body was in complete shock and couldn&#39;t move.  I saw that it was about 3 feet hovering above the ground, and it looked like a triangular shape.  It was a solid white color for a few seconds.  It didn&#39;t make a noise when I saw it.  It was next to our big tree and mail box about 3 feet above ground on our dirt road (back then it was very remote).  Then it changed colors from white to red and took off and dissappeared with a second! ! I got the courage to go outside to try and find evidence.  I couldn&#39;t find anything and went back in the house.  I know it had to be something (either something from the government, a real UFO, or who knows).  I still think about it till this day.  It changed the way I think about things now.  I still believe in God, but I do think of things more scientifically as well.  I forgot the camera because I was in total shock!  I truly thought in my mind that they may know if I took their picture.  I certainly didn&#39;t want to be killed at 11 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
9/20/86 23:50|Tucson|AZ|Unknown|10-20 sec|Paired blue halos ascend rapidly and silently.|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19931.html|3|ndxe198609| Paired blue halos ascend rapidly and silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This small event occured whilst I was riding my bicycle home from work late one night around midnight. We lived in the foothills of the Santa Catalina mountains of Tucson, along the southwest slope. I was coming through the trees between two houses to get to my back yard, when I looked up toward our house. The mountains can be seen directly over our roof from that position, about 3-4 miles away. Above the house, but between me and the mountainside were two blue halo-shaped phenomena that rose from about 20 degrees, straight up to about 75 or 80 degrees before winking/fading out. The closest comparison I can come up with is that of the paired exhaust ports on an F-4 Phantom. Two blue flame-like halos trailing to cones as they ascended. They were much larger than jet exhaust ports in scale though, from that distance. They rose above the level of the mountains, from my perspective, and still all I could see were the halos. No shape blocked out the stars where one would think a fuselage would have been. There was no sound whatsoever, and we were very used to the sounds of military aircraft, as Davis Monthan AFB in town is one of the largest AF bases in the SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was no jet. There are no swamps in Tucson to produce &#34;swamp gas&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was going upstairs one night and I happened to look out of the door window. I was white smoke traveling down the street and I thought someone&#39;s house was on fire. I was scared to open the door my mother was sleeping so I just watched. It traveled about the height of a light pole and as I continued to observe it, there was an end to it. It was about 20 feet in lenght and traveled down the street over one of my friend&#39;s house. It stopped right over their roof and it did a circle and had gotten smaller. It stood over my friend&#39;s house for about 2 minutes and just disappeared. Out of the 2 other ufos&#39; I&#39;ve seen that was the weirdest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports submitted by witness.  Time and date may be approximate.  PD))<n>
9/18/86 20:30|Colts Neck|NJ|Fireball|30 minutes|ET Sighting in Colts Neck NJ 1986, shooting objects across  the sky.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51447.html|5|ndxe198609| ET Sighting in Colts Neck NJ 1986, shooting objects across  the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking a walk with a friend in my neighborhood.  I lived in an area where all the houses where on 1 1/2+ acres of mature grounds, i.e. many large tree and bushes.  It was a very clear night and the stars were out in an abundance.  After walking for about 15 minutes we began to focus on the night sky.  When looking up at the sky both myself and my friend saw what we thought was a shooting star.  We both became excited because we both saw it.  Made the wish (don&#39;t remember what it was now).  Continuing to look at the sky we both saw another &#34;shooting star.&#34;  Now we were amazed at our luck.  Then we saw another.  We both looked at each other.  Wow, this was a crazy good night!  Then another shooting star appeared very soon after. I began to realize that each time I saw the &#34;shooting star&#34; I felt like a tingling sensation throughout my upper body, head, arms and chest.  It gave me the goosebumps.  I asked my friend if she felt anything.  She described the same thing.  We started to get a little freaked out.  We looked up at the sky again and another &#34;shooting star&#34; appeared, as well as the tingling feeling.  We began to theorize that maybe they weren&#39;t shooting stars, but a meteor shower, or what if it was extraterrestrials??  Our minds pondered over this possibility for about 15-20 minutes.  Innocently thinking what an interesting discussion to have on such a beautiful night with &#34;shooting stars&#34; or just witnessing a meteor shower.  Later we began to focus on another topic other than UFO based.  Normal teenage talk (I was 17 at the time).  All of a sudden a middle-aged man appeared right in front of us.  He was not more than 2 feet away and to this day I can remember exactly how he looked.  He had a receding hairline, wearing a red flannel shirt, jeans, kind of unkempt, and he was walking a short scruffy light-haired dog on a leash.  His hand was fully extended, straight out (no bend in the elbow) and the leash was perfectly straight (no slack) down to the dog.  Because my friend and I did not see the man with dog right in front of us until he was right upon us, we both screamed, jumped, and grabbed each other in sheer fright.  We did not see him until he was right upon us and it scared us to death.  After we calmed down which took us a few seconds, we realized how we looked like total fools by jumping, screaming and grabbing each other right in front of someone.  So we turned around to apologize for being so scared and &#34;girlish.&#34;  The man and the dog were NOWHERE to be found.  They had vanished.  They weren&#39;t in front of us, behind us, to either side of us.  We continued to look for him for a couple of minutes.  He was nowhere.  Then we thought it was very strange that a man who was 2 feet away from us, who must of obviously known he scared the sXXt out of us, didn&#39;t ask us if we were okay, or that he was sorry for accidentally scaring us.  In fact, we realized after the fact that he did not make one sound nor do we recall any movement of the man or the dog.  When we thought back about the incident we both remembered that the man was not walking towards us he was STANDING with his dog right in front of us.  Totally still!  My friend and I both swore we would never minimize what happened to us that night.  We knew there may come a day where we would blame it on our imagination, or that there must have been some other explanation other than extraterrestrial related (I  apologize  if I spelled that wrong.).  I am no longer in touch with that friend, but 20 years later I still believe that what happened that night was an encounter with an extraterrestrial being.  I have NO doubt at all.  I just finished watching- Dan Aykroyd:  UFO Unplugged.   He had a similar experience about a vanishing as well.  I got the same chills/tingling when I heard his story.  It just reconfirmed my conviction about what I (and my friend) experienced.  PS- There was no reporting of a meteor shower the next day.  I inquired, watched tv, listened for it on the radio (no computer then so didn&#39;t do the internet search), no mention of one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also in spring/summer of 1999 I saw a metallic looking balloon hovering near my house very high in the sky.  It hovered for several minutes.  At this time I lived about 20 minutes west of Newark Airport in NJ.  I pointed it out to my husband.  He said it was probably a weather balloon.  He is a non-believer.  Again, watching the Dan Aykroyd movie about UFOs I saw the exact metallic shaped balloon in his footage as well.  After a while it slowly crossed across the sky and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I solemnly swear that the above did occur and it is not a hoax or a false report.  The Dan Aykroyd video encouraged me to document my two past UFO/ET experiences.  Hope it helps.  I always wanted to go on record with my experiences/encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/18/86 16:00|Owensboro|KY|Cylinder|approx 3 minutes|"Baton-shaped" object moving end-over-end in clear afternoon sky.|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14099.html|6|ndxe198609| &#34;Baton-shaped&#34; object moving end-over-end in clear afternoon sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in September of 1986 around the middle of the month, weekday, probably a Thursday between the hours of 1500 and 1800 CDT, most likely around 1600 to 1700 hrs.  I was driving north within the city and stopped for a traffic signal.  I looked up and saw what appeared to be something falling from the sky in a spiralling motion.  I was naturally quite curious and when the signal allowed me to proceed, I crossed the intersection and pulled into a then vacant business drive access.  I got out of the car and saw that the object was not falling but rather was moving in a southern direction by flipping end over end with a &#34;scooting&#34; motion between flips.  The object was metallic in appearance, cylindrical in shape with a small sperical apperature at both ends, rather like a majorettes baton, except not as elongated in the shaft and the tips being slightly larger in proportion to the baton.  I was intrigued by this motion and shape of the object and looked around to see if anyone else was observing this; though  there was plenty of traffic, no one else seemed to notice.  I then looked around in the sky and saw 2 jets travelling in the same southerly direction, but they were northeast of the object.  The jets were in a &#34;half-V&#34; formation and seemed to be moving at a speed and course congruent to a &#34;trailing&#34; flight.  The jets were at a fairly high altitude as they were quite small, but clear in appearance.  As I recall, it was a clear day absent of clouds, so I cannot accurately guage the altitude of the object itself.  However, as an ex-paratrooper I can safely say that it was not less than 2000 feet above the ground, but it could have been much higher as there was nothing in its immediate sky-space to relate it with, and it being an unfamiliar object, I had no mental reference of how large it actually would appear in relation to its distance.  If it was at the same altitude as the jets then it would have been immense in size, however the jets were sufficiently far enough away from the object to prevent an! eyeball comparison.  If this object had openings, lights or other &#34;decorations&#34; I did not see them, what I observed was what appeared to be a solid metallic object void of any rough texture, creases, etc.  The motion as described before, was &#34;graceful&#34; in that it took approximately 3 seconds for the &#34;rear&#34; sphere to become the &#34;front&#34; one, in relation to its direction of movement.  Then its &#34;scooting&#34; duration was about the same amount of time of 3 seconds, before it would engage another &#34;flipping&#34; motion.  When it performed this &#34;flip&#34;, it appeared that only the rear sphere changed altitude in relation to the ground, so that the front one remained on the same plane.  There were no &#34;dips&#34; or gawky motions or changes in velocity, that I observed, by the object.  As it began to fade from view in the south, I once again looked around to see if anyone else was watching this, to my disappointment, there was still no-one that I could see looking at this strange sight.  When I reached my destination I used the phone to     contact the local airport watchtower (ATC?) and inquired as to the object.  The person to whom I spoke with related that they were not aware of this and that there had not been any other reports made of the object.  I described the object to him and he stated that he had no idea what it was. He sounded neither surprised nor condescending, just matter-of-fact.  I would be interested to know if you are aware of any reports  which match the shape/motion criteria of this report.  I was 32 years old at the time.<n>

It wasn&#39;t moving fast, it wasn&#39;t moving slow.  My wife screamed for me to get out of there...LEAVE!  But, being curious of the site, I turned into a little side road and turned around, my wife was about frantic as I got out of the car, just wanting me to leave!  It shift from a western heading to a northern heading.  It didn&#39;t point that way, it just &#34;slid&#34; that way.  I couldn&#39;t see it after it passed over the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/15/86 22:30|Redding|CA|Cigar|1 minute|In September 1986 I was working for the National Park Service at the Whiskeytown National Recreation Area just west of Redding, CA.  I|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91310.html|8|ndxe198609| In September 1986 I was working for the National Park Service at the Whiskeytown National Recreation Area just west of Redding, CA.  I worked in the Natural Resources Division as a crewmember on the unit’s Fire Truck.  On the night in question we were tasked to lend support to the U.S. Forest Service in conducting a controlled burn on a unit of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mission probably began around 1930 PDT.  The firemen walked their drip torches from the top of the clear-cut block to the bottom and spent the rest of the evening making sure the fire did not jump the lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between 2200 -2230 PDT the fires were dying down and the crews were assembled on the landing, which overlooked a steep canyon, shooting the breeze while the bosses decided who would stay on site that night to monitor the fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about this time that someone noticed &#34;an aircraft&#34; approaching from the north.  I call it an aircraft because it was traveling through the air, but that’s where its similarity to anything else I have ever seen ended.  It caught the first person’s attention because there appeared to be flames and sparks emanating from it.  There were probably a dozen guys on the ground there and we all watched it in amazement.  It was just a cylindrical object travelling a slow, horizontal path with perhaps a 3-degree downward trajectory.  There were no wings, no elevators and no rudder.  There was probably a moon, I don’t know, but some light was shed on it from the fires behind us. The best way to describe it is that it kind of resembled a booster rocket but it was travelling horizontally and about one-third as fast as an airliner on its final approach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed the only sound I detected was a hissing and crackling.  A plume of smoke seemed to be coming from the middle of it with hints of sparks and flames.  There seemed to be markings but I could not make them out.   Now the smoke was the other curious thing. Because the thing was travelling so slowly it seemed to drift out or off of the object.  The affect was similar to holding a lighted cigarette horizontally and tracing a line in the air with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all stood and watched it until it disappeared out of sight behind the next ridge.  We kind of listened for an explosion or a crash, but there was none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listened and watched for news on the radio, television and newspaper for anything that might give a hint as to what it was.  And if it crashed in the woods in would probably start a major fire that a lot of units would have to roll on.   But there were no big fires and to this day I have never heard anything about it or even like it.  I have no idea what it was.<n>
9/15/86 22:30|Wingdale|NY|Other|20 minutes +|First obect traveling at high speed, second object stationary on mountain top observed for several minutes|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54978.html|9|ndxe198609| First obect traveling at high speed, second object stationary on mountain top observed for several minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> After attending a movie in Poughkeepsie,NY.,a friend and I were traveling N/E on Rt. 55. I was a front seat passenger and noticed a very bright light about 30 degrees off the treeline to the S/E. It appeared to be several miles off, but I commented something about a helicopter. The driver looked in the direction I mentioned and we both saw it move with lightening speed maintaining the same latitude, across the windsheild and stop about the same distance in the N/E direction. This occured West of Pouquague approximately. We were both pretty amazed, but chalked it off as to just one of those things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were traveling a short cut across what we referred to as East Mountain Road to reach our destination of Wingdale, New York. At the top of this mountain, there is a farm on a plateau. On the N side of the road, the main house sits about 100 ft. from the road. Directly across is a barn and some out buildings ( a barn mainly) that sits directly off a 15 foot shoulder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we reached the top of the hill, we noticed a large illuminated object hovering beside the house. initially, it appeared to be amorphorus. Undefined, but brilliant. The base of the object appeared to be off the ground but level with the second story of the house. The top of the object faded into the haze so we had no idea where the top of the object ended. It was very close to the house which gave us a little perspective. It was at least 5 times the size of this 2 story farm house. While it was not touching the ground, it seemed &#34;at rest&#34; hovering beside the house and remained there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told the driver to turn off the headlights as we grew closer, and instructed him to pull onto the shoulder by the barn so we could take it all in. He turned off the motor and  we just stared. We were both terrified at the scale of this object. The top of the mountain was very dark. There were no lights coming from either the house or the out buildings. There was no moonlight and it was slightly hazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there for about 15 minutes. There was no noise except for a very low frequency the I can only describe as &#34;feeling&#34; the sound rather than hearing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, my friend decided he was going to get out of the car and investigate it closer. He opened the door and started to get out when the noise because more audible. I panicked, and literally tore the sleeve from his shirt to restrain him from getting out of the vehicle. I turned the key and started the car motor and told him to drive. I also told him to leave the lights off until we began our descent down the other side of the plateau, which we did. We were both so frightened we wanted leave quickly, but it was like groping for a light switch in the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The East Montain Road is very steep and there are several hairpin turns. The mountain pass runs parallel to a deep ravine. From some places on the road, you cannot see the bottom of the ravine (in daylight) and as we were heading down, shortly after we turned on the headlights again, I noticed something glinting in the ravine below. The reflective(?) object was not stationary and seemed to be traveling slightly ahead of us but with us. It was shiny, and traveling like a bullet, only sideways. We were going to try to find a place to pull over again, to let it move on when it seemed to shoot down the ravine on an S shaped course and disappeared. In a S/E direction very similar to the object we saw initially on Rt. 55. This however was NOT the object we saw by the house. These were, in my opinion, two different objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We vowed never to discuss this with anyone because of the stigma attached. We were both New York State officials at the time. I honestly don&#39;t know why I&#39;m reporting this now, so many years later, but I am still stunned by it to this day when I think about it, and at least I have it off my chest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I looked up and a large object was moving over my head. However, there were no lights and no noise. It blackened out the sky as it went over me and this only lasted a few seconds. It was so close that I couldn&#39;t see the whole of it but my mind recognized it as the shape of an aircraft (without the wings)...I hesitate to say &#34;cigar shaped&#34; because it was so close over my head that I couldn&#39;t see the full shape. It was like being in a row boat and suddenly turning around and seeing a large cargo ship float 50 feet in front of you (with no noise or lights)...you can only see a mass chunk of it. This experience has mystified and haunted me for 15 years. I guess I&#39;ll never know exactly what that was.

The premises are outdoors and are guarded by guard and dogs in strategic positioning.While outside and on top of the small roof overlooking the night and starry sky. I distinctly recall the perfect night and how the stars were out. Then as i positioned to my left and towards lower manhattan side i noticed what seemed to be a shooting star. It was bright and streaking with a blue red into the atmosphere. I was amazed first as i thought it a rare chance to see a shooting star. But as i expected it to fizzle out. It only went distant and stopped seemingly pulsating. I was thinking this is odd. Then the pulsing had in a flash moved east as if by a enormous speed and in a  seeming instant. I was now really getting a bit curious and also uncertain what i was expecting. Then i noticed another pulsing closer and i was now sure this was more than odd. Within a flash i looked up and there directly by some amazing unexplained way i was seeing this enormous craft that was very sophisticated and truly unimaginable. The outer side was running a thousand patterns of seemingly colored lights in some sort of sequence. Yet somehow i looked towards the center directly above me and saw movement as if something was being done within the opening as it seemed to turn. But i didn&#39;t know what it was doing.Yet i also knew that if i could see this craft here in a borough of ny city then this may have a cloaking ability or some type of force to disguise or hide itself if necessary for its own advantages.I knew that in a instant just by its presence. That i was just nervous and almost wishing for what happened when it just ascended into the upper heights directly above then did the zipping movement into the distance where i saw a pulsation again and then it zipped out. This i almost never share due to its circumstance and the nature of our being on earth. But i feel this event had shown me there are real di! mensions to other realms of being and a extreme degree of sophistication and who knows what else around .

This area is mostly vast farmland. The light had a reddish/yellowish glow. Upon noticing the glowing light, I said to my mother without taking my eyes off of the light, &#34;Mom, you might want to pull the car over. I think you want to see this.&#34; As I remained transfixed on the light, Mom pulled the car over. She jumped out of the car, as did I and my younger sister. The three of us hopped a small ditch and stood in the open field looking at the light. The moment the three of us stopped and stood together to watch the light, the light began to move toward us. While in the distance, there was no way to tell its size, shape, or distance. As it began to move toward us, I could see a large red sphere of light, flanked by a smaller yellow sphere of light on each side of the larger red sphere. It moved slowly and made absolutely no sound. As it approached, I could see the red glow reflecting off the field in front of us. As it grew nearer, static electricity grew strong as well raising the hair on my arms and head. From the moment I first noticed the object, I looked away only twice. Once I looked down at my arms to notice my hair standing up and the red glow reflecting off my skin. The second time I looked away, a car was passing by. It was a friend of mine leaving rehearsal as well with his mother. I watched them pass to see if they noticed the light, or us watching it. They passed by without notice of anything. It was then I turned back to look at the light when I realized it was almost directly over head. The three of us grew highly anxious and embraced one another tightly. My mom stood in the middle, I was on her right, my sister was to her left. We never spoke throughout the duration of the event. As the object hovered directly over head, I could see through the light. There was no structure within it. No apparent source from which the light emitted. The red and yellow lights were bright, but not blinding or hurtful to the eyes. The lights appeared electric, yet soft, like a neon sign. That moment in time is the last memory either of us have of witnessing the object. For all three of us, there is no recollection of the object departing, us departing, us going home, us returning to the car, or even discussing what we had seen. The object hovering directly above us is collectively our last memory of that entire night. It was a few years later while in college that I remembered the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outdoors one evening photographing shots of the moon. Upon later developing the images, I noticed a small metallic-looking ball hovering near the moon in the frame. I had taken several shots and the object appeared in one other photo, only this time it had moved much closer to the moon. Viewing these photos startled me. It was then I remembered the incident with my mother and sister in 1986.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon recalling the incident in 1986 with my mom &amp; sister, I was quite disturbed when my memory didn&#39;t last beyond the object hovering above us. I promply visited my mother to ask her about it. She rememberd the incident vividly with the same detail as myself, with no memory of the object&#39;s departure, and no memory of the incident at all until then. She and I called my sister on the telephone to inquire about the same night. She too remembered the exact same incident with the exact same voids in her memory. Later, the three of us met face to face to recall the events of that evening and our memories, and lackings thereof, were in perfect accord. I do not know what it was nor do I claim that it must be alien. The only thing I know it to have been was a UFO...an Unidentified Flying Object. A UFO that left the three of us with some very unusual effects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/1/86 20:00|Virginia Beach|VA|Unknown|5 min|Two creatures or aliens in Bay Colony, no UFO.|8/21/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83236.html|14|ndxe198609| Two creatures or aliens in Bay Colony, no UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a report of a UFO, but of two strange creatures I witnessed.  I was 12 to 13 years old, it was dusk and overcast.  I remember it being windy and about to rain or it was sprinkling.  Out of my downstairs bedroom window, I can clearly see the neighbors house roof.  I was looking out the window and saw a figure on top of the roof ridge about 5 feet from the gable end.  It appeared to be sitting there looking at me!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for a minute or so and ended up walking away for a minute to find someone else to see.  When I came back to the window, there was a second creature sitting behind the first one and appeared to have its arms around the first one from behind.  Like hugging someone from behind.  They just sat and looked at me for enough time that I figured they wern&#39;t going anywhere soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I left to find a witness, but on my return, they were gone!  I thought it was a racoon or O&#39;possom when I saw the first creature, but soon realised it was nothing I&#39;ve ever seen.  I was raised in the mountains and have never seen an animal like this!  The best description is a kuala bear.  They were no more than 1.5 - 2 feet tall, more of a brown/black longer fur, and smaller ears.  The roof top was about ~75&#39; from my window.  I&#39;ve never heard of koala&#39;s in Virginia, except at the zoo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in the Bay Colony neighborhood of Va. Beach.  It is a neighborhood surrounded by water and only a few land/road access points through populated areas.<n>

9/1/86 17:00|Valparaiso (Chile)||Sphere|hours|Mass sighting of a shiny metallic sphere|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17997.html|16|ndxe198609| Mass sighting of a shiny metallic sphere<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event occured when I was a child.  I came out of my home with my mother to visit my aunt up the street.  As we stepped out of the house, we noticed right away in the north sky (direction we were walking towards) a static shiny metallic silver sphere.  It was a clear, sunny day so that this object seemed out of place and as a result there were lots of people on the street pointing and gazing at this object.  My mother and I did not stop walking, and on the way to my aunt&#39;s house, my mother ran into a friend, who was also looking at this strange object.  He happened to have a pair of binoculars, and my mother took a look, and so did I.  No more details of the object could be discerned through the binoculars, though it seemed to give certain off colours as light reflected off it, kind of like a disco ball.  Now, after a half hour of looking at this seemingly still object, we went over to my aunt&#39;s house.  We walked back home later on that night, and the object was no longer visible.  I had been thinking about this object all day and later on that night we saw a news report on it on TV.  Apparently the same object had been and filmed not only in my home city of Valparaiso, but also in Santiago, Punta Arenas, Buenos Aires and other cities and towns in Chile and Argentina all within one day.  They showed clip of the object, which looked the same as the one I had witnessed.  It was said on the news that it was not a weather balloon as many that had seen the object suspected, and that it had been witnessed by thousands of people.  Nothing else was made of this event, and I never heard of it again.  Even though I was a child at the time, I can still remember the object looming in the north sky, and I&#39;m sure that it could not have been explained by any natural phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

9/1/86 15:00|Oak Harbor|WA|Other|15 seconds|Possible military test craft in Oak Harbor, Washington.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58541.html|17|ndxe198609| Possible military test craft in Oak Harbor, Washington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving and saw and oddly shaped aircraft.  It left no trail.  I could not tell whether it made any noise because I was driving a very noisy car at the time.  If you looked at the craft from the bottom, it appeared to be shaped a bit like a chevron.  As it flew away and I saw it from behind, its appeared to be curved.  It was one solid body, somewhat like the Stealth, except the wings (if you can call them that) were curved downward.  I doubt it was an alien craft because it was flying very low and there was a military base close by.  But it was certainly unlike anything I&#39;d seen before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.  PD))<n>

No one talked about such things back then, especially in the narrow minded south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke from a sound sleep in the middle of the night, and sensed something.  My windows were high on the wall of my bedroom, so I stood on the bed to look outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There, hovering over the woods next to my house, was a triangle shaped ship.  It had lights that ran along all 3 sides, outlining its shape.  It was at a distance of less than 3 tenths of a mile.  I watched it, too afraid that if I looked away, it would disappear, for several minutes, until I lost the feeling in my feet.  Then, it did an almost instant 180 degree turn and shot off into the night.  Traveling east to southeast, I guess.  It made NO sound, but there was that kind of sensation you get from something that you don&#39;t so much hear as feel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned on all the lights and refused to go back to sleep, to ensure that I had not dreamed the whole thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
