Thinking it was a satellite I started to video tape it as my wife flashed a flash light at it. the light flashed back at us twice as the light kept moving to the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From the black night sky to the flash and back to the black sky again, it last no more than 2 seconds. at the time of the flash, I noticed many rounded off rectangles. I would also like to add that there was no sound. I was later seen again in a different portion of the sky about 5 minutes afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Me and my friend seen both flashes as reported. I seen the first flash, and my friend saw the second flash. I was facing at that time aprox. NW when I seen the first flash, which basically flashed, I saw maybe 6 rectangles and then it disappeared, the second flash which my friend saw, occording to him, was about the same thing, at this point I was off the highway and we were facing S to SW when we see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At 11pm in 2003.  It was a long time ago, so I do not remember the day or month!   I was looking towards Cortland and she was looking toward Jamestown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the sudden she yelled my name.  I turned to see what she was yelling about right above the shed was a large white light there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran inside to tell our parents who did not believe us.  The next day in school many students were talking about the white light that they saw by  Jamestown so there were some people who did believe us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in 2003 is approximate.

6/30/03 22:00|Ripon|WI|Circle|1 hour|Strange object sat still in sky for 45 minutes like a star, then very quickly passed over me.|1/31/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34689.html|6|ndxe200306| Strange object sat still in sky for 45 minutes like a star, then very quickly passed over me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was out at Trinity Church looking at fireflies after a church event had ended, I noticed a bright yellow (not white, but a deeper yellow) light about the size of five or six stars combined. It was a clear night, so I could compare the object to the many stars that were out. The object remained motionless for about forty minutes. When I went to my bike it started moving in a loop towards me, it looked like it was descending towards earth. No one else was around since church had been out for about half an hour, and I hid in the long marsh grass. It flew directly over me and I could see tiny red, green, and white lights on the bottom of it and larger, more bright, yellow lights in a circle pattern on the bottom of it. There were no lights in the middle, but there was a combination of three figure eight patterns made with yellow light. The three figure eights were connected together and seemed to be coming from the large yellow lights. I have seen many airplanes, jets, satellites, and meteorites fly at all times of day since Ripon is located near Oshkosh. Oshkosh gets all kinds of planes from around the world for the EAA and I can tell the difference between planes and what I saw. I have never seen an aircraft just sit still for about forty minutes, then when you glance at it a second time it moves at a very fast speed towards you. What caused me to wonder what the object was is that I have never seen it before while looking for fireflies, and that the object was brighter, larger, and a different color then a star. As I was leaving I saw an object that looked the same as the first object out towards Oshkosh flying in an odd pattern. The object was raising its height, then lowering it (bobbing up and down). I was just wondering if anyone else in the Ripon area saw this strange object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:The objects lights were in a disc shape, but I could not see the outline of the object due to the bright yellow lights. The object seemed to be less than 100 yards above my head, but it was hard to tell because I did not know the exact size of the object. If the object was a little less than 100 yards high, then it had around a 100 foot radius (assuming the lights were on the edge of the object). I compared the objects height to the roof of the church as it passed over it. As I noted before, the yellow lights were extremely bright and they made it impossible to see the outline of the object, only the smaller lights were noticeable with the large yellow ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  It is unusual, in our opinion, for a UFO to remain motionless for an hour, although not impossible.  If the report that the object moved swiftly across the sky is accurate, then it could not have been a celestial body.  PD))<n>
6/30/03 21:00|New Brighton|PA|Other|10 minutes|Black triangle surrouned by silver sphears moving south towards Pittsburgh, PA.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29535.html|7|ndxe200306| Black triangle surrouned by silver sphears moving south towards Pittsburgh, PA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While taking an evening walk I noticed someone in a car near me point up to the sky.  Wondering what they were looking at, I too looked up into the sky.  I saw what appeared to be a black triangle that was standing upright.  Altitude could have ranged anywhere from 10-12,000 feet.  This black triangle in the western sky puzzled me for several reasons.  As it was in the direction of a seeting sun on a clear evening it did not reflect any sunlight as I have seen airliners do thousands of times.  The strangest thing about the whole event were the other objects that appeared to be with this black triangle.  On each side of this triangle appeared 3-4 silvery spheres.  From my view they appeared on each side of the triangle lined up at 45-degree angles.  My girlfriend who was with me noticed the triangle, but because of poor vision could not see the spheres (they were smaller than the triangle).  I witnessed these objects for a total of about 5-10 minutes.  The objects appeared to be heading South-South West and it seemed as though they were following along the Beaver River and towards the Ohio River just north of Pittsburgh.  After rushing into the house to grab a pair of binoculars I could not find the object again.  I&#39;m an airplane enthusiast and I can identy almost any civilian/military craft with just a glance.  This was neither a civilian or military craft.  The objects in question emitted no sound, lights, or trail.  On a similar note, while watching CNN the following night at around 1 AM there was a report that strange lights were seen that night over the city of Pittsburgh.  I have found no written reports in any newspapers about this event and only saw one mention of the event on the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They left the 4 wheeler and ran towards home, the craft came fast toward them and was quiet and dark, huge as a big jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The girls were about 15 years old, they were so scared the froze at the back door of the house and just looked up at it.  It hovered over them very very quiet for a few seconds and took off.  Its had lights on botton.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/30/03 20:00|Hong Kong (China)||Other|1 hour|glowing Ball in delta formation 1000ft wide over Hong Kong|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50038.html|9|ndxe200306| glowing Ball in delta formation 1000ft wide over Hong Kong<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sorry that I cannot recall the exact date but I could if I spent time on it. I am British and live in Hong Kong. One day I received a call from my close friend in Hong Kong. He informed me that the night before he and several members  of our community were having night cruise. They saw balls of light in formation but he stammered over his description and it seemed to not make sense. It was a Hong Kong harbour cruise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend asked me to come the following night at around 8.00pm to talk  whilst they were unloading a chartered ship full of oranges. I arrived and spoke to my friend when he was interupted by the Polish captain of the ship and they were talking. His back was towards me when I saw up in the sky and saw balls, glowing in delta positions. Pls note my choice of words. I called to my friend and he said that was exactly what they saw and he became very flustered. 10 chinese were on the quay side and  when we asked them to look they became very cynical and made jokes and we could not assess whether they could see these things or not, in the sense that they could see but could not really make descriptions. One of them took pictures, however the night before, the pictures that were taken did not show anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I must explain to you something. Firstly the objects were balls estimated at 8ft diameter, glowing between white and gold. My friends descriptions was &#34;glowing red&#34;. The chinese could not say what they were seeing and as I said their answers were not cohesive. There would be circa 9 balls in delta formation that did not change. As wide as 500-1000ft wide. Secondly there were about 5 delta formations and they were circling the IFC 1 building in Central Hong Kong, slowly.. It is I guess a 50  or more story building and the building has a light beaming skywards.The objects circled the beam within the height of the beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thirdly my friend is the Governor of the School, religeous and honest. I am a Director of a Corporation in HK. My friend does not want to talk about this incident due to it effecting his credibility as a school governor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can honestly tell you under oath that these objects were intelligently controlled. I can vouch that no reports were made in Hong Kong at all and that is understandable as far as local culture is concerned. It happened a month after we were shown the UFO flap on TV which happened in Beijing and Shanghai. the objects were not the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not wanting to go too deep into it but for weeks afterward strange related issues took place as far as I was concerned, however they have not been happening since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please also note this was not lights on a wing. Each ball was its own object in fixed formation with the others.They appear to resemble the film clips on the internet &#34;phoenix lights, which might be balls on a wing. these were not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Me and my older (5 years older) sister where at her friends and we looked out the window now and again that night and we kept noticing a ball of light hovering from a far distance at the back of her house.   As we looked every 5 mins or so we noticed i was getting bigger we thought it was a star or something then we noticed no it wasnt getting bigger it was moving closer (we were kinda freaked out by intriged) and watched it and it was moving to a point we couldnt see it as it would now be in the sky at the side/front of her house (still where the feilds are) so we went outside and her road was a dead end and we stood there watching it at the bottom of her road.  Gazing as it just hovered the 3 of us and the craft for about 10 mins not as high as an airplane though. bright white with a yellow tinge to it. It hovered for about 10 mins then disappeared to the left for about 10 seconds and appeared with another one so now there we 2 hovering for another 10 seconds the one the 1st one brought back so the 2nd one that left and brought back another one (so theres 3 now) the 3rd one left and and brought another one and this went on until there were 7 they werehovering in a circle like they knew we were there not over us but in front of us in the sky and they hovered for 20 mins or  so and moved to the left and disappered behind the clouds.  we were amazed at what happened and that day has never left my mind. It was a strange yet amazing experience we didnt feel threatend at all its a day that ive never forgot neither has my sister we still speak of it today. just 3 kids at the end of a dead end street in the middle of feilds.  what i find weird is that it was like they was communicating with each other in the crafts and figuring us out.  Also why would the last one dissapear each time and bring back another one. just to hover and wat! ch us.  Maybe the 1st craft that we saw 1st at the back of my friends house window was catching our attenttion so we could be used as a learning source for the others. im not sure. its all a strange yet cool experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 2003 is approximate.

I said &#34;no&#34;. Then he said to me &#34;did you see the saucer up there?&#34;. I was astonished and kept looking at it until it disappeared behing a motel/multi storied building up hill. My profession is architecture and I do design of building. I tried to see the detail of it. I saw it straight above my head. I did not know the distance but the size to me was about 16 inch. It was moving very slowly with a smooth rotation. It had multiple bluish white lights around the disk, not less than 8, it could be upto 12. If I try I can still draw a picture of that disk/UFO. The lights were very pleasent and smooth. It did not make any sound and did not leave any fume behind like aeroplane does.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a cloudy day and nearing sunset when I heard and saw this.  In the third frame, it appears as though multiple crafts were in focus.  I only had a 200 mm lens but as I enlarge the photos, the sighting is remarkable.

It grew very bright and silvery for about half a minute and then faded, not moving like the Iridium satellites.  It then came back into view a second time and I noticed an oval shape briefly. It faded again in about 30 seconds but came back a third time a minute later, slightly dimmer. It seemed to have shifted only slightly, laterally, if at all, during the entire event.  The pulsating appearance seems to rule out satellites or a planet. I watched steadily and intently from the first moment it came into view.  The brilliance was intense enough at times to call it an aura. As bright as a full Venus would be at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Iridium satellite flashes do not last for 30 seconds.

It was in the direction towards Sky Harbor Airport. The object floated for a while than it disapeared and then it came back, this happened 2 or 3 times. Then to assure me that it wasn&#39;t an airplane. I saw an airplane fly under the object. From where I was driving I really couldn&#39;t judge the distance between the 2 crafts.

Clear skys, no winds. I observed two large cloud like objects to the south of where I was standing. The outter ring was large and perfectly round. The inner circle was the same. The outter and inner circle had even space between them, at which I could see the night sky behind it. As my girlfriend and I were watching the cloud like object, another object fireball like was just over head of both of us. The fireball object shot along the sky going south towards the double cloud like rings. As the fire ball moved closer to the circles, it threw off a light streak that was as bright as day, it looked like it had a tail, comet like. When the fireball entered the center of the cloud it vanished from sight. The tail of this object remained for 10 mins. After the fireball vanished the circle remained until about 20 mins later, after that there was no trace of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible missile launches out of Wallops Island, VA.

There was some generalized fog and there was a cover of clounds above the city. We observed a very dark cigar shaped object move repetitvely back and forth from one end of the city to the other, occasionally dipping into the clouds but never decending below the cloud cover. The object did not appear to be movong fast but it was covering considerable distances in a short amount of time (moving back and forth acros the city in appx 45 sec). The object was signifaclty larger than a plane or helocopter as it appeared in relation to the city scape to be longer than the width of two buildings. The movement, shape and speed was not consistant with any modes of air craft with which I am familiar. The nearest airport is located some distance from the city. We observed the object for appx 10 minutes during which we noted an intersting cognitive phenomenum in which as we ruled out aircrafts that were consistent with our contextual schemata, we became increasingly aware of the unfamliarity of the object. We would be interested in kowing if there were any other sightings in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The thing that amazed us about it was the speed at which they travelled.. they traversed the part of the sky (about 1/3 of the firmanent) in which we could see in a matter of 3 or 4 seconds, one following the other a little bit behind it, a little off to the left. The altitude at which they were is hard to determine, but they were definately at a few kilometers&#39; heigth. The colour seemed to be a bit orangy. They looked like they were sortof disklike, since they didn&#39;t look like regular stars, which to the naked eye resemble pinpoints of light. These objects however seemed to have at least some kind of mass to it, since the light it emitted seemed to come from some sort of illuminated body of sorts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven&#39;t got a clue what we saw that night, but i&#39;m sortof hoping that other people saw it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Connecting the tops of the &#34;W&#34; in the shape of a semi-circle which looped below the entire &#34;W&#34; was a fainter light of the same color.  The entire image measured roughly ten times the size of the moon when similarly positioned at other times of the month. We pulled off the road and got out our camera equipment, checking to see if clouds had developed in other areas of the night sky.  Other than the unusual blue trail of light, we saw only clear sky and bright stars from horizon to horizon.   By the time I dialed in the proper settings on my camera equipment, the light&#39;s intensity had diminished by roughly half, and I was able to capture only a few faint images.  By this time, the &#34;W&#34; had begun to dissipate by expanding outwards from the center in a uniform manner. Curiously, the trails of light did not behave as a jet contrail would behave as it is blown apart by high winds, with the entire trail moving down the sky uniformly as it disperses.  This &#34;W&#34; shaped light simply expanded out from the center, with the trails of light growing wider and fainter in intensity, until the entire image was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued our drive back to Kill Devil Hills, where as we were unloading the car at around 3am we observed the same configuration of lights in the same location of the sky.  This time I was able to capture images immediately.  I also took a picture of the only clouds in the sky we were able to find -- due south along the horizon.  There was a distinct difference in the appearance of the clouds versus the &#34;W&#34; light -- in other words, the &#34;W&#34; light did not have the same characteristics as the clouds on the horizon. Over the following 20 minutes, we observed the &#34;W&#34; light as it dissipated just as the earlier sighting had.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> While packing to leave my beach house, I looked up and saw a large, odd-shaped cloud that was very clearly glowing with a blue-green light.  It looked kind of like a trail left by an aircraft after the aircraft had been gone and the trail had widened, but this cloud did not move with the wind or dissipate.  I had the impression it was extremely high up (dozens of miles, perhaps).  The cloud/trail varied in thickness, and described a roughly 270-degree &#34;swoop&#34; or semicircle about five times the circumference of a full moon..  As it was an otherwise clear night, and I was intrigued by the trail, myself and two friends went over to the beach to get a better look and benefit from darker sky.  The cloud was very clearly glowing (not reflecting light) and the light was a pale greenish-blue.  It kind of looked to me what I always imagined aurorae might appear like.  Anyway, at the beach, we saw four people who claimed to see what caused the cloud.  They saw a very bright ball of light, the same color as the cloud, come tracking in quite quickly from the southeastern horizon and seemingly &#34;higher&#34;, it appeared to follow the curve of the earth.  Then, almost directly overhead, it kind of &#34;ricocheted&#34; and appeared to dissipate, the fading light flying very quickly toward the opposite (western) horizon and leaving the strange glowing cloud where it &#34;bounced&#34;.  In the darker sky, I could see a faint, very straight trail leading to the cloud from the direction which these other folks said the object originally appeared.  To me, it looked like the straight, slanting trail leading to the cloud was emanating from &#34;deeper&#34; into the sky, like the path of an object which &#34;fell&#34; from deeper space to the point of the cloud.  The other observers had claimed to see shooting stars and fireballs before, and that this object was a different color and moved much more slowly.  After about 10-15 minutes of observation, the cloud very slowly seemed to lose its &#34;glow&#34;, though it didn&#39;t really dissipate, and never move! d from its position almost directly overhead and just a bit out to sea (east).  My hypothesis at the time (and which I still believe, but would love to have confirmed) is that some sort of meteor, fairly large, struck the upper atmosphere and glanced off, leaving a &#34;bruise&#34; of ionized gas very high up, which slowly faded out.  I&#39;m submitting this report in the hopes someone at that end might have more information and be able to shed some light on this mystery sky-sign.<n>

The lights were about a quarter of the size of the moon and appeared to be 1.5 miles away from us (witnesses).  I estimate they were .5 mi. above ground level.  The two objects first hovered stationary for over a minute and seemed to move independently of each other.  They then spiraled upwards around each other, then floated back down to a similar altitude as before.  They rested in this position for approx. 5 seconds then shot straight up out of sight.  No noise was recognized as being related to the objects.  I believe them to be two separate objects because when spiraling around each other nothing blocked the light produced by the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Here is what the sun dogs looked like: They were about a quarter inch in length, slightly cylindrical and vertical. They were kind of like orange paint daubs on a canvas and they stood out well from the orange sky behind them. Anyway, if anyone else reports the same thing, it might be interesting to compare the reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We know this witness, and know her to be an exceptionally cautious observer, with a great deal of technical training and experience.

It was pretty high, I assume because, with the naked eye, it was about the size of a pencil eraser.  The rest of the family search the sky a spotted the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watching it, it looked like it was heading toward the ground, because it looked like it was getting larger.  Then it stopped and hung there for about 5 minutes.  Then the object slowly began moving North-Northeast.  I looked away and my son exclaimed &#34;Hey! it just divided in two.&#34;  So I looked up again and I spotted the two objects.  The second just accelerated really fast and flew off in a South-Southwesterly direction and disappeared behind our trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued watching the first object, then suddenly the second returned with equal velocity flying in the North-Northeasterly direction catching up to the first.

At first I thought that it was my &#34;tired eyes&#34; playing a trick on me, so I blinked a couple of times and rubbed them. I looked again, and the object was still moving in a straight line but I noticed some jerking motions, like it went forward then went backward. I thought I was just imagining it, so I closed my blinds. I then, out of curiousity, opened the blinds again. And I saw the same object, maybe a different one, I can&#39;t be sure, traveling in and upward direction. I have never turned my back on this sort of thing and like to keep an open mind, but I never expected to see this type of phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a warm night, there weren&#39;t any clouds in sight, and the light pollution was low. I was looking for Polaris, the North Star, by following the stars Dubhe and Merak of Ursa Major. I was having difficulty finding it, and I blamed this on a stray cloud, even though it was a clear night. Suddenly, something caught my right eye and I realized that a small pinpoint of light was moving across the constellation Bootes toward the area I had been searching earlier, to the North. At first, I thought it was a shooting star, but I continued to watch it and it did not fade or disappear. I knew it was not an airplane, either, as it was far too high in the atmosphere. It was about the size of a small star, and had a reddish glint to it. As I watched, it made its way across the sky, then disappeared from my view once it got too low to the horizon. I shrugged this off, and continued to stargaze. But it hit me as a real shock when I realized that there was another one, following the same Northern path in the sky. I watched this one, and then a third, for it appeared shortly after the second. They were all tiny pinpoints of light that required my binoculars for a clear view, and all three followed the Northern path, disappearing once they came too close to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We feel that satellites are the first possibility to be ruled out.

They would make 2 or 3 rotations and then all would merge togeather into center and then explode outward into a larger rotation and begin the counter clock-wise rotation. The movement in and out was very graceful and smooth like an inhale and exhale movement. When the objects merged in the center they merged into an orb that was translucent also and we could see a star shinning through. The star stayed in the center the whole time and was twinkling red and white. Did not count how many times these disks rotated or how many orbits. It was very quiet the whole time, even the animals out side were quite but my husband and I talked to each other and asked questions of each other. But we noticed the silence. The disk merged togeather into the center one last time then disappeared. The star remained. The star was not any bigger or any different then the other stars that were out but we went out the next night at the very same time and looked in the same direction and that star is no longer there.

Geographic reference points are 40° 38&#39; 28.5&#34; north, 73° 46&#39; 41.9&#34; west. There was a saucer shaped object with the usual half sphere middle part 3 rows of 8 or 10 windows. It was emitting a gloomy white light/haze all over it and a blinking sharp white light from the bottom. It was hovering low in the horizon. It stayed in one position approx 300 meters high then moved slowly to the right while lowering itself. Then came back to its original position but much closer to the ground and got out of sight because covered by a building. Might have landed. We were four of us. Other people also saw it from a JFK between terminals bus but did not pay too much attention. We have just got back to NY and looked up on the sky as getting off the bus and going into the subway station. IT WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE. Several airplanes went by paying no attention to it altough they must have seen it. No chasing. I followed its movements in the parking lot and saw it time to time covered by the trees. At the very first sight we knew we had never seen anything like that on the sky before. Somehow a very nice relaxing feeling over the excitement of the unusual sight.<n>

A friend and I just got out of the car and we noticed a thin lighting shaped line at a very high altitude and was stationary. We went in to get my friends mom and when we went back out it was gone. We stood there lookin for it, when we noticed something simular reappearing. This time it was veritcal and straight. It grew brighter and more distinct and then seemed to burst with a bright light. After this, it went back to a hazy dim line and shifted around to be horizontal. It stayed like this a few more minutes and then slowy faded away. &#34;We could see stars behind it so we don&#39;t think it could have been clouds&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness observed the launch of several missiles out of Wallops Island, VA, to test the upper atmosphere.

6/28/03 23:12|New York City (Brooklyn)|NY|Disk|6 minutes|A friend and I saw a round domed object metallic in appearance and rather large with lights located around the bottom edges and top.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29474.html|43|ndxe200306| A friend and I saw a round domed object metallic in appearance and rather large with lights located around the bottom edges and top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving down Flatlands in Brooklyn I noticed an object hovering straight ahead, normally I would not have paid a flying object any mind because we see helicopters and planes all the time, however this object was noticable because of its shape, it was round with what I can only describe as a domed top, furthermore this object was not high up like an airplane but only several stories it was low enough that details could be made out.  It had a metallic appearance with lights located around the bottom along the edge, these lights were between purple and blue in color and there was also a pulsating yellowish light located between the round bottom of the craft and its round domed top. I looked at it for several seconds trying to make out what I was seeing before I tapped my boyfriend and said do you see that, I should mention that I have never believed in aliens, or bigfoot or anything of the sort I am a graduate student majoring in forensic science and have always been taught there is an explanation for everything, he looked up got quiet for a few seconds and said &#34;oh my god, what the hell is that.&#34; We continued to drive north and the craft simply hovered there, the night was clear and silent and we both noticed that whatever it was it emitted no noise, we continued driving and the object began to travel north but at a slow pace. My boyfriend began to feel uneasy about this round object which was most definitely not a plane or a helicopter or any other flying object either of us had ever seen before and turned right, at this point we were traveling east but were still looking back at the odject, maybe 4-5 minutes had passed by this point. Now we had to look back and to the left to keep the object in focus, at this point the object began to tavel in our direction rather rapidly however it was now slightly tilted with the bottom turned toward us, the closer it got the larger it appeared and the more detail we could make out (at this point the object was only about 2 blocks from us,) we co! uld not understand how those around us could not see this, it was so close, but the drivers around us did not appear to be looking in the direction of this craft which could easily be seen by looking through the back seat window on the driver&#39;s side but rather straight ahead.  At this point the craft was traveling behind a set of buildings, once again I commented on how low it was, it wasn&#39;t flying over the buildings but behind them so that its view would be blocked for about half a second everytime it went behind a building,( the buildings were apartments I estimate to be about 15-20 stories high)the object suddenly took off in the opposite direction and we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/28/03 23:00|Virginia Beach|VA|Light|5 hours|Bright green light "draws" serveral strange marks over the Atlantic Ocean|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62249.html|44|ndxe200306| Bright green light &#34;draws&#34; serveral strange marks over the Atlantic Ocean<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at the Virginia Beach oceanfront with five friends on a summer night in 2003. Three of them left to go play pool. My friend and I went and sat on the beach around 80th street, a few miles down from the strip. When I first saw the green light, it looked like a dotted line being slowly drawn downward slowly in the sky. It seemed to be very wide and very high, miles out over the Atlantic Ocean. I pointed it out to my friend and we both just thought it looked cool. It stopped abruptly, but about 5 minutes later it returned, a little faster now, and it was a solid line. The light made one streak and then stopped. This line remained visible for quite awhile. My friend and I became very interested after that. I called my mother and a few friends to tell them to look for it. One of those friends was on as boat just off the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and she and her friends could see it from there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We eventually settled back down, but an hour or so later the light returned. It started the same way, making a segmented line. When it came back as a solid line it made a broad, looping stroke in the sky. It was really bright green, and reminded me off a neon sign. My friend and I started to feel uneasy after the second appearance. There were other people scattered on the stretch off sand, and they all began pointing up and acting afraid. There was a group of around ten teenagers there from the Ukraine on work visas for the summer. They approached us and asked if we knew what was happening. Some of them seemed really scared. They sat and talked with us for another hour or so (it was between midnight and 1am) and then the light returned a third time. After its dotted stroke, the light made another sold line. This time the light swooped around a few times before culminating with an incredibly bright flash. At this point I became frightened as well, and I remember thinking we were seeing some kind of unfathomable missile or bomb approaching and that we were all going to be killed. Both the lines and the shape of the flash remained visible for what seemed like an hour. My other three friends came back sometime between 1 and 2 am. We told them what happened and one of them stayed on the beach with us and the Ukrainians. As I recounted the light appearances, it struck me that the three different shapes left by the solid line resembled the numbers 1, 2, and 3, in that order. This wasn’t completely true, however because the &#34;3&#34; had an extra swirl at the tail before the flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all completely amazed when it came back again, making the same dotted and solid line as it had the first time. I was scared, but I was also mesmerized and couldn’t tear myself away. We all just sat there watching the sky, wondering if it would keep coming back. When it did (again, about an hour later), it repeated the pattern of the second dotted and solid line. I was sure it would come back and repeat the third line and its flash, and just before dawn it did. I was still completely awed and so even as my companions went to bed, I stayed on the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cycle began to repeat itself a third time as the sky grew lighter. It was still visible after sunrise. I watched as the light again formed its first and second formations, but before the third pattern could be re-drawn, I succumbed to my exhaustion and went to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember wanting to see what the newspaper or local news would have to say about the lights, but I never heard anything about it. I assumed the stations would be flooded with calls from people in Virginia Beach and as far away as North Carolina, so I never even considered calling myself. I did do an internet search to see if there were any weird tests being done at nearby military bases, but came up empty-handed. I still tell people about it, and when I run into the friend who had been out there with me we ask each other whether we’ve figured out it was.  We haven’t, of course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We had been out there for maybe 5 minutes. I was sitting in a lounge chair that lays back. I dont know why but for some reason I looked up. I know what I saw was not a plane or lights off some gas ball. There were 5 circles in the sky. Each one was a off white color. They did&#39;nt move they did&#39;nt blink they just sat there. But they were&#39;nt by them selfs. They were hooked to something else. The circles were in a circular pattern, as if they were attached to something. They were about 5 feet from one another. But you could see them clear.....it was&#39;nt a plane! Those lights were attached to the left side of some kind of craft. I told my wife to look at it. When she saw it she got a little scared and went inside. I stayed out there for maybe 15 more minutes. When I got to the upper part of the hotel I looked out over the rail. They were gone......just like that....gone no noise..nothing. Well when I went inside my wife did&#39;nt really wont to talk about it. Later on that night I would say around 3;15 am. I woke up to a very bright light outside the hotel window. I got up and looked out the door. It was so bright when I opened the door you could&#39;nt even see the parking lot. I dont remember much after that....not even going back to bed. But the next morning I woke up with a cut in the middle of my arm. Not a big cut, but a cut. It was&#39;nt there when I went to bed. Well after comeing back home the cut stayed on my arm for about 2 weeks. Did&#39;nt scab up....did&#39;nt bleed...nothing. Then the next morning it was gone! No scar...nothing. I have never had any trouble with my body before that night. But ever since I saw what I saw. Ive had bad headaches...and my right arm goes num. I know it sounds stupid but it&#39;s the truth. I belive something happened that night.....what I have no idea. But what ever did happen, it feels like I got part of it....if you would like to email me feel free to.

I spotted the craft as it was descending in front of a jagged peak that we were about 100 yards from. The background was brown and green so it was easy to see. The craft was about a foot in diameter and appeared to me spinning while in descent. The whole incident lasted about a minute, and then the craft just disappeared into the canyon. The craft did not make any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

By the time I was about a 1/4 of a block away from house, it was around 4:45 AM.  The side street I was on lacked artificial light or any sort and for some reason (probably the lack unusually clear night)  I was compelled to look into the night sky.  Right then and there I saw twin streaks of green light appear from somewhere above my head or behind me and streak across the sky (faster than anything that&#39;s not powered by a rocket motor) heading towards the East and dissappearing behind the trees of someone&#39;s yard.  As far as I could tell, the object or objects were fairly high up.  I couldn&#39;t see the source of the streaks, but they were wider at the leading side and trailed off like a jet contrail, only with faster dispersion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now some may assumet that this was some sort of pyrotechnic, but that&#39;s out of the question since I waited several minutes for any resultant explosion.  In addition to that, how many professional flying pyrotechnics would shoot 2 green trails and not make any sound what so ever?  As for a meteorite, every one I&#39;ve ever seen tends not to leave twin trails in perfect parallel sync&#39; and also tend to leave white streaks.  Others may assume that it was a military jet since Moffett field is under 5 miles away, however this couldn&#39;t be the case since Moffett should not be used for fighterjet aircraft due to its decommissioning about 5 years ago.  In addition, the streaks were green and what sort of plane burns a fuel mixture or uses technology that leaves not red, not orange, not yellow, not blue, but green streaks?  The fact that there wasn&#39;t even a sound also bothered me.  If this isn&#39;t a U.F.O., the military is using the Moffett/N.A.S.A. Ames facility for a fighter landing strip or some sort of testing/staging area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object had no flashing lights or sound of any kind. I was not certain that it was an object moving but confirmed what i was seeing with very close attention. The object seemed like a aiplane 2 connected airplane wings with no body. There was no sound as it moved through the sky. I do not and still do not belive the existence of flying saucers however I do believe this to be an unidenfied flying object. There was no way anyone else would have noticed if they were not looking at the sky with particular attention to see something ie a shooting star, which I was. Then there it was. &#34;SOMETHING&#34; was moving through the sky. At first I thought it might be a cloud but it moving a faster rate of speed than clouds move. There were no identifible lights of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

An object caught my eye. The object was too high to see details. Sunlight reflected off the object. The object was north of us (me and my 14-year old son). We had seen an object &#39;hanging&#39; in the sky several weeks ago, and wondered whether this was the same or similar object. It looked similar. We watched this object for a couple of minutes, waiting to see if it was perhaps a small plane that was far off and heading toward us. There were no contrails around the object. And no clouds whatsoever. We watched it for a couple of minutes, then I said, &#34;Let&#39;s note the time.&#34; It was 13:57 Mountain Daylight Time. The object moved slowly toward the south. We looked at about 45 degrees to the horizon to first see it. In approximately ten minutes it had moved so that we were looking at about 85 degrees, not quite straight up. Watching the object was easier with polarized sun glasses. Without the polarized sun glasses, the object was hard to see. I told my son to go to the car to get the other sunglasses. When he came back, the object was closely to straight overhead, and I said, &#34;I&#39;ve lost it.&#34; My son said, &#34;I see it.&#34; I asked, &#34;Where?&#34; He said, &#34;There&#34;, but he was pointing to the 45-degree location. It had to be a second object in about the same spot as we had first seen the first object. Unless the first object zipped back down. I think there were two objects. We watched that object for a number of minutes. It was just hanging there. I said, &#34;What would happen if I tried to contact them?&#34; I stepped out into the open and waved at the object. I waved with both hands scissoring over my head. The object immediately faded from sight. We started walking back to the car. We noted the time. It was 14:17.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as a person with a great deal of technical training and experience.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD))<n>

It brightened as it was heading in the northeast direction but then faded into the northwest sky, almost U-shaped.

I was observing this about 5 miles away from the base. As I was observing that I was distracted by a Triangle shaped object thet flew directly over me. It was a good distance up, but I could make out from the glow of the lights that it was a triangle. I watched it slowly drift away. as it went overhead it made no sound. I focused my attention back on the glowing object over the air station. this object moved slowly to the south then moved north slowly and kept going. I know it was at a fairly low altitude because I could see it move through the trees that were in my field of vision. I think they are doing tests on some new technology. There were also alot of military jets flying around earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I started to look down again I noticed 2 lights kind of low on the horizon barely moving west. My first thought was it was 2 helicopters following each other at a very slow speed. Since it took a minite or so to come to that conclusion I decided to play a joke on my wife and called her out to see. I just kept looking at them because something was just not right with my conclusion. Mainly because for as close as they appeared I couldn&#39;t hear anything. When my wife got outside and about half way to where I was I told her to stop turn around and look up. She started questioning them right away asking me what they were. Shortly after she got outside it appeared as the first one seemed to have sparks fall from it and seemed to have turned north as if the light came from the front because it became real hard to see so I focused on the second one which kept going west.Then the second one kind of stopped for a couple of seconds and also turnin the same direction the other one did. Since there wasn&#39;t anymore I really focused on this one as the light got further away. This time noticing the direction was north but it also was climbing in altitude kind of like when watching an airshow and watching the plane as it climbs to a point until it stalls, but this kept going. Then the light seemed to disappear and I remember saying it&#39;s gone right as I said that it faintly reappeared and (this is where I really started to question what we were seeing) We both saw it shot up and I mean up and in two kind of swooping motions (the dot of light became a trail slowed down and did it one more time) and it was gone nothing like we have ever seen before nothing. I am 31 y/o and I have alwayed watched our airforce jets as they fly around that are based in Miramar, seen all that latest tv shows regarding the usa&#39;s technology in jets, been to many of sky shows (blue angels) and never seen anything take-off like th! is did. The only thing I can think of is maybe there is a top secret aircraft that nobody knows about except for the select few. For some reason I just don&#39;t think that we have the technology, just by the way we send the shuttle or even satalights into orbit. They go up quickly about at the same angle these did, not even close to the same rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object appeared parallel to the ground at first, at around 10,000 feet altitude, and when it was parallel it had a cigar shape and glimmered silver and shiny.  When it departed it did not ascend or descend, but instead just floated off.  As it turned it banked and the underside was dark and allowed the viewers to see that it had a disc shape.  About 15 people were watching it closely, asking others if they had a camera or videocamera, but unfortunately noone had anticipated this so there were no cameras around.  A dark helicoptor with no markings was seen hovering and following from a distance, but it certainly kept it&#39;s distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides a minimum of personal data, but we will request that he/she have some of the other witnesses submit written reports, as well.

It seemed very close to us. It lasted a few seconds. we ask each other did you see that? we saw an amazing show after that the multi colored ones seemed to be communicating with each other and the larger bright one  they would flash different sequences. move rapidly up and down and/or side to side. One even took off across the sky looped around the disappeared. One may have even been near or in the water. It almost seemed like there may have been two different types of ufo&#39;s.

We (myself, a friend, and his son) were at a beach just outside the town of Kokkari (37 degrees 46 minutes latitude, 26 degrees, 54 seconds longitude). The bay opens out to the northeast. My friend had a digital camera and was shooting photographs of his son playing in the water. None of us saw anything unusual at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my friend looked at his pictures at home, however, he found a very strange sight: a distinct, silver, disc-shaped object in the air between the beach where we had been and another peninsula of the island in the distance. The disc was symmetrical and tilted at a slight angle. It was deepest at the mid-point, tapering at the edges. In a photograph taken a minute later, the disc is no longer there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up to the North, approximately 10 degrees above the horizon and saw a medium to dark gray disk.  It appeared to be approximately 1/4 mile up and a few miles away.  It rotated from horizontal to vertical, occasionally flipping over slowly, completing a 360 rotation, returning to a horizontal (upright?) position.  It moved slowly and steadily in an East-Southeast direction.  While rotating to a vertical position, it reflected the sunlight and flashed a brilliant silver and gold metallic color.  When it was horizontal (and all angles between horizontal and vertical) it again returned to a muted medium to dark gray.  Someone else thought it was brown.   It was silent .  Four adults and two children observed this disk, however, the five others left the scene to resume their daily routines.  I stayed behind and followed the disk visually for another 15 minutes or so.  This took me to my back yard which faces an east-southeasterly direction.  The disk continued to move to the East toward Camp Pendleton, gradually moving slightly upward but still on a plane somewhat parallel to the horizon.  The disk maneuvered from horizontal to vertical when it would travel straight up and then either flip over or return back to horizontal.  I had to get to work but could still see the object in the distance before finally walking away.  It appeared to be in the area of Camp Pendleton.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was scanning the skys as usual and saw a bright whiteish blue light stationary in the north eastern sky. I thought it was a star but did a double take as it was barely moving. As soon as I got a good fix on it it suddenly drifted straight up, and within ten seconds I could not find it anymore.Before I lost sight of it I am pretty sure it changed to an orangish color. 1. Satellites do not go up, 2.no plane I know of can shoot straight up like that. 3. too fast for a balloon.

I was staying in a guest bedroom of my parents home.  The home lies in the midst of 78 acres with fields surrounding it.  I was sound asleep and then suddenly, I was wide awake.  One set of the bedroom windows faces what I belive is north to north-east and the four dogs that live outside were completely silent.  There were no highway sounds (the highway is about 5 miles away as the crow flies), no night-bird sounds, no insects, nothing.  I looked out the windows and my first thought was that there was going to be a commercial jet airplane smashing into the house.  All I could see in the adjoining field (about 1 &amp; 1/2 football field legnths away from the house) was a large rectangle &#34;window&#34; with a bright blue (neon style light - piercing - strobe level bright) and I thought it was a downed commercial jet and it was going to skid into the house. I could tell there was some massive shadow behind it, such as woudl work with a large jet body laying behind the &#34;pilot&#39;s window&#34;. I could only discern in bulk and what appeared to be delta style wings behind the brilliant blue lighted window. It was so eerie as there was no sound.  The rectangle shape of light was, I supposed the pilots&#39; front window.  But then, there was this super-intense bright little zipping ball of light that traveled so quickly my eyes could not even barely track it without &#34;trails&#34; of light refracting.  I did not know it at the time, but I had cataracts in both eyes, that may have caused the &#34;refraction&#34; of the light in the zipping ball (in comparison to the large light rectangle, in comparison to the enormity of the &#34;blue lighted window&#34; and the bulky craft behind the windown, this ball was about the size of a supersized beach ball or 100-plus pound pumpkin).  Anyhow, I watched it for what seemed like a half an hour at least, but I have no idea.  I blinked, stood up, drank some water from the bedside table, but yet it remained.  Then, I laid ba! ck in bed facing the field and the strange apparation and I just fell asleep or something.  I don&#39;t know. I was going to wake my younger sister (asleep in the adjoining first floor guest room) and have her look but I fell into sort of a trance or whatever.  Later that day, I went out to the field and could find no evidence of a burn or the weeds or crops that were left mashed down. The following weekend I watched my used copy of the movie, &#34;Signs&#34; the wonderful film by M. Night Shalalah (sp) with Mel Gibson.  I had terrifying nightmares and was extremely stressed and frightened.  That movie is frightening but I never made me so panicked before. Strange.  Thanks, that&#39;s my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date of the sighting is approximate.

Given the distance, I doubt that my camera could pick up a reflection.  I zoomed in on it as much as I could on my computer, but that did not make it any more identifiable.  The part of the sky it was in is in line with aircraft landing and taking off from the columbus airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A man reported to me that he and his wife were just heading out for a couple of days fishing trip at Prince Rupert, British Columbia. They were just outside of Terrace, B.C.  driving on highway #16 along the Skeena River heading west when the man&#39;s wife gave out a yell for him to look up and towards the south. The gentleman said it took a couple of seconds before his brain kicked in, thinking what he was looking at was very unusual. He pulled the vehicle over to the side of the road and both watched an egg shaped object hovering over the south side of the river at approx: 1000 feet. They mentioned it was approx: the size of a pick-up truck, shiny silver in color. It was completely smooth, or no seams on the object were visible. &#34;Witness expressed: it looked like an egg&#34;!! (he laughed and said they must grow large chickens in Canada).<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not hear any sounds coming from it. The sighting lasted for approx: 10 to 15 seconds before it sped off at an incredible rate of speed south. He also said that since it wasn&#39;t that early in the morning there were other vehicles passing them on the highway, and a couple of vehicles had slowed way down and they could been seen looking in the direction of the object. The witness said I know what normal aircraft look like, and this thing was not anything that I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Note: Of course I am looking for any others who were traveling the highway that morning in hopes they may have seen the same thing.

At times the lights seemed to pulsate and darken.After an hour of watching it float around our campsite we fell asleep.In all of my years of camping I have never seen anything like this before.They are here and it&#39;s real cool!<n>

We were so happy at the moment. Nothing special, while playing in the car, one of my friend judt looked outside the window. Accroding the him, he was just simply look outside. He saw something outside. It was a egg shape plane. So bright. The special is, the egg is not moving, it was stop near the ground. Later on, 2 more egg shape come from the sky. But these 2 is not so bright. It was just a little bit brighter then star. We can hear some sound. But when we hear carefully, it was not a normail sound but is was a nice music. They just look like having party on our place(earth). Only 3 and a half minute,they fly away. We so surprise. We dont have enough time to take photo even thought we have camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I witness a bright bluish-white light appear in the northern sky approx. twice as bright as an aircraft&#39;s landing lights.  As I watched the light move in a north/northwest direction I noticed there was no sound.  As the &#34;craft&#34; moved NNW it slowly faded to a very small point of red light.  I carefully watched to see if I could locate the normal strobe or wing lights of an aircraft, I saw none.  Approx. 5 seconds later the &#34;craft&#34; accelerated at tremendous speed and disappeared from sight completely.  I have long been a night sky observer and somewhat of an amateur astronomer and therefore can easily discern the difference between what I saw and a meteor or sattelite.

It had 7 Lights under the UFO in V-Shaped formation and it flew 7-8 stories up from the highest building in the city which was 10stories. I am still unsure about how many people saw the craft since I was the only one walking in the streets at such late of a night. The craft moved slowly at least 10-20 miles per hour or less for about 3mins then just dissapeared without a trace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

From the mall to the intersection at the bottom of the hill, an object, or group of objects, could be seen hovering above the trees on top of the mountain ahead.  It appeared at first to be someone on a parachute, and this formation was quite clear.  While observing the object, I noticed that it did not move.  Therefore, someone on a parachute would be impossible (besides the fact that no one would be on a parachute around there).  It was rush hour, so I assume other people saw this formation.  If anyone knows what it was, or saw it as well, please contact me.  Drawing the object is simple..draw a half-circle (upper half, like a parachute), come down an inch from the center, and draw a dot.  That&#39;s what I saw<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

In the air, over Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada, I saw motionless, a long silver cigar shaped object in the air. The sky was very cloudy with dark grey clouds. There had been a thundershower about a half hour earlier. This object stood apart from the the clouds as it was shiny, but not like chrome, more like the stainless steel of a medical instrument. It was definatley not flat-colored like the backing clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could hear no noise, possibly due to my distance from it. I could not tell at about what altitude it may have been at, I am not a meteorologist. It was clearly, in my opinion, not a conventional aircraft. There is significant aircraft activity in this area. Helicopters, float planes and passenger planes of all descriptions. One often looks up to see the aircraft coming and going, and gets to recognize many of the regular aircraft, by their paint and markings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no air polution in this part of the country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a weather balloon, it was motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a helicopter, float plane, or regular aircraft, it was silent, and motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I advanced up the road to see if I could get a better look at it, and it moved slowly into the clouds, and did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will say as well that I got the sense that there was more &#34;depth&#34; to the object than what I could see from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not on any medications, drugs or under the influence of alcohol. I am a credible citizen, having held elected public office. No criminal record. I have never posted on this website before.

It was moving at a quick pace, then stopped and stayed in one place for about 5 minutes and then started traveling again in a different direction and then disappeared. It was too far up to see a shape, but appeared to be white in color much like a star, seemed to be as high as the stars in the morning sky and the same size as a small star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/22/03 23:00|Kingston|WI|Light|1-2 minutes|It didn't move like a shooting star or plane and I wasn't alone when I saw it on two separate occasions.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29363.html|92|ndxe200306| It didn&#39;t move like a shooting star or plane and I wasn&#39;t alone when I saw it on two separate occasions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night a friend and I decided to go outside stargazing.  We love to look for shooting stars.  As we walked out the door, we noticed a super bright star.  As we gazed at it we realized it was moving.  It became brighter and brighter in the sky mostly straight up a little to the western horizon.  This &#39;star&#39; was traveling from south to north and then stopped, turned, and headed toward space.  We watched as it disappeared from view.  As this was not the first time I&#39;ve seen this strange event, I finally decided to report it somewhere.  Last year on Sept. 7, 2002 at approximately 11 pm again, 3 of us saw the same thing in the eastern sky.  It headed right at us and we thought it was a shooting star.  As in came closer, I actually became frightened as I thought maybe it was a meteorite going to hit or something.  I hadn&#39;t ever seen anything like it.  It finally changed direction heading south and then changed direction again and headed into space until it disappeared.  The object both times was extremely high...as if in space, but much bigger than a star or satelite.  It didn&#39;t have the lights of a plane or jet and didn&#39;t move like any kind of plane I&#39;ve ever seen.  It was much too high to be a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To give you background on myself, I&#39;m a disabled police officer.  I went through 4 years of college and actually took classes in Astronomy in college as I&#39;ve always love stargazing.  I&#39;m level headed and logical.  I do believe in the idea of life in outer space as the universe is a big place and there are many things we have no clue about in it.  I will say that I have never met an alien that I&#39;m aware of; I have never dreamt about aliens, however I do enjoy science fiction books and television; and I have never felt as if aliens were trying to contact me.  I would embrace an opportunity to meet other-worldly creatures, but I don&#39;t expect it to happen in my lifetime.  I&#39;m a middle aged, down to earth, farm girl who went to college, got a job, and got arthritis.  What did I see?  I&#39;m not totally sure.  But for now, I would have to classify it as an &#39;unidentified&#39; flying object.  I&#39;m continuing to search for an earthly explanation, but haven&#39;t found one yet.  I would really love to find out just what it was.  I&#39;ll be watching that sky!<n>

Sitting outside on patio enjoying the warm clear evening, around 9:45pm, my night vision adjusted, not too much light pollution. I can see more stars than in the SF Bay Area. I said to myself I&#39;m going to bag a UFO tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watched planes flying around the valley… all had blinking, or strobing lights. I kept watching for an aberration in the stars, i.e. anything moving erratically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking towards East, a light enters my vision, a moving solid white, smallish pinpoint of light, not as large as say Mars, moving slowly my way. Another airplane I said to myself. Ah, what&#39;s this? It stopped moving. Now its moving again but swaying… swaying right, swaying left. It stops. It goes down (relatively speaking from my LOS), sways right, sways left, goes back up and continues on its pathway toward W. Now it turns, not a sweeping turn, but a sudden 90-degree turn. It does a maneuver around a fixed star (again relatively speaking), and continues on it way, now in the southerly direction. Eventually, it fades from my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon first glimpse I thought &#39;satellite&#39;. But when it stopped dead in its tracks and started swaying, I knew I had bagged my &#34;UFO&#34; for the night. Amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was heading east from Bardstown going to I-65.  I noticed to the south of me two object which appeared to be white (or silver reflection).  They stayed stationary and were about 100 yards from each other, maybe a couple of thousand feet off the ground (above the tree line).  I even rolled down the window hoping I would hear something, but to no avail I did not hear anything.  Then I thought they were advertising balloons, but I could not convince myself they were balloons.  This is my very first experience witnessing such aircraft(s). I was wondering if there is anyway you can confirm if there were other reports like this one.  I do not know anyone in Bardstown other than the friends house I was leaving.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As they got to the north (3sec) I looked straight back up and saw a formation of 5 Disc&#39;s as if following or chasing the group of 3, same speed if not faster. These had an aura or glowing haze on the outer edge with a glowing circular haze in the center.  They did not break formation.  I ran in the house, yelled to 2 friends, ran back out, looked up and saw a 2nd formation of 5 Disc&#39;s with the same aura and haze moving in the same direction and speed, this group though changed into a triangular formation and back by the time they got to the north.  Approximately a minute later a single disc, looked to be the size of the first 3 only an off white with reddish tint, same speed and direction was seen.  I&#39;ve always wanted to see a UFO, never have except for books and pictures, now I have and dont know who to tell or what to do except enter this report.  Hopefully others saw tonight what I saw. Nebraska or South Dakota. I will watch for other reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this MUFON member for sharing the report with our Center.  PD))<n>

About three hand spaces above the horizon I noticed three iridescent orange lights in a triangle shape.  They were very slowly changing from orange to green.  They hovered where they were for approximately two minutes when my friend asked if I was seeing what he was seeing. I said yes, and then we started trying to see if they were reflections from some lights in the pickup cab.  I hung my head out the window and the lights were still in the same position.  They seemed to be rotating clockwise very slowly, almost imperceptibly.  We both watched them for another minute or so when they disappeared.  My friend thought they just blinked out, but I thought I saw them zoom away to the northeast at a speed that made them seem like they disappeared.  The lights never really did change colors completely to green but seemed to shimmer and have a green tinge.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have had UFO sightings before and often scan the skies.  The object appeared silvery/white in color and was about the size of a 1/8&#34; BB at arms length. I estimate it was 1-2 miles away at the time, and about 50-60 degrees high in the sky. It was moving slowly to the southeast away from me, and at one point appeared to slow and stop, before continueing to the southeast and fading away in the blue sky. I had it in view for 5-6 minutes and had time to get my 35mm camera and take two pictures using the telephoto setting, which unfortunately is not too powerful. The sky was mostly clear with a few wispy clouds. There was no apparent wind at the time, but about 20-30 minutes after the sighting the wind did begin to blow and I saw that the clouds were moving to the northeast, which is at a right angle to the direction I saw the object moving. My first thought was that the object could be a large balloon but the fact that the UFO appeared to slow and stop, and move at right angles to the wind made me discount this. I hope something shows up in my pictures that I can send to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of the report, and to MUFON COLORADO for sharing the information with NUFORC.

We were at the fort, Castillo de san Marcos, where we have visited many times before.  We didn&#39;t see or hear anything unusual that day and none of us remember a plane, helicopter or anything else flying overhead (even though none of these things even vaguely resemble what we caught in the picture).  We just had the film developed and I also requested a picture CD.  As I was looking through the pictures one of them shows a distinctly silver, disk-shaped object over the fort.  I have no idea what this is and it was suggested to me find somewhere to send the picture in hopes of finding out just what we captured in this picture.  Can you help?  Again, nothing was noticed that day, just once we got the pictures back developed.  The picture was shot with a 35mm camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request that the witness forward a copy of the photo to NUFORC for our perusal.

Hard to see the pattern after about five seconds. Translucent. I could see through the octagon forms. The Moon was not up at the time. The grid was over 12&#34;AL. I could not see the overall shape of the grid. I go back to sleep. No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4:30 I awaken and immeadiately look straight up and see a highly visable elongated square just hovering. 4&#34;x6&#34; AL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had many large and small octagons covering the bottom. The octagons were like a black frame work. For a few seconds it hovers then moves away to the NW.  In the center was a trangular shape made of small black dots or blobs. As it hovered I could see the larger grid pattern hovering above the smaller square. The larger grid was more visable at this time. I noticed the larger grid began to fade out soon after the smaller grid square left the area. The moon was to my left at about the ten O&#39;clock position. It was less than half.

I slammed on my brakes thinking it might be a animal, but I could hardly speak to my daughter because I didn&#39;t know how to describe it to her. The only way I can tell you what it was is it looked like a stick dog. It had no skin or hair just sticks shaped into a dog about 2 foot tall,and no I am not crazy!Now get this a friend of mine just moved here and 2 weeks ago we were coming home from town and it was dark as we were talking I was listening and looking at her when all at onced she hit her brakes and said oh my God I thought she almost hit a deer and she said no it was something that leaped across the road so fast that all she could tell was it was made of sticks. I then told her what had happened to me just a year back. Then I seen on my pc that somewhere in another state a party was ran out from what appeared to be stick people. Now I am a true believer I saw what I saw. I am 56 years old and have no reason to tell such childish stories.I would love to hear if others may have seen stick objects no matter what their shape was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/20/03 21:53|Chicago (over Lake Michigan)|IL|Teardrop|At least two minutes|a teardrop or fireball shaped object that hung in the sky; the object showed up on a long-exposure photograph.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29359.html|115|ndxe200306| a teardrop or fireball shaped object that hung in the sky; the object showed up on a long-exposure photograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my roof taking long exposure photographs of the city, facing east.  I didn&#39;t see the object in the sky at the time, but when I looked at the photos afterwards there was a curious, bright shape in the sky, shaped I suppose like a teardrop.  Using a long exposure soaks up whatever light is in the sky, even stuff you don&#39;t see with the naked eye.  For example, keeping the shutter open for ten seconds over a solid blue sky could reveal distinct, clear clouds once the photograph is developed (or you view the digital photos, such as mine).  The object was definitely stationary because otherwise it would have been streaked.  It wasn&#39;t a reflection or something stuck on the lens because it would have shown up in other pictures.  Also, as the position of the camera changed, the object remained in the same place.  There&#39;s a small, very faint, circle of light surrounding it.  So there&#39;s no question that it was something in the sky and not a glitch with the camera.  I guess it&#39;s a UFO in the literal sense of the word: it&#39;s an object, it&#39;s in the sky, and heck if I can identify it!<n>

At about 9:00 PM CDT, we went &gt; out to look for stars. We were looking in the direction of Dodd&#39;s &gt; Camp on Lake of the Ozarks, when I noticed movement on the eastern &gt; horizon. I looked at it, and there was a black disc, which looked &gt; like it was spining very fast, just below the clouds. It must have &gt; been very large, because it was still three-quarters the size of an actual &gt; saucer. I had the girl I as babysitting look up, and we watched as it &gt; flew from east to west. When it got to a certain point on the &gt; horizon, it lifted over the clouds and kept going until it got too &gt; small to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt; This isn&#39;t the first time they have heard from people in that area of &gt; strange things in the sky.

There is so much construction (and of course NO ONE WORKING at the time) taking place on the bridge that they have lowered the speed limits on the bridge.  I was just getting across the bridge and was looking around towards the east where the Kone tower is and I saw the small elongated upside down triangle shaped object (looked like the size of small black plastic office garbage can turned to the narrow side) just floating there just 10 feet off the bridge on the other side to the east.  I slowed WAY down to about 15MPH so I could take a good look at it.  It was a clear blue sky and no planes, helicopters, birds, no noise....nothing else in the sky near where I was looking.  I should mention that I wasn&#39;t look up I was looking almost straight out of my car window at it.  For the most part it was dark in color but reflecting some light towards me since the sun was going down in the west.  I was totally excited because first of all I have heard of things just like this but never seen one till now and second it was only about 40 feet from my car during the day light.  No strange lights in the sky with this one. It was an actual object there that wasn&#39;t there when I went back 2 minutes later.  I ride this bridge every single day (back and forth) so I&#39;m very familiar with what is going on.  There were no lights on it but there was something strange on it.  At the very top of the upside down triangle it had what looked like a round dish shape thing.  I stared at it for about 20 seconds total before the cars behind me started to approach.  You can&#39;t stop on the bridge since it&#39;s only one lane now with all the construction going on.  I watched it in my side view mirror as it continued to levitate there about 10 feet off the side of the bridge.  I took the first exit and headed down to the Kone tower which is on the east side of the bridge to see if I could find it again.  After the exit I lost sight of it an! d never saw it again.  I&#39;m not sure how long it was there but I do know that I got a really good look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a student, who is engaged in a demanding course in the hard sciences.

However, it turned to the north quite rapidly to avoid the cross over.  I live in the country so I have a pretty good view of the sky and there was no moon last night.  But on almost any given night I can go outside and see at least one of these things.  Also we seen three meteors, one of which was guite a show!<n>

The thing is static, stagnent without any movement (I knew it is static because when I drove closer, I had to shift my head a little bit).  It is so quiet that if there was no light from it, you wouldn&#39;t know it is there.  My car radio was till on so it looks like that thing was shut down and resting there and wait for sky turning clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The road is not busy at all but I did see other cars.  Please post your sighting if you drove by on Wiehle and spotted it.  I just want to get another confirmation.  There are some townhouses right below that thing and people who live there might see it too.  Please post your sighting so that I know I am not the only one who saw the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BTW, I was exciting, scared and afraid that they will lift me up, capture me, probe me and even do a abduction...  That is why I didn&#39;t keep watching it...  But anyway, I was convinced that there are something out there!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects not to identify self.

In two places on this ride, I saw a glowing yellow sphere with what looked to be darker rings around it right about the line of trees.  It was about half the size of the moon and seemed to be staying stationary.  I ran home to get my video camera and went back to one of the locations from which I observed this UFO.  I parked my car and grabbed my camera.  I spotted the craft in the sky, and I hit the switch to turn on my video camera.  Almost simultaneously, the yellow sphere began to move west in the sky, before I could capture any footage of it.  I frantically went to the other location where I had seen it, but it was no longer in sight.  There were no other higher vantage points in the area that I could try to again spot the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took my dog outside to go to the toilet and I noticed what at first looked like a bright star. But as I looked at it I noticed that it was changing colours, red, blue yellow and a green. I was freaked by it so I got my neigh bour to come out and have a look. He had no Idea what it was either.It was just hovering in the distance. I came in to try and find some one to contact to get a idea on what it was and got a phone no. for ufo sightings but I just got a message, so I decided to get on here to see what I can find out. I went back outside after ringing the number and I just stood there and watched it and then it just vanished. It didn&#39;t fly away or anything it just went black. I&#39;m confussed maybe you can help me, I&#39;m not sure.<n>

I would say for a few seconds. it was proabably a cross between lime green and jungle green.

They were above the clouds in the night sky. I need to know the cloud ceiling to givr the objets hight. As I was watching the objects they kept turning into themself and making high degree turns. Than three objects came away from the main group avd flew directly west staying in a tringal formation. Thats when I knew that they were not night time birds. They all had the same color and shined the same way. They had a dimond shape and were bright white. In the main group there could have been upto 20-25. My friend saw objects break away and fly south over the Gulf of Mexice\o but I did not see this as I keep my eyes on the main group. you can call me if you have any questions my name is ((name and phone number deleted))<n>

It hovered over the water with the reflection of the light on the water. then it shot straight up at a speed that was so fast it scared me.It had no noise at all. Silent!!

It happened and as the new TV series says, &#34;I KNOW WHAT I SAW,&#34; and I don’t care if you believe or not! Story:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon arriving home from work one day in June of 2003 at 6:15 pm or so, our biggest cat (Midnight) was wanting out and was standing by the back door.  I opened the door . . . my next recollection was of looking up and seeing a rectangle dark space with three pipes attached beside it that were approximately three feet long and reattaching to an object, and I thought; what the heck! My field of vision expanded and I saw a ship hovering above my back patio just missing the top of our mimosa tree in the back yard.  The object was approximately 30 feet by 30 feet but was not a silver disk, the front (that was the side that was forward when object moved to the west, then zoomed off, I assume it was the front) was over the covered patio to the west of the open patio 5 feet and covered the length of the open patio plus 5 feet or so (just measured area with tape measure 30ft x 30ft).  This object had attachments, plates and bolt, and there were antennas sticking forward in the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stood there I heard a low hum, almost too low to hear, resonated from the object and it started to move slowly to the west, I walked east into the back yard to get a better look.  Object had three equal rectangle areas on back that glowed red, but I felt no heat and should of, as I was only 20 feet below the object.   The object maneuvered around the neighbors’ tree (neighbor west of house) then zoom disappeared into a dot then gone.  I went into the house and called my husband immediately it was now 9:00pm or so.   Missing time approximately 3 hours<n>

After the train had passed, I looked to the North and seen a silver object hovering above what I beleve is Great Lakes Steel. It appeared to have a greyish fuzz of haze around it. We observed it for about 5-10 minutes, then it seemed to just fade away. We are both students, 16 and 17 years old. I beleve in UFO&#39;s, but my friend is a bit more skeptic. We thought it might of been a weather balloon, but with the haze around it and the way it faded away caused us to think otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from the same witness.

In between the flashes of the lightning, we were looking at all the stars.  At the same time be both pointed out what at first looked exactly like a star, but this bright object was moving at a constant rate of speed.  I thought at first that it was a jet, but it was much too high in the sky to be so. It traveled from north to south and was not blinking like lights on an airplane would be. The object looked exactly like the other stars we were gazing upon.  We watched this object travel through the sky - it did not appear to increase nor decrease its speed - until it faded from our view as it came within proximity of another star still well above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It&#39;s 70 F degrees, clear skies with a few thin clouds.  To the western sky is a very bright star low in the horizon.  It&#39;s about 15 degrees or so.  Worland is located approximately 44 degrees North Latitude and 108 degrees West Longitude.  I&#39;m 5 miles north on Wyo. Hwy. 433: West River Road.  The bright star is due west.  About 1/2 degree above and perhaps 3 degrees south of this star, I saw a small point of light moving from South to North.  I assumed it was a satellite until it grew in brightness.  I thought it might be a plane except there were no flashing lights and only the one point of light.  It grew in brightness to twice that of the star which is about as bright as Venus would be.  I thought it might be a plane turning towards me however it continued in a straight line to the north.  At about the 2/3 point of it&#39;s arch which covered about the span of one hand at arms length, it reached its maximum brightness and then faded back to a dim point of light before disapearing.  The event lasted about 15 seconds.  As for my background, I&#39;m retired Air Force and flew in B-52G&#39;s.  I&#39;m also a private pilot (licensed in the early &#39;70&#39;s).  This was not a plane.  It was also not a meteor.  The duration and relative slow speed of the sighting was without any &#34;tail&#34; of any kind.  It was simply a dim spot of light that suddenly grew in intensity and then deminished.  If you have questions, please contact me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Well, I&#39;m the kind of person that could go either way in believing about extraterrestrials visiting earth. I have a wonderfully vivid and creative imagination and this subject is very exciting indeed. One afternoon on my way back into Austin, Texas, with a friend of mine I happened to look in the sky and noticed a black helicopter going by. This is of interest to me because I know this fellow who believes in conspiracies and what not and as a kind of joke I took a photo of the black helicopter, to light the fire underneath my friends ass so to speak. (I used a canon powershot S200 digital camera). Anyway when I got home and downloaded it I noticed a shiny silver metal object way above the black helicopter. It wasn&#39;t until I read this article &#34;Daylight Photos of UfO&#39;s&#34; that I took my very own picture a little more seriously, I really would like to have someone outside of my circle of friends and family to see them and tell me what they think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took this picture on the 17 of June this year around 8:00 pm while traveling down the Devil&#39;s backbone (hwy 337 I believe) on the SouthWest side of Canyon Lake (in between San Antonio and Austin). It sure does look alot like the ones on the web site. I did take these pictures from a vehicle and the window was rolled up, as far as I can tell there was no object on the window itself to cause this type of reflection and I had no need of a flash so none was used. post the picture if you&#39;d like but I&#39;d like to remain anonymous. Write back with your comments if time permits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photo of this object can be found at: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/united_states_ufo_reports.htm  Thanks, Personal Information deleted by HBCC UFO)  I would like to extend my thanks to the person you sent in the photo and story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm http://www.geocities.com/hbccufo/home.html<n>

I ran outside and saw a light move quickly from N to S running parallel with the Big Dippers&#39; handle. After about 20 seconds it disappeared, in that time span it had moved nearly the lenght of the visable sky from N to S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About that same time I spotted another light moving S to N at about the same speed in the eastern sky about 30 degrees east of the first light, this light disappeared behind some high clouds and I lost track of it, less then a minute later I saw another light move very quickly from W to E but also lost it in high clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I thought first was a meteor shower was certainly not that ! Neither was it commercial aircraft because there was atleast 4 in that time period flying E to W to land at either St Paul Holman field or MSP and they very easy to see and follow because River Falls is in a landing corridor for both airports, although the jets all usually  fairly high up yet when they pass overhead. I can get three others to confirm this and probably much more because they have been watching this for several nights now! To me it seemed like these lights were on &#34;patrol&#34; for something being there were many more than the three I clearly saw, dozens have been seen by two of our residents, I plan on watching atleast 2 more hours tonight and then again tomorrow!<n>

I can further assure you that I am of a sound mind, have never been in trouble with the law, and do not have the imagination to cook up a story like this. I rarely drink alcohol and was not drinking at this time. The only skeptism that there could be about me is that I do have an interest in extra terrestrials ,as I have had many dreams of them recently. THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE DREAMS.  I have not told this experience to anyone and I do not seek any attention or money.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived in this small Farm house, surrounded by open fields, for seven years and have lived within a half-mile of this farm my entire life.  I am extremely familiar with this location and what the sky looks like at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two days ago, sometime after  11:pm. I went to the bedroom to prepare for bed. all the lights in the home were turned off.  As soon as i entered the room I instantly noticed a VERY BRIGHT pure white ball in the eastern sky outside the window.  i went directly to the window and watched as it seemed to &#34;bounce&#34; and move slightly. I looked up at the stars and looked back at it but it seemed much too bright and much too close to the ground to be a star. I kept watching it and every time I started to think of some sort of an explanation, it would immediately do something that would rule that explanation out.  For instance, I would think it was a star and it would begin to move a little bit more. I would think maybe it&#39;s a plane, and it would bounce directly up, then drop down. I thought maybe an erratic helicopter pilot but then it  dropped down from side to side like paper in the wind. after evrything it did, it would always go back to it&#39;s original position. Grasping for a more broad explanation I thought maybe someone was up in a silo on some nearby  farm with a flashlight  or something. it changed color.  maybe there was some possible reflection from something or some kind of atmospheric phenonmnon. It was really hard to tell how far away it was. I thought to myself  &#34;i&#39;ve been waiting to see a ufo, but you&#39;re gonna have to do better than that!&#34; Before I finished my thought, A GIANT YELLOW BALL appeared INSTANTLY out the window, it was to the right of the first object. It was MUCH CLOSER. It had rays of yellow light emitting from it. the rays waved like fire but were exactly the same tone and color as the object. Sharp lines and triangles. This was the real deal. this was actually happening. I felt excited and amazed as the object glowed and the rays made beautiful patterns in the sky. I am certain that it was putting on a show for me.  I am certain that it knew i was looking at it and I felt them looking at me. I could hardly look away as it was very beautiful and very mesmorizing. I looked briefly at th! e first object which was in exactly the same spot as before, only now the ground underneath it was illuminated like daytime. there was no streaks of light or rays comming down. just the light in the sky and the lit up circle in the field, nothing between them. There were some sounds from the back door of the house but I was unable to pay attention. looking at the second object and realizing that it was looking / communicating with me, I began to get frightened. It started to move like  &#34; S &#34; and when it came around the second turn it came directly at me very very fast. My heart was pounding. I thought &#34;st  st st st st stop!&#34; and before i finished my thought it stopped. i started to tell it that i was scared.  the rays of the object retracted. i said i&#39;m sorry but im not ready for this yet. it turned blue. i may have had another thought, im not sure what but then the object turned deep red for a moment then back to yellow and slowly moved outside the view of the window. i ran to the other window where it should have been but could not see anything.  Looking out the first window I saw the first object was still there. I ran out of the room to peer out other windows but found nothing. I ran back to my bedroom to the first object but it was gone. I looked at the clock but i just can&#39;t remember what time it ended, nor do I recall exactly what time it bagan. I feel like it happened somtime after 11pm. I will say that the object was friendly and pleasant. it was very beautiful and i felt somehow like i had just turned away an old friend. They seemed so kind and they made me feel so special that i really feel guilty after asking it to leave.  Another strange thought is that I kept expecting them to return last night. Even though they didn&#39;t. i really feel like they know who i am,  and will return for another visit. I hope to be more brave next time. I miss them.<n>
6/16/03 23:05|Vancouver (Canada)|BC|Light|12 seconds|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  I saw a single blue light traveling very slow towards the east|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29284.html|146|ndxe200306| I think I saw a UFO over Vancouver city on June 16th at 11:05 p.m. I came home from work and was closing my blinds on my window that faces North and I saw a single blue light traveling very slow towards the east. Then it got slower and slower, almost a complete stop, that&#39;s when I opened my window to see if I could hear any sound and I couldn&#39;t. Then it flashed a big bright white, yellowish light and made a sharp left turn and moved faster towards the North, the light fading as it moved. I lost sight of it over the high buildings in the downtown area. Do you know of any aircraft that has this kind of lighting and can move like that? I would appreciate any information that you might have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks  &#34;Addition Information&#34;  I should tell you that I first spotted it when I was in a taxi cab on my way home from work.  I just glance up and saw this blue light and before I could take a better look we took a turn and It was above us so the roof of the cab blocked the view. It was just above Granville bridge as high as a small plane that&#39;s why I took it to be a plane and didn&#39;t think about again until I came home and saw it again through my window and it was moving from the west going towards the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. I remember really taking a good look at this light moving and trying to make out any shape against the dark sky and thought that I did see something besides this light like a shape but couldn&#39;t make it out and it also seemed to have a very tiny faint light in front of the blue light but I&#39;m not sure about that  I would say I watched it for about 7 seconds before it turned bright and turned, then another 5 seconds watching it fade and move towards the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. Yes I would say pea size when blue but it expanded when it flashed bright and at that time it would be dime size and then back to pea size when it move away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. Altitude would be the same as a small plane. The same altitude of the planes when the Symphony of fireworks are here. Ten thousand feet?  5.  No one else was with me in my apartment at the time and when I was in the cab I didn&#39;t ask the cab driver to look because he was driving and I thought it was a plane. Surely someone else in the downtown area saw it too. People on their balconies facing it would see it but would they say report it? I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for sharing the report with NUFORC.

6/16/03 17:00|Armidale (Australi)||Disk|20 minutes|A Disk/cigar shaped object ,100m in lenght , bright orange to silver in colour, splits into 2 craft then reforms as one.|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38413.html|148|ndxe200306| A Disk/cigar shaped object ,100m in lenght , bright orange to silver in colour, splits into 2 craft then reforms as one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had been having some spectacular sunsets leading up to my recent sighting. This is my sixth to date. I was watching the sun set at 5pm. It had just set below the horizon and the sky was another painted masterpiece! Looking west from my house I can see the golf course and Airport on the hill. I suddenly noticed what I though at first was a meteor just right of the airport about 500m. It looked like a fireball. This object was hovering at tree level. When I realised that this was no meteor I grabbed my binoculars for a better look. Apon viewing the craft I was literally numb with shock. Then an amazing adrenalin rush took over.  The craft was huge. I estimate about 80/100m in length. It was shaped like a saucer but more cigar shaped. It was fluctuating between a whitish silver and the most amazing intense orange. Almost like a colour that I have never seen before (if that makes sense). It also had this strange shimmering effect, abit like heatwaves on the road. This part is hard to explain...... The craft appeared to be surrounded by what looked like a cloud.  The only way to explain it is to say, to me, it was a hole or a tear in space-time-reality and this object had sorta popped in for a look! I found this really hard to comprehend. I winessed something they don&#39;t teach us in science. The object suddenly began to move very slowly to the north still above tree level. About 10 minutes into the sighting the craft split into 2 objects. The both remained side by side for about 30 seconds and then joined as one again. I witnessed to object for about 15-20 minutes all up before it drifted behind a mountain and I lost sight of it. During the sighting I called a friend who has a video camera. Unfortunately due to the geography he couldn&#39;t see the craft. I have spoken to several people including a helicopter pilot who was working at the airport that day, but no one saw it. During the sighting I also observed 2 small aircraft fly near the object and land at the airport. I also got this sensation that it was showing itself to me, and me only!<n>

Yesterday June 16/13 I saw an object in the sky, it looked about 350 ft in the air.  Flew directly over head in one direction toward Lake St Clair Northbound with out any sound. I got a very good look at it.  It was like a multi-Triangular rectangle, it rolled in an orbit as it floated across the sky.  It was blueish purples and reds and greens reflecting on these multi triangle panels and strange lights on what looked like a panel. I was the size of a small car.  It looked like it was changing shape but not so, it was due to it rolling like it was.  It was like multiple triangles put together forming an odd looking rectangle.  It lasted too short of a time and I had my camera packed away...while riding my bike through the nature trail.  Just my luck… But I know what I saw.<n>

I, too, heard very little noise, nothing loud enough to be a jet engine.  I even checked out some air force sites, and told myself it must have been one of their low-flying bombers like the B1B Bomber.  We have several air bases in a 100 mile radius.  It was broad daylight on a sunny day around 2pm.  When I read the account of the sighting featured on your website, I realized that I saw the same object as this person in Trenton.  It flew very slowly and I remember the shape was similar to your graphic on the site, maybe a little longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thought I post this - maybe the person who posted the other siting will see it.<n>

When I awoke I got up to retire to my bed. It was about 3 am. I went to the front door to close it and saw a very bright light up and in front of me. My front door faces south. It was amber colored and I could not see any stars. It did not appear to be moving and my first thought was that it could be the hospital helicoptor however there was no noise. I watched for a few minutes and it seemed to get slightly brighter and I still could not identify it. I grabbed my digital camera and am now embarrassed to admit I did not feel comfortable stepping outdoors to get the photo. I took the photo through the screen door. I quickly enlarged the photo on the tiny camera screen and was still unable to identify what I was looking at. As I prepared to take another photo the bright light disappeared. It was as if someone had turned off a light switch. This experience has nagged at my brain since as I have not been able to think of a reasonable explanation. I will send the photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My younger brother and my self were down by the water, and we were talking and looking at the stars, when I noticed a green diamond shaped something.  It was clearly in the atmosphere but so far off that it was like looking at a star.  It glowed so bright and beautiful that it could not have been a star.  The green looked almost like you could touch it, like it was living.  I swear on everything this is not a joke.  In almost no time it was gone. I looked over to ask my brother if he seen it also and he said yeah, and in that moment, I looked back to where I saw it and it was gone. My brother never looked away, and when I asked him where it went, all he said was its gone, it’s gone. The first thing we both declared before we even debated it was I think that was a U.F.O.  We never told anyone but he will vouch for what we saw with out a doubt. I swear though, we forgot as soon as we walked away from that spot, because to this day, we didn’t go back to camp and say a word to anyone, not because we where afraid.  It was as if it hadn’t happened.  You don’t forget the adrenaline rush or excitement from the experience though.  I am not sure what it was but it was there and ill never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I am a former U.S. Infantry officer, and 3,000 hour commercial pilot.  We are in the habit of sitting on our roof at night talking and looking at the sky- it&#39;s cooler &amp; breezier up there, and less buggy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3 months ago we had an interesting experience that I&#39;d like you to comment on, if possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 11 p.m. on a clear night, we both became aware, simultaneously, of 3 ruby-red lights, bright and distinctly visible, like car tail-lights or red aircraft nav lights, approaching us from south to north, right to left as we viewed them, in a symmetric V formation, one leading and two trailing. After 3 seconds of this motion, the 3 lights diverged, the lead light continuing straight, each of the trailing lights turning 90 degrees away from the original direction of motion. The lights passed more or less overhead as they made this divergence, then they didn&#39;t fade away into the distance but simply vanished out of sight in about  2 seconds. Literally, like poof, they&#39;re gone. It was stunning!  It was a clear night with no other air traffic. The experience lasted 5 seconds, and we both subsequently agreed that we had observed exactly the same phenomenon. There was absolutely no sound, and no other lights visible. There was no way of judging altitude of the lights, but we had the &#34;impression&#34; that they were several thousand feet above sea level, and that the rate of movement must have been extremely rapid. I have seen    F-4s fly directly overhead, and have observed a very large number of other aircraft movement over the years, and I can tell you without hesitation that those 3 lights were moving significantly faster than any aircraft in my experience, and in complete silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you care to comment, I&#39;m curious if this account sounds familiar to you, which is to ask, have other people witnessed anything similar? And what do you suppose those bright red lights were attached to??  Thanks, and cheers!

While a family was laying out in their backyard. The objects were flying in military type order, side by side, with one slighty ahead of the other. The colors were green and slightly off red(pinkish). The colors were off because they looked like a mist or fog was moving with them covering each up. The speed of these crafts flying over must of been fast(between 3-5 seconds). Father estimated them at at between 1000-1500 mph(comparing them with jets that usually fly over from Seattle). The heighth of these objects was hard to estimate but we could tell they were below the stars out because it was perfectly clear out. The size of these crafts was estimated at being larger than a football field.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I immediately saw a VERY bright white light in the sky left of me with a pointy tail following it that was an electric blue color (like a blue colored flame from a gas stove). I couldnt help but follow the the bright white light with my eyes that went straight across the sky in front of me from left to right. There was no angle to its flying. No upward direction, no downward direction-just straight across the sky PERFECTLY from left to right. There was no smoke behind its blue tail. Then in a split second I lost sight of it behind a VERY large tree in my yard. My first thoughts were &#34;Wait! what are you?!&#34; I ran behind my large tree to see if I could still see the bright white light with the electric blue tail but it was completely gone. During this whole time there was no sound when I saw this bright white light fly across the sky in front of me. After I lost sight of it I looked straight up and saw a large jet flying in the Eastern direction and I could just barely hear its engine sound soaring through the skies. I immediately ran inside the house to tell my husband. He unfortunately did not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was easily seen with the unaided eye moving exactly from east to west at a fairly fast clip it was out of my sight within a few seconds.  It was shaped cicular, white-grey coloring.  It had no lights, no wings, and no noise. There was no one else in my yard other than me observing this object. I would guess it was maybe 1000-1500 feet up? Lighted objects have also been recently reported on the local news over this area. I might also add that this same object or at least one similar was again observed by myself in the back yard around 10 pm local time in the month of Septemer of this year as I was seting up my telescope to observe Mars. That object had a definte black bottom and a whitish top, moving fast and quiet, exactly from north to south. It exhibited simlar charactistics in stucture and altitude as the first did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Moving south to north<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside after the evening news and was enjoying the cool breeze, while looking up at the Big Dipper I noticed what I thought was a plane, since Love Field and DFW Airport are north of Waxahachie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It only took a second to realize this thing was MOVING FAST. To get a better look I shielded my eyes and looked ahead of it a bit. I don&#39;t wear glasses so there was no reflection. The object was moving from south to north and I noticed a faint blue crescent or what may have been lights around the leading edge and sides with a faint yellowish circle in what would appear to be the middle. From the few seconds that I saw this I can only estimate that it was traveling at approximately 1200 to 1500 miles per hour. Estimated altitude is rough to even estimate but I would guess it was around 10,000 to 15,000 feet. It crossed roughly 30% of the sky in about 3 to 4 seconds. What I waited for after it went out of sight was the noise of it&#39;s engines. There was none. It was absolutely silent, and there wasn&#39;t any other aircraft in the area at the time that it went overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it sounds a little nuts, it sure does to me, but I grew up around the airline industry. My father was a dispatcher for Braniff for decades and I practically cut my teeth with him when he took with him when he went out to different stations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing is is that I can&#39;t get it out of my head. I can&#39;t identify it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Dallas Fort Worth Airport Information line and they referred me to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The control tower at DFW Airport, or Love Field also had to have seen this on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s why I called them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please contact me<n>

We were sitting on the deck facing south when an object drifted across our field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled from east to west, slowly, not changing speed, or direction of travel, remaining in a straight line. This was easy to determine as it moved in a direct line above the utility wires in the alley, in front of us. It was approximately  twenty degrees directly above the horizon. I could not say how far away or how large the object was. There was absolutely no sound coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Normally, when one of us located a satellite - we would call out that one had been discovered one and point directly above us to show the others where it was.  Most of the satellites were moving in a south to north or north to south trajectory.  However, when we saw this object, nobody said a word.  All of us saw it at once, not like the satellites, when the others would sometimes have problems finding it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of us picked it up at the same time, which was strange because normally we were straining our necks to look straight up,  not directly in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object crossed us from left to right, each of us turned our heads in unison as it passed.  Shocked, somebody said, &#34;Did you see that?&#34;,  &#34;Yeah, what was it?&#34;,  &#34;I have no idea.&#34;  Now, the hard part.  I have seen plenty of photos and video of strange objects in the sky before.  This was completely different from anything I had seen documented before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not have what could be considered an straight edge outline.  I know this sounds weird but,  the only thing I think of that would describe it - is either a giant Amoeba or Jellyfish.  It appeared gelatinous in form.  The object appeared transparent in color because it seemed like you could &#34;see through it&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If that is not strange enough,  the object had what I can only describe as five very dim lights emitting inside of it.  These were not random lights.  Three of them were vertical, in a perfectly straight line, close together.   The other two were horizontal behind the vertical lights.  The best way I can describe it is - imagine a capital letter &#34;T&#34; laying on it&#39;s side, with the top or the &#34;cross&#34; of the &#34;T&#34; in the lead.    The lights did not move -  nor did they twinkle or change color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never observed anything like that before, neither have my friend and his son. Of us three, I am the only believer of &#34;other craft&#34; but, that night we all agree that we all saw something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never knew who I could tell this to till I became a fan of George Noory and listened to Mr. Davenport on his show several times over the years since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It startled me because i realise that it wasnt more than a few hundred meetres ahead of me, so i frose and just stared at it. trying to take it all in... definately wasnt an aircraft. it was probaly a similar size to a small jet or a large single prop type plane. luckily i had my camera in my pocket, while i was trying to turn it on. i took my eyes off the thing for only a second. and then it was gone! completely dissapeard. at the rate it was moving, it couldnt have moved off into the horison that fast. so i presume that it was one of the following. wasnt a materal object, turned out all its &#39;lights&#39;, i was simply hallucinating (even though i was completely sober), or perhaps it went to ludicrous speed and went over the horison in 2 seconds flat. this is the second UFO that ive seen in my local area, myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Science Major, SKEPTIC|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42179.html|166|ndxe200306| Another (belated but discovered) Bonaroo witness. Science Major, SKEPTIC<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve found this place! I was also at the second bonaroo music festival.  After reading the other testimony, my stomach has been shaking and I am estatic to realize that no one had slipped me LSD or anything that made both me and my other friend question WHAT THE HELL THE GREEN ELLIPSE WAS????!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our personal explination at the time (Still coherent, but a bit intoxicated from Jack Daniels and Coca- Cola and cigarettes, period. PERIOD.) was that if there were aliens that were studying humans, a change in poulation density from the area of Manchester, which is a farm/field for 51.5 weeks out of the year, would interest a reasearcher. Seriously, 100,000 people assemble for 3 days? I&#39;d like to study that kind of population spike- something was happening...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, being a HUMUNGOUS skeptic about the situation- in all honesty, it looked like the largest, luminous, ominous kite I&#39;ve ever seen;  If the thing was a kite, it must have been flying outside of the entire venue- I would have been able to see some kind of string to support a large craft like the one in question, or a quick reflection streak of light that would have caught my eye; nothing though. I can&#39;t remember if it was windy in the first place...  It hovered very slowly as we almost forgot about the music and speculated, questioned, feared, and awed at what the hell this glowing green hovering object&#39;s purpose, orgin, and location were. Everyone else in our proximity were really intoxicated and were useless to get to pay attention...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I take everything with a grain of salt. My friend swears that it was a UFO; I am personally indifferent. it really does make sense for the &#34;aliens&#34; to study a population spike like a huge music festival, given that there are aliens with green ellipse-shaped craft that moves like a kite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Honestly, it was truly un-conventional, unidentified, flying, and a tangible object. I can only pray to have my entire reality questioned like this again.  Unbelieveable.  I will go under polygraph any time, any day. I want to believe. I wanted to find out what that object was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It dissappeared after an hour of noticing it though. Grrrrr....<n>

I made a reference to another incident that I had when I lived in Virginia Beach.  I was looking through your posts to see if I saw anything that was similar to what I saw and found report:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred : 6/15/2003 19:00 (Entered as : 06/15/03 19:00)<n> <n><n> Reported: 4/1/2010 9:00:03 PM 21:00<n> <n><n> Posted: 4/13/2010<n> <n><n> Location: Virginia Beach, VA<n> <n><n> Shape: Fireball<n> <n><n> Duration:3-5 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report describes exactly what I saw other than the changing colors. I lived right off of Kempsville Road which intersects Indian River.  If this person was near this intersection, then I think we were possibly viewing the same event.  I know that the front of my home faced the direction of the intersection of Indian River/Kempsville Road.  If they were observing this from facing the driection of Centerville Tpk, then I know this has to be the same incident. I know that the weather was warm outside and it was late evening right about when the sun was about an hour from full set. Whatever I saw made the same irregular movements...up/down...left/right...and also had that faint trail of light that followed it.  (There was a small tornado in Kempsriver Shopping Center that is right at the intersection of Indian River Road and Kempsville Road.  I was on my front porch when this tornado had formed and could see it clearing forming in the sky from my porch so I know that it is ! very well possible that this person, if they were facing toward my home at that time could see what I was seeing....Facing my house, the incident took place to the left of my house.  If the person who reported this was traveling on Indian River traveling towards Kempsville, then they were facing toward my home.<n>

We were stopped at a left turn signal on Indian River Rd.  While we were waiting for the light to change out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright circular object, at first i thought it was the full moon, but it was not the moon.  I looked at the object and I was glowing bright white to orange to redish colors, almost as if it was on fire.  There was also a tail somewhat like a comet&#39;s tail coming of of the back of it.  The way this object moved though could not have been a comet, or a rocket.  My dad was watching it as well once I pointed it out to him.  He is a high level navy Senior Cheif and now works in a control tower for a nearby base.  The object sometimes just floated, there seemed to be no sound whatsoever, and then it would make complex movements left to right, diagnoly, straight down, up, any way it wanted.  This lasted about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the car in front of us and noticed the couple in the car were also pointing to the object in the sky.  Soon after the object made some more maneuvers.  Then as if having the ability to accelerate to what I believe to be the speed of light, the orb, craft, object whatever it may have been.  Shot off at an amazing speed and in a matter of 1-2 seconds completely disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This image has stuck in my head ever since and I dont think I will ever get an explanation for what we saw that night.  My father contacted Langley to see if any launches were scheduled for that day and there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father works with many top officials now that he is retired and now a civilian working on base in the control tower.  He knows what we saw that night was nothing at least in military arsenal that has been released.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This area has seen many sighting since then...  Including the lights and explosion seen and felt over va / nc in the last couple months or so.<n>

The day was sunny, cool (about 60 degrees), and not a cloud in the bright blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we arrived on scene, a local resident pointed to the sky approx 30 degrees up off the horizon, approx 5 miles away (estimations), there was a silver ball slowly moving across the skyline.   As we observed the object, the resident shouted &#34;No s(*%, a real UFO&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We video taped the object for approx 15 to 20 minutes before disappearing over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most surprising observations were the inexplicable ability of this object to change shapes from circular to diamond, and back again.  It appeared to vibrate and blur its borders while conducting these shape changes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The absolute strangest observation was my attempt to zoom in on the object where I observed symetrical smaller diamond shaped patterns in &#34;the hull&#34; (for lack of a better term) but the object immediately speed out of view in a looped, non-linear manner when I apparently was getting too much detail on the cam-corder.  Most unusual.  I still have the video tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object is not anything conventional or seen before; not an airplane, no propeller, no &#34;nose&#34; or &#34;bill&#34; or &#34;tail&#34;.   We did not shoot the object because we thought this was potentially some secret project with humans aboard.  The incident is documented and witnesses are available.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never been visited since; even though I wish I would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested additional reports from the Chief of Police, and from the other witnesses, as well.  Also, we have requested a copy of any police report that may have been generated by the incident, as well as permission to view, and possibly post, the video tape that apparently was made.

Me EX Airforce!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Near the graveyard across from dennis the menace park while driving I looked to the left across the graveyard through the tree&#39;s and noticed this object that looked in the shape of a blimp. It was a clear day, the heat was reflecting off the object, no writing on the object and it was not moving it appeared. I was trying to look while I was driving but started to go off the road so I turned right into the dennis the menace park so I could turn around and drive into the grave yard (took about 10 seconds) when I got into the graveyard I could not find anything in the sky (there were no clouds) if it were a blimp it could not have went out of view that quickly. I work for the government and was in the Airforce always lived near airports and never believed about UFO&#39;s but this was definately strange. Well about a year later I was talking to a friend and the subject came up of UFO&#39;s and I mentioned it to him and he told me that another friend of his told him of the day he was working in the baseball field at Dennis the Menace park and thought he saw a UFO. My friend couldn&#39;t believe two simarlar stories from two different people who don&#39;t know each other happening at the same place and probably around the same time. He said he wants me to meet his friend so we can go over our accounts. Someday soon I&#39;m planning on doing that. The sight I saw seems to be burned in my mind. The thing that stood out is how still it was and the heatwaves relecting off. It gave me an eeiry feeling after the sighting. The object looked metallic greyish/silverish, the heat reflecting off really made it stand out to me. It was on my mind so I thought I would report it now. Unfortunately I don&#39;t have a specific date but I know it was about three to three and a half years ago. I should of wrote everything down then. Hey, working for the government I didn&#39;t think I wanted to go around talking about possibly seeing a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

It is diamond,( or square on a half turn) bright white or silverish in color,with a real pattern to it. Something like four bars with four dots on all four corners and illumination in the middle. Im not sure what it is.After asking co-workers who have dealt with electrical occurances for the past 20yrs, figured out that this was nothing electrical related as far as they were concened or have ever heard of.I actually have the image clear as day printed in color, as well on disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The air was fresh and the animals were just starting to wake. Life as usual began with the daily choors nothing to extraordinary but not this morning. This event did not last very long so I will get straight to the point. In the corner of my eye as I was in the barn I saw some kind of craft, but not taking much notice I continued my job. What really got my attention was the high pitched noise that followed. I came out of the barn to investigate the noise and there it was. About 100m away the craft I had seen before, A perfectly shaped egg or sphere. The craft had no markings, It was just a white shpere but it did make a ear peercing screech. The craft remained at that distance for a few minutes before moving off slowing over the hills to the east. I was always a sceptic about whether other life existed but now I know for sure. That craft never returned but I hope one day that it does as I was not afraid but truley inspired.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At the time, and at no point during that day were we under the influence of any mind altering drug.  It was a clear night and we were sitting outside our tent looking at the stars.  I was looking at one area of the sky and I thought I saw a star move.  I asked my girlfriend if she saw the same thing I did.  She saw it as well.  The &#34;star&#34; dipped and began to move across the sky and do loops and twists.  At times it would drop down and the shoot back up and dart across the sky.  We watched this for about 45 minutes, then my girlfriend wanted to go to sleep so I went into the tent with her.  We couldn&#39;t have been the only ones who saw the object, as the festival had over 80,000 people there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I&#39;ve been an avid aircraft enthusiast for many years and I can tell you this thing was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate the altitude at between 80,000 and 100,000 ft OR HIGHER!. My reason for this estimate is the fact that this craft made virtually no sound and that I could see a contrail in dashes. It appeared that the craft was so high that its contrail was being illuminated by the SUN. I feel that this craft was right on the edge of the terminator from its location. The contrail seemed to have an even pulse. Also the aircraft was heading Due North (Not your typical satellite path). I could ascertain this from the fact that I can see the Big and Little dipper clearly from the intersection of streets I live on. I estimate the craft crossed approximately 30° of sky in approx. 10 seconds. The craft did not waver or fluctuate in course. It flew perfectly straight to the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason I am making this statement now is to see if anyone else may have seen a sighting like this in the North East. I do not believe this craft to be of alien origin but I believe it could be the Aurora.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not specifically state that to be the case.  Satellites generally do not leave streams of material behind them, and they do not cover 30 degrees of arc in 10 seconds.  If the object was, in fact, being illuminated by the Sun, it must have been very high.  PD))<n>

What we both thought was very odd was how the object sailed all the way across the sky in about 30-45 seconds and than dissapeared and ended up turning around while repeating the pattern 5 or 6 times. then all of a sudden it came really close to the ground and paused for a couple of seconds. when it came down close enough to see, it for a minute looked like a plane  but then i noticed running lights: red and orange. COULD YOU PLEASE TELL ME WHAT THE HELL THIS THING WAS!!!!!! i know i&#39;m not going phsyco, so please figure this out. me and my friend were really freaked out by this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness implies a sighting on Sunday morning, June 15, 2003.

6/14/03 20:00|Paphos (Cyprus)||Cigar|12 minutes|Intensely brilliant objects accompany a Cyprus sunset.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29498.html|183|ndxe200306| Intensely brilliant objects accompany a Cyprus sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was recently on vacation near Paphos on the island of Cyprus, and at sunset on June 14 (approx 20.00hrs local time) I witnessed an unusual event in the proximity of the setting sun.  The sky was completely clear and free of cloud, and the horizon in my view was the calm Mediterranean Sea to the West of my hotel balcony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event itself took the form of two intensely bright lights (one a pinpoint and the other a streak or slim cigar shape). Both were located a few degrees to the upper-right of the setting sun. The pinpoint was at approx &#34;2 o&#39;clock&#34; to the sun. The bright streak (slim cigar shape) of light, was situated a few degrees to the right of the pinpoint (also at around &#34;2 o&#39;clock&#34;) with its left end slightly inclined toward the horizon.  Both lights remained stationery and continued to emit an intensely brilliant white light for several minutes, both before and after the sunset. The pinpoint then suddenly dimmed and disappeared.  Approx two minutes later, the streak of light dimmed suddenly and disappeared, leaving behind it for a few millisceonds a brownish streak of exactly the same proportions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, some ten seconds later, the brilliant streak of light reappeared in roughly the same position (possibly a few degrees to the right), and it remained intensely bright for approx. half a minute more. At this point, the streak of brilliant white light suddenly dimmed and disappearing as before, leaving for a fleeting moment, a brownish imprint of itself against the turquoise sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after first noticing the lights, I attempted to film them using my camcorder. However, the camcorder refused to give me a clear picture, even though it was switched to auto-focus. I therefore switched it to manual focus, but the image didn&#39;t improve.  Frustrated, I then discarded the camera and decided to watch the event with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a point of interest, my partner Jenny also saw the above mentioned lights and, without prompting from me, she independently described them in exactly the way I have described them to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported my sighting by telephone to the Cyrpus Mail newspaper office in Nicosia on the following Tusday morning (I spoke to a reporter called George).  However, he&#39;d had no other reports at that time. I gave him my hotel address and invited him to contact me if he required additional information.  I had no further contact from him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nearly three weeks on, I am now back home in England, but I am still deeply puzzled as to the nature of what I witnessed on June 14.  I am a writer by profession, and I&#39;m always keen to get to the bottom of a mystery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yours faithfully ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses observed a distant aircraft, with contrail behind it, being illuminated by the setting Sun in the west.  We will invite his comment.  PD))<n>

My cousin&#39;s friend picked us up and we went to his house. We were in the back yard hanging out. He brought out a torch and said this is one of Saddams candles and showed me that it was made in Iraq. He put the torch on the fence and lit it. The wax of the torch was on fire so we wondered if we should blow it out or leave it burn. As I was looking at the fire I noticed two balls of light in the sky, it was still daylight. They appeared to be close, only feet apart and not moving. They appeared to be at the same altitude. The light on the right, as I was looking up from my lawn chair, turned into a silver triangle in the sky then as it flew away it turned from silver to black and the ball of light on the left seemed to follow it,  it disappeared. It just vanished.  After about fifteen minuets I told my cousin and his friend. I was embarassed to tell them right away. Then my cousin and I saw two balls of light shoot from horizon to horizon, his friend did not see it. Then my cousin got excited saying &#34;I saw that, I saw it that time.&#34; I was not all that astonished because what I had seen a few moments earlier was much more dramatic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later I saw a jet in the sky and could see the difference in speed it looked like it was going very slowly compared to what we had seen earlier. What I saw earlier was like warp speed on star trek, it went that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

After about 5 min we noticed some unusual lights over the ocean. Due east off Fl coast. In one&#39;s vision,you would have the beach in the lower vision and the upper the sky. Within the sky portion it was 1/3 of it above the horizon/beach. The lights would have appeared to be about an inch to two inches across together. The lights themselves were rectangular shaped and evenly spaced in a parallel line. The Light swere also orange in color and stationary. They disappeared all of a sudden like someone turned off a lightswitch. We observed them for about 15- 30 sec. For the most part it was a fairly clear night. There were some cirrus clouds over head and a bank of clouds off near the horizon but these lights were definately no where near clouds. It was a full moon so there was plenty of stuff visible. After the lights disappeared nothing could be seen where they once were. Just the sky.I believe it to be one craft if a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I yelled to my son to look but he wasn&#39;t sure what or where I was talking about.I wanted to pull over but I was going 45mph in the center lane and another vehicle was in the right lane. The road curves and the tress were now blocking my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was low and close to us. Bright white and neon blue glowing object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flew over us, went into cloud, came back over us and then suddenly disappeared as if a cloud wrapped around it to conceal it. Later that night my freind and I saw about 20 skinny, bald midget creatures in the field, as if watching us.  We both witnessed the UFO object and the aliens. It was too dark and too far for us to hike home [we were scared] but we went to bed instead,<n>

When we came to highway 15 where highway 58 meets, there was a big rig truck that had tried to turn in the middle of the road and got stuck there for quite a while, covering both sides of the freeway.  However, people took a chance and drove in a ditch partially under the back of the truck to get by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we went around the truck, not long afterwards we saw flashing red and blue round lights coming toward us.  We thought we were looking at a police car at first, and I think I slowed down, or it felt like we were still driving on the opposite side of the road in slow motion when we saw it come closer right next to the driver&#39;s window, as if it were looking in the car at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said, do you see what I see and she said yes.  It was hovering beside us, and we looked desparately for wheels and there were none.  I was trying to get away from it by speeding up, but I was still in slow motion because it stayed next to my window for a few moments. There were no other cars on the road at that point.  I don&#39;t know if the cars on that side of the truck saw anything or not, it didn&#39;t bother us.  It just took off and I rolled my window down and we didn&#39;t hear any noise from it.  It was about the size of a Delorean car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were scared and told our families when we got to Las Vegas.  I wondered if that truck was trying to help cover up the spaceship by holding the cars there for so long until they got enough nerve to drive in the ditch partially under the truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, is there any reports by the police that day that the truck was blocking the road?  Also, I couldn&#39;t get the time in the box but it was night time around 10:00p.m.=2200 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

At about 2 hours into the trip, we were driving eastbound along Interstate Hwy 40 through Ludlow... just above the Twenty-Nine Palms Marine Base.  Around 03:06am, Our attention was drawn to a &#34;VERY BRIGHT, single amber colored Object&#34; (Pic#1)off to our left. I was amazed on the Brightness of this object, It was about a half a mile away at about 2 to 3 thousand feet. I quickly snapped a digital photo with a Sony 3.5mp digital cam but the flash went off, so my wife appears on the photo as a negative refection off the passenger window. What is surprising is even with the flash going off... you can still see the Brightness it had. So after that mistake, I quickly turned off the flash and took another about 10 to 13 seconds later... and what was once one object... appears to have split into two separate objects... (pic#2) What I had seen soon after was it disappearing at a 35 degree angle towards the north. We were not alone on the hwy... there was a truck who I KNOW saw it because he swerved like I did when the object appeared. I exited on &#34;Crucero rd&#34; and even saw three California Hwy Patrol Cars parked at the gas station where we had stopped to defragg what we just saw. I &#34;Stupidly&#34; said to one of the officers if they had seen the Object I seen ...using the term UFO. I was Laughed at and told Marines are using FLARES to light up the area during maneuvers... which could be true. But I Know what a Military Flare looks like in fight. No parachute, no smoke trail... and I never seen anything take off at a 35 degree angle at a speed from a dead stop.  So I have enclosed five Pics for evidence and my word as it Happened! Thanks for a place to put this important information , at least someone cares! A.Chacon<n>

We never beleived in any of that UFO crap until tonight...we ran back to our dorm and reported this to campus safety, who ignored us, but we think they are just covering up the TRUTH!<n>
6/13/03 00:00|Elgin|SC|Formation||i was outside and all the sudden i saw a flash of light and 13 ufos appered just like that. then they moved very fast across the night|12/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33443.html|197|ndxe200306| Sustained enveloping noise culminating with a menacing &#39;voice&#39;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should first describe the atmospheric conditions: it was a very humid night but visability was pretty good. The Moon was very bright and it inveloped the haze in a dull light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, let me say that my wife and myself did not see any type of craft. I am filing this report to see if anyone else in my area may have spotted something or had a similar experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I went to bed around 11:15. I noticed a rolling sound very similar to thunder. I asked my wife if she thought that the noise was thunder and she did. I looked out and saw that it was rather clear but the humidity had created a haze at ground level. The moon lit everything up and our yard and cars were clearly visable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I related as much to my wife and she suggested that there might be a storm in the distance. Possible I suppose, but this rolling thunder noise was sustained. I found it unusal but possible due to the atmospheric conditions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not timing the noise but I could not sleep because of the humidity. About 10 minutes elapsed with the sound still constantly in the background, at times becoming almost mechanical in nature, sort of like a muscle car. The volume also seemed to raise and lower. The last time I looked at my watch was around 23:35. Then I fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somehow I ended up on the couch down stairs. I woke to my son crying. He is 29 months old. He sleeps with us (we have a king-size bed) and he had apparently fallen out of bed. I ran upstairs my wife held him until he calmed down. I looked at my watch and saw that it was 2:05 AM. I could hear what I think were Tractor Trailers in the distance. I laid there, unable to sleep for about an hour. I ended up going back on the couch. It was strange that the air was really still, hot and thick in the bedroom (yes, there were 2 windows open upstairs.) I even stuck my hand up against the screen, and it just felt so hot. But downstairs, the air was thick and cold. It was also slightly breezy at times. I laid there for about an hour and could not sleep. As I did enter a state that would best be described as a Twighlight type state (somewhat aware but VERY relaxed)I was startled by a noise - I&#39;m getting goose bumps at this point - that sounded almost electronic, and, for lack of a better adjective, evil. It almost seemed like one of those voice changing kids toys, or a distorted Nextel phone. I could not determine what was being said. It sounded linguistic and not just noise. I was completly awake at this point, laying, waiting. I heard it again and bolted up and looked out of our picture window that over looks a flat field that is about 100 yards. I heard it again as I made my way to the picture window which is about 5 feet behind the couch. I distinctly heard this &#39;voice&#39; 2 times, and it was distinctly different both times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went upstairs and asked my wife if she had heard it. I was kind of dazed and didn&#39;t realize that I was waking her up. She sort of freaked out. At this point, I am completly awake, so I head back downstairs to investigate. I look around out of the window. I enter the kitchen and notice that our dog is completly asleep, I make some threatining comments out of the window trying to call this person or thing out. Nothing. Silence. I listen and notice that there appears to be some russtling in the woods that border the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, needless to say, I didn&#39;t fall back asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were sitting outside late in the evening when we noticed an apparently low flying yellowish orange light (circle) traveling from a south to north direction. The object might have been within a mile or ess of our position, but it was  difficult to judge the distance or size of the object itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound, vapor trail, or navigational lights. We did observe a short time after the object came into view, a jet travelling at a higher altitude and with navigational strobes on in an east to west direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Midway through it&#39;s path, the light changed. It becamea very bright white light. The source of this seem to begin in the center and then radiate outwardly to encompass most of the sphere. I did see just a small amount of yellowish orange,but the white was more overpowering. It was a bright sharp white light. One might compare it to a car&#39;s bright lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time, the object continued at it&#39;s usual speed and altitude until it vanished over a hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the past few years, I&#39;ve seen similar objects going over at low altitudes and from different locales in the region (see reports filed on : 8/3/99 and 3/8/01 in data base}.  There have been a couple other sightings of these in this region since then, but I did not file reports at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too low to be a satellite, but I did check the Iridium satellite schedule. To the best of my knowledge, these satellites were not what we viewed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the sky was partly cloudy that night with high clouds and a near full moon.The object was travelling below the cloud banks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks!<n>

The object appeared to be no more than several hundred feet in the air. The reason we believe this to be the case is due to heavy clown cover on this particular evening and the object was below the clouds. While observing the object we kept commenting on the way the object was rectangular in shape and was a bright orange glow almost the color of a street lamp. However, the edges of the object appeared to be emitting what looked like flames also, we noticed the object did not dim nor brighten as it moved across the sky. The object also appeared to be rotating in a slight circular motion as it passed overhead. (Perhaps 15 deg) Usually when you see an airplane approaching from a distance the headlights of the airplane or bright from a distance and then dim and fade away until you only see the marker lights after it eventually passes. In this case the object stayed at the same intensity from the moment we noticed it, until it moved beyond the horizon to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither my self nor my coworker has seen anything similar to this in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On that day I became a believer. It was sunny outside while I was sitting in the passenger side of my cousins car in a mall named Yorktown. We were waiting for some friends to meet us. I noticed a black object in the sky that was hovering in the air. I new it was not a plane because I saw planes flying in the sky. I about a 20 minute drive from Ohare airport and a 30 minute drive from Midway. It was almost 5pm and I could easier see the planes coming and going to the airports. That is why a new it was not a plane. Plus the fact planes can not hover in the air. The object sat in the air and then started moving. I could clearly see thre lights underneath it. The light were in a triangle formation. This is when I began to freakout. I grab my cousin and told him to look at the object. My exact words was what the ((deleted)) is that. I said it isnt a plan because those are planes. I pointed to planes around the area that were moving that left air steaks. The object would move and stop. Move and Stop. I do not know anything that is man made that can move in the sky and stop. This is when a began to freak out. I looked around the parking lot and looked as people went into their cars. I thought are we the only people watching this. We seem as if we were the only people watching this object. I was not like it was only appearing for a couple of seconds. I had been watching the object for at least 10 minutes. I could not believe what I was seeing. Things got interesting. The object came to a final stop and kept rising higher and higher in the sky. Suddenly a plane that was flying as high as it was, moved in the direction of the object. the object disappeared in a blink of an eye. When I was watching this object i got my cellphone out and final realized who would believe me. The police? Yeah right. I wanted to call the airport aviation. Yeah right. i told people but they look at me as if I&#39;m crazy. i blessed to have found your sight.<n>

They were over the ocean bay about 15 or 20 yards from us.

He and his wife were visiting from Sydney and went to see my youngest boy run in his school cross country race (he won!) The school is Forrest Hill Primary on Aucklands North Shore. Grant (brother) is facing South West at approx 2:00pm (race was due to start at 2:15) two New Zealand air force Orions (I think) caught his eye as they approached and then flew directly over the school, he took 1 pic as they approached, and another as they were directly over head. He has only just got the film back today, and has emailed these to me with the following comments. N.B. Whenuapai (Fen-ooh-ah-pie) is our local air base. Yes we do have an airforce...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lastly, check out my UFO! The photo called Planes_3 was taken while we waited for racing to start. Two Orions or Hercules from Whenuapai flew straight over the top of the school. When overhead I took the photo Planes_1. When I got them back yesterday from processing there is a funny silver disc at the top of the shot. When you look through the Lupe you can see a flat round base, a ridge running around the centre with white spots and the silver finish. It is slightly blurred at the back left corner. It appears on the negatives and seems too disc shaped to be a balloon. Close up scan of disc is Planes_2.We are both in the printing / graphics / advertising industry, and Grant is a competent photographer but I assure you we have not touched this image in Photoshop.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4 foot being produces &#34;orb&#34; of bright light and disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife arrived home from work late one evening in a state of panic and terror. She was pounding on the front door so shaken, she was unable to get her key into the lock. It was very disturbing for me to see my wife going through the fear she was experiencing. I assumed she had been assaulted or raped. As I was getting ready to call the police, she was able to calm down somewhat and she told me to put the phone down, that it would not do any good anyway. Confused and shaken I asked why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She explained that as she was pulling into our apartment complex, she was slowing down to select a parking spot (in low level light) when she noticed what appeared to be a small child playing around a large steel waste dumpster in the corner of the parking lot. The steel dumpster was located underneath a large stand of trees about 15 feet from her location.  She got out of her car and walked over to the rear passenger door (facing the dumpster)to get her brief case and saw movement out of her periphery that further caught her attention.  Her next concern was if this child was too young to be playing out in the dark late at night. She began to slowly walk towards the dumpster to ask where the childs parents are at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As she approached the dumpster she could make out the contrasting shape of a head peeking out from one corner as she calmly spoke. She approached to within 6-8 feet when she heard a loud banging noise and this &#34;child&#34; suddenly had an ability to high jump 5 feet. It was then standing on top of the dumpster&#39;s steel lid staring down at her.  At this point she described feeling a pressure in her head, nausea and dizziness (this may have been a physical reaction to fear.) She told me she strained to identify if it was a neighborhood child who was staring at her for about 20-30 seconds, a kind of &#34;stand-off&#34;.  Just as she realized this was not a child, the &#34;being&#34; produced a glowing-white orb of light about the size of a volleyball in its hands and held on to it at about chest height. The light cast off from the glowing orb illuminated its head for several seconds and she described a large almond shaped head with big black eyes staring intently at her movements. She told me that she just stood there in stunned silence trying to understand what was happening and that everything seemed to be happening in slow motion. The &#34;being&#34; seemed to tighten its grasp on the glowing orb of light and it jumped feet first into the dumpster and disappeared without making any noise. Right after that is when she began to break-down emotionally and run into the apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between the time she entered our apartment and calming her down and debriefing her was about an 1-hour. With much reluctance (I&#39;ll admit I was really creeped out to do this). I went back out to the exact spot she described with my metal softball bat and D-Cell Mag-Lite. I had to know what it was that terrified my wife.  I examined that whole area, even to the point of looking inside the dumpster and I did not see or notice anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the past several years we have seen many electric-white blue streaks of light in the area around this parking lot, during late evenings without any cloudcover and have had frequent but brief power outages. My wife and I conclude that these may be related to what she experienced. This is going out on a limb here, but my wife thinks that the orb of light was some kind of device that gave this &#34;being&#34; an ability to disappear, conceal or transport itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, we choose not to be contacted. Based on the emotional trauma she went through, I prefer that she moves on and put all of this behind her.<n>

One appeared to have a blue/green light on the bottom and the other a red indicator while the third remained bright, then they resumed the original color and patterns. They displayed some maneuvers hovering atop one another just being stationary and then zooming past once again, at first we thought it was a helicopter than they split up.  We smelled a funny odor when they passed the second time like fuel but an odd more pungent smell.  We were driving in the oposite direction and several other cars were on the freeway with us, they too slowed down but, kept moving not knowing what we were experiencing, in the rear view mirror it seemed to continue for as long as we could see them. Something I won&#39;t soon forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got up to see what it was and in the sky was a bright reddish orange object falling down out of the sky.  You could see smoke behind it. As it dropped it go significatly smaller to about the size of a dot and then went behind some trees and then all you could see was the smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a lot of commercial airline traffic in the area although none were close to the object.  We live almost directly in the west flight path for Sky Harbor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In any case, the object was zig-zagging overhead as it moved in the direction indicated.  I know it was not commercial aircraft or any aircraft I am familiar with.  It could not have been a planet or star, and it was not dark enough to see satellites as they move in their orbits.  The object looked as if maybe sunlight was reflecting off of it, so I suppose you would call it silver in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appears the object was extremely high as it was about the size of a dull pencil point held at arms length.  Of course, there was no noise.  I called my wife out of the house to observe the object, and make sure my eyes were not playing tricks on me and she confirmed that it was in fact zig-zagging.

I looked up into a nearly cloudless blue sky and just happened to see something streaking across the sky directly above us.  I watched it for a few moments, trying to identify it in my own mind, but had no luck making sense of it at all.  It seemed to be a small spot of silvery white, made no noise at all, and really had no discernable shape other than spherical.  It looked small, and moved incredibly fast, moving from horizon to horizon directly overhead in little more than about 10 seconds.  My first thought was it was my first daylight glimpse of a satellite, but it moved much too fast for that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I grew up watching and counting orbiting satellites at night in the skies over Wyoming, so I&#39;m very familiar with how they move, but had never seen one in daylight.  I discounted the idea, realizing it didn&#39;t seem to be high enough to be in orbit.  As the object neared the far horizon, on a Southwesterly to Northeasterly course, I suddenly sat bolt upright, the realization hitting me that I couldn&#39;t identify what I had been watching, and said to my friend, &#34;What the hell is that?!&#34;  He didn&#39;t see it and I immediately tried to point it out to him but as I did it faded from visibility into the distant sky.  I described it to him, still looking skyward, saying, &#34;God, I wish you had seen that...&#34;, when suddenly there was another, coming from roughly the same direction, on the same general heading as the first, Northeast.  I quickly pointed this one out to my friend, and he immediately spotted it and began tracking it across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I consider myself a serious aviation enthusiast, and I know military aircraft better than most people, even other enthusiasts.  I served in the Air Force as a flight line mechanic, and my buddy who was with me served in the Navy where he specialized in guided missiles, so it&#39;s my opinion we both understand basic propulsion systems, the dynamics of flight, and the capabilities - AND the limitations of manned flight.  Neither of us could explain what we were seeing, we thought through all the possibilities we could think of, everything from high flying experimental aircraft, to cotton seeds floating on the breeze to meteors entering the earth&#39;s upper atmosphere and burning up.  There were inherent flaws with each of these possibilites though... the objects didn&#39;t &#34;float&#34; on any breeze, they were on a laser straight course and moving at a very high rate of speed, they didn&#39;t seem to be burning or breaking up as any other meteor does, they didn&#39;t emit any sound whatsoever, left no vapor trails or contrails... almost as if they didn&#39;t disturb the air at all.  And any aircraft moving as fast as these were would most certainly have broken the sound barrier and delivered the telltale thunderous &#39;clap&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stood staring in utter disbelief at the sky, the object quickly disappeared beyond the horizon to our Northeast.  We frantically searched the sky for any other activity, and to our surprise after a minute or two there came another object, again moving from the same general direction.  That made three so far, and again we both watched in amazement.  They all headed the same direction, yet each was on it&#39;s own trajectory.  Some looked slightly larger than others, giving the indication of a difference in altitude, though that&#39;s tough to speculate on, not knowing the size of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I tried to call my wife (exacly 12:44pm according to my cell phone log)but only got her voicemail.  I then dialed my brother in Idaho and excitedly told him what we were witnessing, as we spoke.  They kept coming, a few minutes apart, until we counted six altogether.  At one point, I watched one of the objects (which seemed either larger or lower in altitude) moving at a slower pace than the rest.  As it neared the far horizon, roughly 70% of the way across the viewable sky, it seemed to suddenly accelerate.  We called the homeowner out after seeing the 6th object, hoping for a 3rd set of eyes to confirm what we were seeing, but by the time he got outside it was gone from view, and with that, our encounter was over.  We watched the skies intermittently for the next hour or so, but saw nothing more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the activity was ongoing, we considered taking digital pictures, but realized it would be pointless because the camera couldn&#39;t possibly capture such small points in the sky with any clarity.  Plus we just didn&#39;t think we&#39;d keep seeing more of them so we just stood transfixed, trying to debunk what we were starting to suspect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was my first sighting of anything I could consider as even possibly having been of a non-terrestrial nature.  I was excited, yet still questioned whether I had just seen what I had just seen, if that makes sense.  Like everyone else, I had seen the movies, heard the stories, seen the picures and read eye-witness accounts of similar encounters.  I had always suspected something or someone else was out there, but I&#39;d never seen anything firsthand.  Now suddenly here I am confronted with my own personal evidence - and understand I can&#39;t completely convince anyone else of what we saw - but now I have firsthand knowledge of something that supposedly doesn&#39;t exist.  I&#39;ve seen something I can&#39;t explain, and it&#39;s been a very profound experience, mentally, spiritually and emotionally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a husband and father of two beautiful baby girls, I have a happy life, and I&#39;ve got nothing to prove to anyone.  I hope nothing more than to share with others what I experienced myself today, because I would hope others would not be afraid to do the same, only then can we hope for enlightenment about who we are as a people, and how &#34;they&#34; fit into our existence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness on several occasions, and we found him to be exceptionally credible.  Please see report from second witness.  Both witnesses will appear on the Jeff Rense radio program on Tuesday night, June 10, 2003; that program is archived on Jeff Rense&#39;s website, &lt;www.rense.com&gt;.  PD))<n>

The individual objects appeared one at a time at about what seemed to be about 3-4 minute intervals, all coming out of the southwest and bearing to the northeast in what seemed to be a fanning out pattern orginating in the southwest. Each of the individual objects streaked across our plain of view from horizon to the top of a tree line (which was approximately 30 degress above the northeast horizon) in approximately 6-8 seconds. A vast distance in a relatively short amount of time. None of the objects had a wing span or tail and appeared to me as being just a bright silvery orb streaking across the sky without a vapor trail or a mechanical noise such as is found in commerical air flights or military flights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the other witness to this event, and he sounded quite credible.

But the further it came down i could see that the object was more then a shooting star, the descent of the light(object) lasted about 2 seconds and a half, after, the object stoped for about 3 seconds that&#39;s when i could see there was maybe 3 or 4 lights forming the object. i cant say at what altitude the object was but it was below the clouds,it really appeared from nowere and got thru the clouds, the lights wer orange and redish in colour. after the object stoped in mid air, it went &#34;south south east&#34; from my position it was about the same height of regular plane that lands in Montreal Dorval Airport, i live at about 30 km west from the airport. (The airport RADAR must have seen this on there screens)The object i saw crossed the path of regular planes that take a west to est direction to land at the airport. The object looked like a flat square, the lights wer not blinking they wer steady lights, it was a cloudy night but i could see patches of clear skies,it cant be a sattelite because i could clearly see it below the clouds. I was Facinated to see this maybe someone else saw it to, its really sad that it lasted only a couple of seconds. I was hoping that it would return but it never did.

It was about 11:00 pm on sunday June 8,2003. The object appeared to be about a quarter of a mile away and was large and very brite. It looked very big, about the size of a football field, the top surface seemed to be covered in very brighy lights. The lower side was dark with rotating red and blue lights. We stopped on the highway, got out of my van and watched the object for 5 minutes, it just hovered not moving. After about 5 minutes it started a very slow foeward motion, it went over a hill and straight down and disappeared. At no time did we ever here a noise, engine, propellers, or any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But on to what I saw. At around 10pm PST, I was driving due west through Knightsen to Oakley. I was on farming roads, so I had a pretty unobstructed view of what I saw. So, as I&#39;m looking at the West horizon around Mt. Diablo, I see this fairly large orange light that was stationary off in the distance. I keep looking at it while i&#39;m driving, and then a I see a smaller orange light off to the right of the first larger orange, and its making it way towards the bigger light. The smaller light continues to go toward the bigger light until they merge together. The bigger light completely envelops the small one. At this point i&#39;m excited because i&#39;ve never seen anything like this before. so I keep watching waiting for the smaller light to emerge signifying that it is just an airplane, but it doesnt. at that point trees cut off my vision of the event, and a few minutes later when i regain my viewpoint, the lights are gone. don&#39;t what it was. i&#39;m just hoping that someone else might have saw something as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is the second occasionin less than a month that we have observed such an occurance.

It was a foggy night and all of a sudden we saw bright neon green lights (beam-like) flashing from the sky. They were linear, and went in different directions (diagonal, horizontal) and were very long (over 100 feet long) and high up in the sky (like the height of a plane).  There were about 6 total, lasting approx. 3 seconds each.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the beams could have been generated by a laser-based advertising light.  Just a guess.  PD))<n>

My 1 friend went to the store that was about 15 minutes away, so he just got back after it was over.  My other friend was with me, and he was the first one to spot the craft.  It seemed to appear out of nowhere and was hovering over a clearing that is now thick brush between Colby &amp; Broadway.  It was illuminated and made no sound. I could see no propulsion of any kind.  It pulsed golden white light. It kept slowly swaying back and forth about 30 feet above the ground.  The entire time we watched 3 black unmarked helicopters were flying near it as though they were watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then turned into a golden streak of light and vanished.  Soon after the temperature in the woods dropped so low our teeth were chattering.<n>

He took just a second to grab the telescope and was trying to follow the jet which was moving across the horizen when I noticed another object behind it that seem to just appear. I assumed at first it was another plane as did my husband. we noticed the other object was just hovering near the jet sort of following it . the object was shaped more like a silver football and we comented how odd it was . Perhaps a minute after we saw it appear it just disappeared in front of both of us . The object would have had to move at an impossible speed to disappear the way it did. we live by Point Mugo &amp; Port Hueneme so we wondered if somthing was watching our military jets<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We normally would wonder whether this might have been some type of military refueling operation, although the description above presents certain elements that seem to militate against that possibility, we believe.

I looked at it to. To me it seemed like a silver metalic classic ufo shaped object but since i was standing without my glasses on i had to go by what my mum was telling me.SHe said it was shaped like a sphere since neither of us have ever see anything like it we called for my dad. He too was overwelmed we never saw anything like it. It looked small but appearantly was far away and i think you can compare the way it was flying to the way a bumblebee is flying.Then really exited as i was i went inside the house to call for my older sister, but by the time she was on the balcony the object was allready gone.Because it had rained earlier that day the sky was a bit grey, sadly my sister didnt believed us, and back inside the house we (Mum,dad and I) allso started to doubt our mental health. We now think it has been a weather balloon. But deep inside i still doubt it,and really want to believe that the thing i saw flying over  Amsterdam was an UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Because there was a bright blue sky with the sun almost directly overhead, I was lying on my back with my arms stretched out in front of me to block out the sun.  In this way, I could see all the insects and drifting cotton from the cottonwood trees darting around at different levels.  I watched them for awhile, thinking about how &#34;rods&#34; are photographed using a similar sun-block technique, and wondering how the closer, faster insects would appear on film, and if they were at times mistaken for UFOs/rods.  Above all of this activity, I noted very high in the sky a solid, steadily-moving object flying over from the SW to the NE, directly over me as I was lying in the same direction with my head to the NE.  The object would have been next to impossible to see in the bright sky without looking at it directly. It was a smallish, dark-grey or black flattened diamond, appearing to be about as high as a jet might fly at cruising altitude, its speed perhaps a bit faster and its size a bit larger than a jet would appear at the earlier-stated altitude.    What I found odd was the shape, of course, but also that the length of the flattened diamond was perpendicular to its path!  Also, while periodically there were other planes in the sky, it was completely quiet and peaceful in the park, with no aircraft sounds audible, when this object flew over. The object never changed shape, nor speed, nor colour.  I had to strain my eyes to watch it while it gradually faded as I looked further back, my eyes watching for as long as possible.  I was afraid if I tried to sit up and watch it as it continued off to the NE I would lose sight of it.  I regretted that I didn&#39;t have my binoculars, which I generally carry with me, so that I could have examined the craft more closely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this MUFON member for submitting the report.

I was looking up at the sky like I usually do when I spotted a silver saucer shaped object.  I thought maybe it was just my imagination, so I asked my mom who was driving if she saw the same thing and she did.  It just hovered there, then we saw what we believed to be an army helicopter approach the object.  Then the object just vanished like it was never there in the first place.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am not sure what the exact time was because I currently do not have a clock in my bedroom on hand... I felt it must&#39;ve been some time between 1-3 A.M.  I had my window open all night since the weather was warm earlier that day.  For some strange reason, I woke up out of a sound sleep and seconds later I heard what sounded like a small airplane buzzing in the distance and it was getting closer.  After a moment the sound grew louder and louder and I recognized that it was the sound of helicopters, maybe two or three.  These helicopters then began to fly EXTREMELY low over and through the tree tops of our quiet wooded neighborhood.  I knew that by this time, all of the neighbors were probably awaken by this event.  The helicopters, for ten minutes circled low, several times as if looking for something.  They were low, but circled a wide perimeter of the forest and I could not see them.  It was the last couple of minutes, one of the helicopters finally circled in closer.  I saw a black helicopter with a very bright searchlight and with bright blue and red lights underneath.  I did not see the other two, but I know there was more than one.  I&#39;m not sure if they were King County Police or military!?  After ten minutes, they flew away in the southwest direction.  It was right after they left, I heard a strange low hum outside in the area that lasted for a few minutes and faded.  In the morning, I asked my family, who also had their windows open, if they woke up and heard this terribly loud event and they said, &#34;No,&#34; and that they were all fast asleep.  Something was strange about this.  These helicopters were frantically chasing and looking for something in these woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was very bright in the center and dimmer on the outside.  It was definitely not of this world.  I am a college educated professional and know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But I was looking at 2 lights that were appearing brighter and brigher they were the same size each about half the size of the moon they became rounder and clearer and more were appearing above below and in a cluster. one of the first ones i saw emerged as the others got bigger. The first ones now became a huge glowing oblong shaped light (about 2-3 suburbs across). 35-40 degrees up I was extremely shaken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the witness implies a nighttime sighting.

Off to the left, about a mile or two away over some low buildings, I saw what looked like a large, gray, cylindrical shaped object with no wings and no lights that looked like it possibly could have been descending into the airport, going down behind the freeway sound wall after several seconds of observation. I thought maybe it was a blimp that possibly had been flying over the nearby arena, but I called both the Oakland Airport and the Coliseum/Arena today on Monday - and both people I spoke with stated that there were no blimps in the area at that time that they are aware of. The time was definitely 7:53 PM PDT, as I looked at my dashboard car clock and noted the time on purpose. It was just about sunset, and there were some scattered &#34;marine layer&#34; clouds in the area, but these were much higher than the object that I observed. I saw no other traditonal aircraft in the vicinity. I would estimate the object was at an altitude of several hundred to a thousand feet when I saw it and then it descended fairly quickly out of sight toward to the ground at a seemingly sharper angle than a plane would have. Anyone else driving north at that time on 880 would have been able to possibly see it also, so there may be more witnesses out there as traffic on the freeway was fairly busy. This object apparently landed or went down very close to the ground, and it was much too large to have been one of those advertising mini blimp balloons on a string. I didn&#39;t even try to listen for a sound because the object was too distant, and any sound it made would have been obliterated by all the engine noises on the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Two shooting stars had been spotted already when an object about the size of the moon came into view at a rapid rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness writes...&#34;I saw what looked to be a football shaped object with a neon-purple shield fly across the sky. In the center of the craft there were 5 or 6 lights that looked like they weren&#39;t set up in any order. From the distance that I was, it looked like the lights probably had a diameter of 6-10 feet.&#34;  The first contact was made by the mother through the OUFOR hotline the following night. Investigator Bill Coones was contacted and visited with the witness and his mother at their home picking up a few more details. Bill noted that the craft had a black body surrounded by a purple glow. The light was not reflected light in the witness estimation but glowing on its own. There were lights randomly spaced within the surrounding purple glow. The object went right overhead. It did not turn or change direction. There was no sound. Bills compass said the initial view was to the north and it went in a straight line and behind the trees to the south. The object was first sighted approximately 35 degrees (as by his angle finder) above level. It crossed directly overhead and was last seen at about 30 degrees to the south before the trees hid the view which was shown to him by the witness on the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Investigator Coones had some conversation about the UFO phenomenon with the witness and his mother and got the impression that the field was almost brand new to them as they were amazed at some matter of fact things he told them about things in this field of study.

We were standing there the whole time saying oh my god what is it, while we were looking up in the night sky watching these things other people starting looking up towards the sky saying &#34;this can&#39;t be real&#34;.

It also appeared to flash yellow as well. I immediately checked to make sure that this was not a reflection off of the glass from an inside source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved closer to the window and affirmed that is was indeed an object in the sky. It remained completely stationary, but it continued to flash a red, white, and yellow light on and off at the same time. The object was about 45 degrees above the horizon. I would estimate that it was approximately 4-5 miles WNW of my location. It was smaller than a dime at arms length, but definitely noticeable. It had no definite shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyone driving on Interstate 71 should have been able to see the object since I-71 is 2 miles west of my location in a semi-rural area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a period of 3 seconds, the object appeared to &#34;fade away,&#34; leaving only the darkness of the sky in its wake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do recall audibly hearing other small Cessna aircraft in the vicinity after the sighting that night, but this object was far brighter than any other conventional aircraft that I have seen in the night sky. I felt strongly enough about the sighting to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to add that I am a regular visitor to your site. I think that NUFORC has done a tremendous job with limited resources. The American public deserves an independent source to report unusual activity in the skies for scientific, public interest, and public safety issues.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We live about ten blocks from the Atlantic Ocean.  The sky was clear.  In a couple of minutes my husband said, &#34;Do you see that, look!&#34; We were facing south-southwest and above in the sky I saw two sphere-shaped objects, slightly star-like, not as bright, but a hazy light grey color.  They were very round yet there was not a glow but a slight haze around them. They were moving at maybe a 45 degree angle from the ground from west to east in a southeast direction.  In other words, they appeared to be descending.  They were parallel to one another and moving faster than a plane, very smoothly, totally silent, down towards the tree line.  They were fairly large, larger than an average star, maybe about a quarter of the size of a full moon high in the sky. My husband thinks they were smaller, more star sized. In relation to an aircraft normally seen around this area, they were fairly low.  Their flight pattern was very unusual.  They were very close to one other, as I said, parallel, then at one point the object to the right crossed over to the left of the other&#39;s path. They continued to head south in a parallel formation till we could no longer see them as there were trees and buildings blocking the view. We ran into the house and my husband checked the time, it was 4:14AM. Neither of us have even seen anything like this.  We were up late but totally sober. We frequently look at the sky.  We watch shuttle launches and shooting stars.  I even saw a flaming meteor a few months ago streak from east to west in the same sky.  These objects were totally unlike anything we have ever experienced.  I looked on the Internet at UFO pictures and the closest thing to them are the so-called &#34;Phoenix lights&#34;, or the round shapes that someone photographed during the recent lunar eclipse, which, by the way, we also watched.  Yet the objects we saw were more defined in their spherical shape and were not stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She was looking for possible answers over what her and her husband witnessed at the beginning of June at 9:00 p.m. in Ardmore Tennessee, United States. Also the witnessed talked with a friend shortly afterwards, explaining what the couple saw. To the witnesses surprise her friend also said she noticed the same bright light on the same evening at the same time when she was outside, but never gave it much thought until the witnesses brought the topic up. I hope I can come up with some kind of answer for the witnesses to this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report &amp; Update below:  I have been looking for something for almost a month now, to help me understand what we saw one night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in Southern Tennessee USA, in the central part.  My husband and I were coming home about 9:00 PM, and as we started down the road towards our home, I got a glimpse  of a very bright light off to the north of us, not very high up, over the tree tops, it was more of a glowing or illumination...not a reflection!  I told my husband to look, and as he looked up, he said it was a plane.  I told him that it was not and since it was moving slow, I was gonna follow it, and we did.  We took back roads and tried to keep it in site, at one point, we went down a dirt road and it looked like it just hovered above the trees, maybe 1500 feet or so.  It was a giant egg shape.  At first I thought it was a blimp, and as of yet, I am not sure what it was.....one thing for sure, it was something I had never seen before.  There was no sound at all, and it was moving very slowly.  Not once did it speed up.  As it moved out of sight, we had to drive a short distance to be able to see it again, and it was moving to the South west....still not making a sound.  As we got into town, where we could see it better, it was moving further away, and appeared to be going higher.   Other people had to have seen it, but nothing was ever mentioned in the papers or to the police.  About 2 weeks later, I was talking to a friend who lives in the area and told her about it, and it jogged her memory to the same night, she went outside, and just looked up and seen a bright light, and wondered what it was, but never thought nothing else about it.  I have tried to find out what a blimp looks like at night in the sky, and I can&#39;t find anything.  I wanted to call the airport in Huntsville Ala, and see if they seen anything on radar, but my husband said, &#34;They probably wouldn&#39;t tell you if they did.&#34; So I didn&#39;t call them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can you help me out,  what do you think it was?  Anything you can tell me, I would appreciate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (name deleted by HBCC UFO Research)  Update: I asked a number of questions in hopes of trying to get a better idea of what the folks saw that evening. Below is the witnesses response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for the answer to my email.  I will try to answer the questions as well as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took place about the first part of June, of this year 2003.,about 9:00 PM.  The weather had been rainy for a few days, but it was rather clear that night, during that time.  From the time we spotted the light, until we lost sight of it, was about 30 minutes, I think.  Maybe 45, with all the driving up and down dirt roads and trying to find it again when it would go behind the trees and hills.  At one time when we seen it hovering, we had driven down a hill on a dirt road, and it was off to our left, hovering above the trees, if I held out my arm and measured the length of it between my index finger and thumb, it would have probably been about an inch and half to 2 inches in length.  (My arms are short also)  When we seen it hovering, we could not make out any details on it, it was just bright, no sound, no flashing lights, no indications of windows or anything like that.  It was just so bright, I don&#39;t see how anyone didn&#39;t see it.  The town we live in, is Ardmore Tennessee, which borders the state of Alabama also.  Interstate 65 runs north and south. And the town of Ardmore is located on the line.  As we drove into town, so we could get a better look, due to the horizon line, we noticed that no one even acted like they seen it.  The teens were cruising the strip and not even noticing what was going on.  As we entered the town, the road we were on was coming from the north east., and the object had moved across town and was headed to the West, southwest.  My friend that seen the light, lives south west of Ardmore, and she only briefly got a glimpse of the bright light, they have a lot of trees there and she couldn&#39;t see it at all, just a light in the sky, through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bright light was like the color of a fluorescent light, kind of glowing.  Putting off a lot of light around it.  I said it was egg shaped, more of an oval, with the egg lying on its side, not standing up.  When it hovered over the trees, it wasn&#39;t long, rather, we stopped and looked at it, maybe 2 minutes, and then we drove off, trying to get a better look, as it started moving slowly again.  It never made a sudden movement, and never sped up, unless it did so while we were driving to get a better look.  The path it took, seemed to be straight.  We were the ones going in circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in awe, I have always been amazed at these things, and although people have made fun of me, I know my husband seen it with me that time.  When we finally got out of the woods and back up on top of the hill coming into town, it was headed on to the west, southwest.  And getting to far off to see it good, but you could still see the bright light.  It was just getting farther away, and my husband wanted to come home, and quit chasing something we may not want to catch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Usually when something odd is in the sky, the meteorologist say something about it on the news at 10:00 that night, but not a single word was said.  Especially Adrian Gibson on channel 31 in Huntsville Ala. where we get most of the weather conditions.  That&#39;s why my husband said it was probably a blimp.  I got on the Internet and tried to look up pictures of blimps at night, and nothing came up....that was any help. My friend said she didn&#39;t see anything that she could speak of, except the light.  She didn&#39;t see the object.  So I guess we will have to go on my word.  Attached is a drawing I did to kind of show you how it appeared at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again (name deleted by HBCC UFO Research)  The statement below referrers to a computer drawing the witness sent to me which gave me a better idea of where they were when they spotted the object.

A witness was trying to get a hold of me, to inform me that if I jumped into my vehicle and headed west out of town (Houston) I would have been able to witness the object they were all watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness telephoned me again this morning at 8:15 a.m. and filed her report. I also talked with others who also witnessed this object. I am just about to do the weekly radio spot with  CJFW FM, plus I did a an interview a while ago with CFBV FM for their news. I will be requesting if other folks had observed this object that they contact me. Also the witness mentioned they would have never called me that early in the morning if they weren&#39;t sure of what they were seeing, and being so strange. Plus as I said above, if I would have hurried out the door I would have seen it for myself, so the witnesses said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes drive west of Houston, five witnesses watched a huge object move silently and low over the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before 1:30 a.m. the witness woke up as she heard her youngest child get up.  As the Mom made her way through their home, she walked by one of the windows and saw a very bright light/object.  As she stared at it, she noticed that it was moving very slowly and was of an enormous size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She told me she screamed for her husband to get out of bed, which he did. Because of all the commotion the parents were making, their other two children got up to see what was going on.  One of the youngster said, &#34;what is that big flashlight doing in the sky&#34;?   The folks who were watching the object said, there had to have been others who saw it, due to it&#39;s size, brightness and rate of speed. Also they noted they could hear freight liners traveling on the highway at the time of their sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses described the object as being boomerang in shape with a massive white/yellow glow around it. There were large bright light white lights in the center of the object. They heard not a sound from it, also the dogs took no notice of it. The sighting lasted approx: 3 minutes and disappeared behind the treeline and towards the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the event was over, the Mom had a problem in getting back to sleep as what she saw frightened her very much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for sharing this report with NUFORC.

The sighting was from this location, but not at this location. While working, my partner and I heard the engine of a (large)plane decrease rapidly. My partner, (who is located in another area of the site that we both work at), radioed to me regarding the sound of the engine decrease. I responded to him that I did hear the engine decrease and looked up to see the plane. It did not appear to be in any trouble and continued on it&#39;s way south towards the Phoenix metro area. As I turned my sight away from the plane, I noticed a light in the sky south/south west of our location. I watched it for a couple of seconds and my partner radioed to me again regarding the light. I informed him that I was watching the light and that it did not appear to be moving in any direction. We both watched the light and as we did, we noticed the light was changing color from an orange to a red and back and forth. It was at this point that my partner radioed to me that he was going to join me at my location. Upon arrival, we both stood there getting a bearing on it to see if it had moved. It didn&#39;t. We tried to come up with explanations for what we were witnessing and after about 15 minutes of not coming up with anything substatial, another light appeared just to the east and a little higher. Since the lights were miles away, there was no way for us to tell exactly what it was that we were viewing. Two minutes into the sighting of both lights, the first just went out. Some surprise for both of us, to say the least. About a minute later, a third light appeared slightly higher and to the west of the one we were now viewing. Then the second one went out. As we were watching this incredible light show, I asked for my partner&#39;s cell phone to call my wife so that she could maybe see it. I really didn&#39;t think she had a chance considering we live in the heart of Phoenix. She never got to a clear spot in time. The third and final light went out! After a few minutes, my partner turned to me and said &#34;Where are all the planes that were flying around here&#34;? True. Not a plane in the sky. As if they were told to vacate the area. Only a half hour before, we had counted at least 15 aircraft in the vicinity. We watched the skies for an hour after that and never saw another light. The entire incident lasted for 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object is a glowing crescent, the color of the sodium (Na) &#34;D&#34; line. It hovered over Byrd Spring Lake for about 15 minutes on June 4. Last night it emitted extremely bright yellow flashes that lit up the lake and the inside of our house.  The bright yellow flashes were not the orange of the sodium spectrum. There is nothing behind the lake for several miles.  There is a hunting preserve, followed forests on the Redstone Arsenal.  We heard no noise, and the object was stationary.  It has disappeared, as if the lights were turned off, and then returned.  It is shaped like a crescent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the sighting occurred at night, and we have amended the time accordingly.  PD))<n>

It was high altitude as there was a hazy halo effect from high thin clouds this evening.  There was no sound.  This was not a satellite flare as it was continual and maintained it&#39;s brightness even as it crossed lower to the northeast.  I am very familiar with satellites in my regular observations including the ISS, as well as commercial and even military air traffic passing.  This had no characteristics of those craft.<n>

These globes were in a formation of 2 vertical lines - there seems to be 8 globes all together.  They were directly above a mountain.  Then, they seemed to just burn out.  Apx. 15 mins. later we saw them again - this time there were 5 globes just hovering in the sky in a V type formation (all flat land - no mountains), no noticable movement.  These 5 globes of light disappeared - 3 burned out, then the remaining ones individually burned out (I say burned out, beacuse they seemed to dim slightly and then turn off).  Another 20 mins. or so passed by and there were 3 globes that reappeared in the sky, still just hovering.  They continued to appear, disappear and then reappear in different places in the sky.  This continued until apx. 10:45pm.  My husband and I finally pulled off at a rest stop to try and capture them on video and take a few pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was black but not dull, but also not shiney.  However, it seemed to reflect some light.  As I watched the object I relized it was not a balloon because it was moving Northward faster than the wind was blowing.  At the same time, I realized I was not able to establish a distance either from the object or the altitude of the object.  While maintaining what appeared to be exactly the same altitude, the object began to rapidly accelarate and in an instant dissapeard beyond my visions ability to maintain contact.  It never appeard to change altitude or color.  In my many years of military service I have witnessed planes, rockets and many other airborn objects but never, have I observed an object travel at such a high rate of speed so quickly and effortlessly.  I haver no way of knowing how far it was from me but I could see it clearly till it went out of sight.  I wold be most happy to submit myself for any and all testing you may desire.

There were no man made lights except some distant campers.  A circular colored light ( I am red-green color blind and the color is hard for me to discern, but it was not white, more a faint red or green), came over the horizon moving in a wobbly fashion but basically in a linear trachectory.  It was about 15 to 20 times bigger than a star. The unusual aspects were the size and the unusual movement.  The amplitude of the movement was probably 2 to 3 times the diameter of the object, but it had no discernable regular frequency.It moved from west to east.  There was no noise of an aircraft.  Before crossing the next horizon the light got smaller then disappeared in about a 5 second span.  I cannot think of anything that moves in this manner.  I suppose if it was high enough it could have been reflecting light from the sun as I was far enough north that it had only been completely dark for about 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The witness who is a radiology technician, was driving north on hwy. 6 and looked off to the west and saw 2 objects hovering above a field. She states that the objects were between 30 and 45 degrees above the horizon from her viewpoint. The witness stated she slowed down and rolled her window down to see the objects clearer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Her description is that the objects were disk shaped, and had extremely bright white and red lights that flashed in sequence around the craft(s). Witness states no stars or other aircraft were seen, (This area is within the ATC area for Altus AFB) Altus AFB tower reported no air traffic in the area at that time. The objects were seen for approximately 3 minutes before vanishing, as the witness watched. Weather at the time of the sighting was reported to be good. No noise associated with the objects reported  Witness tried to find a farmhouse to stop at to try to get another person to see these objects, however this was in a very desolate area and she was unable to do so. She did stop and contact 2 police officers in Elk City when she arrived in town, she states she asked if anyone else had seen the objects, the officers laughed at her, and then advised her to contact me.

Keep in mind it&#39;s an account written by the biggest paranormal/UFO skeptic going but my partner of 7 years and I DEFINATELY witnessed something unusual on a recent unwind trip in Mexico this past week.  We are both two very sane, sober professional Minnesota guys in our thirties and were hardly in search of anything more exciting than some R and R by the pool when we landed in Cancun this past Monday.  After quickly being shuttled to our resort just south of Cancun we settled in our room and indulged in the food accomadations but skipped the complimentary Tacates because after a 4 hour trip all we wanted was to shower and inspect the fantastic playground and beach.  We were already relaxed and by this time it was dark.  Neither of us were tired though, flying from Minneapolis we had the luxury of being in the same time zone and I can assure you NOTHING clouded our vision that night.  We sat togther on two empty lounge chairs on the beach no more than a few feet from the grounds of the resort and discussed our options for our all inclusive packaged week.  We had never been to Cancun and it was exciting.  Above us was a spectacular sky, there were a few clouds and it was a little windy but altogther quite clear.  My partner had pointed out a few constellations I had never seen before having never been that far south in my life and no later than a few seconds after he started talking about the sky then TWO BRIGHT WHITE STARS from opposite sides of the beach MOVED toward each other.  SHOOTING STAR/S????????????!!!!We were intantly stunned and silent as they slowly moved toward each other, they then sort of stopped and &#34;kissed&#34;, moved slowly apart then across the sky again, sometimes in perfect unison and at other times at different speeds and zig zag patterns.  I can say that neither of them circled in any way or ever appeared to come close to the ground.  They moved in straight lines, stopped an! d then changed pace and pattern over and over.  We were actually laughing in amazement, scouring the dark beach for other witnesses to this event but the only sound was the faint chatter of the full restaurants in the backround. It was a real &#34;What the hell is happening&#34; moment and the more excited and vocal we got in our astonishement the more faster and elaborate the patterns got, almost as if these things knew there was an audience!  It lasted no more than a few minutes, they just lost their brigtness and faded abruptly.  We couldn&#39;t take our eyes from the sky but they didn&#39;t return that night and we didn&#39;t check again on any other night although we talked about it often as we enjoyed the rest of our vacation just freaked that it had occured.  Nothing like that had happened to either of us before in our lives.  It changes you a bit.  We didn&#39;t feel threatened by these things, and nobody in the world could ever discount that moment for us although I&#39;m very open for an explanation for this because from our hotel patio during the day I COULD see large, noisy commercial flights taking off in that vacinity from the local airport.  These were not planes and I have seen amusement park/Vegas style light effects in the sky before and I know that these things definately could not be produced in that way.  In fact it was much more than just seeing these thing that we experienced that night, we both had an overwhelming sense of being &#34;performed&#34; to as if something was communicating and although it wasn&#39;t clear what that was it wasn&#39;t beligerent in any way and maybe enhanced our trip altogether.  I was ready to ditch this memory this wind down weekend back home until I searched &#34;Cancun&#34; and &#34;UFO&#39; on the internet out of curiosity and again found my self astounded by a few eerily and almost IDENTICAL experiences to ours in the very same area involving &#34;dancing stars&#34;.  For this reason I add our account for whatever it may be worth, remaining as true and accurate to it as I can possibly be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Than the first one passed the other and slow down. Both staying on the same plane. This happened 3 times when they both turned right or east. The speed was amazing. There was a commercial jet in the backround and I noticed it. The 2 objects diapeared.   There were no blinking lights on either object. They both had the color of etched glass.

Cable, wireless phone and the hardline telephone was out as well because I tried to dial in to check email and see if there was a bad storm coming. I went downstairs to unplug the TV and stereo because I know they are usually at risk when a surge of power hits when power is restored. I also grabbed some candles. When I walked in the family room - I smelled a VERY HIGH concentration of ozone, similar to my Ionic Breeze when it&#39;s turned on after being cleaned but it was not on and had not been on all day. Looking out the back window I saw it. The object was probably 30-40deg declination directly to my west. When I finally stepped outside, there was no storm that knocked out the power - actually, there was not a single sound at all - not even crickets or passing cars. The vehicle was probably 300-600 feet up (but hard to say exactly) and moved erratically but seemed to be hovering. It would wobble to the left and right and below it were two independent blue-ultra/violet-blue strobing halos that made the bottom of the vessel glow in this eerie blue. I was petrified watching it in awe and did not get a picture of it but I certainly studied it enough to accurately describe/draw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later this morning when I woke up again I had wondered if it was some kind of lucid dream but alas, there on the floor in the family room is the candle wax that I spilled while I was mesmerized by this encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Greg informed me that an UPS system is an uninterruptible power supply.  Bascially a battery backup to his computer. It can run his entire system with no utility power for about 2 hours.  When its activated it signals an alarm to notify him that the power has been interrrupted to the house so he can safely shut down the computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When Greg heard the beeping he thought maybe a storm was coming so he got out of bed and went downstairs to unplug the TV and stereo.  That is when he noticed a strong smell emanating from the family room.  It smelled like a high concentration of ozone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His lotic breeze smelled similar when being cleaned but the device was unplugged and had not been used for several days.  Greg grabbed some candles and was getting ready to go back upstairs when he happened to gaze out the back window and spotted an object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness claims that an oval or disk shaped object was visually observed. He stressed that the object was &#39;not quite exactly&#39; oval or disc shaped.  When he first observed the object he believed it held stationary, but after a few minutes it began to wobble.  Greg likened the wobble to a left to right motion but not like a pendulum swinging.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Greg estimated the object was around 1/4 to 3/4 miles distance from his location and at an elevation of 600 to 1,000 feet up.  He said the shape could be clearly seen and if it had been closer, could almost be compared to the size of a bus.  The bottom half of the object could be seen; being comprised of luminous blue/violet light.  On each end of the object were two lights of aqua blue color.  These lights were reportly spinning very fast and according to the witness, appeared to strobe or pulsate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Greg stepped outside to get a better look at the object. Once outside the witness say, &#34;The silence was so complete that it felt like I had walked into a sound proof room.  There was not a sound of any kind.  Not insects, cars, nothing.  Not even a breeze could be felt.  It was a very eerie feeling.&#34;  At this time Greg noticed that lights were on across State Route 747 which he can see in the near distance.  The state route runs not too far from his back yard.  However, when checking the front of the house he noticed the lights were off on his street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Going back in, the witness notes that his cats were nowhere in sight.  They are usually with him or near by when he is up.  I asked the witness if he had watched the object depart?  Greg claims that he does not remember how it left.  He states that he remembers standing out back gawking at the object in the stale silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness sounded perplexed as he related how he usually would have stood there as long it took for the object to leave or do something.  He says that he honestly just remembers the parts leading uo to the sighting.  He says he watched it for 15-20 minutes and then went to bed.  He said he did not remember going back to bed. Again, he says he would of stayed or called someone or done something besides dismissing it. He did not understand his actions in regard to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon awakening the next morning the witness says that a candle contained in glass he had left burning had exploded.  He detailed how wax had been projected on the walls after the explosion and theorized that the glass container had been defective.  He said he does not know why he did not awaken from the sound of the exploding candle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Checking his UPS systems backup which records data during the power outage he noticed that the electricity had been off for 5 hours and 11 minutes.  Greg states that this is impossible because he remembers waking up with plenty of time to get to work.  His printout reads as follows: Outage event at 2:23:43s Eastern time, duration of outage 5 hours 11 minutes 03 seconds.  So the power came back on at approx. 7:34 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Greg sent me the full printout from his computer system which he translated for easier reading.  This printout is on file.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS:  In an attempt to obtain more regarding the claim of a UFO sighting on June 2, 2003, near West Chester, Ohio, I placed a telephone call to the Butler County, Ohio Sheriff&#39;s Dept., the receptionist offered one item from her log that may or may not be of relevance.  At approx. 1:05 AM on June 2nd a house security system had been tripped at a location 3 miles from the claimants home.  No explaination was given for the home security system activation.  I also contacted the West Chester City Police Dept.  The receptionist there stated no UFO sightings had been reported for that time period. I also asked if any power outages had been reported.  The receptionist told me that they do not do reports for that.  I would need to contact the power company.<n> <n><n> <n><n> CINERGY INQUIRY:  Inquiry was made with CINERGY, the facility providing power to a large portion of Cincinnati and Southern Ohio.  I contacted the Operations Planning Engineer. He is in charge of the data for power outages in the area.  After pulling up the records for the area and the  address given he advised me that no power outages had occurred on June 2, 2003 for the West Chester, Ohio area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also asked Greg to check with his neighbors to see if they saw anything on the night in question.  He called me back saying that no one he talked to had bee up at that time of night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Assessment of situation:  Greg sounded like an intelligent, coherent individual. In the early stages of the investigation Greg had told me that the power was only out in his house. Later he told me it was out on his street.  I do not know the reason for the change in his story.

Right before the intersection with McCully Rd., I noticed a bright white light to my right, above some trees. At first, I assumed it to be a helicopter with bright lights on, so I turned off my radio, put my window down, &amp; slowed down to investigate further. There was no sound, and if it was a helicopter, it would have made a noise, judging by the fact that it was no higher than 200 feet or so above the trees. It was at a standstill, and did not move, but changed colors from red to green to blue to white along the &#34;equator&#34; of the object. I live only 2 minutes away, so I thought I would see it at home as well, but when I got there, I looked in that direction, &amp; there was nothing. My car didn&#39;t stop, and no one else was on the road but me. This is the 2nd time I&#39;ve seen an object in the sky in this general area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

South-South-west of our position, we saw a triangular formation of lights, (3 in total, at each corner I suppose). The object was moving irratically (so we thought). Up, left, down, right, and quite quickly. We became exited and nervous, trying to decide what it was. It was undoubtably moving towards us, but not directly (moving irratically). The object was making no noise. We all jumped off the car as it got closer. At this point it was probably still at least a mile or two away. Suddenly, we each noticed that it was changing shape. The upper light moved down towards the others, which spread themselves, and it was now moving in a linear motion, with the lights blinking, and it now undeniably resembled an airplane, sound and all. We were shocked and amazed at this transformation. None of us could deny its behavior before the change, nor expain it, before or after. I felt and still feel strong emotion and watering eyes when I think about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Well I it started a few days before this sighting that something out of the ordinary was going on. For approximately four days two military jets loitered in the area,several of my friends heard and watched them on several occasions that week. They stayed in the same exact area going about five to ten minutes out( west and over the gulf)and then returning almost overhead,I live and work very close to were they were doing this so I could hear them almost continuously. They did this All day and well into each night,could have been all night but I didnt stay up to find out. On the last evening that they loitered something strange happened, at 8:30 PM I arrived at my shop to drop off some equipment I had just purchased, I heard the jets as usuall and watched them as they headed away from me towards the gulf, I turned around and started to unload my truck,A bright light pulse( Only way I can describe it) cought my eye and I looked up, it didnt flash again for about 10 seconds(approx) then it pulsed again, a few seconds later it pulsed again but it looked like it was aimed away from the ground and towards the sky, then a few seconds later another pulse towards the ground. There were no other lights on IT and I couldnt hear IT, it was very dark out so I couldnt see a silouhette of any kind. So Im watching this thing and the next thing I hear are those jets heading back towards were I am but this time the engines are alot louder,I see one more pulse of light slightly west of the last pulse and away from were the jets are coming from and into an area that is cloudy so I couldnt see alot more. The jets arrived over head heading directly towards were the last light pulse occured, I saw a streek of light through a small opening in the cloud bank, Im not sure whether it was the jets or the object.My exact feeling at that time with the aggresiveness exerted by the jets was that there going to shoot this thing down, I watched for a few minutes in almost horror and fear and listened to the jets as they raced away. I didnt see the light ever again, the jets returned approx one hour later stayed approx one more hour and I never heard them again after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

My wife noted that there seemed to be a lot of planes in the air in the vicinity of Laguardia Aiport.  There was a Mets game on at Shea Stadium, and at first I noticed what appeared to be a group of small white lights moving in formation.  On my second look, these lights seemed to be helicopters and were actually stationary.  Then I noticed a large oblong object near the other lights.  This object had a red/orange glow emanting from the bottom.  The boject did not move across the sky, but it seemed to dip up and down periodically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued driving over the bridge, and I noticed the object just above the tree line as I drove on the highway.  I pulled off the highway onto a side street and got out of the car.  I happened to have my digital camera in the car, and I took several pictures using the extreme telephoto setting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after I got home, I got back in the car and headed to Shea Stadium.

The path is a path taken a million and one times through cornfields that were just cut down. Two friends and I decide to go the river and sit (something we did quite often). Just as we were on the last section of field, my friend whose house we were at, yells look!!  I am looking in the road directly ahead cause I am driving (looking for something in the road). Then I look up and there is something in the sky hovering. I could not see it just three lights in the shape of a triangle. I have seen C-130s fly over where I live now, and they do not compare to the size of this &#34;UFO.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10:05:  I pull out into the middle of the field, away from the tree line semi-blocking view, and the object begins to move towards me. I sit for about 20 seconds more. Than the race is on, I turned the wheel of the car and went as fast as the car would go. I am doing about 90 mph in a cornfield; my friend in the back seat is yelling it’s over us! So I slammed on the breaks (to avoid hitting a tree), and we watched as it slowly crept off. The whole time our windows are down and we never heard anything..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other accounts at same location:  I personally have never witnessed any other UFO there.  Right after we got back to the house my friend whose house we were at says that he has seen the object before. I know of at least 7 people who have seen phenomenon at this location. I suggest if you are serious about seeing a UFO go there!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was stationary when she first noticed it and pointed it out to me. Once it started to move, it took about 5 min before disappearing into the sky.

I am sorry I do not remember the exact date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw an object in the sky that looked like a stealth bomber (black, triangular) with bright lights along the edge of it.  It was hovering to the right side of I-95 over homes!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned to each other at the same time and asked &#34;what is that?&#34;.  We rolled down the windows in our car but could not hear any noise.  If it were a plane or a jet, we certainly would have heard something.  It appeared to be hovering extremely low to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it were a plane it would have been moving very quickly, and would have certainly crashed at that low of an altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We don&#39;t think anyone else saw it except us.

Some golf tournament was going on the same weekend at a nearby park.  There was a large yellow blimp flying over head in the distance, west I think, the sun was behind me.  I always look up in the sky while out there, was a partly cloudy day.  I looked up, saw the blimp, there were some airplanes in the air, as we were relatively close to the airport.  I see alot of planes daily. Anyway, as I was looking up this one instant, I saw a white rectangular object, it appeard to be white, could have been a dull silver, very small, but not to small to tell the shape. It appeard to have cut across the path above the blimp. I only saw it for a second, then it was gone, I kept looking for it, but did not see it or a trail again. I told my friend I was playing tennis with, he did not see it, but he knows me well enough to know I was not lying.  Anyone else in Nashville see this????<n>
