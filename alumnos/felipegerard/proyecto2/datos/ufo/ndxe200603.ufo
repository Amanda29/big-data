3/31/06 23:00|Furnace Creek, ca (death valley)|CA|Light|15min|Small light like moving star over Death Valley|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50147.html|1|ndxe200603| Small light like moving star over Death Valley<n> <n><n> <n><n> While camping at Death Valley N.P. recently, i noticed what looked just like another &#39;star&#39; moving around slowly in the sky right above the little settlement of Furnace Creek, this is the HEART and middle of Death Valley. I was about 2 miles up and to the east camping off a backcountry road.  I watched this little dot of light, indistinguishable from other stars in the clear night sky, dart around and make 90degree turns, then move only slowly for a while (like blowing on the upper winds) then return to it&#39;s post DIRECTLY above Furnace Creek.  I heard no sounds. The way it was moving, i don&#39;t think it could be anything our human technology is capable of.  It was curious to me that I couldn&#39;t make out any real shape, just the small dot of light like a star.  I kept watching for 15 mins or so then went in the van and the next time i looked it was gone.  Too weird!   Just thought I&#39;d tell ya- thanx!<n>
3/31/06 22:30|Sacramento|CA|Formation|5 seconds|cloaked stingray shaped object lowflying only saw moisture build up around front end of object|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49915.html|2|ndxe200603| cloaked stingray shaped object lowflying only saw moisture build up around front end of object<n> <n><n> <n><n> my wife saw it first as we layed down to sleep, out the window about 800ft up, moving about the speed of the police choppers when they circle. the object itself was completely invisible but there was a lot of moisture in the air and we could see a build up of moisture around the front end and what appeared to be some sort of tail piece. the only way i can describe the form that the moisture was contouring to is like that of a sting ray. very flat and smooth edges, almost flowingthrough the air, the sides were like the sides of a sting ray in movement flowing from where they met a somewhat of a center area in a wavelike motion out to the tips of them. the area trailing the front arch of moisture seemed to flow in the same pattern but horizontally as opposed to vertical flowing of the front wing like area. I DID NOT SEE THE OBJECT JUST THE MOISTURE BUILDING UP IN THE AREAS IT WOULD OF ANY KNOWN FLYING OBJECT. i would not have believed my wife had i not seen it my self, it was very brief but unquestionably clear. no lights or sounds or abductions or cell phone static, it seemd to be a perfectly cloaked device using motion for propeltion as opposed to a fuel source. im still having trouble believing it but this was no known object to me and it was undoubtably clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/31/06 22:00|Claremore|OK|Disk|15-20 seconds|rotating saucer shaped object flying south to north.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49923.html|3|ndxe200603| rotating saucer shaped object flying south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sitting on the porch facing west and saw a saucer shaped object flying south to north. Object moved quite swiftly in a northly direction and then veered northwest. Object appeared to be rotating during travel. There was one light on the bottom of the object and lights on the side which allowed visualization of the rotation. The total length of this sighting was approximately 15-20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/31/06 21:10|Lincoln|NE|Light|2 1/2 minutes|Two yellow lights trailing dropping sparks seen heading slowly south over Lincoln, NE|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49914.html|4|ndxe200603| Two yellow lights trailing dropping sparks seen heading slowly south over Lincoln, NE<n> <n><n> <n><n> Leaving the mall toward the parking lot we witness two lights flying south about as fast as helicopters would fly. To us they appeared about the size and shape of a yellow street lamp seen from aobut 8 blocks away. They were tailing or dropping what ap[peared to be sparks. My wife saw this first as her eyes are much younger and better. The first craft was dropping these sparks first. Then I witnessed the second one dropping sparks. At first, I thought it was maybe a bomb, or perhaps parachutes. The sparks appeared for only about 2 seconds and then dissipated. It is hard to judge distance, but I would guess they crossed the sky about 2 miles away, maybe more. I called 911 and they checked it out for us. We called back later on a non emergency number and they had no radar records nor were there any military exercises.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/31/06 21:00|Tri-Cities|WA|Light|constant|Six stationary multi-colored objects/lights in the sky seen from all directions.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49924.html|5|ndxe200603| Six stationary multi-colored objects/lights in the sky seen from all directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was lots of Different colors blinking on the &#34;crafts&#34;. Such as red, green, blue, purple, and yellow. 6 of them, in all directions. They were too far away to see the shape. They were stationary, not moving at all. Also, we saw Very bright flashes of light behind the horse heaven hills. We went outide to look for ufos because my aunt called and said the she saw them on the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/31/06 20:50|Lincoln|NE|Light|10-15 min|It was at night so all that was visible were two yellow to orange lights that were side by side, the distance between them is unknown.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49935.html|6|ndxe200603| It was at night so all that was visible were two yellow to orange lights that were side by side, the distance between them is unknown.  They seemed to be moving towards us north to south at about tree top level, it&#39;s difficult to tell how far away they were because it was dark and overcast and we had no perspective.  As they moved slowly towards us they began to move, as if they were  rotating so that eventually they were aligned one on the top of the other, they then started to move away from us and slowly moved back to their origional position.  Their movement was so in sync and smooth not jerky at all, that perhaps they were attached to one large object.  After a couple minutes of moving away from us they simply vanished.  One more point they or it was totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/31/06 18:30|Singapore||Oval|not sure|Bright oval shaped object, possibly with shimmering lights on top.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50086.html|7|ndxe200603| Bright oval shaped object, possibly with shimmering lights on top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a regular videographer and my subjects are mostly aviation things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I go to the irport almost weekly to take pics and videos of airliners in action.  It is my hobby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remembered while filming a plane docking scene, I was trying to pan away from a tiny irritating light that appeared in the viewfinder, but I did not stop to take a look at this lighted object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The heavy rain had just stopped and it was getting dark during the shooting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found out when I reviewed the movies at home.   As is my usual habit, I deleted all the movies in the camera after downloading into my PC.  The other movie shot close to that spot and few minutes later did not show any of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I personally dont believe in UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe you could help explain what is this object - can it really be an UFO or is it a light relection from somewhere?.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know for sure the airport&#39;s viewing glass windows are very in relection.  I know that place like the back of my own hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/31/06 13:00|Bolton, Manchester (UK/England)||Other|5 minutes|I saw two lights which appeared to be linked very high up, as I looked at the lights, I  saw up to twelve flying together.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50577.html|8|ndxe200603| I saw two lights which appeared to be linked very high up, as I looked at the lights, I  saw up to twelve flying together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 31/03/2006 I was visiting Jumbles lakes Bolton with a friend, this was mainly to have a country walk and to do some birdwatching.  I have a very good pair of Carzeiss Jena 8x30 binoculars we had a good day seeing many birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 1-00pm I noticed initially two objects/lights very high in the sky and flying together  I looked at the two lights wondering what they could be. I did not see solid objects as such I can only say they were lights I can=t say what distance or how high up they were. They appeared to be very high in the sky. The first two lights did appear to be linked initially. One white to clear the other a pale aqua blue. The aqua blue light went brighter for a few second, then back to a pale light. I only recall that happening once. They were similar to stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked I noticed more and more lights, I lost track of the first two.  I thought there was about twelve lights. I can=t be precise of the number. My friend and I jointly concluded there were about twelve. There could have been more, it was very cloudy. I could not determine if they were solid objects or not. We were looking at the lights for five minutes. The visibility was good and the weather conditions were reasonable to good. There were white bright clouds and a blue sky and a average wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were moving in a North- east direction from South-west. The wind seemed to be in the same direction, they appeared to be travelling slow but not slowly, I couldn=t determine the speed. The lights were various pale colours clear, yellow, pink, silver and aqua blue, they were of similar size. They were definitely flying together but did not appear to be flying in any kind of  a formation, As I was looking for more after about five minutes there were four lights flying in a line but this was not a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the lights were flying in the same direction but not linked. When my friend and I discussed this he said he thought Athey were connected@.  I did not get that impression. We discussed during the sighting the possibility of them being weather balloons. I don=t know what weather balloons look like so I can=t say that they were or were not. Jumbles lakes is close to Manchester Airport. Planes were circling to land all the time we were in the area. These lights appeared to be higher up than the planes but I don=t definitely know that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I chose to look through binoculars for most of the five minutes although the lights could be seen without binoculars. I couldn=t scan the area very well due to all the clouds. Finally they disappeared behind clouds and we lost sight. During the sighting I could not identify any specific detail with the binoculars neither did I hear any noise they were too far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I discussed the sighting. He could not think what the lights could have been. I am at a loss for an explanation. They were not children=s balloons. Weather balloons ? Twelve?.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My vague familiarity with the night sky told me that the stars were not supposed to be there. So I took interest in them and watched them. As I watched them they grew brighter by the second and appeared as bright as the Venus - the one towards the north was slightly brighter than the other one to the south. They were static and I judged them to be at an altitude of where I normally see the shooting stars. And as I was watching them perplexed, they began to fade and in moments totally faded away leaving me totally bewildered - all in a matter of may be 30 to 40 seconds. I watched intently for several minutes at the spot where they disappeared in the hope they might reappear. But they did not. At about 7.25 p.m, a satellite passed over the exact spot where the two bright objects were - from south-east towards north-west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt terribly excited for a few minutes after that. Could those Unidentified Flying (?) Objects be those of aliens&#39;? Or, what else could they be, I wonder!<n>

I had just turned onto Las Virgenes Canyon Rd. from Piuma Rd. when a bright white flash lit up the canyon around me. This was followed by a streaking object which passed directly behind my truck travelling south (saw it in my rear view after the sudden flash). The object was a very intense white and moved very quickly.  It seemed to be very low... maybe 50 to 100 ft. off of the road.  Shortly after it disappeared several street lights flickered and went out ahead of me.  Weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

3/30/06 21:15|Marion|IN|Light|1 hour|Multiple Orange Lights|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49884.html|15|ndxe200603| Multiple Orange Lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving home on a back country road last night around 9:15pm, I looked up at the sky through the front windshield and saw two orange colored lights that were close together, and one other light that was about a ½ a mile way from the other two. We were going about 35mph at the time. I pointed them out to my husband and he saw them also. We passed a clump of trees and we looked for the lights but they had disappeared. We got to our apartment complex about 10 minutes later, which was about a mile away from the sighting; we parked our vehicle and stood outside talking. My husband and I both glanced up at the same time towards the southwest end of our complex and saw three brightly colored orange lights very close together about 20 feet apart from each other. They blinked on one at a time and stayed lit for about 10 seconds and then completely blinked off. Then we saw further to the right of where those lights where three more lights come on one at a time stay lit for 10 seconds and then turn off. They were separated about ½ mile from each other and were about 100 feet from the ground. There was absolutely no sound. We decided we were going to see where they were heading to so we got into the van and chased these lights. We headed south down the back country roads chasing them. One lit up to the left of our vehicle, only three lights this time and in the same sequence as before. It stayed three quarters of a mile ahead at this point. We continued to follow and saw it light up again this time on the right side of the vehicle and it seemed to be going about  45mph. It stayed just barely in front of us as we followed it. Once again only one and the same sequence of action. The last time we saw it light up there were the set of three lights, but there were additional lights this time, about two more and they were a bit  ahead of the three we were use to seeing. To us it seemed as if there was more then one. If asked I can not exactly say, they were in to many different positions they all stayed about 100 feet off the ground. We came to a dead end and could not follow them anymore so we turned around and went back home. The whole chase lasted about an hour and we ended up about 10 miles from our apartment complex. Tonight we decided we would check to see if we could see these lights again. I had seen on websites that others had also seen these lights in/around the same area. So we went near the area we first saw the lights and parked by a field. This was around again 9:15pm, we waited for about 25 minutes and saw nothing but just when we were getting ready to leave, My Husband, Step-Son, and I, saw these lights come on just south of our location. There were 12 to 13 lights on and the same orange color as before. Behind these lights we saw what looked like sparks shooting from behind it. We watched as it looked to be coming in from an angle and it started to turn more lights on. I’m not sure how far it was from the ground but it seemed pretty close. I tried getting a photo of it but it disappeared completely from there and never reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

3/30/06 20:30|Palmetto|FL|Flash|1 hour|Unidentified floating flashing and blinking light in Palmetto Florida rural property.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49901.html|17|ndxe200603| Unidentified floating flashing and blinking light in Palmetto Florida rural property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a floating light flashing periodically on our property.  The light is about the size of a baseball and appears to float across our property a fairly high speed.  I flashes then dims and then flashes a few yards away showing us it path of movement.  The light seems to know we are watching it because it approached our back porch where we were standing and watching it and came with 12 feet of where we were standing and landed in on the ground and continued to blink and flash slowly perhaps one blink every 6 seconds for about 4 minutes then we noticed the flashing was about 20 feet above the ground and it exited our view by floating into the forest behind our house.  When I shone a very high powered flashlight on it there was no visible structure to be seen. This thing has been here at least three times that we have seen it. It seems to have intellignece and seems to be very aware of our presence. We will attempt to video tape it tonight as proof but would prefer a professional to come and visit our property to make a more scientific evaluation of this unexplained object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/30/06 19:18|Franklin|MA|Triangle|8 seconds|Solid, silent Black Triangle UFO over Franklin, Massachusetts|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55107.html|18|ndxe200603| Solid, silent Black Triangle UFO over Franklin, Massachusetts<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the early evening on March 30th, 2006 my girlfriend and I watched a perfectly equilateral triangular-shaped craft travel across the sky while seated outside on the back porch of our home in Franklin, Massachusetts.  The craft was totally silent and we could clearly see that is was a solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft had about 8 dim pin point white lights across the back edge of the craft, no other lights were apparent on the craft. It was traveling from the southwest to the northeast.  We were able to watch it for approximately 8 seconds before it disappeared behind trees. The speed was comparable to a normal commercial jet flying over our home on an approach to Boston Logan Airport.  We have commercial aircraft fly over frequently, and if this was a commercial or similar sized jet we would have easily heard the engines, as we always do - yet at the time this was the only craft in the sky and it was completely silent.  If I had held my hand out at arms length, and trying to estimate the size, it would have been close to, or a little larger than, the size of an American quarter.  There was a definite thickness to the triangle shape, the thickness being roughly about 5% of it&#39;s length.  The sky was not completely dark yet at this time, and it was easy to see that the craft&#39;s color was a very dark gray, not quite as dark as the clear sky behind it.  It was being slightly lit by the ambient light left over from sunset and the lights of the town, and it was not shiny but more &#34;semi-gloss&#34; in texture - there is no doubt that it was a completely solid perfect equilateral shaped triangle, and very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions were completely clear, not a cloud in the sky.  Immediately after the sighting I came in the house and contacted Brian Vike of HBCCUFO Research by telephone and made a verbal report, which can also be seen on his website at www.hbccufo.org.  This is not my first UFO sighting, but it was my first triangle sighting.  My first UFO sighting was as an Airman in the USAF in August of 1978 in Phelan, California, it was a multiple sighting with 3 glowing oval-shaped craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We grabbed the camcorder and started filming.  We were looking almost directly west, through the tops of the trees.  We could see the lights clearly and having no idea what it was were looking at, zoomed in on one of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We followed it down, until we lost sight of it in the heavier underbrush near the ground.  It took about 16 minutes from the time we started filming until we lost it.  We waited around for over an hour, to see if it would come back up.  We never saw it leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some background - we were filming it from the second floor deck. The camera used was a JVC GR-D270u, mounted on a tripod.  We started filming at 7:15pm and stopped approximately 16 minutes later when we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/30/06 13:00|Burlingame|CA|Cigar|25 minutes|I saw a very large, metallic object descend from over the hill crest to within 15-30 feet above the houses in full daylight.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55639.html|20|ndxe200603| I saw a very large, metallic object descend from over the hill crest to within 15-30 feet above the houses in full daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way to Albertsons grocery store when I happened to glance up to the hills that crest over the Peninsula area and noticed what I thought to be a huge water tower on the top of the hill line. I was somewhat confused because I&#39;d never noticed it before, and I&#39;m a very observant person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove on while keeping my eyes on the object as best I could. I pulled into the Albertson&#39;s parking lot. I was able to see the object very clearly.  It was NOT a water tower! I&#39;d estimate that it was perhaps only 6 blocks from me at the most, and by judging the size of the trees it was hovering over I&#39;d estimate it&#39;s size at anywhere from 50 feet to 75 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, it began moving very slowly down from the tree line towards me.  It had to have been only 20-30 at the most above the houses.  The object then began to move slowly towards the left.  I noticed that at first the object was very stark and clear, but as it began to move to the left the front edge/side seemed to become blurry/indistinct on the leading edge (in the direction of travel).  It slowly went behind some buildings which is when I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What seemed to me to be the most interesting aspect of all this is that NO ONE ELSE SEEMED TO NOTICE!!! and yet, there it was as big as life for everyone to see.  This was a VERY solid, metallic looking (lead colored) object with no apparent windows, wings, engines. It made absolutely no noise that I could hear.  I began checking all the local papers for the next three weeks...nothing!  That&#39;s my story!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Wow! Today started out normal, I had just returned home from carpooling with babies in tow and sat in the car a little longer than usual listening to this cool song on the radio.  The sky was clear, the weather nice, with no breeze. After about a minute I decided to get out and open the house door to enter my house. Just I approched the lock with key in hand, I hear an extremely loud roaring/churning/oscillating sound, I think &#34; What the...&#34; as the sound is directly on the side of my house and getting so loud that I can feel it shake the ground.  I run to the side of the house and for about 5 seconds (that&#39;s about how long it took for me to turn tail and head back to the car so that me and my babies could hotfoot it away!) the sky just on the side of my house and above my neighbor&#39;s yard was a weird cold greenish blue tint. Like looking thru a funky pair of sunglasses. Anyway, at the car door curiosity takes hold so I am standing on the stepbar of my car and I watch, mouth agape as this orb approx. the size of my car tire, leisurely travels down the powerlines. It is the same color as the sky was glowing seconds earlier but now the color is contained just around the orb itself.  And I recall thinking it is going to set the trees on fire as it rolled and periodically sparked. Just as I decided to grab my camara phone (cause no one was going to belive this!!!) It reached the end of the wires, turned a funny bright white yellow color, sparked a few more times then just winked out.  By this time two of my other neighbors were outside and we were all looking up at the lines. So I called my mom who is only about 2 blocks away and asked if she had experienced anything odd, and she confirmed that she heard the the loud roaring and her lights flickered off and on several times but she never came to the door.  After that phone call, I decided to drive the block to see the damage that this fireball had caused. ( still asumming that logically it must have been a blown transformer or something) yet after inspection, it was noted that 1)no damage whatsoever was done to the powerlines in question, you could still see the mold growing on them, 2) there was no buring ozoney smell in the air, that you would normally get from these types of fires ( I have seen powerlines burn before and they smell bad) 3) and the weirdest thing of all is that I do not remember hearing a loud boom like a powerline blowing, the sound just appeared and then got louder!  I will never forget this day!<n>

I stopped the car and both my wife and I got out to look... Three other cars also stopped during the sighting, their occupants also got out to observe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was huge perhaps 50 or so metres wide, with no clearly discernible shape. It was &#34;burnt orange&#34; in colour, towards the yellow end of the spectrum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered above some houses about 200-300 metres above them.... We were watching them in a southerly direction (facing south) and a second (similar) object was some considerable distance further south... I recall another witness saying to us, &#34;What the hell can it possibly be?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course we do not know!  The object closest to us remained there for about 5 minutes.  After which it sped off rather rapidly in a southerly direction, towards the second object.  There was no sound and no &#34;fancy&#34; manoeuvres....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must confess I am completely bewildered as to what it (they) could be and how an object can remain stationary, given its enormous size, at such a low altitude. I guess I will never find out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I considered sending this to WA Researcher, Brian Edwards:<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> http://tinyurl.com/4r2bvu<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> However his site was last updated in 2000, hence I think it has probably been abandoned... I will send this to the email address supplied on the site...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could well be he has another site somewhere, that I am unable to find.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for taking the time to read my/our story Warm Regards ((names deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It is the size of a medium star and shows up in the same location each time. The object moves in circles does loops moves up and down and left to right at what seems to be great speeds. This obeject stays in the same area of the sky and I loose sight of it as it drops below the horizon at about 23:00 to 23:30 hours. We took a drive yesterday trying to figure out how far away it was we traveled 7 miles west and 8 miles south and its location in the sky did not change and it did not become any brighter. Tonight I did pull out the video camera with no luck becuase of the lack of light. I did get 2 still photos that included stars and show that the object has moved in the sky. The object is located in the southwest sky and I would say that it is at 20 to 25 dgrees at 21:00 hours. It is now overcast so I can&#39;t get anymore pictures. Has anyone else seen this? Does anyone know what it is?<n>

We are both of sound mind and body, and the nature of this letter is to do nothing more than report an event that occurred, based on this persons account on Wednesday March 29th .After asking this individual if he was going to report it, he said hell no. Perplexed and astounded by testimony he gave, I am going behind his back to report this event. Simply because he stated “this was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life”. He was very serious, specific and said this was not any sort of aircraft, based on how it behaved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 8:55 PM on Wednesday March 29th in rural Starkville Mississippi, the individual was leaning against the bed of his truck, facing North East having a cigarette looking towards the sky casually. It was pitch black, stars illuminated the clear sky, the crescent moon behind him. In the sky at about 1000 feet he noticed a peculiar white light in the sky just sitting there about a mile and a ½ from him, just over to the right. In a matter of one second the object moved about 2 miles South West, which was closer, and to the left of where he first saw it. It stopped and did one flash (white light), then immediately went North about a ½ mile in a split second , stopped and flashed again just once. Then the object darted East South East about another mile and ½ where it was just above the tree line as he was looking at it, then it flashed 3 times, same white light. The final spot it stopped but further right from where he first spotted it, but closer to him. Then in an instant it simply just disappeared. He said it was completely silent, and the light was like a pure white light bulb when it flashed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was weird because they appeared to have very tiny parachutes or something stationary above them.  As my daughter and I watched, they flew in a perfect triangle formation and they were black in color.  She started talking about seeing them on a show and that they were flying humonoids.  The strange thing is they kept going higher and higher to the east and flew into a large cloud and disappeared.  They made no sound at all and remained motionless in the air while they were flying.  They were not falling from the sky, more like flying from west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Something caught my eye and I glanced at the upper left hand side of my windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw an extremely bright stationary object at about a 10:00 position in the daylight sky. It was intensely bright,like sunlight reflecting off a mirror. Although reflected light tends to spray outwards - this appeared to be a perfect circle or orb approx 3/4 inch in diameter from my position in the driver&#39;s seat. I thought it might be the sun reflecting off a plane, but it was too large, much too bright and a little too low to be an aircraft. To my relief, the brightness gave way or folded to a flat and dull grey slender shape. I had thought it was plane after all. I looked away for a 1/2 a second and when I returned to look at the object and it was completely gone from view - vanished. I searched the sky - nothing. In the farthest distance high up in the sky I could see the trails of an airplane and  other commercial aircraft far to my left. It was really weird. I work for an airline and live in in Fairfield County CT where there are always commercial aircraft in route. I searched UFO related sites to see if anyone else saw it because there were so many cars on the highway. It freaked me out butI&#39;m still holding out for a logical explaination. Now I know what people mean when they say they saw a bright light in the sky. It is out of the ordinary<n>

There were no ships in that direction at the time.  These lights were getting bigger, which made them appear to be coming towards us.  However there was no noise comming from them.  They remained in the sky above us for around 10 minutes, they seemed to be &#34;dancing&#34; around each other.  After this they just disappeared, we were watching them, but they didnt fly away, the lights just went.  All of our batteries remained flat.

Watch it for approx 4 to 5 minutes until they disappear... what in hell is going on?<n>

It was about that size, and from the side it appeared to have an oval shape.  There was a flashing light to the right side, which went out of view as the object rotated.  The light was visible again as the object pitched so the apparent top was visible.  At this angle it looked like a Vinn-diagram, with three areas of the structure coming together at the middle.  These three areas were equally spaced, equal in size, and if the spaces between them were filled the perimeter would have been roughly circular.  The color was dark and slightly metallic, but overall blackish and in the southern sky versus the setting sun.  As the object continued to hover, it spun and also flipped over completely very slowly more than once, moving eastward and we though downward slightly.  At this point we discussed the possibilities of a stunt plane (a completely unfamiliar variety moving entirely too slowly), an RC disc (which typically would have had a limited range and would have been either enormous or easily distinguished), and a helium balloon in free fall (which would explain the manuevers but not the shape and apparent size at that distance).  The loss of altitude we determined to be an illusion as the object was becoming smaller and we observed it traveling away from us.  The object then rapidly decreased in size, moving very quickly away southward.  The altitude also changed as the object got further away  and apparently gained height.  We observed it until it was a barely visible dot in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He pointed it out, and we immediately pulled off the road and tried to get video of the object.  It moved back and forth from west to east as we watched.  I got out the digital camera and began taking pictures. It was a huge craft, but really high in the sky.  It zipped across the sky and was gone.<n>

Over the course of 45 minutes we watch it change colors split into seperate light balls, saw the equivalent of small shooting stars coming from it, and watch &#34;flares&#34; come from the main light source and smaller round lights orbiting in a very random fashion.  At one point in time the light source split into the shape of a triangle in which the lights would literally move between each other.  At one point in time all the lights converged and dissappeared, instantly.  Approximately 3 minutes later, a new small light appeared from our point of view 2 inches up and 3/4th&#39;s of an inch over to the right.  At one point in time we saw what appeared to be an aircraft approaching, it then merged with the light.  Streaks of light were also observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of the witnesses, one is a College Graduate majoring in Education, myself and a friend are Land Surveyors for a highly respected company in the southeast, and a child was present as well.  We all saw whatever it was and are extremely creeped out by what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Given the duration of the sighting, combined with the different colors the witness reports, we believe that a &#34;twinkling&#34; star would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the object was, in fact, a genuine UFO.

We have gone up to this view for years, but this time we saw something we never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A light in the sky (it looks like a really dim flame) appeared out of nowhere and just stayed in the same spot.

I took a video for around a minute.  Now when I went home and put the video on my computer I found I diden&#39;t get the lights in the sky good, but I noticed something really strange, something that my friend and I did not see with are eyes while I was taping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was something right next to my truck in the road!  Lights that I did not see while I was filming that I can&#39;t explain and then under the lights appears something that I can&#39;t explain even more what appears to be (in atleast two frames that I found) a true to life face of an alien!  I am sending the original video along with pictures of the frames with the face that I found while studying the video.  I am 22 years old by the way and my friend is 21.  I am male and my friend is female.

I could tell they were above the clouds because their outlines were blurred slightly from the cloudy sky but the circles were still very bright and visible.  The circular white lights were about the size of dinner plates and were flying around independently and then all joined into one light and then split off into four again.  They did this twice in my presence.  I didn&#39;t stay outside any longer once my dog was finished because frankly I was a little spooked by the occurance and just wanted to get inside. My dog was not phased in the least. There were no visible beams as if the lights were spotlights, absolutely no noise, and the lights seemed to me to be more solid than any spotlight would be as well as very free and unbound by any movement limitations that a spotlight would have as a spotlight originates from a source on the ground.  These balls of light were very free moving.  I am a college educated, professional person who is not claiming to know what these lights are but I do know what I saw, and I know they were very strange and seemingly intelligent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I grew up around airports,my dad was in the Air National Guard (104th) base at Barnes in Westfield,MA, and we are surrounded by airports, including Westover AFB in Chicopee, MA.

As I turned to look I saw a streak of light falling from the direction of the flash (or seemed to be falling), downwards angle, towards the east.  The streak of light was shaped almost like a teardrop, and I&#39;m pretty sure I saw it change color from a pure white to a bright orange before either disappearing or falling out of my point of view.  There was no sound, and the entire event lasted less than 5 seconds.  To be honest, I don&#39;t think it was a UFO, but I&#39;m kinda hoping it IS one, because to my uneducated eyes, it looked like a missile or a plane exploding, either one of which would be bad....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They had bright green, red, and white flashing lights. The 3 objects were moving south and then changed direction and began moving east while keeping the same distance apart. As they got farther east, their triangle formation became more closed in. They moved down behind a large group of trees out of view, but then they came back up into view before going back down. This sighting lasted about 4-5 minutes. About 2 minutes later a single object identicle to the first 3 appeared where the first 3 had appeared. It began to move in the same direction as the first 3 before suddenly shooting downward leaving a streak of white light in the sky. Then it slowly made its way to where the first 3 had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My house faces north and the back door into the back yard faces south.  I was standing in the middle of my yard and noticed the object in the south sky moving north-north west.  One block south of my house there is a brightly lit car lot and birds and bats can be illuminated up to about 100 feet above the lot.  I first I thought it was an illuminated bird as it moved across the sky but as it moved very quickly (approximately 10 times the speed of a jet airliner at cruising altitude)from a south-south west, to west position it became obvious that it was it was not being illuminated from the ground because it never waivered in brightness and appeared to be at a high altitude.  The light was not brilliant more of solid off white illumination.  The light did not blink nor did I see it change color (I am red-green color blind and therefore might not of noticed subtle color changes).  Once it was approaching a due west position I called my wife out to see.  She saw it to and first thought it was a plane but I pointed out the velocity and she agreed that it was moving very fast and could not make out what it could be.  It appeared to very slightly lower in altitude as it moved.  We tracked it from the back yard until my sight line was blocked by my neighbors house.  I then walked quickly to the front yard and saw it in the northwest sky for about 5 more seconds before it again moved out of my sight line by the roofs of houses across the street.  At the point that my sight line was blocked it was only about 15 degrees above the horizon.  I then walked back into my house and back into the back yard.  I then noticed a plane in the southwest sky that was approaching from the south west then changed direction moving north along a very similar path that was taken by the object.  The lights on this plane were a yellowish color and it had a blinking light.  It was moving much slower than the object that had just passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Driving through city center. Looked to my left away from city as something caught my eye. Saw 3 totally black cigar shaped objects flying in a perfectly straight line, almost in formation, 1 behind the other at slightly different heights. They had no lights at all and were sillouetted against a bridge in the distance. They seemed to be even lower than a helicopter would fly. I drew a picture of these 3 cigar shapes when I got home and only have reported this now as I read about identical descriptions. I saw them for maybe 20 seconds before they passed. They weren&#39;t flying that fast but seemed to be silent. No noise like an aiircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then saw 12 more stars following the first three with one being brighter than the others.  I had my binaculars and noticed that there was no set formation and could only make them out as being stars traveling in the same direction at a very slow speed. I watched them for about five minutes and as they traveled out of sight towards the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a light haze around the pin point bright lights. They stayed in one area of the sky. I called a friend and described what i was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/23/06 21:00|Kansas City|MO|Changing|hours|parabollic bell glowing hot blue white|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49791.html|72|ndxe200603| parabollic bell glowing hot blue white<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some time now I have observed a very bright blue-white glowing object in the sky in the southwest of downtown KC. The striking thing is to a non-astronomer at first I thought this was a twinkling star.  It is not a star. It moves sometimes slow, sometimes fast and its brightness changes. I thought at first it was some sort of surveillance aircraft, it moves not linearly, but seems to be moving about the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I bought a spotting lens 30-90x.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight I was able to focus on it and was amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object changed form freqauently but had a basically tranlucent body with a dark orb at the bottom or within.   At times it appeared bell shaped with a glowing hot blue white band where the base of the bell would would be  base form was fairly smoot but appeared as though it was flowing in shape and nearly constantly changing shape. At the bottom of the bell or parabola was a dark globe like form. Not to be trite but the object looked like a taco bell logo, sort of. It&#39;s activity was similar to one of those static electriciy balls, a pulsing electric form, but with straight lines and a ring rather than truly static.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bell or parabollic form was a hazy white which seemed to rotate about itself slowly. It seemed to have stripes running from the arch to the base around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It rotated its nearly continually, so as to appear as though it was floating about itself. It was of intense brightness without magnification. It seemed 5-10 degrees elevated from the horizon.  It eventually took off to the west and suddently disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I viewed it a number of diffent ways.  At less magnification it looked like a parabola which was bright and squiggling. From this perspective it was multicolored including a bright blue white, with varous colors inlcuding red continually fluctuating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it rotated it also gave the appearance of a cylinder with the globe portion at the end. and with stripes of brighter light running the length of its body which seemed to rotate about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object always appeared translucent or nearly so. although not truly a triangle, it appeared to have an elonated parabollic triange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It behaves as though it is conducting a survey.  It is out at night regularly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was of such intensity that I have eye pain from watching it. I made some drawings of it.  I figured it for  some sort of reconisance craftbeing tested out of one of the numerous bases around here, and I say this because it truly gives the appearance of beig a bright star but doesn&#39;t behave like a planet in terms of its&#39; motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/23/06 19:25|Las Vegas|NV|Oval|2 – 3 minutes|Yellow Orange oval ring seen over the Northwest Las Vegas valley.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49796.html|73|ndxe200603| Yellow Orange oval ring seen over the Northwest Las Vegas valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around seven twenty PM, I was taking out the trash and happened to look to the east sky. Above the houses I noticed what appeared to be an oval shaped ring in the sky. All I could see is the outline, which was bright, and nothing inside of the oval. After a while (45 secs maybe?), the object begin to travel south (to my left) staying at roughly the same altitude. As it moved forward and to my left, it would advance and then double back slightly. It did this 4 or 5 times, and then stopped in midair. It began to grow in size, and I realized that the object was getting closer. Not willing to put myself in danger, as I was the only one around that I could see, I went inside. I came back out a few minuets later, and it was gone. I live in the flight path of both an air force base and an airport, and I see helicopters and military planes all the time. This object did not have any running lights like you would see on a helicopter or low flying plane, and it was all one color, a yellow orange glow. The object did not change its orientation to me much. The ring was thickest at the bottom left corner (to the north), and was thinnest at the top right corner (south) the object had two clearly distinct circles or spheres on the bottom left hand corner of the ring. These looked like beads on a necklace, and I could tell the object was facing me the same way because the circles stayed in nearly same position on the ring. I tried to see how big it was, and the ring would fit inside of my little finger. There were other aircraft, in the vicinity, but they did not seem to be chasing the object. If anything they were flying the flight path to the airport. I was the only one that I know that saw the object, and I have never seen anything like it before. I did not hear any sound nor were there any weird effects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked out the passenger side window and saw something rectangular about three feet away from me. I said &#34; Papa look &#34; and he said &#34;what?&#34; and then I felt it, it looked solid but felt like jello. I heard my voice singing a song that I had stuck in my head from quior that morning. Then I saw three lines that had looked a lot like the design on my shoes. My grandfather couldn&#39;t see it from where he was sitting (driving). I saw a square on top that was blueish and translucent. This is where I saw the lines that resembles on my shoe. Then it vanished very quickly from my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It sounded like a ping when take your fingernail to a crystal glass, or the sound of sleet when it is just starting. It woke the cat and the cat got up and stared at the window for about a minute, then jumped down and left the room (the pinging sound continued during this time).  After the cat left the room, I turned off the light and went to the window, opening the blinds.  I was just staring at the sky, when I saw this round object about the size of a small orange from my point of view.  It had yellow lights which covered the entire object, and the lights were flashing like Christmas tree lights.  I observed it for about six seconds and it was moving slowly.  It then disappeared and about five seconds later, it appeared up further in the sky.  After five seconds, it disappeared and I did not see it again.  I called the local TV station and the meterologist said there were no meterological events to report that night that would be anything like this object I spotted.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And we all knew that there was fire planes dropping either water or sand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked off to the west and seen 3 air craft moving towards me.  I ran down stairs to tell my friend to come see this.  The craft was moving so slowly that just as the craft was close enough to be seen, he went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the Triangle shaped craft crusing over head about 300 ft.  There was no noise. and they were moving so slow I thought they could fall out of the sky.  They was in perfect formation and the formation they flew in was also triangle, and each point on the craft had a light. they flew west for a ways then they cut back heading to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them flying until I could no longer see them.  Their speed was that of a air craft about to land. the whole thing lasted about 20 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was amazed cause I knew they were not of Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Indeed, they both show a string of bright lights, which appear to arc up into the night sky.  Our suspicion, however, is that they probably are not genuine UFO&#39;s.  They look to us more like lanterns, of some variety.  Just a guess, on our part.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a 9 min video of more than 25 lights traveling E over Phuket Island, Thailand<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following is my testimonial to the events that took place during a 3 week vacation trip to Patung Beach located on Phuket Island in southern Thailand, on March 22, 2006 at approximate 11:30pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The day started with less than favorable weather conditions, raining heavily throughout the day and into the early evening.  Later in the evening the clouds broke up and the night appear clear with a salting of small cumulus clouds and what appear to be a high layer of haze above the clouds making it difficult to see any stars and the moon was not in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 11:30pm, I had walk out on to the balcony of my second story room at the Tropica Hotel and while looking in the direction of Na-Kha-le bay (N by NW) I saw a dark red (almost ox blood colored) light rise up above the tree line heading in the direction of Rang Yai Island (E by NE).  My first impression was that that light was a helicopter of sorts but my curiosity rose a little after realizing that the light was not blinking.  Within the next 5 seconds a second and a third light appear with the same dark red coloring, rising above the tree line, nearly in line with the first light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This seamed odd to me so I quickly walked back into my room and grabbed my Canon ES50 video recorder in an effort to get a closer look.  Within the approximately 30 seconds it took me to grab my video recorder and turn it on, 5 of these lights had appear, all heading the same direction mentioned above, but now the color of the lights had changed to white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 minutes, over 20 of these lights had appeared still traveling in the same direction, on an incline of about 30%. It was clear that once they reach about the center of the island, just over the Kathu Cascades range, they began to ascend upwards at a near vertical angle.  While I was recording, some lights would pass behind the branches of the trees in the hotels court yard, obstructing their view only briefly.    I found it difficult to zoom in on a cluster of them without loosing focus.  Finally, after trying several times to get a close up, I decided to pan down into the court yard of the hotel with hopes to get the camera to focus and it appeared to work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put the camera on pause for a brief moment to move to the other side of the balcony to get a better angle.  I saw, what appeared to be the last light quite some distance from the others and in a clear patch of sky without any obstructions from branches.  I quickly zoomed in on the single light, which at this point was a dark orange color.  The light took on a triangular shape and moved as though it were traveling in an ‘s’ pattern but still holding the same general direction as the other lights.  I tried to zoom in more but lost the image.  As I zoomed out, the craft reappeared and then spun in a clockwise direction, disappeared for much less than a second then 2 small white lights appeared just slightly ahead of where the craft disappeared.  The two lights joined and created a burst of white light that began to gyrated until it formed a circle.  The next minutes of video taping was of this singular light pulsating from the center core at a very rapid rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found I was getting rather fatigued as my hand began to shake from trying to hold camera still for the entire course of this 9 minute video.  I zoomed out from the singular light and paused the camera.  In the next minute, I quickly exited my room and headed to the pool area in an effort get a better view.  Once I reach the pool the lights were gone.  I rushed back upstairs to the balcony in my room to see if they were still viewable from that angle but found they were not in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the bar at the hotel and to other bars on Bang-La Road asking others if they had seen these lights.  Evidently, no one had.  I scanned the local papers the next day for any<n>
3/22/06 23:00|Kokomo|IN|Light|Hours|Aircraft or Flares? Two flickering balls of light hovering for hours.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49779.html|79|ndxe200603| Aircraft or Flares? Two flickering balls of light hovering for hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the past two nights around 10 pm, there have been a number of light formations appearing in the west sky. At first I thought they were flares being dropped, but then after they kept re-appearing I noticed how they did not behave like free falling flares would. They did not decend in the least bit and their glow dwarfed the tiny flickering of aircraft that appeared off an on in the same area. I also realized that there was no military base in that area. They did appear like flares would though- simultaneously igniting and then vanishing in the same order and timing sequence in which they appeared- so they could just be a special type of training flare that would behave differently or parachute slower... but the more mysterious lights came later. I was doing a search for them when I came across the article of the person below me from the same area in Indiana. We saw the same type of lights, only I saw 2 and on a different night; tonight. In the same area of the sky that the flare-like lights appeared, there were, and still are, two bigger-than-star sized lights that are flickering and sort of just hanging out. They are not planes because they haven&#39;t moved left or right, or gotten bigger or smaller in hours. They are not planets because I know where venus and mars are located, and these are not them. These two lights, depending on how big they are, seem to be about a mile or two apart. They are flickering white/yellow/blue/red. These are not Helicopters. They are too high and too still. Helicopters do not hover for hours on end. The only other strange event of the evening is that a friend who also witnessed the lights said tonight that her business, which was toward the direction of the lights, began to suffer electrical surges when the lights came. Her store lights flickered and her computer shut off. She said she witnessed the flares, only once they dissapeared, it was only for a 2 seconds and they re-appeared and then was also told that other businesses in the same area were having power troubles. I&#39;m sure there is a reasonable explaination for this, but at the current time these are lights that belong to an aircraft which are not identifiable to me. Thus, I&#39;m calling them UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were extremely slow moving, almost at a stand still, along the side of a hill. They were both in the exact same position and then they, at the same time, moved so that they were perpendicular to the ground and hovered there. I couldn&#39;t slow down anymore than I had, or get off the interstate, so I just kept going and I don&#39;t know how long they stayed in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is posted twice, because I accidentally sent in the wrong day the first time, it was actually on March 22, 2006 instead of March 21.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He just had finished walking me home and was going down my driveway looking up. I waved over at the door and went back inside. then the lights flickered and the ground shook for a few seconds then my cell phone rang. It was my boyfriend yelling excitedly into the phone, claiming that he saw a UFO. I told him to calm down and please tell me the truth (since I believe in such phonomia) there was one orb like thing and the color of that was bright yellow while the path it left was changing colors from yellow to red to blue then faded. we heard no noise except for the ground shaking at my house. it followed an arc like pattern for three seconds before it went past some trees going North by Northwest. the size was about a quarter size smaller than a full moon, the sky was clear and there were some trees behind my house, but none in the parking lot where you could clearly see it. After he ran home and told his parents and friends (who dont believe) he sat and beat himself up over it but he does truly believe that he did see something and I believe him too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ps- we both had tension and painful burning sensations in our heads and stomachs but that could have been from excitment as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a very clear sky with many stars visible. I looked up to look at the stars and observed an incredibly fast, star like object about the size and luminocity of Venus shoot across the sky from South to North at amazing speed. (estimate? 3000+mph!) It all happened in less than a second, but I can be certain of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope this is of interest,<n>
3/21/06 21:05|Kokomo|IN|Disk|10 seconds|Large object of amber lights hovering very low.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49771.html|90|ndxe200603| Large object of amber lights hovering very low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday, March 21st, 2006 at 9:05pm my girlfriend and i pulled into the gas station to get some cigarettes. She went in and i stayed in the vehicle. I was looking down at the radio and changing stations listening for a good tune when my girlfriend returned to the vehicle. Upon her getting in i raised my head and seen directly in front of us multible amber lights hovering over Marsh Supermarkets about 100 feet high and a parking lot distance away form us. Very close! I started saying (in a raised tone of voice) to my girlfriend and pointing, look! look! what is that? She looked and saw it also, as it was starting to fade.  We were both astonished at what we were witnessing. We were on the corner of South Lafountain and Southway BLVD. facing east. These lights appeared to be in a disc shape and faded   from right to left in a rather quick motion. This object of lights being as low as it was and as close as it was seemed to be very large and silent. Now, this all happened rather quickley, about 10 seconds in all from the time i first noticed it. I am always watching the skies and have seen lights before like this but never in town and so damn close. Actually, it is a little nerving. MY girlfriend to my knowledge has never witnessed anything like this before and now i think she understands all the interest i and so many other people have in this subject. We both had a spectacular sighting of something very large, very low and very close with amber lights that just faded  quickly in a right to left motion and then dissappeared. This was just extrodinary to see. Wow!<n>

Pretty clear night with very light cloud cover. At first it looked like a fireball and we thought a plane was on fire. We watched it as it continued without any sound rather slowly with streamers or lights emitting from the fireball. The orb glowed bright orange and it looked as if the streamers were falling to the earth. Our whole family watched it until it left our vision. Sometimes it seemed to jerk around quickly. We live on a hill so we saw it for a long time then it seemed to go into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My sunroof was open and I had the radio up, so I didn&#39;t hear it, I glanced up and seen the bottom of it about 10 foot higher than the budget suites motel. The U.F.O. then became stationary (hovering) above Ave.k. exit. I watched and my friend as a witness (she was in the truck with me)all the way, going south to Lamar exit, we went almost directly under it. The U.F.O. seemed to have a circular suction cup underneath it with three bright rectaingular lights on bottom that went off and on randomly. As we passed and it was behind us it all the sudden dissapeared. I don&#39;t know wich way it headed or where it may have gone. I myself have seen this U.F.O. twice since that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We saw an orange ball w/flames around it. It looked about 10 times bigger than a normal star would in the sky. It looked low in the atmosphere, could see the glow, like a comment coming through. It also had a blue like tail behind it. It traveld downwards and over like an arch. About 3 minutes later, one of the wittness then saw another similar object falling directly down, except it was smaller in size. This object vanished out of view after only a couple seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3/20 12:15 am Husband was in the Safeway parking lot and saw a smiliar object as earlier. No tail was noticed.

It had no tail, it was a very solid brilliant white opaque ball. It was the size of a street lamp two blocks away (about 1/8 inch at arms length). Imagine a star, then group 100 of them together, that would be the size. It was actually brighter than the street lamps that are in this area two blocks away. Absolutely white. I&#39;ve never seen anything this size before, I watched Hale Bopp, I&#39;ve watched the Leonid meteor showers, all smaller or dimmmer. There was no fan out of light.

I saw a oblong round cylinder object that had five bright lights(like baseball diamond lights) going down the center of it vertically, then horizontally there was five rows of lights also, but not as bright as the center vertical lights. It had a rod sticking out of the top and also of the bottom of the cylinder. After watching it for awhile, it seemed to moved  from west to east and then at 6:35am it went up higho er and then went out of my sight. I am curious to know if it was a sattelite or a UFO. I also have no idea of who you call to report something like this. Maybe you could give me some information. Thank You<n>

There were a total of sixteen lights in the shape of a cross, four lights on each leg of the cross with no light in the center. It floated towards me in a slow moving counter clockwise spin, and after hovering above it then reversed the spin into a clockwise motion and was traveling away from me and back over the neighborhood. I watched as it drifted away and saw red flair like pods being dropped from its center, one after another, dropping a total of three before it disappeared into the night. 03/18/06 12:40 to 12:53 A.M.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Haze located all around the light seemed to be morning cloud cover considering it covered a much larger area than the light traveled as I watched. Stars were not visible towards the west where the cloud cover was minimal neither were they visible towards the east. The clooud cover that the light sat admidst of, at the time it was visible, was quite thick yet light seemed to be visible below the cloud line. It brightly represented itself 10 degrees to the right of your view if looking towards the east for the sunrise according to my view. Moon was still visible at the time and located towards the west. First sighted through tree line. Light had displayed itself in my line of sight, about half way up the hundred foot trees(approx) as I stood approx. one hundred yards away.  Rose in altitude semi-quickly. 10 minutes later light shown about thirty feet or 1/3 of tree&#39;s height(approx)above the tree that it shown through the midst of about ten to fifteen minutes previous. At this point it seems to be getting duller in light. My hypothesis considering the amount of decrease in the intensity of the light leads me to beleive that it may be traveling easternly slowly but is increasing in altitude dramatically. From the half hour mark when I walked out of view of this sight to about fifteen minutes after, the amount of wildlife and general noise coming from the wooded surroundings picked up dramatically. Birds came quick and plentiful. I have no idea if this has anything to do with odd light sighting but it was a very quick nature wake up if i must say so myself.At approximently forty five minutes after original sighting, sun is breaking the tree line, absolute no sign of bright light that was originally sighted, nor sign of anything resembling with lower intesity, which was my hope. At least to see some sign that it was really there. My guess is that this sight would have been easily viewable in the south eastern corner of Pennsylvania maybe as far as Philadelphia. Definetly would have been viewable from all locations in and around Berks County, PA.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was helping them take suitcases out of the trunk when I saw lights far away in the distance moving really slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured it was something I just never saw before and I pointed to it and asked my grandfather (retired army guy) &#39;Grandpa what is that??&#34;  pause.... &#34;Well that would be a UFO&#34;  completely deadpan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was low in the sky and was approaching very slowly.  Dogs started barking all over the neighborhood.  We stayed outside and watched it pass over.   It was very large and oval and had multicolor lights around the edges that slowly rotated as it moved forward.   It very slowly went off into the distance (I think we watched it for a long time) and I ran inside and called the police (more because I was hoping they would say what it was) and the dispatcher said he was getting tons of calls and he was assuming everyone had a lot to drink this St. Patrick&#39;s Day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next four hours the sky was full of helicopters with searchlights.  The newspapers reported the next day it was likely ultra lights in formation.  I have no idea what it was but you could see the solid bulk of it as darker against the night sky.  It made no noise either, and the lights weren&#39;t in plane formation.  My grandfather read the papers the next day muttering obscenities to himself the entire time.  He was quite annoyed that the there was no reliable explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My roommate who was also a witness didn&#39;t see what I was talking about at first until one of the objects gave off a bright reflection. I then spotted another similar craft further towards the horizon. We got off the bus at the 7/11 on lansdowne street west to get a better look. The closest object at this time appeared to be hovering then a change in its reflection (brighter) then it started moving towards the west horizon very quickly. We heard no noise, saw no lights. Perhaps weather balloons but I don&#39;t believe they can stop in mid air like these objects did. All to strange for me, this is not the first time I have seen stange craft in this region of ontario either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Cruzo la cuidad en segundos segun mi punto de referencia. ES importante notar que en otras oportunidades tambien ha sido observado en la misma trayectoria. Unos dias antes desfilaron f16 y Mirages en formacion y este objeto hace parecer el vuelo de estas aeronaves como un juego de niños. El objeto dejo una estela muy clara y no producia ningun tipo de sonido. No  hay duda de que rompio la barrera del sonido. El objeto era metalico, brillante y de forma aerodinamica, pero el mismo tipo de estela lo cubria en su proa. Calculo su velocidad en unos 3000 Km por hora en su punto mas alto de vuelo. Fue impresionante. El objeto fue captado en el momento que un helicoptero comenzo a volar en forma erratica con su proa fuera de control por un espacio de tiempo muy corto, eso fue lo que llamo la atencion en primer lugar.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared as a five pronged star with a blue dotted circle surrounding the bright white lights.  red dot flashed in the center at some points looked around the during the sighing and saw about 4 or 5 maybe even 6 forming a circle around us.  very weird we watched them for about a hour in the dark and observed them getting bigger and smaller and zooming in odd patterns, i was able to take one picture, of one of the things before my camera died, in the picture the object appears to be a three pronged star, but very hard to tell.  also observed a air plane fly very close to one. i know its saint patties day but what we saw<n>

It hovered at a distance moving in my direction, it literally  came right up to me. All I could see was the lights from underneeth. There were a total of sixteen lights in the shape of a cross, four lights on each leg of the cross with no light in the center. It floated towards me in a slow moving counter clockwise spin, and after hovering above it then reversed the spin into a clockwise motion and was traveling away from me and back over the neighborhood. I watched as it drifted away and saw red flair like pods being dropped from it&#39;s center, one after another, dropping a total of three before it dissapeared into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And it was very bright for a long time one on the ground and one in<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my camcorder set up in my back yard, and whenI looked at the tape I could see a point of light. At first I thought it was from a house but then a secound light came on next to the first light then a third light, then they all came together and became a very bright light,in the shape of a half dome. Then off to the West I could see on the tape two objects comming into view, and one came over the top of the one on the ground and as it did it started to become just as bright as the other one. Then the one on the ground started getting dim and the one on top stayed very bright, then the one on the bottom started to get bright again and they just stayed liked that for a long time, I couldn&#39;t see the secound one that came in from the West. I couldn&#39;t see any features they were so bright. Then the light on the bottom started getting dim, one by one and then you could see one of the lights on the ground move up to meet the bright one, which was getting dimmer, but when the object got to the top one it became bright again and then you could see the secound one going up but I could&#39;t see it very well. The third light just went out. And the object hovered for awhile then it stated to become dim again and changed it shape from half dome or round to a thin object like the clouds around it and it gets really long, then it just dissipates. After awhile I keep looking at the tape and I could hear a Jet go overhead, how many I don&#39;t know and I watch the tape to the end and could  hear the Jet or Jets again. and the tape ended. I have it on Hi-8 Tape, I hooked it to the T.V set to see if I could get a better look, but it was more clear on the Tape. It was also in the direction of a Naval Base. Called Crows Landing Naval Air Base. And also there are orchards and fields in that area also, and some homes, we live close to the edge of the city. The camcarder was pointed South-East.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had clear beans of light coming out of it, two red and two green lights were on the &#34;ship&#34;, there was a white has around it. The hase looked like a cloud moving around it and moving with it. The object made a hwow noise about five times and slowly went away. A light beam went near me as I stepped into it. It did nothing to me. It was like a almost blinding spotlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

But then I decided to walk out onto the gravel sidewalk we have on the property. I looked up and out of the corner of my eye i see a Plane, or something, that was flying pretty low and looks as if he is having trouble with turbulance. It is visable that it is going up and down while trying to ascend. Then as he passes by, I see a light way up in the atmosphere just to the right of the plane. I once thought it to be a star 5 minutes before i saw it. It was the color of a blue star, not bright though. I then see it move, from where i stand, 2 inches across the sky within 1/2 second and come to a complete halt. It then sits there for 2 seconds and just flares out. The whole night afterwards i keep hearing really odd sounds closing in on me. So i didnt go outside after that happened. The plane, or something, I saw after it flew by had no sound. It was a bright red light with 2 Red strobes on it. I couldn&#39;t quiet see the shape of it but for some reason it looked like it was a spinning craft that was about the size of a Fighter Jet. The thing is though it that it wasnt wide. From where i was standing it was about 1/2 inch wide and an inch tall. It was a rotating craft as i could see, but it was too dark to conclude this. The really odd thing about this craft was that it passed really low without generating a Sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They had said that they didn&#39;t know of any military planes flying over Middleboro last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Details: I was on my computer until I heard some loud noises outside. When I looked out of my window, I seen the triangular shape aircraft fly over my house. When I couldn&#39;t see the lights from that, another aircraft of the same kind went by my house. It kept on going until a few more came by at the same time, there was two or three this time and lined up, then kept on driving and broke the line then disappeared from my eye sight. I believe these were UFO&#39;s. I said there was on witness and that is me. But I talked to some people today and they said they seen the same thing. The hovercrafts looked like a triangle, with steadt lights at the bottom. I will draw it out on the e-mail I send you. I have seen air-planes at night before, but I know this wasn&#39;t an air plane because this looked a lot different then an airplane. The UFO&#39;s were flying low and much lower than normal air traffic. Anyways, Air Traffic does not come by this low and this frequent. After 20 minutes, this calmed down and got back to normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am only a student at school. I am not going to give my last name for safethy reasons, but yes, I would like to be contacted by e-mail if that is possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw what appeared to be a triangle on it&#39;s side at about a quarter mile ahead and just above the tree line. I could not see the triangle shape, but saw lights at each corner (three lights) that made up a form of a triangle. The lights were not blinking. I do not recall if there was a blinking light or not anywhere on the object. The aircraft appeared to be on it&#39;s side and appeared to be &#34;tumbling&#34; forward. It then leveled off and made a 90 degree turn. This aircraft was going very fast. This sighting took place about a mile from Kelly Air Force Base, Texas. I do not know what this aircraft was, but I do know three things: 1) I have never seen an aircraft tumble forward and then level off in this manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) I have never seen an aircraft travel at the rate of speed it was traveling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) I know of no aircraft that can make a 90 degree turn at this rate of speed, although the B-2 Stealth Bomber comes close, but I know that it does not tumble on its side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been observing aircraft for a long time and have worked on different types of aircraft in my carrer.

Once it reapeared, it started to glide around the sky at great speeds, yet it did it so gracefully. It continued to disappear and reappear at random locations. It continued to do this for about 10 to 15 minutes the it dissapeared one last time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

With my digital camera, I shot the first photo and the sky was completely blank.  The leaves of plants on my balcony were light green.  The apartments across the street were clear and lit as if it were a hot summer day.  I took more shots and all were the same.  I thought something was wrong with the camera and set it down.  About a half hour later, I noticed that the clouds were now elongated and more like storm clouds.  With the same digital camera I shot approximately 6 photos.  All were now normal for that time of day.  The leaves now were a dark color.  The apartments across the street were now dark.  I believe I was shooting straight into some sort of brilliant light, possibly a flash of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To my right was a wide open field were cattle are sometimes kept and to my left was a large mountain were Elk wonder. To my right in the field I saw 3 bright, white lights moving across the field, at least a 1/2 to 3/4 mile apart from each other looking like they were searching for something, scanning back and forth, and as I drove along the road watching them, the lights were always pointed in  my direction as a drove the probably 10-15 miles stretch along the field. They weren&#39;t bouncing, dipping in and out of sight like a 4 wheeler moving along hills, or weren&#39;t that yellowish tint of a 4 wheeler light. And no rancher i have ever known would be up that late doing anything on a Tuesday night, and it wasn&#39;t calving season, the only reason a rancher would be up that late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason this scared ((deleted)) me is because on the other side of the field about 30 or so miles alway is Douglas, WY, and I knew a guy that was a Fish and Game Warden and he said one night a few years before late at night a guy came in to their office and told them that someone was spotlighting deer in a field off the interstate and you could see the light searching for deer or antelope.  He and another man drove out to where the light was, watched it from the top of a hill moving from animal to animal moving along searching for something.  They drove down without their headlights on to sneak up on the poacher, but when they got to where the light was, there was no truck or 4wheeler or anything, the light was coming from above.  They looked up with their binoculars and couldn&#39;t see the belly of any aircraft of hear anything, and the light just kept moving as if it never saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I waited until I saw it land. Fear got the best of me and I zoomed off as soon as it landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I cannot explain what I saw.  It was not a meteor because it seemed too large and had no tail.  It was not an aircraft.  The light was pure white and dazzling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day my carpool mate picked me up.  I was only a few hundred feet from his house when I saw the light.  He had been watching TV in his living room which faced the same direction I had been walking.  He told me that the room had filled with a bright white light at the same time I saw the object.  So I had independent corroboration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Arlington police the next day to report it.  No one had seen anything.  I think the woman at the police station thought I was a nut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My carpool mate similarly thought I was nuts for reporting it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still can&#39;t explain what I saw.

It drifted away slowly at first then just shot off at a very great speed.  The White lights were very bright and the craft itself was dark and seemed to be large.  It was also hovering not so high in the air, above the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It then turned right and then right again, making a loop around the area.  We drove up to a school on a hill and saw the object as we drove.

(Actually So-East.) 208 runs from Oakland through Franklin Lakes then Wyckoff, Hawthorne, Glen Rock and Fair Lawn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the front windshield I spotted an unusual object roughly triangular in shape ahead and to the left. It was daylight and the object was easily seen though quite small. I would guess it was maybe 1 to 2 miles high. There was a lot of rush hour traffic, especially in the opposite lane and I would guess it was seen by many others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I travelled through Wyckoff the object shifted more to my left due to my movement. The object did not appear to be moving but I could not detect its motion due to my own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I was in Hawthorne, still on 208, the object was off to my left, and it was closer to me. It somewhat resembled a tent with 2 &#39;lines&#39; hanging below it. I don&#39;t mean lines like a kite, but short lines dangling just below it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally went passed it and had to turn my head up and back to the left to see it and it finally was too difficult to drive and look at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too high to be a kite, and resembled nothing I had ever seen in the sky before. It did not appear to be a hot-air baloon. That thought didn&#39;t even occur to me at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear day ,I mean no rain,a little cloudy, but average portland spirng day.I looked up and a triange shaped craft came straight down from clouds.Im guessing it was 150-200 ft from ground.  It leveled off in one swift movement, and stopped.I mean stopped on a dime! I saw no exhaust,nor did I see any lights.  It made no sound,but i was in a car.   Its color was black-ish.It hovered for about15 seconds.  Then with one swift movement it went straight up.  Fast-like a bullet,it was gone.  This may sound stupid.I got the impression it was no accident that I saw this &#34;craft&#34;,and my friend seated 1 ft. from me didnt?   For days later I &#34;felt&#34;it was no accident that myself and so many others see.  And that, way- more people dont?   Ego talking? maybe not!<n>

I saw a triangle shaped object apear from clouds and suddenly stop.I looked hard because of its size,and the fact that it stopped on a dime.As if it realized it was no longer hidden in the clouds.The color im guessing was dark, like blackish.The size was like (two)or (three) 747 airplains put together. Im able to approximate its size because off to the left was a comercial jet.Anyway this craft hung there for about (4) seconds,then with one movement it went straight up fast. Im talking really fast.The weard thing is it went point first like an arrow,but it was horizontal to the ground. But when it took off it was one movement,as it shot straight up it sort of changed shape.It was longer than it was wide,and probably about 300ft off ground. I saw no exhaust, nor did i hear any engines or jets.WoW.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was very clear and virtually cloudless. I was looking SE. The object, though small seemed to be changing shape and occasionally a red dot appeared at the top. After watching for ½ hour, I went outside with my 3.5 digital camera and took two photos. I returned to bed and watched as the object slowly rose over a period of about one hour to about 45 degrees. I then went back to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 16th, I opened the photos in my computer and blew them up to reveal two unusual exposures which I believe to be UFO’s?

Then a second flash.  I waited to see if there was anymore but after about 3 mins went back inside.  I have never seen anything like this before and with the clouds couldn&#39;t see a craft of anything so it may not be a UFO but when I searched &#34;flash of light&#34; and &#34;covington&#34; this site was one of the first to pop up on google.  I sure would like to know what it was.  I have not seen a UFO since I was a kid.

It was not going on a regular speed...sometimes fast and slowing down and going up and down and going to hide in a big cloud that was there. They where going left to right and somtimes doing a c motion....and one stop for like five minutes...and went to the cloud and they vanished.

I was&#39;nt surprised by this since our area is in the flight path of he local airport.  At this hour though, it is typically courier flights inbound from the US.  One other oddity was the fact that the oblect was going paralell to the flight path normally used by the aircraft.  The orange light was moving away from my position, slowly and did not appear to change altitude.  I did not see anyother craft at first and would estimate that it was around 2 miles from my position.As I watched, another orange light approached from the south and flew paralell to the first object.  The two craft then changed color to a dull red and seemed to elongate into an oval shape befor they sped off out of sight within seconds.  The red effect trailed out behind them and appeared to, &#34;wave&#34; as if in turbulance, (sic).  The sky was cloudly with an outside temperature of ) degrees celsius.  I watched the news and heard nothing of anyother reports in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The dots were north of me, and they appeared to be several miles away from me, about 70 degrees up from the horizon and falling very rapidly in a formation pattern, much faster than a plane or any object would normally descend, but I thought I was seeing a plane flying straight down and I said so to the person I was talking to on the phone, then the dots seemed to swirl around each other for an instant at about 30-40 degrees above the horizon and then immediately turned out of the descent and began moving parallel to the horizon, moving directly east for a few seconds, then they seemed to swirl around each other again and went straight down again, descending below my field of view which was blocked by a bunch of tall trees across the street. And that was it. I didn&#39;t see an object attached to the dots - just the white dots themselves. No trails, no haze, no glow, no sound, just white dots moving in a formation pattern descending, then flying east, then descending again below my field of view. I kept watching and did not see them reappear. A person was on the phone with me while this was happening and heard me reacting to the event (various exclamations and four letter words).<n>

The I saw a oval cigar shaped object moving about the same speed as my vehicle.  I observed this object as a silver shiny abject.  Then I though there was no such plane that had this kind of shine to it.  I stopped the vehicle to look at this more in detail.  I had a pair of binoculars.  When observing this alien aircraft through binoculars I could see that it was huge. It was really at a high elevation. I could see what look like several windows on the side of this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I didn&#39;t understand was how it was flying through the air at this speed and shape.

It was not moving and was the only visible light in the sky.  I could not see any stars.  I kept watching it.  Eventually, I went to get the binoculars for a better view.  I could see five or six square lights in a row: the middle light being the biggest.  Inside or behind these six lights was a brighter light that moved from the middle to the far right side.  There was no rhythm to the movement of the brightest light.  Sometimes the whole object would fade away, like it was going away from me, not across the sky like an airplane, but move back from me in depth.  I did see clouds moving across it.  The object stayed there in the same spot in the sky for at least 30 minutes.  I did not see it leave because I had to get in the shower however, I did make my husband get up and he saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could see an outline of a black triangle shape. There was alot of moon light out. It started to turn and as it turned there where 4 bright lights on the back. It was still moving slowly. I slowed to about 5 mph and watched it moving and then turned around to go the same direction it was moving. As I turned around it started moving up into the sky but the body of the craft stayed horizontal. That was the coolest thing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is the second time it&#39;s happened to a friend of mine, his story:<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said he was walking home from the store during the Monday night snowstorm and as he approached his building, he noticed three women in high-school cheerleader mini-skirts walking silently behind him (he mentioned that they were silent because he said that he only heard his own footfall as it crunched into the snow). When he turned back around he noticed what he first thought to be alot of police cars. Then he said because of the size of it, maybe a large construction crew working on Lyndale Ave N.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As he climbed the steps of his building, he noticed that the women had lined up side-by-side, standing at the foot of the steps but were facing and staring at the &#34;construction sight&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything was silent and this is when he said he got the sudden urge to run into the building.  He said he went straight to the Recreation Room because the window there gives you a direct sight to the street where the &#34;construction sight&#34; and the women were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when he got a clear view of what he said was this huge object hovering over the street about tree level.  It was silent, black, or either a very dark color, and had a row of flashing, dancing, lights running along the bottom perimeter of it.  He said what was also astonding is that the object was about as large as a football field.  &#39;<n> <n><n> <n><n> He also noticed that the street--which is usually busy--did not have ANY traffic at all.  (I was born and raised there too so I know this particular street and it is ALWAYS busy--just like a freeway.)  He said he then started running around inside the building to all his neighbor&#39;s, knocking on their doors trying to get someone to come and see the object--finally finding someone after approximately 15 minutes.  He said he told this person, &#34;Man, come and see this shit!&#34;  But when they got to the window, the craft was gone.  He said the guy then asked him, &#34;What shit?&#34;, and my friend said he told him, &#34;Man...NEVER MIND&#34;  He saw this very same object back in 1979 while with a group of friends. That sighting lasted for about 10 minutes as a triangular-shaped object moved slowly in their field of vision from right to left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must say that these encounters are similar in that there is an eerie calm and that sometimes no-one seems to be around or is arousable when these experiences happen--obviously &#34;they&#34; set it up this way.<n>

I walked out on to our porch (which is on the second story of the house) and I looked acrossed the street (which is on a right angle from our house)when I realized the sound was coming from that direction to see if the coyotees were that way. Out of the corner of my left eye I caught something in the sky that looked bright. It was &#34;falling&#34; in a straight line from left to right yet at a downward angle, it appeared to be in the sky over the Beaverton or Hillsboro Area. It was just above the line of a tree in our yard, and over the lights of the town. My first reaction was that it looked like a HUGE shooting star but then my brain connected that it was not white but a very bright Aqua (blue green) color.. not a regular blue.... and it was pretty big.... much larger than any falling star I&#39;ve ever seen. Sort of a firey looking bright aqua colored light. I yelled for my family because the door was still open and I really didn&#39;t know what I was seeing. It lasted long enough for me to think they would actually be able to get to where I was at and see it, but at the last moments ...as it seemed to get to it lowest point it suddenly swooped back up in a circle (rounding over itself and coming back around), then in a kind of figure eight and then basically made a bunch of very eratic moves...in a really much faster and crazier pattern. honestly the closest description I can give is that it looked like a ballon losing its air... a kind of crazy dance right at the end... and then it just disappeared. Before it did the circles though it was going very straight and fast at an angle towards the ground. It was very clear .... no clouds skewing my view..... and I saw it distinctly. I don&#39;t know what it was, so I won&#39;t even speculate, but I can say I For SURE saw what I saw and know it wasn&#39;t any kind of plane or ballon or regular aircraft I&#39;ve ever witnessed before. It left me feeling pretty odd since it was so big and in such plain site. No matter what it ends up being I&#39;d love an explaination!<n>

Approximately 4 to 5 miles from Leon I noticed a light in the sky that was lower then a star and that kept going out then appearing again.  At first I thought it might be a planes landing light that went out when turning, but this light would go out and then reappear in no time at all.  I kept watching it and about 2 miles from Leon I told my wife to watch the light.  She looked up and saw the light and a second light appeared. The lights stayed lit for about 10 to 15 seconds and faded out one at a time.  Within 10 seconds, three lights appeared and stayed on again for about 10 seconds and unlike the two that fade out, the three lights went out abruptly and did not reappear. I would say that they were about 500 to 600 feet up. I would also say that putting your hand out in front of you palm extended that you would have had to turn your hand sideways to cover the lights.  Also, the lights were white, and the three lights had a little arch to them.  It was awesome!<n>

I seemed to be the only on wacthing this object at the time because the other three witnesses were talking about soccer. I told them to look at the craft above the tree&#39;s they saw it but really could not really make out what it was. The driver said it was probley a helicopter. To me it was to big to be a heilcopter and to flat. I wacthed it until it was out of sight. The other two witnesses say it was a plane or helicopter.

It was about 2:00am.  I was several miles south of Belle Glade approaching its small suburb of South Harbor.  It was a clear dark night and the stars were out. Lake Okeechobee was on my left to the east just beyond a retaining dam or dyke and a swamp was just to the east of me on me on my right.  There was what I think was a sugar cane processing plant aglow in a cluster of lights on a hammock about a mile away in the marsh.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly a bright green object traversed my windshield from right to left on a downward path at a slight angle.  It was a glowing iridescent green triangle open in the middle with a smaller triangular cutout.  It looked like one of those fancy new odd shaped Frisbees that kids toss around in the back yard.  Its relative size on the windshield was each leg of the triangle was four or five inches in length.   The object began to fall in a graceful falling leaf fashion, flipping and flopping in several different directions as it descended. Then it faded away and disappeared from view.  My girlfriend was looking out the side window of my truck, the window being open, and saw what appeared to be the same object doing the same maneuver.  I was apparently seeing the reflection of the object on the interior of my windshield while she was actually viewing it. What was astonishing is the reflection itself was very vivid like an image on a liquid crystal T.V. set.  The color, the shape, and the movement of this object sets it apart from anything I have ever seen before.  So far media or law enforcement sources have not corroborated this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the third UFO I have seen in my lifetime (I am 65) but the first one I have ever reported.  I have decided to include the details of the other sightings although I cannot remember the exact dates of these sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Varadero Beach, Cuba, winter of 1954  I was just thirteen years old and had just jumped off the bus with my Cuban friend, nicknamed Pupi.  It was midnight and we were returning from the movies.  It was a clear cloudless night and the stars were out and shining bright in the night sky.  We were walking along a road that paralleled the beach.  Suddenly in an instant it became as bright as day and I could see a woods a half a mile away.  Trees, houses and every visible object stood out in stark relief as if they were caught like a snapshot by the flash of a giant camera.  Then an object appeared going in the opposite direction of our travel.  It was a round luminous white disk.  It could have been a saucer shaped disk flying on its edge or I could have been viewing a round object.  Other than the flames there appeared to be no other details such as structures or lights. From the trailing edge or rear of the disc sprouted a dozen or so blue flamelets like the flames on a gas stove turned down to a low setting.  I estimated the object to be about fifteen hundred to two thousand feet in altitude and about a half mile away.  Its relative size at that distance was about the size of a melon.  I have often wondered how an object responsible for producing so much light could be easily viewed, not appearing as an intense overwhelming blinding light with no discernable shape because of the glare. What was amazing was that this object appeared in a night sky with a starry background while the whole landscape was bathed in light.  Apparently this same object was seen over and over again and reported to the media. It was once described as a glowing disc that cart wheeled through the air.  This disk did not appear to spin or cartwheel but appeared to be flying in a steady fashion with a leading edge and a trailing edge that spouted flames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rockford, Illinois, early Nineties  I was just about to enter a bicycle shop on the south side of Rockford.  It was midday with a clear blue sky and a few clouds.  Before I got to the door of the shop I stretched and as I did this I looked up and saw something I couldn’t identify. It appeared to be a light silver oval or disc shaped object.  I was seeing it not from the side but possibly balancing on edge like an egg carefully placed upon its end in some kind of magicians trick.  It hung motionless several hundred above me at about an eighty degree angle from where it was soaring above some telephone wires. It was actually hard to determine its altitude and size.  Its relative size from my vantage point was that it was the size of a (egg shaped) manhole cover.  I thought it might be a balloon but balloons tend to rise and to my recollection high altitude weather balloons are sent aloft under inflated to compensate for the reduced pressure of the atmosphere there. This thing was fully “puffed up” so to speak and it was not moving at all and not rising. I decided to go into the bike shop and get some witnesses to help me possibly identify or verify what I had seen or verify that I had seen it at all.  But just as I entered the shop I became embarrassed, feeling like some kind of irrational lunatic. So I quickly went outside to see if it was still there.  It was gone.  It was not some distant dot high in the sky or any where on the horizon of my view.  It had totally vanished.<n>

The only lights around us were the stars in the sky, and everything else was pitch-black darkness surrounding us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached the town of Belle Glade to the right of me high up in the sky about three hundred yards away were little rows green lights in the form of a diamond with a reddish hue on the outer edges.  This diamond-like object was about what appeared on the ground at eye level to be about the size of a child’s size small diamond kite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was trying to make out what those lights could possibly be, the form of lights seemed to start falling like a leaf in the wind and then before I knew it, the whole lighted phenomenon disappeared without a single trace.  It moved as if it was as light as a feather that was rocking back and forth in the wind in a carefree fashion.  I can’t explain what this could have been, as I have seen nothing like this before.  My boyfriend who was in the drivers seat had also seen what I had seen, although he had seen the reflection of this through the front window of the car.  I don’t know what this sighting was, but it was beautiful and remarkable at the same time and I was disappointed it went away so quickly.<n>

I called my girlfriend to see it.They were adjacent to the two stars an the big dippers handle and slightly smaller distance apart. they moved in one direction parallel to the handle quite slowly (about the same speed as one might see in a high moving plane). They were too high to have been a plane as well as not hering any noise associated with them. I work with helicopters quite frequently so am sure it was not a sighting of this nature.  As they move in the same direction the first slight began to fade as if it was drwing upward and the second followed shortly after. It was a totally clear night and know that it was not a couple of planes or other objects that i could explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And she got feeling there was something strange about the thing then it glistened and it was shiny. It had a strange pattern of movement. It was a significant size, possibly the size of a roof or even a house.&#34;  The witnesses watched it for a couple of minutes, rotating in the distance and heading towards Wandsworth Town. Then, as soon as it had appeared it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness said if it was a piece of rubbish it would have caused severe damage when it came down, because of its size and density.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it had not been notified of any sighting of the pyramid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;The MoD does not have any expertise or role in respect of UFO/flying saucer&#39; matters or to the question of the existence or otherwise of extraterrestrial lifeforms, about which it remains totally open-minded.&#34;  He said it examined the reports of UFO sightings it received solely to establish whether what was seen might have some defence significance, namely whether there was any evidence the UK&#39;s airspace might have been compromised by hostile or unauthorised air activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses said there has been a lot of activity in the skies over Putney recently and they had seen several Chinook helicopters over the past week and believe something must be going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A spokesman for the MoD said the helicopters were probably part of general aviation traffic over London and there was no specific activity or event they were involved in.

He pulled, bolted straight into the neighbours yard.  I did not have his regular leash which is longer (for walking), this is just his go out and do your biz leash.  As I said, he bolted straight for the yard....when he got to the grass, from the pavement, he came to a complete stop....barked up a storm, his hair was up on end, and I could not calm him down for anything.  While I was startled by the running and the barking, I was oblivious to anything that might be about. But when he stopped, and I was ready to get down on him, and make him sit...I noticed/heard/felt...I have no idea.  I knew he had something in his field of vision that I only felt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog barked, jumped back a step, and then I saw it...I saw the eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was frozen, incredulous...could not believe that I saw what I was seeing.

It was very hard to make out how large they were and soon a group of people from the wedding had gathered and were debating as to whether they were helicopters etc. Soon another light appeared over the hill to the north of Matauri Bay and slowly rose in the same direction. by now the first two had risen and were slowly becoming fainter. There movements were somewhat irrational as was there speed seeming to move slowly and then very fast. This continued until we had counted nine in total, usually only three in the sky at any one time but all moving in a similar manner and in the same direction. Only logical explanation could possibly be that someone north of Maturi Bay is very good at making Hot air balloons and does so on a semi regular basis as there have been numorious sittings of a very similar describtion???????<n>

From my terrace I watch planes take off and land frequently, so i&#39;d like to think that I know the types of aircraft that usually soar above and their capabilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That being said, I was star gazing - as best one can next to a major city - and had my telescope fixed on the Orion Nebula.  I had withdraw my eye from the eyepiece and glanced up at the Orion Nebula with my naked eye when I saw a miniscule reddish dot that seemed to be flying far higher than any commercial aircraft that i&#39;ve seen.  Here&#39;s where it gets odd though:  It was moving erratically.  It took an S-like swurve around and through the bottom two stars of the Orion constellation.  Depth perception made it appear about the same size at the stars.  This object was far, far too small to notice any flashing lights and you&#39;d normally be able to make out if it were an airplane flying at 30,000ft.  Again, it was barely a dot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had went to the telescope to see if I could zoom in on it but by the time I finished calibrating, the thing had vanished.<n>

I was walking west down N. Rowland Drive in Camarillo and I happened to glance upwards.  I saw what appeared to be a light traveling around the star Sigma Cassiopeiae, also called &#34;Ruchbah&#34;  I saw it circle once and once it broke from the circle it traveled south west a short distance before quickly fading out. I would say the radius of the circle was a fourth of an inch or a little more at arms length. The object was slightly brighter than the star originally, and was whitish in color. When I first caught sight of it it seemed to be transitioning from one direction of motion, to another, and entered the circle shortly thereafter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My exact coordinates at the time were 34 degrees 13&#39; 30.23&#34; N   119 degrees 02&#39;45.74&#34; W at an elevation of 143 ft above sea level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving slightly faster than a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I just learned of your site from the Discovery channel. The date of the siting is within 30 days of event date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in the northern most part of Bakersfield California, In a small sister city called Oildale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I left our house traveling west bound on seventh standard road  just as the sun was setting, The sun had already dropped behind the mountians, but the sky was still illuminated enough to see. The moon was in the southwest portion of the sky over the city of bakersfield. The moon was halfway between straight up and the horizan, The sky was completely clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was enough light from the sunset that you could still makeout a blue tint to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon was 1/3 crescent and looked like a giant sized cereal bowl slightly tilted as if it was spilling some of it contents. Thats what attracted my attention to the moon and I said to my son jokenly, Look the moon looks like a cereal bowl, maybe thats what GOD eats his breakfast out of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son who was 12 years old at the time started asking me some questions about the moon so I pulled off the road to look at the moon safely. We exited the car looked and talked about the moon for 2 or 3 minutes or so and just after I answered his last question. &#34;remember the sky is clear and there is still just enough light to see faint blue sky&#34;. The background was faint blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we both where looking directly at the moon something like a dark, fuzzy like cloud started to move in front of the moon from the left side to the right, But there was no clouds. None! It was like the cloud/ship? was only visible as it moved in front of the moon and only at the right edge of the moon as it moved across.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is where it really get strange and hard to discribe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this thing moved from the right side of the moon to the left, as more of it moved in front of the moon it changed from fuzzy dark smoky cloud looking to horizontal lines as it moved across in front of the moon. But the lines where like see through so you could see the moon through it. But you could still make out the lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like this ship, craft whatever it is. Was projecting an image from the outerspace side of it to the earth side of it and was having technical difficulties and not doing a very good job of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It only seemed to have trouble projecting the moons image, Because before it moved in front of and after it passed the moon it was invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the size. It must have been huge because it covered the whole moon with its lines/image as it passed. The lines where something like when you get to close to a bigscreen TV. It was like there was a image line then a thinner black line then image line then thin black line etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed seemed slow. It took aprox 2 min maybe slightly less to pass completely in front of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I saw a metallic flash through the tree branches and thought &#34;there&#39;s the plane&#34;.  But then, I saw several other metallic flashes and I stepped out into the open looking up.  There was a configuration of 10-12 metallic-type balls.  At first I thought they were balloons, but that didn&#39;t make sense.  Then I thought they must be birds which also made no sense.  The sky was clear blue but was surrounded by heavy clouds to the east over the Santa Cruz mountains.  I watched as they seem to &#34;float&#34; across the sky and I kept trying to figure out what they were.  There were no fins, appendages or moving parts.  They were perfectly spherical and silver.  Then I realized they were flying in a formation of several groups of three to four in each group.  The center group consisted of three.  They seemed perfectly spaced.  Suddenly, the left sphere in the lead group instantly &#34;dipped&#34; towards the lead sphere and then darted back into its previous location.  I watched them move from northeast to southwest heading towards the Monterey Bay.  I called the newspaper to find out if anyone else had reported seeing spheres in the sky flying in formation. They told me no.  I live approximately four blocks from West Cliff Drive in Santa Cruz City.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather had cleared, the sun had been shining for a couple of hours and so I know there had to be lots of people jogging, surfing and walking their dogs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t believe I am the only one who witnessed this phenomena.  I talked to my husband, who has a Ph.d in quantum physics and chemistry.  He suggested balloons..maybe someone let a bunch of balloons go at the same time---but as I told him  &#34;  Since when do balloons fly in formation?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used to work on the original F/A-18 program at Patuxent Naval Air Station.  I know a little something about aircraft.  These were no aircraft and were definitely metal or metallic.  They were so bright with the sun shining on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other observation I found weird was the silence.  The air was still, there were no birds singing, everything was just quiet.<n>

I was observing the plane mainly for a con-chemtral when i noticed just behind the plane on both ends of the wings of the plane where to hawk shaped objects paceing the plane they where both the same distance behind the plane about a thumbnail length but seemed to be just higher then plane they looked like two souring hawk at high altitude but they flew at the exact same speed as the plane, they and the jet plane flew  pretty much right over my head and off to the north going extremely fast I just kept looking and looking saying to myself no no no hawks dont fly at the same speed and hieght of a jet air plane I have been perplexed ever since that bazarre event oh every one in traffic was laughing at me as i pulled myself back through my car window<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.

3/11/06 05:45|Pittsburg|CA|Fireball|5 minutes|Five sightings of glowing red orange fireball object over Pittsburg, CA|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49526.html|211|ndxe200603| Five sightings of glowing red orange fireball object over Pittsburg, CA<n> <n><n> <n><n> As of March 11, 2006 at around 5:45 am I encountered a bright red orange circular object in the sky. During the time I was delivering newspapers at Kirker Creek apartments when in my car I looked up at the sky facing north I saw a bright red orange fireball type object in the darken sky.  You couldn&#39;t miss it. It was travelling at a slow rate at a low elevation around and above 500 ft in the air.  I observed the object carefully to see if this was a plane or helicopter but all I could see was a bright red orange glow all around the object.  There were no beacons of light flashing on it like a plane nothing I could spot similar to a plane was on this object.  This object though had this slow strobe blinking on it.  I watched this object fly in the sky for five minutes or more. It was heading south toward a patch of clouds as it entered the clouds I could not see it any more the object did not exit the patch of clouds as I presumed it disappeared in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not my first sighting, as I witnessed this object 4 times in the past 2 months during the same time at around 5:30 am while delivering newspapers in the same area in Pittsburg on Railroad Ave and Buchanan in the neighborhood where Hillview Jr High is at. My first sighthing was in the middle of Janurary of this year on a Wednesday same time. I was on the street of Redondo Dr. and Railroad when I looked  up and saw a red orange light and had the same slow glowing strobe blinking, it was travelling at a slow rate heading east it was at a low elevation and the object didn&#39;t make a sound at all because this object was above and near me I could have heard plane noise from it but I didn&#39;t, so I started following it in my car untill I lost it the incoming clouds. I have never seen anything in the sky like what I was. I&#39;ve seen so many planes in the night sky that this object differed from any other plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second sighting happened two weeks after the first sighting, end of Janurary. This sighting happened on Saturday around 5:30 am again I was in the same area. I was on  El Dorado Dr just a few blocks away from Redondo. I was facing south west when I suddenly saw this time two bright red orange lights come from the south as the two objects where flying parallel to each other at the same rate of speed. The two objects were coming towards my direction at a fast rate of speed like above 100 mph a sec then then the two objects slowed down at the same time and they were on the same low elevation I saw before. I just watched the two objects fly north into a patch of clouds as I lost them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third sighting happened in Feburary this time I was on Buchanan and it was wednes day around 5:30 am again. I saw the object fly south at the same rate of speed and elevation and same physical characteristics I&#39;ve been witnessing. I watched it for two minutes and then looked away from it for a couple of seconds as I kept on driving.  Then I looked back at the direction I saw the object was at and I could not find it anymore I looked all around in the sky and it was a clear morning. At the slow rate it was going I could have seen it pass by me even though I looked away from it I know this for fact because when I see a plane fly by I could still see pass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fourth sighting happened on the last week of Feburary on Saturday the 25th two weeks after todays sighting same time around 5:30 am. I was at Kirker Creek apartments when I looked up at the sky facing north I saw the same exact object. I observed it very carefully as it was flying and hovering in the sky at a low elevation. I can see it always flew in an quick stuttering up and down motion as it was doing this the oddest thing happened nothing like I saw in my previous sightings there was this tiny but visable object coming out underneath the main object it had the same color and form and it was coming down very slowly toward the ground like in a hovering and floating movement. As it was coming down the tiny object started to fade away until you could see its color any more. It vanished away. The main object just continued fly ing south into the clouds when I lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again what I&#39;ve been seeing is a bright red orange fireball type object in a circular shape flying at a low elevation in the area above Railroad ave and Buchanan Pittsburg CA at a time around 5:30 am. I mainly see this object whenever the clouds start to come in and after rainy weather when there&#39;s a mix of patchy clouds and a clear sky.<n>
3/11/06 05:30|Rockport|WV|Light|10 minutes|Vertical line of three blue and red lights about three or four times the size of stars or planets well above the southern horizon.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49674.html|212|ndxe200603| Vertical line of three blue and red lights about three or four times the size of stars or planets well above the southern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I wrote about this last week, but apparently did not enter the state correctly because it did not appear in the desciption I saw after I posted.  Also, when I entered my summary, I put &#34;horizontal&#34; instead of &#34;vertical&#34; to describe the lights.) On both March 11 at 5:30 AM and on March 13 at 1:00 AM, I saw lights in the southern sky that appeared to be at a far distance. The lights were in a vertical line and appeared to be blue, red, and blue. I watched both nights for about 10 minutes. On the 11th, the configuration was in the south east, and on the 13th it was almost due south - perhaps slightly to the west. The sky was overcast in the southern area on the 11th and totally overcast on the 13th, but on both nights I was able to see the lights very distinctly. They appeared to be at least three or four times as large as most stars and larger than any planets I&#39;ve seen including Venus or Mars. The closest description I can think of is airplane lights, but they did not move and they were in a vertical line. Because I can hear the interstate highway from my home, I couldn&#39;t tell if there was a sound coming from the lights, but it seemed that there was the same kind of humming sound I&#39;ve heard airplanes make at a high altitude. I&#39;ve never seen a satellite from earth, so it is possible that my sighting was of a satellite. I have attempted to find photographs of satellites on the internet, but have not been able to find anything that looks like what I saw. The lights did not blink or move at all in the time I watched. Although I assume a satellite would be above the clouds, and it was a cloudy night, it may be that there was a break in the cloud cover. Eventually on the 13th, the clouds did move and cover the object.<n>
3/11/06 05:30|Rockport|WV|Light|At least 10 min|Horizontal bar of single blue and red lights in the southern sky with lights appearing to be about the size of large stars|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49630.html|213|ndxe200603| Horizontal bar of single blue and red lights in the southern sky with lights appearing to be about the size of large stars<n> <n><n> <n><n> On both March 11 at 5:30 AM and on March 13 at 1:30 AM, I saw what looked like a very bright bar (or single line) of lights or stars in the southern sky. On March 11, it was in the south east, on the 14th, it was almost due south (my house faces directly solar south, and it was slightly to the west). The row of lights was about the length of a quarter of the circumference of the moon, but they were placed vertically with blue at the top and bottom and red in the middle and were about the size of very large, very bright stars. It was impossible to tell if it was a line of stars or lights or a continuous bar of color, but it looked more like 3 stars - blue, red, blue. The night was mostly clear on the 13th, but the lower part of the horizon was slightly overcast. The moon was apparently already down in the west, because my first impression was that it was probably a reflection on the moon. Then I realized that it was definitely not the moon, and the moon wasn&#39;t visible. On the 13th (at 1:30 AM), the sky was very overcast with no stars. The moon was visible behind the clouds, and the night was bright in spite of the clouds. The object was very bright and appeared to be among rather than behind the clouds. I watched it for about 10 minutes each time; the first time, I went inside because it didn&#39;t seem to be doing anything and I assumed it was simply some brightly colored stars. But on the 13th, I watched until it seemed to be covered by the clouds and disappeared. It did not move at all except for appearing at different places in the sky on the two different nights (or early mornings). It almost looked like airplane lights, but the line of lights was straight up and down and it didn&#39;t move closer or further away or change position. In addition, there was a slight sound that seemed to be almost like an airplane engine. However, I can hear the interstate from my house, and I couldn&#39;t discern whether or not it was cars on the interstate or if it was coming from the lights. I don&#39;t know what it was, but I am absolutely sure it was not a plane, a radio tower, the moon, or any star or planet configuration I&#39;ve ever seen before. One of the weird things was that I saw it more to the east at 5:30 and more to the west at 1:30. Another strange thing was that it appeared to be closer than some of the clouds, appearing below them, but was covered by lower lying clouds, although it may just be that there was simply a break in the clouds on both nights that permitted viewing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One of the five objects splits off into three seperate objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unbelievable!  My son and I sighted 5 objects in the night sky that were independant of each other over a 40 min. span.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had sighted a vapor trail from an airliner moving east to west and noticed a glowing object approaching the airliner at high speed and accelerate around the airliner and disappear off in the distance. 3 times we observed this from one location.  We then drove home got out the binoculars and lawn chairs and sighted a 4th object moving at high speed east to west, we tried to get a bead on the object with the binoculars but, had a hard time getting a focus because of the velocity at which the object was traveling when all of a sudden it splits off into 3 seperate objects!  One of them appeared to bank off to a due south direction, and accelerate out of sight in seconds, looked like it jumped time. While the other two maintained there same velocity and banked off the northeast &#34;Stacked on top of each other.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could never determine a shape or clean lines to the objects, they appeared as if they had an ullumination surrounding them that you couldn&#39;t make out a distinctness. Sky was exceptionally clear, no wind, probly 68 deg. F. Really neat sighting! Really nice machines!<n>
3/10/06 21:00|Whittier|CA|Oval|About 35 minutes|Red Shimmering Object over Whittier California|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49567.html|215|ndxe200603| Red Shimmering Object over Whittier California<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Whittier Ca. I recieved a phonecall from my husband on Friday March 10,06 about 8:40pm telling me to run outside and view this big red light object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran out with the cordless phone still in hand.  He was about 2 miles or so from home at his Dad&#39;s house off of Meyer and Imperial.  As he had arrived at his dads getting off his car he said he looked up at the moon, (1/4 moon that night), and saw this big glowing red object.  As he watched it for a minute or so, it appeared to be dropping something or shooting something out the bottom.  He said it looked like possible flames, or lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I viewed from my front yard, it was stationary.  It sat at about 2 miles or so in the south/east sky, I was looking towards the right and up from my driveway.  It&#39;s kind of hard to judge the distance from me. It wasn&#39;t real high up either, but it shimmered a vibrant red that you really couldn&#39;t get an accurate shape of it. It appeared as being oval.  Now thinking back, I&#39;d say with an arms length measurement, it appeared to be about the size of a hot air balloon, not too high up and not too low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were experiencing a storm from Alaska at this time, but the skies were pretty clear. There was some clouds around, but not in the area of this object. The sky was really clear in the area it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it in awe I began calling alot of family and friends so they could see it.  In years past I have viewed some strange objects, etc, and I wanted everyone I know in this area to see this.  The only ones I got a hold of were my two brothers.  One, who lives in Montebello, and the other who was visiting here from Hesperia.  He had been here earlier in the day and went to do some visiting in Montebello, taking my youngest son with him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was stationed in this position for about 5 minutes, then slowly started moving towards the north/east, and then became stationary again.  This time I was looking at it directly infront of me.  It sat directly above the house across the street now, and just to the right lower area of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it sat there for about 7 to 10 minutes it started doing a slow flashing.  It would go off and on with a duration of about 4 seconds in between flashes.  It flashed this way maybe about 5-6 times, then stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live on a busy street, Gunn Ave and Mulberry Dr, and I can&#39;t believe that all the cars driving by didn&#39;t even notice it.  Nobody was pulling over to look at it!  At about this time, my brother and son arrived. I had called them on the cell phone to tell them about it. They were on their way here to Whittier from Montebello. They weren&#39;t even a full mile from here when I called.  They pulled over and saw it from the intersection of Laurel and Lambert, then kept driving here keeping it in view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they arrived, it was still stationary across the street from my house.  We watched it as it started to flash again with the same amount of duration.  As I watched with them now for another 5 minutes or so, it started to slowly move again, still going in a north/east looking direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped again.  This time it looked to be in the area of Whittier Blvd and maybe Colima.  It appeared smaller at this distance, but you could still see it.  It became stationary again, and started to again flash a few times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point it went totally dark, like it had disappeared.  It was out for about 10 seconds, then came back on.  It started moving further away, and by this time the clouds in that area of the sky from the storm seemed to swallow it up and we couldn&#39;t see it any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon discussing with my brother from Montebello of his account from that distance away, he was able to run and get his binoculars.  I could have ran in my house to get a camera, but was afraid I would miss something, so I just watched and called everyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said through the binoculars, even at a distance of about 8 miles west of my house that the object appeared to be of a triangle shape.  He must of had some good binoculars, because I thought it looked to be oval. Again it was shimmering alot, so I couldn&#39;t see the exact outline of it.  At one point he said a different colored light on each end of the triangle came on.  A green one, yellow one, and I think he said a red one.  To me, the whole time it appeared to be a very vibrant ruby red shimmer.  When I saw it flashing on and off, he said that it was flipping.  The kind of flipping you would get from flipping a coin. From his distance, he said at arms length it appeared to be the size of his thumb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t explain the differences in our views of the shape, only that he may of had an advantage with using the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just an awesome sight to see!   When discussing its viewing with my husband later in the evening, he said the flight pattern of the airplanes seemed to have changed too, as if being diverted away at a further distance.  My son also commented at the time of the viewing that its strange we weren&#39;t seeing any jets being sent out to investigate.  Didn&#39;t anybody else see it???<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also remembered a few years back that a very similar object had been spotted in Montebello and Monterey Park Ca too.  It came out in the Montebello Newspaper.  I also found it posted on this site:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.100megsfree4.com/farshores/ufo03us6.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else in this area seen the same thing, please post it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I am not sure of the time but it was approx. 8:30 pm. The sky was very clear &amp; the moon had not risen high enough to wash out the stars. There were also several commercial aircraft flying at different altitudes. Some were on approach to Charlotte Douglas &amp; some were much higher. We did not see a craft. We saw the first 2 bright white flashes about 1 second apart. Then after approx. 7-8 seconds, we saw 1 more flash in the same spot. We didn&#39;t see anything else. Since we couldn&#39;t see any shape of a craft &amp; didn&#39;t hear any sound, we are assuming that it was from something high in the sky. It very well may be something quite &#34;earthly&#34; &amp; not a ufo. Approximately 5 minutes later we observed a moving craft that had a bright white light on the front and a blinking white light behind that light. It was traveling very fast compared to the commercial aircraft in the sky &amp; was low in the sky, also traveling towards the North. I watched it through the binoculars until it disappeared behind the treeline &amp; could not see an outline of the craft. We had a similar sighting of the flashing lights last year that was also reported to this site. We live a mile outside of the city of Rock Hill, away from city lights. My husband is a computer executive &amp; I am a scuba instructor &amp; travel agent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both have traveled in planes extensively &amp; I was formerly in Civil Air Patrol &amp; earned my observor wings as a teenager to look for crashed airplanes. I would appreciate hearing whether anyone else saw the flashes of light.<n>

I like to try to spot planets and various stars. I was looking eastward and I saw what looked like a reddish-orange star. I thought maybe it was Mars, but after a few seconds it disappeared. The moon was full and I could see that there were no clouds in the area.  There were some trees but they never blocked my view. I kept looking around thinking maybe it was a light on a tower but I never saw it again. I only think that it could be a UFO. I am not sure, but it was really odd. Starry Night Pro shows that Mars was more to the west of where I saw this object. Anyway, planets and stars don’t just stop shinning like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume the witness means a date of March 10, not May 10.  We have altered the date above.

It&#39;s not possible<n> <n><n> <n><n> A planetary conjunction in Ursa Major?  I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes.  I was taking a walk just after dark in the Bay Area, after some rain had passed through.  The sky was still hazy, but I could make out the brighter stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always look up when I go outside, it&#39;s the amateur astronomer (for 25 years now) in me.  Turning a street corner, something spectacular caught my eyes just above the stars Dubhe and Merak in the asterism the Big Dipper.  The Big Dipper, standing in the sky with its handle down and dipper pointing up, I couldn&#39;t help but notice two bright yellow lights, the one on the right brighter and about one degree higher than the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, my mind automatically thought &#34;planetary conjunction.&#34;  I&#39;ve seen many.  They were both perfectly still.  Then I realized the zodiac goes nowhere near the Dipper, thus no planets could be in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bottom planet-like beacon looked like and was about as bright as Saturn is in the sky.  The brighter one was about the brightness of Jupiter, but it was as yellow as the dimmer one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately turned and started to double-time back to the house for the camera, turning once half way to the house.  When I turned that one time, the brighter one flared up and dimmed.  The other was still there, but dimmed out 20 seconds after the first one did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the Heavens-Above website, because my first guess was the International Space Station.  It turns out that the ISS was in the area ONE HOUR before my sighting, and this was two UFO&#39;s, not one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could anyone shed any light on this?  My only guess is that it was something that separated from the ISS or something like that.  No hoax, folks, this was the real deal.  Thanks, Peter.  Regards, MG from Pacheco.<n>
3/10/06 19:00|Norwalk|CA|Light|20 minutes|Red flare type light over Los Angeles Area|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49552.html|220|ndxe200603| Red flare type light over Los Angeles Area<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 7:00 P.M. I witnessed a Red (flare type) Light traveling in an easterly direction. When I first saw the object it was to the west of the Norwalk area where I live in the direction of Long Beach. I thought it might be a helicopter at first but it had only a bright red light (not typical aircraft lighting).  As I am quite familar with aircraft lighting I knew this was not a typical aircraft as no green or white light was visible anytime during my observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object passed to the south of me (no sound was heard at any time) traveling at about a normal aircraft speed until it was a few miles directly to the east at which time it stopped.  It appeared to by approximatly at about 3000 to 5000 feet. As the moon was shining brightly I could see that it had stopped between two clouds.  It remaining in this position for about 10 minutes.  I called my son outside at this time and we took several photographs of the object with his digital camera and 400 mm zoom lens.  The photos appear as a bright flare type light. After about 10 minutes the object then began to continue east. It began to flash several time and moved away at a extremely fast speed (faster than any aircraft I have seen before.  It was out of sight within 10 seconds and appeared to go down but may have just been moving away to the east at the high speed. This ended our sighting.  As my son is an amatuer aviation photograper and private pilot we are quite familiar with watching aircraft but this was like nothing we have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At this point all four of us saw it,I then went down stairs to get another prerson when my son said that it began to spark and started to fall down wards, then it bagan to blink as it moved away towards the north until it. moved away from site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere.  We do not know what he witnessed, but we believe that some kind of pyrotechnic device would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the object was a genuine UFO.  PD))<n>
3/10/06 05:15|Cridersville|OH|Fireball|5-10 mins.|Several orb-like fireballs fading in/out; Alot of FEAE -psyhically 'knew' I was filming and moved in close - Check out the short video!|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74326.html|222|ndxe200603| Several orb-like fireballs fading in/out; Alot of FEAE -psyhically &#39;knew&#39; I was filming and moved in close - Check out the short video!<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five or six miles east of my house. This was approx. 5:15 AM, when I woke up to get something to drink from my throat being too dry. This object I say was for sure not a star, it wasn&#39;t the planet Venus, and it sure wasn&#39;t swamp gas lol. I saw a spherical amberish red light in the sky. This light was stationary and extremely odd looking. It was simply said, a true &#34;fire in the sky.&#34; The light often dimmed and then would come back lit, at times, within a fraction of second, this thing would shine extremely bright. The best way I can describe it was like a superconducting light bulb that just would shutter immense light at a very short period of time. Then, there was a second &amp; third one. Fading in &amp; out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, after knowing that this was something unnatural, I ran into my bedroom and got out my 8mm camera BUT the battery was dead. So, secondly, I grabbed my digital picture camera and jolted outside. With only having limited disc space and recording time, I started filming. Let me tell you, this object was wild..I was pretty captivated by it..but that would soon change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here’s a link to the short video I filmed:<n> <n><n> http://s67.photobucket.com/albums/h313/euphoria5150/?action=view&amp;current=Dustins_UFO_video_clip.flv<n> <n><n> <n><n> After taping my short video, I watched it, instead of just one bright object, the camera was showing three of them, different colors and dimming on and off.  This blew my mind, right, so I looked back up into the sky and there was only one object. As soon as I did, something happened…something rather frightening. Just as if, this &#34;thing&#39; could sense what I was doing and where I was at, it plotted a course toward me. Within seconds, this light was getting a lot larger and it was apparent that distance was the factor. Yes, this UFO was coming directly toward me. Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, it didn’t make any cool Arial movements or swoop down toward me. It came directly toward me like it was following some GPS flight plan. Best way I can describe it, like seeing a white light at the end of a dark tunnel...just getting larger and larger and larger. Within about eight seconds, this thing was half the size of the moon and still coming directly towards me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once that light started coming toward me, I totally didn&#39;t feel very &#39;warm&#39; about it. I thought. After that, the object stopped in air again and remained stationary for a while. I ran inside and was peering out the window, the objects were gone.. That&#39;s the kind of fear this thing gave me. Let&#39;s just say, I didn&#39;t get any sleep last night...none at all.  I will be happy to post the video that I took before this thing started coming after me. No, I didn&#39;t take any more video after that, my shaking hands couldn&#39;t even hold up a piece of paper at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a true story, I&#39;m a Rhodes State College Graduate &amp; I have extensive technical background. I have never seen anything like this and it&#39;s I&#39;m so very passionate about.  Hope you enjoyed my experience, because I didn’t!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) from Ohio<n>
3/10/06 01:00|Lake Worth|FL|Triangle|2 minutes|Triangle at night, no lights or sound; fast.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67670.html|223|ndxe200603| Triangle at night, no lights or sound; fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was homeless at the time and happened to be lying down in a field on a clear evening.  While looking at the night sky I noticed a black w/ brownish tinge colored ufo traveling east over the atlantic  (I was about 1 mile from shore).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing I did after watching for a few seconds was to close one eye and check with the other and then visa versa.  It was a triangular shape approximately the size of a Boeing 737.  The shape was rounded at the corners and was wider than it was in length.  I would estimate the altitude at 20,000 feet.  The vehicle had no lights and absolutely no sound could be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on the fact that it blacked out stars as as it traveled and again estimating altitude at around 20k this thing was moving.  Noticeably faster that a commercial flight and the speed I would estimate at mach 2+  I am adament about the speed, which is strange as anything traveling that fast (I&#39;m being conservative on the speed)should be making some sort of sound or at least have nav lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an Air Force veteran and have seen SR-71&#39;s as I was at Beale AFB I worked on the flightline so I&#39;ve seen a lot of aircraft.  It was not a F-117.  That&#39;s just a side note.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no doubt in my mind that what I saw is not something that is currently being flown by any country.  It was quiet where I was, no traffic, just silence as this went by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watch a lot of discovery channel and know what ramjets and pulse detonation engines are, scramjets, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what I saw, but I will always remember it.<n>
3/10/06 00:30|San Antonio|TX|Triangle|12:30 A.M.-1:40 A.M.|I was driving home from downtown San Antonio and witnessed a series of  crafts with strange lights on Highway 281 for an hour or so.|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49516.html|224|ndxe200603| I was driving home from downtown San Antonio and witnessed a series of  crafts with strange lights on Highway 281 for an hour or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 10, 2006 I was driving on Highway 281 at 12:30 A.M. past the Alamo Dome in downtown San Antonio when a large bright white light caught my eye ahead in the sky about 1-2 football fields high(the craft stayed about that far away the whole sighting). At first I thought it was a tower light or something like that but when I got closer to this object it eventually got right above my car in the middle of the highway. I then saw the bottom of the object. It was triangular in shape with red and blue lights on the three corners blinking. I watched it until I had passed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Astonished and terrified, I decided to take the next turnaround and go back and see if what I saw was real or not. When I got back to the place of the first sighting, I  no longer saw the craft in the middle of the road but instead I saw the object near the lookout tower on the opposite side of the highway to the right of the tower. I then decided to take the next turnaround and find a spot to park on the side of the road to get a better look. But when I got near the tower again on the highway there was a 2nd craft that was smaller and had red and orange lights as opposed to the red and blue lights of the larger craft. I should also note that every time I saw these things during the hour of my sighting the crafts top bright light kept turning on and off randomly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw this second craft I got scared because it proceeded to come straight towards me. This smaller    red and orange craft eventually went right over me like the larger one did before. This craft looked like the first one did, triangular in shape only with red and orange lights on the bottom at the three corners. It also had a top bright light as well. It passed me and went to the right of me on the highway and then immediately changed directions and joined the larger craft on the left side of me on the highway quite fast. At this point I was not about to pull over and stop as these things were just too close for comfort. I was shaking, I honestly don’t know hwy I was so scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instead I just kept taking turnarounds and went in circles about 3 times until they disappeared. I saw them going back and forth across Highway 281 every time I turned around. It is almost as if they were following me, playing some kind of game. It’s kind of  egocentric of me to think that these things were there only for me but at the time is how I felt which is probably why I did not want to stop on the side of the road for a constant look at these things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they were no longer to be seen I headed back to my original destination point, home. About 5-10 minutes later I was near the University of Incarnate Word still on Highway 281 when I saw the small red and orange craft yet again on my left side no less than a football field high. I could not believe that it was near me again. It proceeded to cross my path giving me another view of its bottom and headed to my right until I passed it up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I took the next turnaround yet again and when I got back it was gone. I then went ahead and drove a few more minutes before taking the next turnaround to finally go home. But when I got back the larger blue and red craft had returned and was approaching my left side until it got right overhead of me again. This time however I saw a bright beam of light that looked like those airplane beams you see near an airport or major highway shoot out of the bottom of the craft and proceeded to point it EVRYWHERE. When I say everywhere I mean it pointed it at cars, buildings and houses nearby. The odd thing was it never once pointed it at me. At least I think, though now that I think about it when I saw the craft overhead the light was so bright I had to shield my eyes for a second so it might have shined it on me at once. It very much looked to me like it was searching for something. After it got done with the beam it went on its way to the right of me and I lost site of it when I got too far from it. I should note that when it did this i got a pretty good look at the side of the craft. It looked disk shaped. I was scared enough that i went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I got home however I saw the small red and orange craft flying over 281 and towards my neighborhood near Brook Hollow Blvd until I lost sight of it beyond the trees on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 1:40 A.M. when I got home.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Also two small flashing lights near the front, one on top of the other.    Object moved from southeast to northwest at a slow pace.  There was no sound.  I thought it may have been a plane or helicopter equiped with lights to advertise something at first but there was no sound and it was pretty close.  About 1000 in the air, and 9-10 blocks to the east of me.  Two lights in the front flashed white, they were stacked one on top and one on bottom.  The Four red lights pulsed slowly, fading out and comming back on.  It did not fit any aircaft to which I am famillar because of the configuration of the lights and their pulsing nature.  The shape was rectangular or Square like a four cornered box flying across the sky. The craft was low and did not head in the direction of the airport in pasco but kept moving northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the evening sky there was a huge lentricular cloud formation that looked an awful lot like a ship under cloud cover.  To the right and left of the huge middle cloud were three smaller perfectly saucer shaped clouds on each side spaced at an angle so that it looked as if they were in a V formation.  My passenger in the car was a committed non-believer.  Even he had to do a double take when I brought them to his attention.  I have heard that it is not uncommon for cloud covers to be used by UFO&#39;s.<n>

I let him out of my front door and I looked up and did a double take. I saw a disk-like shaped object flying in the sky. It had many light on the underside,about ten. Two of them were red and the other lights were white. The object was very metallic looking. I know it wasn&#39;t an airplane because it was too low to the ground and too large. Also none of the lights were blinking. I saw it flying to the south. I froze and stared at it as it dissapeared into the clouds. I am convinced that it was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The weather was exceptionally clear, and no cloud cover whatsoever. I observed quite clearly a very shiny metallic object that was orginally noted as cigar shaped and it was suspended in the sky. The object was tilted from a one o&#39;clock to seven o&#39;clock position with the right corner situated at the one o&#39;clock position. Regarding the distances i.e. height and distance to object. I can&#39;t be certain but it wasn&#39;t close to the ground At the point where I noted the object we were traveling on Rt. 295 southbound right next to the Delaware river. That being said, the object was high in the sky in a southwesterly direction. As I watched the object it moved from it&#39;s static position to the right at a rapid speed without changing it&#39;s position, i.e. pitch, yaw and then the object moved straight up into the sky at a unbelieveable speed. As it went skyward I noted the circular shape and I distinctly remember a dark spot in the middle of the circle and a dark lining around the outside of the ojbect as it sped into space. I know airplanes and was in the Navy. I&#39;ve NEVER seen anything move at that speed in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I attempted to snap a photo with my digital camera, only to find out the picture was sort of out of focus but I decided to keep it and upload it to my PC later. When I uploaded the picture and zoomed in, I noticed something near the aircraft that just struck me as odd. It looks like one or two small sphere-shaped cloud-like objects or orbs hovering/flying together in front of and either just above or below the flight path of the F22s. Its weird because these objects appear to be camouflaging themselves in or around the clouds. I heard no noises besides the planes, and didn&#39;t see anything unusual at the time until I saw the picture up close.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were each moving at a very fast pace.They then began chasing eachother through the air until it seemed as if a swarm of fire flys had descened from the heavans.

I was sitting on my couch watching television with my best mate. We were sipping at our coffee when saw flashes of light out the window. We ran outside and saw 3 circle shaped UFO&#39;s. They were flashing beams. My friend ran inside to grab a camera when I started to feel a tingling feeling going through my body. I felt sick in the stomach. I felt a deep pain in my nose and blood was gushing out of my nose. My friend came back with a camera and they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ever since that encounter I have never felt alone and often wake up in the night with cold sweats.

They were shiny, with no visible lighting. They appeared to be shimmering, either due to their speed, or their altitude.They appeared to be at very high altitude, and streaked across the sky from straight due south to due north. It took them approximately two to three seconds to cover my entire field of vision, which was the whole sky from horizon to horizon. There is no such plane, rocket, or man-made vehicle which could cover this huge distance that fast....I know for a fact, this could not have been a meteor or fireball, this was no atmospheric phenomena, these were definite objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Besides UFO&#39;s the only other explanation would be the space station, but I have seen that before, and these were very different.....plus there were two.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I pulled out of my drive, I noticed what looked like a harvest moon sitting right on Lake Erie.  I almost drove away not thinking anything of it, but I decided to drive up to the waters edge to have a closer look. The shape that I saw was spherical, but only 60% percent of it was viewable(similiar to a cresent moon).  It was about the size of the sun just before it sets over the lake during the summer months. It was fiery orange red in color. It seemed very bright yet the illumination did not go beyond the sphere itself. At this point I still, may have left just thinking what I saw was odd, but the sphere seemed to be dissappearing below the horizon.  I decided to race back home and get my digital camera.  I drove down my street, pulled in my drive and looked back towards the lake and noticed that only half of the visible portion of the sphere remained. I ran into my house grabbed my camera, ran back out and it was gone. This sphere that seemd to be as big as the sun setting in a summer evening sank below the horizon in a mere 5 minutes...<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/6/06 23:30|Decatur|TX|Other|3 hours.|Strange (Craft?) sights seen between Boyd and Decatur Texas.|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49489.html|243|ndxe200603| Strange (Craft?) sights seen between Boyd and Decatur Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recieved a call from a neighbor about three miles down the road who told me to go outside and look in the sky.  Looking to the left of the moon were two blue spots of light.  Off and on about once a minute they would strobe white light.  They stayed in place and never moved and never made a sound.  While watching these two things my neighbor (Still on the phone) said look in the direction of Denton.  I saw what looked to be a bright yellow dot of light. (maybe ten miles out)  As we watched (Wife and myself in person, neighbor on phone) the light seemed to get closed and it looked almost flat.  As we watched the light started to sway back and forth.  It would then move maybe about half a mile out away from where it was sitting and then shoot back to where it first started.  It did this over and over again for about 20 minutes.  From there it then seemed to circle in one spot over and over again, it did this about ten times then sat still.  From there is would shoot out like before and curve out back to where it started.  (The other times it shot out before it would go in one line and shoot back in one line in what seemed like no stop)  It then quit this after two runs and stayed in the same spot it first started.  We then saw what appeared to be a 747 or other large aircraft some close to it headed to either DFW or Alliance and the thing went up and away from the object.  When the aircraft left the area the thing went back to the same spot.  The thing just stayed still with the odd movement off and on until about half an hour later when a small jet went into the area and the light just vanished.  I have two other people that saw this other than me and we are willing to talk about it.  I never have seen anything quite like this before.  These things never made any sound.  Where I live sound will travel for miles upon miles.  The area is also blessed to not be under the glow of city lights.  I have worked around aircraft as well and I know the way this thing was moving, was not like any natural manned craft.  The moves would be too much for a pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought I was watching fighter aircraft doing horseplay dogfighting.  The objects moved much faster than commercial aircraft.  I guess speed at 3 or 4 times faster than commercial aircraft.  The approx height in the sky of the three objects I guess at 10 thousand feet.  They looked like small fireballs.  They would show up for maybe five to ten minutes, then disappear on the horizon.  But would return again in 20 minutes or so.  I saw them three different times, almost like they were doing laps.  I was hooked to watching the sky but was not prepared for what I saw next.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx 10:30pm, I hadn&#39;t seen any fireballs for approx 30 mins.  I instead watched 15-20 aircraft moving through the area just amazed at how slow they moved compared to the fireballs.  I saw a small prop aircraft of some kind flying north parallel to Hwy 65.  It was about 5 thousand feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a very large triangle following this plane very closely and right above this plane.  I saw the large triangle then bank and head east.  This bottom surface area of the triangle was about 100 times bigger than the small prop aircraft.  I saw three glowing lights on the bottom and at the points of the triangle.  The three lights on the points glowed dim and blueish in color.  The approx height of the triangle I guess equal to a three story house.  The large triangle seemed to be cloaked in a very thin cloud on a very clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure what I saw.  I saw something.  Not sure if it was military or alien UFO.  I&#39;ve read the stories about huge triangles on this sight.  At that time, I didn&#39;t believe the stories because I didn&#39;t think anything so big could fly.  I do now.  I wish I had a camera at the time so I could show evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We looked up to the northwest and could see the navigation lights of the approaching helicopters.  As they passed overhead on a southwesterly heading it was apparent that there was three helicopters in a triangle formation, two in front, and one in back. At first as they began to pass over I noticed that the trailing helicopter was quite some distance behind the front two. Then as they passed overhead I could see that the void between the leading helicopters was not empty at all, there was a black triangle shaped craft without any lights whatsoever flying between the leading and trailing helicopters. We were only able to see the craft because it was darker that the slight overcast we had that night. I am absolutely convinced that the helicopters were &#34;escorting&#34; this craft for some unknown reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I glanced out my window and saw the craft flying by fairly quick. It caught my attention first, because of its strange shape which i would describe as a single object made of 2 long, thin, white ovals connected at ends.  Second reason it caught my attention was the fact there was no noise of any kind. No buzzing of an airplane, no screeching/soaring of a jet, nothing.  Third there was no chemtrail/contrail behind object.  I cant really give an estimate as to the altitude but it seemed very high and moving fast for that altitude. It was heading in the general direction of south west but more west than south if you no what I mean.  I saw it briefly then lost it as it moved over the woods across the street.  Yesterday I saw 3 white objects in the sky which flew straight then circled each other in a triangular pattern.  I assumed them to be birds but Im not so sure now.<n>

I watched it and noticed that it made a reflection in the water like the moon would if it were shining on the water.  I got my digital camers and used to the zoon lense so I could see it better.  When I magnified it as much as I could it looked like a yellow/orange ball that looked like to radiated heat.  It stood perfectly still until I tried to take a picture of it and when I tried to take a picture it jumped around sporadically in the view finder on the camera.  I took the picture and the picture looked somewhat like a tubular neon snake shaped object.  I took several picture and the energy it obmitted was of various patterns.  I watched the object until daylight made it impossible to see.<n>

This was also witnessed by 3 other people, 1 driver and 2 other passengers in the vehicle. The two brightly light objects hovered in the sky while I took a photograph. At this moment I alerted the driver and 2 passengers as to the object. I then proceeded to capture some video footage of the 2 craft with my mobile phone camcorder, which wasn&#39;t very clear at all. At the last moment of the camcorder footage we entered into a tunnel and when we emerged from the other side the 2 craft had disappeared. It seemed as if the 2 craft where starting to move as we entered the tunnel parallel to the car&#39;s direction. Also I noticed an airoplane moving in a westerly direction to the car, which was clearly no where near the 2 objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We kept it in view for around 3 minutes and stopped to try and get a better look it turned again and continued in a North West direction.  It continued to travel at a slow rate of speed and at the same 200 ft above ground.  I put down the window of my vehicle and it emitted no sounds.  It appeared almost transparent at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear crisp day, blue skies. Right before I hit Stryker Ohio, I noticed a &#34;disc&#34; like object very high in the sky. I&#39;m not a good estimator of distance, but I would say a good 2 miles from me.  It was clearly not moving in any particular direction and actually seemed to be keeping stationary. I noticed a plane directly above with (&#34;entrails&#34;) on it somewhat near the object. But this object was not a plane. I would say definitely silver in color, but it was pretty distant so I&#39;m not 100% on the color description. Anyway, I would definitely describe it as just &#34;floating&#34; up there. I kept a direct eye on it so I didn&#39;t lose sight of it as I kept driving. But in a &#34;virtual instant&#34; the object was gone right before I hit the little town of Stryker. It&#39;s like it blipped out of the atmosphere. I flabergassed because it was such a clear day and it would have taken something with extradorinary speed to just, well vanish. It was sincerly, one moment it was there, then gone. Just a footnote, at teh time I had the visual of the object, in my head (sarcastically) I was talking to the object, saying &#34;I see you, I really do see you&#34;.  10 seconds later it was gone. At the time I really didn&#39;t know what I was looking at, I was wondering as I got closer maybe it would be something like a plane or helicopter. But when it disappeared, I knew it was something more than a plane or helicopter. I&#39;m not here to waste people&#39;s time, I know what I saw, and I&#39;m telling you it was very real to me. I just don&#39;t have a clue what it could have been though.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was absolutely no sound as it drifted a couple hundred feet in the sky.  I returned to the location minutes later and it was gone.  Interesting that the power had then gone out in the area.  I ask people in the location if they had scene anything but all had not.  I tried to reason that it was a transformer but it was very uncharacteristic of an electrical explosion since it was so constant.  I it was overcast and rainy at the time and this object drifted below the cloud cover. Anyone see it?<n>

It made absolutely no noise what so ever when it flew overhead. The lights on the craft were a very dim white lights and there appeared to be 4 lights. The craft was moving at a very high rate of speed, and all we could see was the dim lights. A shape of the craft could not be made out even though there is a little moon light over the area. The craft had to be of a dark color because it blended into the night sky (other than the lights) The craft moved from the south to a north easterly direction and then vanished.

When approximately 2 degrees east of the bright star sirius i see a saucer shaped object, it seemed to be moving slowly so i looked more closely with binoculars to see if it was an aircraft. There were no flashing light like you see on an aircraft, so i decided to get my 100mw red laser out and i gave it a zap pointing directly at it with the beam, as soon as i did i dropped down flashed bright blue then shot of out of the atmosphere. Just like to say i&#39;v seen these in the past but to get a reaction from such a craft made me smile THEY DON&#39;T LIKE LASERS ha ha they obviously interpret this as dangerous threat as our military having a pop at them, have possibly used laser guided stuff before. All i can say is if they are a threat to us then a $199 laser does the trick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot guarantee that this is intended by the witness to be a serious report.

Very high and bright as stars in daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today at work I am out smoking a cigarette. I look up and see what looks like a plane really high up flying from left to right. Then it makes an angular turn towards me. Then out of no-where another one appears following it and they start going right to left together. Then one of my customers says, &#34;whatcha lookin at.&#34; I told her, &#34;those two things in the sky.&#34; She goes, &#34;Well there&#39;s three.&#34; There was another one where the two first came together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I am freaked a little because things don&#39;t really move at right angles but figure it is pretty far away so could have made an actual turn and me not notice. An hour later I go back outside for another cigarette and there is another one. This time it is lower and bigger and now obviously spherical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered there for a while and moved a bit. I thought maybe they were all balloons until a plane flew underneath it and it was still that big!  Then I had a revelation when I saw it go into the clouds. I could find out how big it was before I would decide if it was something odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noted the size and found out the cloud ceiling today was at 25000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife is a math whiz so she did some geometry and figured out that it would have to be 242 ft in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was behind the cloud briefly but was always visible through the cloud except for a second or two when a dense spot in the cloud obscured it completely. Another identical point of light appeared from behind the cloud trailing the first point of light at about a 2&#34; distance at arms length.  There was no relative motion of the two points.  I noticed a third point of light trailing the second by 2&#34; at arms length, but this point of light was definitely below the cloud and a light greenish blue in color, similar to an airport beacon.  The three points of light slowed and drew closer together, forming an equalateral triangle.  They stopped completely, but at that point the cloud blew between myself and the objects and I could no longer see them.  The motion of the objects was opposite the motion of the cloud, and the clouds were at the 5000 foot level.  Assuming the objects were at cloud level, the triangle formation would have occurred approximately between Thurston Middle School and the large S curve in highway 133.  John Wayne airport is approximately 10 miles North from that location.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was watching the moon eclipsing, when something caught my eye about 6 &#34;inches&#34; down from the moon.  Moving at about the speed of a plane, there was a black triangle travelling east/south-east. It had approx 10 very very faint lights down the 2 front sides (5 tiny lights on each side).  No flashing lights, no unusual behaviour, and completely silent. I live in London under the incoming flight path to Heathrow airport, but this craft was travelling in the wrong direction to the flight path.<n>

3/3/06 19:39|Ironton|MO|Light|18 minutes|Orange lights appearing and disappearing, again in Southeastern Missouri.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55971.html|278|ndxe200603| Orange lights appearing and disappearing, again in Southeastern Missouri.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have looked at alot of Missouri sightings in your files on these orange lights, and wonder what they are. Almost all of the sightings are fairly close to where we were on March 3 2007. Well, here&#39;s what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me (38) and my wife (38) went to Lake Hanna about 4 miles North of Ironton Missouri. This place is in St. Francois and Iron Counties. We went back to the far lake (Iron County) to see if we could see the lunar eclipse. But it was to cloudy and a little to late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We preceded to look to the south-southwest towards Pilot Knob Mountain and Taum Sauk Mt. (highest elevation in state). The clouds started to clear and we could see a bright star (possibly Venus) and the moon peaking out from behind the clouds. It is very dark out and we were amazed by how much light the moon emitted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, around 19:39 we noticed a orange-amber colored light appear in the sky in the same direction (S-SW} between the mountains, then another, and then another. The lights appeared to split in two and then disappear in same order they appeared. Me and my wife looked at each other and said what in the world did we just see? It almost seemed like they came out from over a cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky had cleared pretty much and we were watching the sky in hope of seeing something else. It had been about ten minutes, 19:49 on the van clock. Then it started again a bit different. The lights were bigger this time and appeared to be spinning with other lights shooting out of them. One looked like it shot toward the ground. Another light looked like it split and was making a banked turn on an angle. These lights looked like the size of streetlights (dime size).  We saw 4 of these lights appear and then disappear in same order.  Lasting I would say around 10 to 15 seconds each.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had been completely silent to this point when we started to hear fighter jets. We could not see them. The reason I know they were fighters is because I live a couple of miles from Scott AFB.  Every kind of plane imaginable has flown over our house at all hours of the day.  We go to the lake every weekend if possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got out of the mini-van to see if we could see the planes.  To this point we were watching out of the windows.  I called a friend down at the lake to tell him to come out here and what we saw.  Just as I got off the cel phone, it started again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time the lights were even bigger (quarter size). Five lights appeared in the sky one by one till all five were lit. Then disappearing in same order. With the lights being bigger you could see more detail, it looked to me like the orange-amber lights had little white lights spinning around them in the middle. I looked at the clock and it was 19:57.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch the sky and saw four jets heading east in a single file line. That seemed strange that they were not flying in formation. Then we saw two more heading north and then two more way up there heading northeast. Eight jets we saw in total. Another strange thing was that the jets didn&#39;t have any flashing lights just solid red ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the sky for about another half-hour and didn&#39;t see anymore lights. It almost seemed like the jets scared them off. I know that they say the full moon and lunar eclipes have strange effects on things. I don&#39;t know if it had anything to do with that but on the way back to the cabin we saw three deer walk right down the side of the road by our van it seemed like they had no fear. We looked at them and them at us almost to say &#34;Did you see that too?&#34; We have gone back the last three weekends to the same exact place hoping to see the lights again. We haven&#39;t seen a thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I have two children, married 16 years and never saw or believed in any kind of et stuff, but this really makes a person wonder. Me and my wife are both educated and working.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife told a Air Force Colonel what we saw and he said it was probably the Air Force flying manuevers. I don&#39;t know exactly what we saw and probably will never see anything like it again. I hope someone there can tell me what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was able to get one picture on her cel phone and I will send it to you as soon as I can figure out how to get it on my computer or a picture of it.<n>

From where I was it was small (if you were to hold up a match at arms length, it was the size of a matchhead) and not moving. But it was shiney because the sun was behind me and the orb in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I&#39;m like, &#34;hmm, maybe it&#39;s just a plane getting hit by the sun&#34; and didn&#39;t think much of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I drive about 400-500 yards up this big hill that goes into the town. When I get into the town I look off to my left and I see four military planes in formation off to my left. These planes looked odd and they were hauling ass. I look back to my right (by this time the orb was behind me and to the right) and it was GONE ! In a matter of   30 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I look back at the planes and all four of them were turning around above me and headed back to I would guess Andrews Air Force Base in a hurry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was blown away. I didn&#39;t think it was a UFO at first, but I had my suspicions, now I know it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found a picture of the plane and come to find out, they were Warthogs, here is a link of what the plane looked like:  http://www.altixsoft.com/airforce/screenshot3.jpg  Here is a picture of what the Orb looked like:  http://www.orbwar.com/light/orb-block-005b.jpg<n>

As I was smoking, it seemed to be moving left and right, but I thought it was just me moving. So I went down the stairs on my porch and the object began to move downwords towards the trees. I could see that it was bright red with a circling red light underneath it. It was also moving left and right, which really freaked me out. It was approximatly 3-4 miles away. As it was moving up and down, left and right, it finally went below the tree line. I have always kinda believed in UFOs, but used to think a lot of the stories were made up, and the people were just wierdos. But last night was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. It sent chills up and down my spine, I got tears in my eyes, and I was shaking. I promise all of you, this was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed he was gazing up into the sky and I was wondering what he was looking at. Approx 20 seconds later he turned to me and said &#34;look, what&#39;s that&#34;. I looked towards the heavens and saw a small bright silver (metallic) object the size of a pin head moving very quickly and horizontally across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was taken aback and yes we claimed to have seen an unidentified object. It meant more to him as it was his first ever sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I however over the past 20yrs have seen several, although I was living in NZ at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several nights later on March 3rd I was working a night shift and decided to go outside for a cigarette, it was 3am and a very clear night. I was looking at the stars when I noticed a very bright but low star, it was so low it appeared out of place so I turned all the inside lights off to get a better view. On doing that I realised the object was changing colours gold/bluish and orange. I rang my partner hoping he could see it but because of the distance between us this was impossible. I watched it just hovering in the one place for several minutes and on one occasion it seemed to have disappeared only to appear just as quick. My partner rang back and I was trying to explain what I was seeing...  at that very moment and although it may sound very strange I said to him that it looked as though it had a light coming from beneath (as though it was beaming something up) after 14 minutes it disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have worked several shifts and have made a point of looking in that same direction at around the same time but to no avail.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

THe skies were clear and there were no storms at the moment and then there was a light and a small orange craft was hovering about 1 kilometer away. It was oval shaped and came closer until it was hovering almost ahead until it changed into a circular disk and literally rolled away. It had many colrs but was primarily orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was dark and perfectly quiet.  No aircraft were in the area though there is an Air Force Base down the road about 15 minutes.

This is something we often do. Between buildings there is not much light and I was admiring Orion in the southern sky as it was extremely clear and bright. A motion caught my left eye  and I turned to the east in time to see a &#34;boomerang&#34; or triangle shaped dark object moving against the fixed stars. It was black or unlit except for reddish glowing lamps pointed in the same direction as its flight...there were three to 5 of these lamps...It was moving swiftly, at an altitude of 250-500 feet and was very large. It was totally silent. I especially listened to hear engines because I have heard others have seen these things and I suspected they might be some kind of slow moving blimp, but this was not moving slowly. In a few seconds I lost the backround stars and lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also lost the cat and after wandering around an hour found her cowering behind a building air conditioning unit.

On our way back, we were a little late for the next Speech, we saw a very unusual white craft, hovering right above the main street &#34;Casino Drive&#34; and in front of the hotel to the right, don&#39;t know which one it was, maybe on a level with the 10th floor of this hotel, kinda very low, too low for a plane, and we could watch it slowly flying off south, above and along the street and colorado river. We would describe the shape like too balls attached to each other but on top it was cut off, like two flattened balls attached underneath to an even surface. No wings, no lights, no sound. It was daylight and sunny and we stood at the traffic light right next to the hotel and not far away from that thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

3/2/06 09:00|Medford|OR|Disk|2 minutes +\-|Object seen over Medford, Oregon|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49370.html|291|ndxe200603| Object seen over Medford, Oregon<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnessed a darl colored, round object at roughly 50,000 feet altitude, traveling south at a speed of approximately 500-600 Knots. Object was headed south when first observedbut, performed a high speed, high G turn and altered heading to south-southwest and continued flying in that direction until obscured by a buildings roofline. Around 2 minutes later a commercial airliner passed through same area as the UFO (route is well traveled from Portland to San Francisco. I have over five years experience in the navy as a radar operator and 20 years experience as a merchant marine captain and can state that this object did not perform like a jet aircraft would. UFO&#39;s turn would have been impossible for any aircraft currently in US inventory. It was a rounded, 90 degree turn at a speed of 500 knots plus that took perhaps 4 seconds total. It left no vapor trail, even though the aircraft that went through same area moments later did leave one.Object appeared much smaller than any aircraft normally flying at that height, roughly 1/10th the size of the airliner that was nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/2/06 06:25|Kingman|KS|Other|5 MIN|I saw an aircraft i cannot explain.|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49379.html|292|ndxe200603| I saw an aircraft i cannot explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was getting in truck to leave for work,  I had the feeling of static electricty on my neck, uncomfortable, there was a humm, I can&#39;t tell you if I was hearing or feeling it, but there was a humm. As i looked around, I looked up, I saw a craft in the air.  I wasn&#39;t sure of what I was seeing.  I served in the Air Force, I live and work near an airport.  I have never seen anything like this.  Round on the back to a point at the front, like an arrow head.  It wasn&#39;t flying it was just there,  Size wise, I would say half a football field, 50 yards.  It&#39; surface appeard to be changing in color as it moved from morning darkness, to sunrise. I watched till I could no longer see it. I thought to myself, Tax Dollars at work.  As I have gone thru the day thinking about it.  I don&#39;t think this was out tax dollars at work, I think I saw something extratestrial.<n>
3/2/06 02:30|Winter Springs|FL|Light|2-3 seconds|Strange appearing/disappearing white light|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49446.html|293|ndxe200603| Strange appearing/disappearing white light<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside at 2:30 am having a smoke (wife does not allow smoking in the house), I was looking up at the stars wondering if I could get a photograph of them. Suddenly a bright white light appeared out of nowhere traveling south to north at a very high rate of speed and then disappeared into the dark. No noise was heard, was to low to be a shooting star. There was no trail. It appeared more oval that a ball. No other lights visable. It was hard to determined altitude but it appeared low like about the altitude of a low flying airplane. It just lasted for just a few seconds. It would be like if you were invisible and running and then threw a switch, exposed yourself and quickly shut it off. You would appear and then disappear... Normally I don&#39;t make these types of reports because when I told my friends this tale, they asked what I was smoking.<n>
3/1/06 22:00|Townsend|TN|Light|Two Days to Current|Luminated objects spotted in clear night sky; our friends 20 miles away were called, they verified the sightings from their location.|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49432.html|294|ndxe200603| Luminated objects spotted in clear night sky; our friends 20 miles away were called, they verified the sightings from their location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The domninate visual is that of light.  There was only one spotted at first, which was a white-blue color.  Then after further observations, several more were witnessed of similiar color as well as different colors.  They blend in with the night time stars rather well.  The objects move unlike stars however.  Some appear to be closer than others.  It is not possible to determine distance nor shape of the objects, as the reference point is the night sky.  At approxiamatly 22:30 on 03/01/2006 a low altitude jet had a set course to one of the objects located South by South east of the location of observation.  As the jet approached, the object&#39;s movements was similiar to that of a bumble bee, very quick and in various directions.  A college (which has not witnessed this but was told about it) reported today, 03/04/2006, that he overheard conversation refering to the same details as described above about the objects being in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to note that the objects are holding a &#34;static&#34; position, meaning that they are NOT rotating with the stars, rather staying in particular locations.  Sometimes they will leave the location they are in and then return shortly afterwards.  The movement is a slight but steady bobbing in multiple directions.  They range in colors from white-blue to redish orange.  Attempts were made to make visual verification by means of Cam Corder, 35 mm camera with zoom lens, as well as a telescope.  The camcorder images are crude looking due to the fact that the exposure settings.  The camera and and the telescope provided a better view.  Upon closer observation the objects tend to be luminated by lights resembling that produced by LED.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/1/06 20:00|Gold Canyon|AZ|Fireball|1 hour +|Fire balls in the sky in AZ|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49485.html|295|ndxe200603| Fire balls in the sky in AZ<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a fire ball in the sky hovering over what appeared to be the San Tan mountains in Arizona.  This was not my first sighting of these fire balls, so I knew to watch and wait to determine whether or not it was a military flare. This fire ball stayed illuminated for several minutes, then disappeared, slowly flickered out. Then, two minutes later, it reappeared in the same spot.  I drove home and got my camera..unfortuantely, I didnt fetch my tri pod. I found a nice dark spot to park and got out of my car and immediately,,, in the same spot as the first one was hovering,,, there were two! I took several photos.. of which I&#39;d be more than happy to share. Because I didnt have a tri-pod, some of the photos have light trails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last light I saw  was the weirdest of all.. while observing three lights hovering in the sky, a white light appeared, Dim at first the getting progressively brighter, then it appeared to split into several small lights that sparkled so brighly that I had to turn my eyes away. When I looked back to snap off another picture, it simply put, flew at high speeds, across the sky, so fast that I couldnt follow it. Then it was gone. There was one more hovering fireball that I observed, but I had children at home, and had to leave. This light show may have gone on all evening,,,, no telling.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a light to my left, turning I saw what I thought at first was a crecent moon.  It was sitting very low at a distance over the tree tops.  During the 10 mile ride home to the next town of Brooksville Ms I kept noticing what I thought was the moon then I mentioned it to my husband. We both watched as lights seemed to move rotating around it then it began to glow very bright then like a light being turned off it went black only to light up again,  much like a light show.  This went on until we reached Brooksville and got off the road.  We have traveled this road many times over the years at night but never have seen anything like this before.  We went down the same road tonight and it was dark as usual.  We know what we saw was like nothing we ever saw before but have no idea what it could have been if not a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/1/06 19:45|Garden Grove|CA|Oval|3 min|Flying oval shap object w/ bright white lights underneath|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49413.html|297|ndxe200603| Flying oval shap object w/ bright white lights underneath<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were going North on Beach Blvd when we saw this object with very bright white lights in the air. We kept looking at it because it didn&#39;t look like a plane. It stayed in the mid air and got really close when we turned onto Garden Grove. It was definitely not a plane or a blimp. Anyone else saw it on that day?<n>
3/1/06 19:00|Egg Harbor City|NJ|Light|10 minutes|Five very bright orange lights just over  tree line in New Jresey pine lands.|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49458.html|298|ndxe200603| Five very bright orange lights just over  tree line in New Jresey pine lands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my kitchen and looked out the window and saw the first tiny slit of the moon, it had been a new moon two days before and it was just starting to reappear. I decided to go and have a look. As I walked out my front door, through the trees I saw a bright orange light. It was in the opposite direction of the moon, NW I think. It was very bright and I thought it was a little strange so I walked out to a clearing to get a better look with no trees in the way.When I was able to get an unobstructed view, in the distance, maybe 2-3 miles just above the tree line, I saw the extremely bright orange light, not moving. Then it quickly faded out.Then, just as it faded out, a little to the left another bright orange light lit up, then another, then again until there was four lights in a row. One by one they would light up until all four were lit. Then they would quickly fade as the first one did. The first lone light would come on again, then fade. Then one by one, the four other lights would come on, then quickly fade. This went on for about ten minutes. The weather conditions that night were extremely clear. This is a rural area, at the base of the New Jersey Pine Lands, very few homes in that direction, no industry. Very flat landscape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/1/06 19:00|Ontario|CA|Oval|30 minutes|huge bright eliptical shaped object with multi colored lights flashing, like millions of sparkling diamonds|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49374.html|299|ndxe200603| huge bright eliptical shaped object with multi colored lights flashing, like millions of sparkling diamonds<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a single object that was shaped like a football, kind of squished down a little to be about 2/3 the diameter of a football, elliptical in shape. It was just hovering above a mountain ridge. If I were to draw it, it would be a 15 degree ellipse running in the horizontal position. This object was very large, approxiamtely the length of a 747 airliner or larger and had intermitten flashing colored lights coming from every angle, reminded me of colored lights reflecting of a high quality diamond. It had the appearance of an immense amount of diamonds clustered together to form the above mentioned shape, like nothing I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work in the Engineering field in Aerospace and Avionics and I have never before seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor whom I had gone next door to see and have her look at this so I would be believed, saw pretty much what I saw through the binoculars. She described it as a translucent oval object, extremely large in size and appeared to have what looked simlar to an immense amount of diamond like objects inside, with itermitten lights flashing. We both laughed because it reminded us of the movie &#34;Close Encounters of the Thrid Kind&#34; in which the ship had these different colored lights flashing and yet they were of such a brilliance that neither one of us had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/1/06 18:00|Corpus Christi|TX|Changing|10 minutes|Mother ships in south Texas.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49578.html|300|ndxe200603| Mother ships in south Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way to Austin,T.X driving alone, while the sun was setting and heading up Interstate 37 from Corpus Christi,Tx.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just passed through Mathis, T.X in San Patricio county and was about to enter Live Oak county along the interstate when I looked off to the left and not too far off in the horizon there was two HUGE metalic disc sitting side by side in mid air, slanted in formation at least half a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately pulled off the road and put my emergency lights on. I sat there and watched as the bottom object slowly moved down and left and it elongated into a long pillar of fire orange or almost like a thin cylinder. It turned into the sky and disappeared in a very odd fashion.  Almost like it had turned on a cloaking device.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The top object stayed as a classic disc shape but also turned fire orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About this time I noticed a diposable camera sitting in my console so I unloaded.  As I snapped photos I looked around and other cars were looking at me as they passed but no one seemed to be paying any attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last disc did the same as the first and just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I had arrived in San Antonio there was alot of military ariel activity going on. Like a hornets nest being disturbed they were flying around the out skirts of the city.  Also in Austin I saw alot of jets flying around the outskirts.  Mind you these were not commercial airliners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the photos developed and out of the twelve photos I snapped one shows a strange illumonous obbject sitting in the sky.  Because of the quality of the film it is left for someones own interpretation for it can not sum up the actual event.  I have this photo but it needs some one to give it an enhancement on the object pictured, some one to clear it up better with a program of some sorts.  It&#39;s a photo thats worth it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were what I would call mother craft because of the size.  Note that event took place as the sun was setting on the begining of lent and when the sun was down the moon was already in its place large and only the bottom of it was visible.  It was almost like an eclipse. This month of March 2006 yields alot of cosmic activity with an equinox and solar and lunar eclipses through out it. Makes you wonder....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  For a host of reasons, we wonder whether this is a serious report, or not.  We have not received any photos from the witness, to the best of our knowledge.  PD))<n>
3/1/06 18:00|St. John's (Canada)|NF|Light|1 hour, 30 minutes|I observed a bright light off in a distance over the ocean. The object would steadily and slowly move over the ocean and over Cape Spea|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49359.html|301|ndxe200603| I observed a bright light off in a distance over the ocean. The object would steadily and slowly move over the ocean and over Cape Spear. The light would be bright and it would fade away. Whenever it would come back it would first be a little white light ,it would slowly move across where i was looking and then it would turn into a bright orangey light. This was over a period o an hour and a half and it may still have been there after i left. This is really hard for me to explain to you and totally new ground for me. I definately think that you should look into this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Kennedy airport is nearby cause the Mall is right off the Belt PKWY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked at the big silver one and saw about 20-30 little ones circling it.  Making &#34;formations&#34; and moving into each other and toward the big silver one and more came out.  Some were stationary.  They moved slowly and then moved fast.  They would &#34;drift&#34; In any direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We knew it was not ballons.  We tried to convince ourselves that it was snow stuck up there with a big silver blimp in the center because we didn&#39;t want to believe we were seeing what we did. We tried to get other people to witness it but they were in a rush to get home since a snow storm is heading here slated to hit tomorrow morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend thought she was looking at a constellation until she noted that you cannot see stars in broad daylight and they are not accompanied by a big silver ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there for awhile and we saw planes flying in the other direction away from it.  Helicopters showed up about 10 minutes later, they were black and it looked like they were &#34;chasing&#34; it but they backed off and flew away from the silver one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove off and tried not to see anymore.  It left us quite nervous and excited.  But more nervous than anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I had had a camera, video or film butI didn&#39;t.  I plan to carry one from now on.<n>

They got very bright then disapper. They almost look like white fireworks the way they disappear but fireworks dont stand still and split and form a line and the lights were silent no sound at all. They were probably a good 20 miles or so. I was looking towards the north. my sister was with me and a homeless man was there in the street bare witness also. It was still black outside 4:12 am. clear skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft looked like a metal football field... completely rectangular in shape, and made no noise.  It flew over our heads, and we both saw it.  It had no lights. There were a few indentions on the bottom of the craft, but for the most part, it was just smooth and metalic-looking.  The viewing didn&#39;t last but a few seconds, and left us both stunned, asking eachother &#34;Did you see that?!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I believe she said it was in the Molalla, Oregon area.  While driving, a UFO/Disk chased their car down and literally skidded on top of the roof of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Aunt told me she was driving erratic as she was scared at that point just to stay on the road as it was so bright and her daughters went hysterical and began screaming and yelling.  The object then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She continued on till she saw a House with a light on.  She pulled off and got out of the vehicle.  There was some type of powder or substance on the vehicle all over the top.  I think she said it was Whitish/Yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They rang the doorbell and the man came out of the house.  She explained that she got ran off a road by a UFO/Disk and that the car had evidence of the stuff it put on the roof of the car.  The man then said he BELIEVED HER because the samething on the same road had happened to him in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She also told me that when my Uncle and her owned their Boysenberry Farm not too long ago in Bandon-By-The-Sea Oregon some odd things happened at their home.  Uncle Lonnie died of heart failure.  She would be in the Living Room watching TV and they had a Solar Window over the Roof of the house.  Each night the Helicopters would fly over her house and she would look up and could see them.  It got to the point that she would wave to them as the lights were so bright that they would then Rev up the the motor to let her know they were leaving.  I don&#39;t know if they were just guys out watching the ships, boats out in bandon.  Who knows.   All I know is shortly after that she started to hear something out in her yard and the dog refused to go outside.  She use to keep the bedroom window open and fall asleep as it was hot sometimes in summer.  She said as she slept she could feel something around her ears and it was like a RADIO and broken up Language.  She could feel something touch her ears.  This happened several times and then she would see the helicopters again out there at night and sometimes strange BRIGHT LIGHTS like UFOS out there.  She decided she better keep the windows closed as she noticed several strange marks on her body that she never had before she could not account for.  She got so scared she told her sons and they went up the road one night as there was strange lights in the sky near her neighbors across the road at his Berry Farm.  The kids were worried at that point that maybe a burgular was scaring the local farmers homes at night.  The older man across the road said he had been seeing strange lights off and on as well.  She decided shortly after my Uncle died to sell the farm and move to another part of Oregon.  There was talk in the town that there was a school teacher one day found on the local beach with perfect incision marks on a cut off hand and to this day no body really knew how someone could have a PERFECT cut off incision like her hands looked when they found her.  Some local kid got blamed for it.  But to this day locals said something did not make sence the way she was found out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.
