PD))|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42979.html|1|ndxe196303| ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the parents be invited to submit reports, as well.  We do not understand how a 9-month old infant could remember such an event.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Same event witnessed in Clunes Australia and Clunies in France<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just 9 mths old and we were travelling from Clunes to Maryborough when it took us. Dad was screaming hysterically and they sedated him or something and put him in the wall in a drawer.  It was all shiny inside, the best I could say for years was like chrome plating but better quality with round tables and what I called Marble Statues that were alive and in charge.  I crawlled up to the talles and hit it on the foot for putting dad in the drawer and it rageed at me.  I was sucked into it&#39;s big black hollow eyes and then we were at home.  Only damage to car was paint burnt off roof and it sat in the yard for years.  I was taken often after that, from my bed at night.  The strangest part is tht all of our neighbours son&#39;s were killed at the exact same spot, at least 4 of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recently came across an old article about a sighting and abduction from the same spot a year earlier, and indeed it has been documented by several people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole townof Maryborough watched what I described as a fireworks show several years later that ws witnessed by thousands of people.  I still have to see a fireworks display that beats this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also of note is that at the same time in France at a place called Clunies (coincidence maybe) the same things were going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a hankering to buy some land there and setle and so does my little sister who must have been conceived at about that exact night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In later years as I reached my 20&#39;s the little ones changed from the nice little chaps to taller blonde beings after I moved to Perth and these beings came across as sexy and nice but then turned out to be constructs with many inpliments and instruments coming from their bodies, the pain was horrid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw craft whilst living on Hamilton Island and have on other occaisions sseen what appear to be craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That first incident though I had to wait until I could talk before I could ask my Mum about it.  Dad thinks it was some sort of nightclub, of which I still have not found one yet to match and why a nightclub in the middle of the bush (like putting one at yellowstone or something).  No one knows how we got home that night and no-one ever went near the car again till it was sold some 25 years on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The visits were very frequent inmy early years.For some reason the news articles do not mention clunes in Australian article but I made the immediate connection as it was only less than 10 miles away as per the french sightings. It was like fire to me that is how brightly the object glowed outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/15/63 17:30|Great Lakes|IL|Disk|15 Minutes|Craft of some size flew slowly over the Great Lakes Naval base during my tenure at boot camp.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17476.html|2|ndxe196303| A craft of some size flew slowly over the Great Lakes Naval base during my tenure at boot camp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In early 1963 I was in Navy boot camp at Great Lakes Illinois.  While stand watch one night a craft of considerable size appeared over the base.  It was moving very slowly and completely silent.  It&#39;s hard to estimate size but I would guess 200 Ft. in diameter and at less than 2000 Ft. altitude.  It had rectangular &#34;windows&#34; on the outer circumference which glowed with a red-orange light as the craft slowly revolved.  I don&#39;t recall anything about the actual shape other than it was round. I think I was so transfixed by the lights that I never tried to make out anything else.  Or perhaps it was just such a dark night that the outline couldn&#39;t be seen.  I don&#39;t really know.  The craft moved slowly toward the far end of the base.  There were probably hundreds of trainees looking out the barrick windows.  As I stood there dumbstruck a base security truck pulled up to the gate I was guarding and ordered me to get it open and fast.  I did so even though my orders were that no one, not even the C.O.  was to be allowed to use that gate.  After my watch was over the sentry from across the highway which divided the two parts of the base and was in my company came over and asked me, with his mouth hanging open, if I had seen that.  Everyone saw it.  I never heard another word from anyone about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  If anyone else who saw the same event, we would welcome any additional reports.  PD))<n>
3/15/63 13:00|Normandy Park|WA|Cylinder|5 minutes|Pencil-like objects seen flying over the water.|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87837.html|3|ndxe196303| Pencil-like objects seen flying over the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking out over the bay, we saw two silver objects shaped like pencils...can&#39;t remember seeing exhaust....  They were about a half mile away (it seemed) or closer.  They looked to be about 200 feet above the water.  They were flying close together and toward the north.  They looked just like silver pencils in every way...were cylinders. It was a clear day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them with binoculars and they looked the same as they did with the naked eye.  As I handed the binoculars to my husband, they vanished....he did not see them with the binoculars...but did get a good look at them with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.
