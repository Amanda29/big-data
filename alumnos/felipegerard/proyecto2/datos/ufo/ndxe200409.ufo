I saw a circular shape to the upper right side of my vision.  It was much larger than a star, and was a very vidid, white light.  As it got my attention, I focused on it.  Just then, after being stationary for a very brief moment,  it darted from being in the upper right of my vision to the lower left.  Initially I thought I was witnessing a falling star, but I automatically knew that it was much too large.  The speed at which the object left the upper right side of my vision and darted down to the lower left was way to fast to have been any type of aircraft.  Also, the intensity of the light never changed.  It was if it moved from the upper right to the lower left within a second and then just disappeared or blacked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Too fast for satellite<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10:10 on Thursday night, Sept. 30th I went out on my deck and looked up in a westerly direction, and just at that moment I saw a star sized light, not unlike a satellite moving from east to west through the Lyra constellation at a high rate of speed. It also slowed down at one point and then sped back up until no longer visible. This whole incident lasted about 3 seconds.  This was NOT a meteor (or falling star),it actually appeared to be ascending.   I also felt that it was much to fast to be a satellite, unless we now have a new generation of high speed satellites that I&#39;m unaware of. Also, most satellites I see are moving in a general north-south or south to northerly direction, from my viewpoint and this was as I stated, east to west. Since it was over so fast, I actually shook my head and found myself saying. &#34;did I actually just see that&#34;??  It seemed odd but I guess it could&#39;ve been a satelite?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites do not move with the angular velocity across the sky that the witness seems to suggest with his description.

As I was playing my guitar, I noticed a large crescent shaped object move into view from the west.  The object appeared to be quite distant and large when compared to the apartment building across the street.  The crescent moved slowly and steadily to the east for a few minutes.  Later, it quickly accelerated east out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is difficult to say what it is that I saw other than that it was a dull glowing white light in the shape of a flattened crescent, almost like ground light reflected off a disk seen at an angle.  I can not say whether or not what I saw was part of a larger object.  There may very well be an explanation involving light phenomena or some other yet to be understood physical process.  I chose to report this in hopes that soeone else may have witnessed this event around the same time.  After all, it was a very large object low on the horizon extremely clear viewing conditions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

HOW could I could have missed a jet&#39;s landing light? WHY is there a jet at 6500 feet traveling west here? (it&#39;s not on any flight path that I know of) It&#39;s too late to &#34;dive&#34; out of the way, I&#39;m going to get hit by turbulence no matter what..... then, I didn&#39;t get physically hit? Hey, if it&#39;s a landing light, how can I could still see it as it winked out over the ocean?  This made no sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On first impression, a jet and the bright light I saw was the landing light - then thinking about it, No - it couldn&#39;t be a landing light - I could see it as it went away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> a meteor, A luminescent blue meteor? But, it didn&#39;t &#34;get dim&#34; over the ocean, it just &#34;winked out&#34;. making me think: no smoke trail. How could it be a meteor?  I couldn&#39;t figure out exactly how close it was - but, it appeared at my 10 o&#39;clock and went over the ocean at about my 2 o&#39;clock - and it was only visible for 2-3 seconds. So - it had to be darned close. If I had to guess, less than 200 feet. Maybe 6 to 10 feet long, 4-5 feet wide and 1-2 feet thick. Or maybe 100 feet and it would be a bit smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No wind turbulence, no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weirdest thing I&#39;ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t help thinking that some ET teenager swiped the keys to the saucer when the parents were out and went out with his buddy&#39;s for a night of ET style &#34;cow tipping&#34;......<n> <n><n> <n><n> btw: I was so shocked that I couldn&#39;t talk enough to call Oakland Center (ZOA).......<n>

It traveled in a clockwise circle over downtown Baltimore.  It moved very very slowly.  At first we thought it was a blimp, but it was so strange and quiet that we really couldn&#39;t tell what it was.  I saw it first, on my way to pick up some half and half from the local 7/11.  I went and got my roommate and had her come out to look at it, and when our other roommate came home from work we took her out to see it as well.  No one could say for sure what it was.  Observers are one Hopkins graduate, one current Hopkins undergraduate, and one young professional.  We watched it for a while, and it kept moving in its circle, so we came back to the house to check the news for any report of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It first had red and white blinking lights, then about an hour later, it had red, blue and white flashing lights.  It had three white lights under it with what appeared to be a red circular, glowing light under it.  Approx an hour later, we observed another red and white object, which appeared to be circular in shape.  Approx an hour after the second appeared, we saw another that appeared to be circular in shape and also had red and white flashing lights on it.  My daughter noticed that the three were in a triangular formation  shape...one on the right, one on the left, and one in the middle.  About 30 mins.after we saw the third one, a fourth one appeared.  This one also appeared to be circular in shape with red and white flashing lights on it also.  The first one was the largest of the four.  We sat and watched all four of them.  At times they would move to the left, right, up, down and even in circles.  We never heard a sound of any type.  They never moved fast.  The first and largest one disappeared first, just vanished.  The second one went slowly straight up and as it did, it&#39;s red and white lights turned into a golden color.  It went up and as it did, it got smaller until it actually ended up looking like a star and then just vanished.  We didn&#39;t stay outside too much longer after this, due to the fact that one of the two that remainded started slowly getting closer to us. I wish I had had my video camera and digital camera...unfort. I did not due to the fact that my daughter and I were visiting my friend at her home.   Our backgrounds are:  I am a Naturopathic Doctor, former Nurse,  my friend is a Nurse, and my daughter is also in the Medical Field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Given the long duration of the sighting, combined with the description of the objects, we cannot help but wonder whether the witnesses might have been looking at celestial bodies, possibly twinkling stars.

Blinking lights, some brighter than others, appear and disappear.  The most I&#39;ve seen at one time was approximately six.  At one point when there the largest number of lights, I could hear what you would pass off as airplane noise, but too loud for no real close airplane to be seen.  Several were gathered near each other when the most spectacular display occurred.  At three different areas in the southern sky (at the same time), gatherings of orange lights occurred.  The gathering I focused on formed into four orange lights in a perfect horizontal line.  From my peripheral view I could see other gatherings moving.  Then they faded out.  They were in view for probably 6-7 seconds.  From then on, I watched 2-3 blinking lights move around the whole horizon, ending up back in the southern sky.  At one point they stopped blinking but if you focused, you could see the object still there.  It would appear like a satellite at that point, except that it changed directions at times.  Then it would start blinking again.  After about a half hour, they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It droped directly below the normal everyday aircraft, and then suddenly burst into colorful display of orange and red colors of light coming from the rear delta shaped craft.  It then accelerated at an enormous speed leaving a long contrail of white smoke behind it.  As its speed increased instantly it also began to gain altitude, it then disappeared in the sky, the ordinary looking aircraft immediately landed at the closest airport, which is located at the mojave airport, california.  Other aircraft where in the vicinity, as well as black helicopters shortly after the occurance.  The object made a sound which sounded like a sonic boom, possible from breaking the speed of sound.  The black helicopters that appeared after the occurance had strange effects on the FM and AM radio, as well as lots of mobile phones and remote control devices.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the witness is referring to the flight of the Space Ship One, which flew on this date out of the Mojave, CA, airport.

Bright white light - with short tapered lighted tail entending from the bottom of object. I turned onto highway travelling in a north east direction. The light seemed to pace my vehicle - keeping just to my right. The object would stay on my right of would be slightly ahead of my vehicle to my right. Very bright clear white light appeared to be round object. It would was not that high in the sky - hard to judge - but seemed to be the height of a radio tower. Object was 300- 400 meters away from vehicle.  Again hard to judge distance in dark - but it was close enought that I could see that it would bounce somewhat in flight. The object continued to pace my vehicle for approximatley 4-5 kilometers. At a straight stretch in the road the oject seemed to accelerate past my vehicle and continued in a straight line - in a north east direction. The light was not as bright as if it turned lights ahead. Again it seemed to move slightly up and down like it was hitting turbulance of some sort. The object contiuned travelling straight for 3-4 seconds putting distance between us. The object then made a left hooked turn to the north and seemed to stop - as now the light was brighter again. The object seemed to sink lower in the horizon behind a tree line. I turned north onto another roadway and observed the object just below the tree line area. At this time I contacted a family member - telling them to look out the window of our residence - I explained what had been  seen. The person never seen anything. When I arrived home I observed the bright light to the north east - throught the tree line - slightly obscured. Moments later when I got into my house - both myself and family member observed a very bright light hovering in the east sky - well above tree line and the few houses in the area. Light was not there when I arrived. The light was video taped. It appeard to hover up and down. The light stayed for well over 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness identifies self as being a public employee with considerable responsibility.  PD))<n>

At the first stoplight (the one before the train tracks), I could see a VERY bright light about two miles away, near Reagan National Airport. My first thought was that a plane coming in for landing had turned in a way that created a beam which was brighter than usual. As I drove closer I realized the light was stationary--it was not moving. As I rounded the second entrance to the airport I saw a HUGE silver circle with beams of light directed toward the airport or to Andrews Air Force Base visible just across the Potomac. The &#34;disc&#34; was motionless and only about 100 feet off the ground. It was at a slight tilt and the lights were only coming out of the half closest to the ground. I slowed down to a crawl, watching the &#34;ship&#34; and all of a sudden it moved to above the 14th Street Bridge. It did this effortlessly, and I remember thinking that I had not really seen it move--it re-appeared above the 14th Street Bridge, and I got the feeling &#34;it&#34; knew I would be taking that exit. As I moved into the middle lane going into DC I could see it in my rear view mirror. There were other cars around me--I think I saw two on the Parkway, and maybe two or three behind me on the bridge. All of them should have seen this. Additionally, the ship was near the Boeing comples across from the airport. Certainly someone had caught this on a security tape or a controller had seen it from the airport.  When I got home I tried to call the airport only to find out that all the flights had been cancelled due to Hurricane ? (insert appropriate alphabetical name here). I have sent this in before,the night of the sighting, but I am submitting an electronic rendering that I had made the night of the sighting so I wouldn&#39;t forget details. The picture could not show the point that the craft came to--similar to the bottom of a top, but almost flat. There were green blinking lights and the red symbol is not accurate but there were some red symbols in that position. I seriously doubt this was a plane or Boeing experiment, and wish someone could see if there is evidence of it in any number of security cameras that should be in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first they appeared just as two unseen stars showing through.. and did not move for a couple of seconds. Then both shot across the sky... faster than any plane, no matter how close it was.. they were parallel to each other and stayed on the same route flying south until they were out of sight... It was amazing, almost like it was displayed for me.. they were small and slightly amber in color... it could have been one object.. but I felt it was two... who knows..!!! It was great!!!<n>

My fiance and I saw a HUGE triangle object hovering over Phonenix near the Phoenix Airport. The object had about 25-50 red LED style lights fading on and off slowly and on the tip of the triangle, there was a white light. On the other 2 tips of the craft there were also single white lights. There was no noise it was silent. It appeared to be hoving or moving at a real slow pace. There were 2 airplanes flying around the craft appearing to inspect the huge UFO. The planes looked like ants compared the huge craft. Because we were driving on the highway, we lost sight of it as we drove to 17 north to exit at dunlap ave in Phoenix az. Traffic on the highway appeared to take notice too as we slowed down to 55mph. A police car was next to us observing the UFO with us. We had our digital camera with us and was able to take photos and video of the UFO. Because it was night, the photos and video are blurry, but you can clearly make out the objects shape with the red lights hovering over Phoenix AZ. Unreal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photos, and although they are ambiguous, they do look to be somewhat interesting.  Strangely, NUFORC has received no other report about the alleged event.  PD))<n>

I had just sit down on my 2:00 p.m. break. Due to all the hurricanes we have been recently experiencing, I guess I was just looking in the sky,looking at the clouds. What I saw appeared to be one object moving at a tremendous speed alot faster than any plane Ive seen.It looked to be far away up high. Then it went behind a cloud, when it came back out of behind the cloud.(I would like to say to when I say clouds it was way beyond the cloud) It accelarrated very fast and split in to two different directions then disappeared. I guess it could have been some kind of military aircraft. No telling what high tech stuff we have now(secrectly).<n>

I just looked up at the right time and I saw a dark form coming down through the clouds. then all of a sudden it stops about maybe 1-2 thousand feet above the treetops. Then it slowly hovered in the direction down river. I estimate that I watched it for about4-7 minutes. This was in no way anything but some type of flying craft. It had no lights as it was as dark gray as it could be without being black and it had multiple windows around it&#39;s rim. The bottom did not constntly keep it&#39;s round shape but seemed to shimmy an shake like mercury dropped on the table. When it came down and stopped i thought i saw some type of wave in the air from the bottom. This really freaked me out! I could not keep fishing because I lost my concentration, so i sat on a rock along the river for the longest of time pondering this. As an amature astronermer years ago I had seen some strange lights in the sky at times but this thing was without a doubt a intelligently operated craft flown by someone from somewhere!<n>

It was Yellow-White and looked flat round but lacking any trailing light. The light traveled about 1-2 seconds and taveled about 20-degrees from start of 75 to 50 to 55-degrees. Oddly it came and went out of and into sight without changing size or shape.  Then aprox. 10 seconds later the same event happened in exactly in reverse.  Same portion of sky and all details?<n>

We had just spent three rough days as Hurricane Jeanne just came through on Sunday.   We are use to seeing all sizes of airplanes, from large jets to small twin engine planes most every night.  We also see satellites, the ISS and occasionally a shooting star (Meteor).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight my husband noticed and pointed out to me either several smaller objects flying in a tight formation flying in unison or one big object  with sharp edges silhoutted with multiple lights on the underside all in a  tight but sort of flexible pattern.  It was flying  at about the  speed than most big aircrafts would be flying but lower altitude.  It was flying  from  (from Orlando area) East to West toward the Gulf of Mexico.  The object changed direction, it turned more to the Southwest, but stayed in a tight formation, which is why (without our eyeglasses) we are not certain if the object(s) were one large one or several smaller ones. It almost looked like how geese fly in formation, and maybe one deviates, only these &#34;geese&#34; had lights on them.  Our first thought was it was something like the flying angel&#39;s small jets doing a night time formation up very high.  But there were no jet noises at all, which we normally hear the jet noise at some point.   Anyway thanks for giving us the opportunity to tell someone who wouldn&#39;t think we&#39;d had too many drinks (we had none) when we tell this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was weird was it a sattelite, airplane, secret government aircraft, alien space ship, and then a meteor? I do&#39;t know just letting you know. Plus I have seen about five other weird sightings in the last month. These include lights moving up down and all around and lights going from a stand still to really really fast, lights moving in weird ways and then going out, and weird sounds like hummingor vibrating.

I know for a fact that this was no shooting star because i have seen many myself.  this was very fast and the way it changed colors and just dissapeared so quickly and the other thing was that it seemed to be close to me in distance.  being at night it may have been a few miles away.  it occured so fast that i couldnt see any shape but it had no sound to identify with.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It sat above the trees stobing and pulsing shifting from blue to green to red to white to orange. It appeared to be rotating.... I waited 15 minutes untill I was sure of what I was looking at and I could obviously see that it was moving ... I went to the building next to where I live and got my friend Mike to witness what I was seeing. Hes a skeptic so the first thing out of his mouth was  &#34;thats an airplane&#34;, andhe got argumentative about it. Then I told him how long I had been watching it and he was watching it very closely and said &#34;Thats not an airplane&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at that point that witness number two arrived.... We watched this thing as it moved plused shifted in color and looked at times like it was splitting itself apart in seperate llights it then dropped behind the trees as two what I think were fighter jets moved in on its position then it took off leaving a trail of white light in its passing...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our attention was caught by a very bright light which at first I thought was a satelite. However, we both were surprised at the size (a VERY large star) and speed of the &#34;satelite&#34;. We then thought maybe it was a jet, but there were no blinking lights and no sound. We were watching and wondering when the light began to change to red and then began to fade quickly and then disappeared. We watched the sky a bit longer and saw two planes minutes after the sighting. One passed by the moon similiar to the unidentified flying object which provided us with a good comparison and it looked nothing like the UFO. We don&#39;t know what we saw, but in case anyone else reports a sighting in the same time/area we wanted to add further information.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a very crisp, clear evening, with just a few high clouds drifting south to north.  After just a few minutes I noticed a bright, starlike object sitting in the sky just to my east, and about 30 degrees south of zenith.  I sensed right away that this was the same or similar object as the one(s) I&#39;ve reported recently.  Through binocs, it was a steady, white sphere, but to the naked eye it resembled a bright star or planet shining in the blue sky.  Using the overhead wires as a guide, I confirmed the object was stationary, and remained so for 20 full minutes, not wavering at all, while clouds passed either through or behind where the object sat.  The clouds were so thin and wispy it was hard to say.  At about 6.25 my 16-yr old daughter came home and I called her out and she looked at the object through binoculars, and said it just looked like a white ball.  Her 19-year old friend arrived at about 6.30 and also came out and took a look at it through binoculars.  We were discussing how strange it was that it seems whenever I look for this sphere, I see it.  I looked up again after a few seconds of not looking, and it had vanished.  We were all very surprised that it had been shining so brightly and then suddenly disappeared.  The time was 6.35 PM. The only thing I can determine may have led to it vanishing is that the sun may have dipped far enough behind the mountains that, if reflecting light, it very quickly lost its light source.  But we all agreed that it was an inexplicable sighting.  The two other witnesses are willing to make a report, should you wish to interview them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM THE WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Following is a correction to a report I made Sunday evening.

It was hard to tell how fast it was going but it passed overhead and was gone in 10 to 15 seconds. Quite faster than any plane creeping by.  The object seemed extremely large by assuming each light on it was plane sized and it covered quite a bit of sky.I tried to point it out to others around me but it happened too quickly.  I wished I had a laser pointer or some form of light to get its attention like it got mine.!<n>

I saw a very bright light (ball form) hovering off in the distance above a tree line.  The light moved side to side so quickly all I could see were the tracers it left behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, the light got dim, moved upward, got much brighter and just disappeared. While I was watching it, I was paralyzed. All the hairs on my body stood on end, and I knew I had seen something I shouldn&#39;t have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back out in the daylight hoping to find a cell tower in the place, but there are none.<n>

I woke up my boyfriend and had him come take a look. After watching it and knoiwing this was not normal, we got the vidio camera and caught it on tape, though the strange thing is, that sometimes you could see it with your eyes plan as day, but through the vidio camera you could only see a mist or force field. Then it would become bright and show up on camera again. We also caught 2 other lights (orbs) hovering close to the brightest one. One of the reasons we know it WAS NOT A STAR because no other stars were visable on camera. It was clear skies and we could plainly see the real &#34;stars&#34;. After about 1 hour of watching and taping, we decided to go to bed. That is when we really noticed how much it had moved from where we started watching it. It was amazing that it moved in such away. Not like anything we have ever seen, like a jet moving accross the sky etc. It started about 3:30 am until 5:00 am or longer, unfortunatly we were too tired to stay awake.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stopped by a river to fish around 7pm, and I decided to rest a bit, and have a smoke break and watch my wife fish the river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun was going down over the mountains, and the sky was clear. There were some faint stars becoming visible and I looked up towards the northeast, over a mountain and saw an unusual looking &#39;star&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say &#39;unusual&#39; because it wasn&#39;t a &#39;whitish&#39; color but more of a whitish/bluish color, about half the size of the north star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object for a minute, then realized it was moving very slowly, what appeared to be coming towards us.  It was difficult to estimate the distance or altitude of the &#39;star&#39;, but I would guess it to be at around 7500 AGL, and I can&#39;t even guess at the distance. I am a commercial pilot and have been flying for close to 30 years, so I know what aircraft and other types of objects look like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, about maybe 2 minutes later, the object is getting brighter, again with a bluish tint, and it appears to coming towards us.  There is no noise, and at this time, I yelled to my wife to come look at this object. She came over, and quickly ran to our SUV to get my binocs. I stood watching the object while she was looking through the binocs, saying........&#39;oh my God!!&#39;........I got a look through the binocs and could make out what looked to be a perfectly round, translucent &#39;orb&#39;, with lights around the outer &#39;edge&#39;, if there is such a thing, on a round object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About this time, the hairs on the back of my neck are standing straight out, and I get this very uncomfortable feeling of being &#39;watched&#39;. I&#39;m probably mumbling someting while watching this thing for another minute, and then, suddenly, it shot straight up and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was one of most unusual objects I or my wife have ever witnessed. There was no noise from the craft, and where we were fishing, there was no sound at all, we could not even hear the sound of the river, since the water was so low, so, it was dead silent out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate that we watched it for about 4-5 minutes total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear at the time and no other aircraft flying in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It did not move or make a sound.  May have been 1 mile away.  We had just exited on 31st (?) heading south from Lake Shore Drive to head back north on LSD to find parking for a Fire game.  The craft was South West from this location.  There were no other craft visible in the area.  It appeared to be 30-50&#39; in diameter but there was no point of reference.  The shape seemed to be circular as if it were a very short hollow cylinder shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Facing SE at a 60 degree angle to what looked to be around 5000-10,000 feet was a little white dot in the middle of some cirrus clouds.  It was out of place.  I took my Canon A80 digital camera which has a 11x digital zoom and snapped some pictures at full zoom.  They are blurry at best but do show the metallic coloring.  I then looked at the craft with a pair of cheap binoculars I have in my car.  I was able to make out 3 things.  First of all the Craft consisted of three parts.  The top was an indescriminate shape, neither round, nor square, but has mass like a crumpled up bunch of aluminum foil.  The second part in the middle was square and segmented like 4 or 6 silver lady fingers.  There then was a silver line going down a hundred feet or so, and I couldn&#39;t see what was hanging on it but it was a small white dot. It hung in the air for around 10 minutes and then when I came outside from a store 5 minutes later it was completely gone.  If I had to say what it was my first impression would be a long distance travelling ballon, like the ones millionares use when they try to travel around the world.  But the top of the craft had no distinctive sphere shape and was not at all like that.  Perhaps it was a survelliance craft of some sort?   There were some aircraft in the air, just passenger jets and they seemed below this craft, and they were very small themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am posting hyperlinks to the images I took along with a sketch.

It was about two miles away and seemed to change elevation slowly. I watched it with binoculars for several minutes, but could not get a good look at it since we were under sail. It could have been a ballon or a kite, but looked too large to be either. We could see all kinds of planes all around and the planes were easy to identify. This was no plane. We then lost sight of it when we approached the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To do this I use a Laser speed measuring device.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the afternoon I was on a major north south road in the city’s east end. I was seated inside my parked auto facing north. I was looking at the heavily overcast skies when something caught my eye. I looked directly overhead and saw a large golden orb. It was within the clouds but the bottom of the orb was slightly lower and visible. The clouds were low but I could tell this object was huge. It moved northbound at a high rate of speed causing a wake in the clouds. I could see it was indeed an orb from a distance before it went out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes I texted my radio dispatcher by way of the computer and asked if there were any calls for a meteor or lights in the sky. The dispatcher after several minutes confirmed some calls did come in regarding lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my sighting to myself and made no report to my superiors. I fully expected something in the evening  news about a meteor in the sky. There were no news reports to my knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before this incident I had little interest in UFO  sightings etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

She is studying cloud formation, and weather prediction, so we routinely watch the skies daily, and nightly. The sky was clear, although it was a bit hazy, as the sun did not hurt our eyes to look up. I pointed at 2 objects in the sky, and she soon located them as well. They were very high up, as I am not good with distance, I would say higher than I have ever seen a bird, but yet when I saw them I said &#34;look at how high those birds are&#34;. She had said that they don&#39;t look like birds, as they were shining. We did not hear any engine sound, and observed that these objects were flying in circles around eachother in perfect sync, slowly. After watching for about 5-8 minutes, these 2 objects left their circular pattern, and one turned away flying straight North, which as we watched went directly above our heads, and the other followed within 30 seconds of the other, again staying in perfect sync, and distance of one another. Once these objects were directly above us, we could see a different angle of them, and noticed that their southeast corner or side was shining as the sun was shining on them. It was at first thought to be white, then we noticed it was a silver color when the sun hit them. I have seen very few birds fly that high, and this was even beyond that. We live over a direct path of airplane flight, and during this time not a single airplane was in the area. We also live in a flight area of what I believe to be Military airspace, as the Military base is not far from here. I can just about guarntee that this was an unidentified flying object. UFO&#39;s do exsist, I just can&#39;t say for sure that this is what it was at the distance we saw it at, but I also cannot find any other explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The hot tub jets were turned off so there was very little noise around us at the time.  I looked up at the stars and all of the sudden I saw a black, triangle shaped craft moving almost directly over our house.  I clutched onto my wife&#39;s arm and when she looked up she knew she was seeing exactly the same craft that we had witnessed just 3 years ago from the exact same spot.  As it flew over us, it appeared to veer slightly to the left and then continued flying in a north-eastern direction.  It was black with round lights in each of the three corners and completely silent.  This is the second time we&#39;ve seen this aircraft flying over our house.  The first time we saw it was during the Leonid meteor showers.  It&#39;s almost like it wants to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 19:40 (CET) I saw 6 bright, orange lights moving across the sky with a huge speed. It is hard to say what was an altitude of these objects, they were moving from east to south. The objects were seen for about 5-6 seconds and they just flied into  Space. Some people on the street shouted: &#39;Did you see that?&#39;. So they must have spotted the lights too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crafts did not fly in any kind of formation, there was no sound or other unusual activity.

Ten seconds later I took another as we were stopped for the light.  I had a digital camera in my purse as were going to a wedding reception.  When I downloaded, I had to images of the sky and the first one had the UFO.  It was an orange glow in the center and seemed to have a dark rim around it.  I never saw it when I took the first photo.  The second photo does not have it, so it was not a spot on my windshield.  It&#39;s just another mystery, but maybe there is a logical explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I called to my husband to look at it.  He did not know what it was.  It was a metalic gray color with no windows, no lights, no sound, no wires.  There was, what looked like a small vent on the side of the object.  By the time we moved to a different position to get a better veiw of it, it was gone.  It was in length, about as long as a football field.

It made me feel weird and unsafe because it rode right next to and infront of us. a good way to describe how close it was it was like 3 lanes over, about 40 feet in altitude, pulsing, producing a pulsing trail that was similar to a tear drop stretched out. it began to move side to side and up and down rythmicly pulsing and gave us one last big pulse and it just dissapeared/vanished into thin air. this was my first encounter/eye witness of whatever it was and i am now addicted to glancing at the sky, frequently scanning for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The formation was at an angle of between 10 to 30 degrees off the line of travel, varying that angle over the duration of the sighting.Formation length was about the length of observers  thumb as seen at arms length. Line of travel was from the north west to the south east. This corresponds to the direction from toronto int&#39;l airport to lake ontario. There are many aircraft in the air space in the duration of the day where observation took place. None take this flight path. There was no sound coming from the formation, at least not audible by the observer. Sky was clear with no wind. Light of formation could have been the reflection caused by city street lighting, if the object(s)were of a reflective material such as polished aluminum. Observer watches night/day sky often and has come to know the difference between known aircraft or birds and for example this observation. It was not the first time. People look up at the sky, you&#39;ll be amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Seperate from one another. Perfectly angeled from one another. 2 of the lights were vertical to one another. And appeared to be seperated by at least a thousand feet. The other 4 lights if connected would have made a perfect square. Also about 1000 ft from one another. I could not tell distance at all. It was a clear night over the desert. The light could have been 5 miles away, or 30 miles. The lights then disappeared, sometimes 2 at a time, sometimes one. then would immediately appear maybe a mile to the west of where they had just been seconds before. Again perfectly spaced from one another. At one point one of the lights vanished and immediately like a strobe effect, they moved across the sky for maybe half a mile. then vanished. The lights would appear for about 5 seconds, then vanish for 10 minutes. Then show again. I have been an airline pilot for over a decade and never seen anything like this. There were no beacons, no navigation lights. These did not appear to be helicopters for they moved to smoothly through the sky with no vibration on the lights. And much to quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could it have been military? Possible. But an aircraft we are not privy to know about.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He said he saw stationary multicolored blinking lights in the sky for a few seconds, then they moved off at a great speed, leaving a tracer. Since my friend has about ZERO imagination, I believe he saw something strange. We talked about the possibility of it being a UFO and I jokingly asked if he wanted to report it. He said HE didn&#39;t want to, because someone might come to talk to him and think he was nuts. But he told me it was okay if I knew how to. As I said before, this friend has a sci-fi value of zero, so i believe him that he saw SOMEthing odd. We live near many airports, and there&#39;s no way he&#39;d call and say something if he thought it was even possibly an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S.

We had just passed the exit northbound for Safford, Az. about 5 miles west of a small town called Bowie, Az.  I was sitting in the back seat behind my friend ((name #2 deleted)).  I started to gaze out the window as we all do on road trips, when i noticed a bright, white light in the north part of the sky.  At first I thought it was the North Star, but quickly realized that it wasn&#39;t because it was moving while getting brighter and bigger, then dim and smaller.  I quickly grabbed my camcorder and began filming.  The object, when i first saw it, was in the north part on the sky on the driver&#39;s side of the vehicle.  The object was moving side to side and getting bigger, then smaller, etc.  At 5:11 a.m., the object moved from the north side of the car to the south side of the car while traveling eastbound.  At 5 :19 a.m., the object moved back to the north side of the vehicle.  The sun was starting to rise for the day, and i kept recording until the sun completely rose, and I could no longer film the object.

I was driving west just passing Brookpark at Ridge Rd. and saw the triangle in a banking-type manuever. It was quite clearly backdropped against the sky, and I saw the VERY bright lights at each point with a subdued somewhat pulsating red light in the center. It was approximately 10 to 15 degrees above my straight-ahead line-of-sight and almost directly in line with my car, and seemingly only a couple miles up. There were more than a few vehicles also traveling around me, but I was too fixated on the craft to notice whether anybody else was also observing it. It banked to the south and traveled at a relatively slow rate, while I was able to keep watching it out the window. It was a starless night, at least in that location due to light pollution, but I could still make out the low, thin profile and the lighting beneath it. As I was still viewing it, I passed a tree line at the same elevation obscuring the view, and as I cleared the tree line, it was no longer visible. I have seen the Triangle type before in the late 80s on my way home to Connecticut, where it was amazingly low over the highway traveling at an exceedingly slow speed. The entire highway was apparently watching it as well, as we were creeping along and there was no place to pull over for the people stopped on the side of the highway. Last nights sighting wasn&#39;t quite as dramatic, but having been in the Marine Corps, there was no mistaking it for a conventional aircraft or other natural phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can be contacted via e-mail if so chosen<n>

The objects were moving at a speed I&#39;d say was much slower than a satellite.The objects were by my estimates to be at a very high altitude.The objects moved directly over my location and continued on to the south a little ways, that is when they stopped and after about 20 to 30 seconds there was a slow orangish flash and they were gone.This is not like me to report something like this,but I thought I should share this incident.I work in a medical field and am also a pilot I&#39;ve been married 23yrs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Soon it reappeared then I saw a short tail from it like it was a jet beginning to leave a contrail,however it was very short and then disappeared.  Then I saw another one and the same thing happened.  A long light appeared like a small cloud then it bloomed into a long streak, however it could not have been a cloud that developed so quickly then it evaporated.  I watched this activity until I made a turn and then it went behind a cloud.  I have seen the shiney sphere before not not doing manuevers.

I was otherwise pre-occupied and didn&#39;t really sit down and talk with her about it until last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She told me she was driving to the gym that day. It was late afternoon, perfectly clear sky and plenty of daylight. She was moving slowly in traffic when she caught something out of the corner of her eye. She looked up and saw what she believed was either a large private jet or a small commercial jet. The unusual thing is that, flying about two plane lengths ahead of the aircraft, she clearly saw what appeared to be a small silver ball. The plane and the object flew along a straight flight path. Judging from my daughter&#39;s descriptions, it appeared both were at around 10000 feet, flying perhaps a couple hundred miles an hour. Nothing erratic, just a smooth trajectory across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She had them in clear view for less than a minute. However, during that time she saw the sun glinting off both the jet and the object. They maintained their relative distance from each other but my daughter was convinced that these were two discrete objects and not connected to one another in any way. Again, judging from a drawing she made, I estimate the object was no more than 10 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter is a pretty level-headed young woman.  She said this was like nothing she had ever seen before.  I am reporting this because the sighting took place in a heavily populated area and I would think there might be other independent witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My initial impression was that they were birds.  There is a local species of white crane, but I have never seen them flock like this.  Moreover, these objects appeared to be much higher than the altitudes at which local birds fly.  They were disk like and traversed the sky from SE to NW.  At one point they circled.  They changed formation, appearing as a straight line, a large &#34;v&#34;, an &#34;s&#34; curve, 2 &#34;v&#34; shapes, and random grouping but still close together.  They stayed together for the entire time I observed them (if they had been balloons, I would have expected one or more of them to drift away from the others).  Their reflectivity/brightness varied as they moved across the sky, appearing very bright at one point, then almost disappearing before brightening back up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Was causing my digitial cable to reset and lights to dim and annoyed me. I went to see if my cable &amp; power line were sagging due to the weather, it had been raining and the sky was full of clouds as the remnants of one of the hurricanes passed over. As I looked out my window I saw in the distance a very intense almost neon blue light flashing against the sky.  Each time the light flashed everything electrical stopped.  By my approximation the light appeared to be coming from the Perry Ohio Nuclear Power Plant (approx. 25 miles away).   The light &#34;flashed&#34; just like lightning except it looked like it was orginating from the gound and reflecting up against the clouds.  The last flash was the most intense lighting up the whole horizon and included red and orange as well as blue light and what appeared to be a fireball.  After that no more lights and no more power disturbances. Apperently others saw the light and reported it on the radio next morning WTAM 1100.  I thought it would be good to report the power interruptions as well.  I called the power company the next day to see if anyone else reported power distrubances in my area and they would not tell me.  I have never been through anything like this before and will never forget that light.  It definatelly was not lighting.<n>

The lake was called Hay Lake.  Near Whitney ON(South Algonquin District)  We had arrived there that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10 - 11pm, we had decided to go out to the lake side to start a fire and stare at the stars.  We never lite the fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was crystal clear.  We could see all stars. The hill sides across the water were definitely easy to see reflecting off a moonlite lake.  We walked down to the water line from our cottage around 9:30- 10-ish.  When we had both noticed that a red-ish and oval shape was hovering object above the land across the lake and near what appeared to be &#34;Lower Hay Lake&#34;.  This thing moved in a weird way from right to left and up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best description agreed by us both..........<n> <n><n> <n><n> - Oval-ish and round looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - It&#39;s body seemed to be glowing different colors from red to orange and yellow in a pretty smooth but fast (changing) pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - Separate from the body’s changing colors, was a noticable light that seemed to be shining below and moving around like a search light looking towards the ground and land around it.  ((name deleted)) described it as flickering a white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - Movements were odd.  Mostly in one place but hovering in a way that no man made craft could ever do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -  It was the largest thing in the sky other than the moon.  Like a dime and the moon was a Silver Dollar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing did its dance in the sky for what seemed to be 15 - 20 mins.  We (((name deleted)) and I) debated over what &#34;it&#34; could have possibly been.  In reality over 5 solid min&#39;s guaranteed, and I am now here reporting this in hopes that someone else might have seen something there that night aswell.  I will never forget it.  I am stumped and at a lose to explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Listen, I am a Software Executive and my wife is a Pilates Instructor.  We are not crazy, nor are we big sci-fi movie buffs.  We honestly saw something that spooked us enough, to not want a fire put on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our logic was that since its completely secluded up at the cottage lake, if we could see this thing clear as day, than it could easily see us if we had we put a fire on, no problem.  So hell no to the fire.<n>
9/21/04 22:15|Browns Point|WA|Light||Bright light over South Puget Sound.|9/29/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39421.html|101|ndxe200409| Bright light over South Puget Sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were looking towards the Big Dipper when we noticed a very bright white light traveling through the constellation.  It was headed in an easterly direction over Puget Sound, about 20 degrees above the horizon. My first thought was that it was a plane, but there were no colored or strobe lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see airliners in flight patterns all the time because my house looks north towards Sea-Tac Airport, and there were a number of commercial aircraft in the air at the time. The lights flight path seemed to be crossing the flight paths of the air traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My guess on the altitude was about 10,000 - 15,000 feet, and there were no clouds to interrupt our sighting.  We used a pair of binoculars to try to determine what the light was, and all we could see was a very bright light traveling in front of a star filled sky.  As we determined that it wasn&#39;t a plane, and way too low to be a satellite, it started pulsing then dimmed for about 3-4 seconds turning a soft redish color; and then it just vanished in the area of the constellation of Cassiopeia.  I used the binoculars to try and see if it was still visible, but I couldn&#39;t see anything moving among the star filled background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed seemed to be about the same as a mid-altitude airliner, and the direction was steady. We watched it for 20 or 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife is a UFO skeptic, but she was at a loss to determine what we had been watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The object could not have been the International Space Station, if the time and date above are correct.

9/21/04 22:00|Morehead|KY|Oval|25 seconds|It seems to glow; it is globular in shape|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39643.html|102|ndxe200409| We where on the roof of our home taking pictures of a sunset, we took four pictures of each of us standing in front of the sunset. With a Kodak easyshare, after downloading them into the picture files on our computer we discover that there is a white object off to the side, as we looked at the next three pictures we discover that the object moves farther away with each picture. The pictures where taken approximately three to five seconds apart. I am a non believer myself and I really want to find out what this is that we have unknowingly photographed. I don’t think that it is a digital malfunction of my camera because I have taken very good care of it and I have taken more the 1500 pictures with this camera. The object appears to be white or off white in color, on a standard 8’10’ print out it is one inch wide as well as long. It seems to glow; it is globular in shape and has a darker maybe a shadow ring around the outer part of the outside of the circle shape. It stands out in all four pictures. We live on a big farm and we own dogs and ever since that night they bark relentlessly at times during the night. I don’t know if it is returning and I don’t want to know what it wants I just want to know that what ever is in these pictures are not here to harm us. For the most part you may not believe me but I was the one who brought the camera in and placed them into the folder and I did not leave this computer for anything. I was alone when I put them on and my boyfriend waked in as soon as I brought the picture to full screen. We both looked at each other and said :what is that?&#34; We then looked at the other three and confirmed that it was a moving object traveling in a northwest direction.<n>

It was between the North Star and the horizon. It was approx three times brigter than the star and very vivid. I did a double take when I realized it was moving. Looked very far away but moving at a high rate of speed much faster than a conventional aircraft. It was moving ENE what looked to be level with the horizon. I poked my head inside for a sec and hollared to my wife to come and see. I looked back out and saw that it was tracking away from me. It got a little more faint and seemed to flicker once or twice and disappeared. It was not below the horizon yet but there was very slight cloud (cirrus) but not that low to the horion from what I could tell. The object seemed ro pick up speed just before it vanished. Of course my wife missed it. I love to star gaze, watch meteors and am an avid aircraft buff. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before and am fairly certain it was not one of those. I really hope I hear about it on the news tomorrow. I wish I could have snapped a picture!<n>

It was around 9:15-9:20.  I am uncertain to the exact time because my clock in my car was not set correct due to the fact I changed the battery a few days ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked to the West and saw, what  I thought was a tower I had not noticed before because the light remained in the same spot.  I kept watching it for a few miles and did notice movement.  I saw another car stopped on the side of a parking lot in a place cars should not have been parked because of the hour.  I think they were watching it too.  I found a place to stop and watch.  It moved very slowly, however did appear to speed up after maintaining the same spot for a few minutes.  If flew overhead.  It had a light pattern, however the pattern was not like any I had seen before. I watch the skys at night so I know.  I looked at the craft and it was clearly a black triangle.   As it flew overhead I quick turned off the car to see if I could hear it.  I could hear a low hum, it was differnt from other aircraft I have heard in the past.  This craft was not from the Newark, NYC or Philly airports.  It is possibly from Mcquire airforce base.  I should have paid more attention to the light pattern and copied it down.  It was also a triangle.  It is difficult to judge the size and height.  Normally, I can do this, however this thing was difficult to judge.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I will give you his email address also but for some reason he hasn&#39;t reported this as of yet.  I&#39;m urging him to and I&#39;m sure he will, but for now here is the info I have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He lives in view of the Bremerton ship yard approx. a mile north from the water.  He told me tonight that this was the 3rd time he&#39;s seen this in the last couple months.  What was described to me was two balls of light, one bigger than the other, both hovering over the water and changing colors rapidly from blue to red to green to white then staying white and pulsating, then going back to rapidly changing colors.  One would move slowly to the left and then come back.  The other stayed there, hovering and moving to the left then right then holding position. The bigger one finally moved off to the left then vanished instantly, the smaller one stayed there until finally moving off and getting smaller, then gone.  I was on the phone with him while he was describing this to me. What I wrote down was this: approx. 8:40 pm to 8:48 pm on Tues. night Sept. 21st, 2004.  One big, one small, both pulsating and changing colors from blue to red to green to white, one moving off to left etc. I&#39;m repeating myself so I&#39;ll wrap it up there.  The first time he called me after seeing these same objects was a couple months ago and I can get the details of that sighting also.  Both previous sightings he ran into the house to get his binoculars or monocular and when he returned to the deck they were gone. Tonight he had the mono with him and watched the whole time through that. I could tell he was quite impressed with what he was seeing and kept saying &#34;god, what is that, I don&#39;t know but it&#39;s not helicopters or military planes, I&#39;ll tell you that much.&#34;  Then they were gone and our conversation basically ended a minute or so after that, I told him I would send a link to your website and also report the incident myself. He agreed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, since I have actually sent a picture of something in to you before, I decided to report this first, and then let you pursue an email conversation with him if you wish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His name is ((name deleted))and just for the record does not drink alcohol or take any drugs etc. Sober guy and not likely to be making this kind of thing up. I&#39;ve personally known ((name deleted)) for 20 years and will vouch for that. My name is ((name #2 deleted)), I live here in West Seattle. Anyway, his email address is; ((deleted)). Thanks so much and hope you find this of some use.  My next mission is to buy him a pair of those binoculars that take digital pics so maybe he can get it on film next time:-) Regards, ((name deleted))<n>

More like a cats eye on its side.  In inner parts was a muted white color.  Like an illuminated jelly fish.  However, the most amazy part was the ring around it like you&#39;d see on Saturn.  The ring itself was very bright white.  Off in the distance I could see the moon and in comparisons this object was larger and much closer.  I pulled off the side of the road to watch it even more.  For a while it just seemed to hover.  Then it lowered somewhat in the sky and began to move north west.  As it moved away, very slowly, it turned and when it turned it changed shapes.  As if I was seeing it from a different angle.  There were other witnesses because the highway was busy and I&#39;m sure they had to see the same thing however no one pulled off the road like I had.  It was moving away from me so I decided to head on home but for at least another 10 miles or so I could see the thing in my rear view mirror.  Not as close of course as it had been when I first spotted it but it stayed there until I was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An Army Ammunition facility was near where this craft moved over and then turned north west.  The reason I know the proximity of this facility is that my husband works there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never witnessed seeing anything unusual in my 53 years.  Seeing this was VERY amazing!<n>

It was much larger in size than any airplane lights would be   looked to be about 1/4 mile above the ground and extremely bright like a large star or planet reflecting - but it was obvious that it was in our atmosphere not far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched it while driving down the highway  it appeared to be stationary and solidly bright( extremely bright white ) .  Suddenly it dissappeared as if a switch was shut off - it did not fly off it just shut off the light so to speak    both my oldest son and I witnessed it dissapeared as my wife did not happen to be looking at it at that very moment but was supprised to see it gone so quickly.  As we scanned the sky for it we saw a plane flying in it&#39;s general direction and were able to see just how much larger than a planes lights it actually was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone else reported this sighting?  please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  ((name deleted))<n>

It was flat however, with no limbs of any sort such as wings found on an airplane. I could slightly tell the shape was reminiscent of a disk or saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It began its journey in the near proximity of the moon. As it neared larger cloud formations I could at times see that it was going behind them. The only clouds present in the sky were the high cirrus clouds, yet like I said earlier, I could roughly discern a shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it came from behind a cloud, it had lost its glow and now its shape was much more clearly prominent. It was then a dull metallic hue. Moments later it vanished from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its descent across 1/4 of the sky had taken no more than two minutes. Keep in mind that this was not traveling away from me. It kept its size and girth throughout and seemed to be traveling in an arc or semicircle around my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I frantically searched the dusk sky for the object but I could no longer see it. Resigned to thinking I had hallucinated, I walked away defeated all the while fighting the urge to run into a nearby restaurant and shout &#34;Did you see the UFO?!&#34;  A quick glance caught me off guard as I realized that the object was back in the sky and glowing- only now it was suddenly traveling the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Correct me if I speak wrongly, but can a plane suddenly begin traveling the exact opposite direction in mid flight?  Either I&#39;m on a rollercoaster and this is loony land or I really did see a UFO tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It almost looked like a bright city lamp post light.  The circle was completely still for about 10 minutes and appeared to be low to the horizon (over a tree line) so I could see it directly.  After about 10 minutes of complete motionlessness, the light became brighter and brighter and started to rise.  It rose very smoothly and at first slowly, gradually increasing its ascent upwards.  The movement was mostly vertical, with a bit of angle to it.  As it got higher up, I could see vibrant orange &#34;legs&#34; stemming from the center, looking a bit like spider legs.  In the very center of the yellow circle (underneath the craft), the was a red and green small light.  Once the craft started to ascend, it was out of sight (straight up in the sky) within about 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was on the balcony watching the storm with my girlfriend, when we both saw a triangular shaped thing pass about 150 feet in front of us, the thing seemed to be only about 10-15 feet across.  It has no discernable colors except for three dim orangish lights at each corner.  My girlfriend continued to watch it and I ran to get binoculars, and when I lifted them to view the thing it veered to the left and out of sight.  It was in view for about 15 seconds.  This was not a plane, it was in contrast to what I have read since, too slow and small.  It was about 12 miles from the nearest airport and not in the flight path.  It was flying about 50 feet from the ground.  It was not ball lightning, or any kind or ligtning.  The electric lights in the apartment were flickering but only before the thing was seen, although I am sure this was due to the storm being the skeptic I am.  It sounds really odd, but the thing seemed to be almost like one of those pictures that if you view it at the wrong angle it can&#39;t be seen.  I&#39;m not crazy.  But it sounds like I am.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I figured it to be at least 2-3miles away and about 2000ft up. It did not move, nor did I see any light emitting from it. I would estimate its size to be in the 100ft wide range and twice as long, as well as about 20ft thick. This estimate is based on the lack of atmospheric scintillation. It could have been farther or even closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not reflect any light that I could discern and that made it so black it stood out in the sky like a black nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I put my thumb up to measure it, which was about 1/4 the width of my thumb at arms length, it seemed to just wipe itself away, from tip toward the base in about 1/2 a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the first time I could say I saw a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It took about 3-5 minutes to traverse my whole field of view.  the other sets of lights followed at about the same speed and altitude at about 1 minute 3 minute intervals.  Through binoculars all that could be seen were red and white lights, approximately in an oval shape that were very bright and flashed off and on rapidly (&#34;disco lights&#34;).  the other sets were smaller but had the same red and white &#34;disco lights&#34;.  I would think it was a jet but I never saw any more jets take the path in the 3 nights I was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This would mainly be to confirm someone elses sighting if there are any other reports from D_FW/ Waco/ San Antonio.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We observed them from The Boatyard, however a friend saw it from Glass Beach, also. It hovered for two minutes, then one flew off towards the southwest. The second one followed about one  minute later. While hovering they looked trianglar and silver. This is my second sighting in nine years.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was trying to clean off a very small smudge mark on the lense, so I took my camera outside, pointed it straight up into the clear blue sky where there was nothing , and snapped 2 random shots, 2 seconds apart, in the exact same place in the sky so I could then take my camera back into my office and look at the photographs to see if the smudge marks were gone. They were, but in looking closely at the photographs to see if the smudge was gone, I noticed a small dark speck at the top of the first photo. This is a 6 million pixel high-res digital camera and I zoomed in on the object. Upon doing so, It became clear that this was some kind of flying object, sort of an oval in shape, and by the amount of deep zooming I did, appeared to be very large.

It was before sunrise and the sky was still somewhat dark but beginning lighten. The aircraft appeared to be similar in shape and 1/2 the size of a normal size airliner. I could see the left side of the aircraft and it had a shape of a tail section similar to a normal aircraft but I could not see any defined wings.The aircraft caught my attention because there were no aircraft running lights blinking on the craft and it appeared as though it was preparing to land.(No Airport in the area) The aircraft then made a move in flight where I was able to see several lights under the craft as it was getting farther away from me. I was approximately 1/2 mile from the craft as I was drivng my car Northbound in its direction.As I got closer to the area where I saw the aircraft, I lost sight of it. I looked to the West to see if the craft was actually making a landing in the desert to the West. When I looked in that direction, I saw for a brief second a large craft coming quickly in my direction from almost ground level and then swooping up in a upward direction back up to the sky. I could see what appeared as three dull or filtered circular shaped lights under the craft facing me as the craft darted back up in the sky. I believe there were two white lights with a red/amber light between them under the craft.I estimate the distance between the aicraft and me to be within a couple of hundred yards from my location and there was no engine or jet noise that I could hear coming from the craft.Because I was driving at the time of the sighting,I was unable to stop because there was other traffic at the intersection that I was approaching. It was my initial thought the aircraft that I had seen was sometype of test aircraft from some of the high tech businesses in the area (Orbital Launch Systems). I still cannot understand or identify what I saw as I was on my way to work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I stepped outside for some fresh air and to look at the stars as it was a very clear and dark night. After a short while, I noticed a strange flying object appear in my line of sight (a lot of trees on the property), moving in a straight line northeast to southwest. It flew at medium-to-low altitude and at a consistent rate of medium-fast speed, nothing outrageous. But what was strange was that it seemed to be rectangular, with approximately 6-9 dim reddish-amber lights placed at odd positions around the craft (not symmetrical), and it flew entirely silent through the still, cold, autumn night air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Orange County Municipal airport is about 10 miles away, and we see all kinds of private aircraft and ultralight homebuilt planes fly over during the day. But they all make plenty of standard aircraft engine noise, and at night, always have the required symmetrical lighting and flashing strobe light. Though I did witness this in the dark of night, the rectangular craft did not remotely appear to be any kind of conventional aircraft whatsoever. Most importantly, it was totally silent with strange non-regulation lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 48-year old artist, musician, graphic designer, and arts educator from New York City, so I feel like I am visually literate. I am a fairly recent newcomer to this small summertime bungalow co-op here in  Pine Bush, though my wife&#39;s family have been members for 20+ years. While I have not witnessed any previous UFO activity in the 5 summers I have been coming here, nearly all long-term co-op members have UFO stories of their own to tell from back when this whole area was a UFO hotspot. One woman and her ex- both insist that about 15 years ago they were physically restrained in their beds during a &#34;close encounter&#34; and witnessed a saucer take off out of the neighbor&#39;s field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am only filing this report now as I recently discovered your organization and web site, and just today read someone else&#39;s account of a flying rectangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I figured it was just a plane, but since I had seen three mysterious lights in the same area earlier in the week, I decided to watch to see if they behaved in a similair fashion.  After appearing to hover for a few minutes, the lights suddenly began to bob and weave, rapidly ascending a short distance then falling back below the tree line, appearing a short distance away in a few seconds, then moving in apparently random patterns including figure eights and loops.  I am not currenly aware of any helicopter or plane that could have done this without some change in the quality and direction of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I do live relatively close to the Buffalo International Airport, but I also saw a plane pass by far overhead while the lights were moving in patterns, and it most definetly did not resemble what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He also saw what appeared to be an appendage of lights appearing to hang below the main body, also flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the object fly for several minutes, it slowly moved up and behind the nearby mountain. MUFON finds the witness highly reliable, accurate in his testimony and feel he did witness something quite strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by Mr. Kim Shaffer, State Director for MUFON Tennessee.

I noticed three yellow lights circling in a small circle and commented that it was weird how backed up the planes were that night figuring that they were planes waiting to land. They circled closer to each other very quickly. When they moved that fast and close we knew they couldn&#39;t be planes. One of them that changed to red and then back to blue and then yellow took off from the others heading east very quickly moving across the sky until out of sight. The other two, one of them changing to red then yellow while the other one changed yellow then blue circled each other twice and then the one that was yellow then blue took off going west and then the other one took off after it. We were looking northwest when we seen all this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw two satellites close together following the same path from south to north.  The rear satellite started glowing brightly at about 60 degrees from the horizon, which I thought was odd because I didn&#39;t notice the first one doing this.  It almost looked as if something was shining a bright light on it for about 2 or 3 seconds.  About 30 seconds after they were no longer visible, an object(s) came from the north going south.  My first thought was a meteor, but then realized there were several lights.  Second thought was an airplane, but it was moving very quickly, seemed to be high up, and seemed to be very large.  There was a cluster of three or four lights, different colors but not sure what, followed by two small lights.  One light following was directly behind the cluster, the other was off to the side and rear.  This one appeared reddish.  There was no noise and it was moving too quickly to be a normal jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following night at the same time, 9:25 PM, I saw two orangish lights following each other from directly overhead, curving around south and then quickly to the west.  They were gone in one or two seconds.  Possible search lights from the Myrtle Beach Airport, however there were no clouds in the sky to reflect off of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed an Iridium satellite.  Just a guess.  PD))<n>

I was was not looking up however the sudden brightness brought my attention to the stars.  For about 35-40 seconds the objects lights were very, very bright and moving slowly east, northeast and &#34;away&#34; from earth, then began to dim over the remaining minute of viewing time until they became less viewable and dimmer.  Both objects appeared in unisen in their movements.  The objects were not traveling across the skyline, yet just slightly in a direction away from earth.  About one minute after their dissapearance, another object travelled from s/east to n/west as a whitish, redish, orange light which did not have the characteristics of a &#34;shooting star&#34; at all and was much faster than a satelite.  This object traveled in a straight line and did not vary in brightness and did not appear to be encountering earths atmosphere.  My wife would neither agree or disagree that these objects were not of our planets origin and jokingly says that if they are visitors from another part of the universe they likely decided to leave as soon as they got here because of what they found....  I laughed, however I beleive this siting has merit as UFO&#39;s and will watch this site for other reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But last night for the first time, I was looking at the sky and I saw a light turn on for one second and then turn off. I thought it was my vision even though I have perfect vision but I kept looking for it again in the same area. Within a 20 minute period, I saw the light about 7 times. It would turn on for one second, then turn off for about 3 minutes. Have you heard of anything like this? I have never seen something like this in the sky before. Could it be a stationary satellite that flashes once in a while? Looking forward to your response. The size of the light was like a bright star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear day very sunny, beautiful day. I was walking from the garage to the house and looked up and noticed a bright silver or alummium color cigar or blimp shape object in about a 45 degree angle going really fast across the sky from the N.E.tO the S.W. for approx 10to15 seconds  the sun was really shinning on the object caught my eye,I was home by myself there was none of my neigbors out side at that time. It was something I have never ever seen before .It was not a plane it went really fast,no trail,made no sound. I was thinking about this all day and hope someone else may have seen this object and this would help you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Lights in the rear were criss-crossing within the formation. They traveled approx 110 degrees of sky in 10 seconds or less, silently. We live within 5 miles of Buffalo Niagara International Airport and are very familiar with approach and landing patterns, and have never seen any traveling in this direction. The altitude is hardest to estimate; we can only say that we see aircraft traveling higher and lower than the lights observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed very high and was completely silent, moving from northeast to the southwest.  Compared to a comercial planes that regularly fly over our home, this thing was at least 10 times wider.  All you could see was a grey shape gliding over our house against the darker sky and stars.  There were no lights on this object but it had a glow like moonlight does on a cloud.  When I first saw it I pointed and started to say look, look, look and my wife looked up and saw the exact same thing. This was no flying saucer, it was chevron shaped, and it was no cloud!!<n>

After approximately five minutes, two of them drifted below the tree line (Approximately a mile away I estimate) while the third one remained in sight. At this point, a jet passed by my bedroom window on the opposite side, and much closer than the lights making the usual noises associated with a jet. A family member brought me a pair of binoculars, but even still the light only became a more visible cross shape with no definable object behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, the light moved up into the sky slightly, then to the right, then left, before dropping straight down behind the same tree line the others had gone behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, after two of the lights dissappeared, there appeared to be another distant light behind and to the right of the remaining light, although this might have been another plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Getting out of my car, I got out my binoculars (I keep them in my car) and observed the craft as it headed north over Lake Washington, finally disappearing behind some trees.  What initially attracted my attention was the triangular configuration of the lights, which seemed to swoop down from above me and then turn north.  With the binoculars, I was able to discern a dark triangular shape which was completely silent, flying low and slow...maybe 500ft at about 50 knots.  I have never seen anything like this: there are always a lot of planes flying west over our house and then turning south to land at Boeing Field, but these planes are much higher and you can always hear the jet noise, helicopter blade noise or small prop engines.  As this unknown craft got farther up the lake, I was observing the tail of the craft and noticed flashing white, red and yellow lights somewhat like &#34;disco&#34; lights.  I estimate that this craft was about the size of a 737.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first we had thought they might be planes as we go to a flight school, and are very near an airport.  But because we are so familiar with airplanes something just didn&#39;t seem right, as the objects had no blinking lights.  Planes have two blinking lights on their wings (one green one red) and one on the tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be about 400-500ft in the air and about 35 degrees with respect to the ground.  They also appeared to be very small spherical objects.  The 4 equidistant objects were in a straight line which appeared to increase in altitude from left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to be moving with us.  It was very cloudy for AZ, and just before a storm.  There was also some lightning.  We had just left a movie and were on Glassford Hill Rd. Approaching HWY 89A when we first saw the lights. (At least that is what I would call them even thought they seem to have more of a substance and may have been metallic as the one I was watching seemed to change colors, which I reasoned to be because of the setting sun).  One of the people in the car (an Aerospace Engineering Major) saw them seem to disappear in to the clouds (which also lead us to believe that they were not airplanes).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I said wait let me grab my glasses, and I came back outside to confirm with him 4-5 silver (we thought planes at first) objects in t he sky. It was crystal clear out and the sun was reflecting off of the objects so it was very easy to see them, but at the same time if you took your eyes off of the objects it took a few seconds to find them again. I really don&#39;t want to say it couldn&#39;t have been planes, although there were too many in the same area and they weren&#39;t b-lining like a plane would, they were just moving a little this way and a little that way. I would say they were 30,000-40,000 feet in the air, but it was so clear out that it was possible to see with the naked eye, in my case with glasses.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were brushed chrome colored.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An f-15 followed soon after in what appeared to be a chase.  My mother and I are both from montana and were attending a class.  We had never before seen a ufo.  My mother tried to take a picture but when it was developed no pictures from the role turned out.  I do not know about the others as we never spoke with them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we left in our vehicles we saw a &#34;mothership&#34; it was enormous and would appear on the left (west) of us and then suddenly appear in the east. It was about a mile away but looked like a city in the sky. You could see lights in the middle of it that appeared to be windows.  I had severe pains in the stomach (possibly from low blood sugar) but was very excited.  And starting about a month later i wrote symbols, page after page, although I don&#39;t know what they mean. I have written them now for 12 years. Very curious!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

After a few seconds we found ourselves both staring at the same place in the sky for a minute and commenting to each other it was a strange feeling about that one particlar spot that kept making us glance up to that point in the sky. I joked that there was probably a U.F.O up there that we couldn&#39;t see with our eyes, but could more or less sense. I got our camera and snapped a couple of pics. of the cloud bank and sure enough when I downloaded them to the compter something showed up, I&#39;m not saying I was right but there seemed to be a presence up there getting our attention.

We watched it for about 45 mins from inside and went outside for 20 mins to get a closer look. It moved without moving, almost as if it were a star, but much brighter. We also noticed the stars around it definitly not moving at the same speed. We are students and I have been an armchair astronomer for years.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like a *backward&#34; triangle is the best I can describe it. the flat base of the triangle in the front and the point in the rear moving WSW. There were 3 large red lights, one in each corner of the triangle as well as a slow pulsing white light on the bottom and I assume one on the top as it was very cloudy and when the light pulsed on the bottom the clouds directly over the object lit up white as well. There was something very unnerving about the object. I went out on the balcony to get a better look and there was no sound coming from it that I could here and it just seemed to glide across the sky from SE to WSW. I live about 20 minutes from the Philadelphia International airport so we see airplanes fly over all the time. This was nothing like I had ever seen. I immediately woke my wife to tell her about it. She insisted that I report it to see if anyone else had seen this or if anyone new is it was a conventional object. I must note however, I was so shaken after seeing the object that I was unable to sleep at all until the next evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

((Celestial objects??))|9/29/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39432.html|159|ndxe200409| One very luminated bright light just hovering in the sky, than it would slowly fade,see a haze than re-appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were out at our farm house on the weekend of Sept. 17-19, 2004 like we do just about every other weekend.  Friday night the stars were just beautiful and bright, as usual on a clear night.  Saturday night we went outside and sat on the deck looking up at the stars then we went inside to get ready for bed.  My husband got up at around 3AM and went down to the kitchen and a few minutes later he was hollering at me to rush downstairs because there was something in the sky that wasn&#39;t there before, EVER. (My husband grew up on this farm so he is very familiar with all the surroundings).  I rushed downstairs into the kitchen and looked out our bay window, there in the sky, it seemed so close, a very bright luminating light.  I looked down at my watch and it read exactly 3:15AM.  It just stayed suspended in the sky getting brighter than it would slowly fade to where you could not see it all, but you could see a cloud or some sort of haze as to where it was, than all of sudden it would re-appear, stay very, very bright for about 15-20 min. than fade away and than you could see the haze for about 3 minutes than it would re-appear.  The same process over and over again.  Than off to the east my husband tells me to look left there is another one.  However, this showed multi-colors and was further away but it would fade and come back like the other.  Oh, also when we stood there very quietly there was this humming sound in the air like being at a power plant.  Another thing was, that our dogs would not go outside, but the dogs at the nearby farms were barking just a bit different than normal.  We went outside, got on the roof, walked down the driveway just watching both of them,  mainly the more luminated one because it seemed so darn close.  We watched the whole time until they even left.  The sun started to come up all the stars slowly started to disappear as they normally do, but these two lights stayed until 7 AM.  They slowing lifted into the sky, it took them approx. 1 hour to where they were completly out of our view.  The whole time we just kept saying &#34;I do not believe this,  I can not believe this.&#34;  But once daylight hit and all the other stars left we knew we have seen something.  We told eachother that we wouldn&#39;t tell anybody because they would think we were nuts, but we told 2 people and they said &#34;Oh, you were probably still sleepy and didn&#39;t know what you saw.&#34;  But we knew what we saw so I had to find a website to tell to somebody.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses were observing celestial bodies.

I have waited until today to report because I had hoped to see a planet or star in the same position on the following nights, but that was not the case.  In fact, I saw the same light in the northern sky, at 22:00 hourst tonight.  Same bright, color changing light, moving and swaying around and around.  These objects are of the first magnitude.

C..  Hurricane Ivan had just passed our area.  It was late afternoon and a large part of the sky was clear blue.  After a hurricane the clouds are lied up picturesquely.  I happened to look up because of the beauty of the clear blue sky color, and out of the corner of my eye I noticed a craft moving very slowly northward.  It had no wings, no lights, but appeared to be a smooth oval except for an indistinguishable darker area around center - horizontally.  It semed to be about the height of the cloud bases.  The color was silver  or white reflecting the color of the sky.  I watched it saunter along for a few minutes, I turned my head, and when I turned back It had disappeared.  As slow as it was moving, it couldn&#39;t reach the nearest cloud in the area in that split second of time.   ---  ss<n>

It was continuously moving a very slow speed, approximately twenty feet above the Redwood trees.  I made a u-turn and followed it at about thirty mph in my car, for almost two miles as it flew slowly northward in a straight path.  There were cars behind me so I pulled to the curb and I watched it for a couple of minutes to see what it would do next.  It continued northward for about two minutes, then made a gradual turn and headed south, in the same path and manner as it had previously gone.  I rolled down my window so I could hear what kind of sound the aircraft had, which was only a low humming motor sound.  I turned and followed it in my car for about three more minutes, when it disappeared from my sight over the trees.  I could only see the bottom of the aircraft because it was traveling so low and the top was not illuminated.  What I saw looked like it was made of galvanized steel, with a ridge from front to back on each side.  The bottom was flat and there was a red light on each of its three points.  There was a green light on the right front side near the red light in the front.  The green light only flashed twice when the craft was headed north and I couldn&#39;t see the green light when it was headed south.  The red lights gradually faded, but never went completely off, then got bright again, about every two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When me and my buddy made eye contact we seen a quick flash of light so bright that it was blinding and in a blink of an eye the crafts were gone.

This object was flying about a mile or two over the treeline to the Northeast.  The treeline being about 50 to 60 yards from us.  The object at first looked to be a line of red light, but when seen through the viewfinder of the camcorder, had three distinct red lights.  This is the fourth triangular object videotaped over Sonora, CA since May and the only one to be seen with all red lights, and the only one flying North over Lyons Bald Mountain.

There was no other air traffic at this time. The lights were bright and surrounded the entire craft and very bright. The craft was going about 5 knots as if collecting data. Then increased speed and we lost sight of it. this was at 21:09L San Antonio; just then at 21:15 2 fighter jets soomed by in the same direction North West direction towards what was Kelly AFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed in a hurry to catch up.

I was looking nearly straight up into the constellation of Cygnus when I noticed a flashing object. It first appeared like a twinkling star, but I saw that none of the adjacent stars were twinkling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching and distinctly saw a flashing/strobing object at extreme altitude and not changing its position.  I told my two friends and they also saw the light.  I got my 10x50 binoculars for a closer inspection.  It appeared to be a blue-white square object that flashed on and off.  It was probably reflecting sunlight and it was flapping back and forth like a stiff flag in the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then tried to observe it in my 8 inch telescope, but was unable to find it due to its intermittent nature.  I scanned for about 2 minutes with the telescope, then looked with naked eyes again and it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because it did not change location relative to background stars, the only thing it could have been is a geostationary satellite; however, I am not sure that these types of satellites have any significant motion to cause the somewhat aggressive flashing and flapping that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Addendum to 9/17/04 report<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is an addendum to my report to your database from yesterday.  After some research on geostationary satellites, I have the understanding that they are all in equatorial orbits.  The stationary flashing object was located at approximately 35 degrees North latitude and 20hr 30min West longitude in Cygnus.  I don&#39;t think that location corresponds to a geosynchronous orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2nd Addendum to report from Dugas...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I meant Declination +35 and Right Ascension 20hr 30min coordinates in my last entry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ooops..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Geostationary satellites are above the equator, and are not visible from Arizona.

Through the winshield of my car I spotted a silver cigar shaped object appear in the sky (the object looked like a silver platter until it rolled on it&#39;s side then it looked like a cigar).  Once I saw the thing in the air I looked out my car driver side window as I was at a stop light and the thing was still there.  Unfortunately this thing only was around for about 5 seconds that I could see it.  I would have to say that if straight up was 12 o&#39;clock and the base of the foothills were 3 o&#39;clock then it appeared to be in the 1 o&#39;clock position.  The object was moving in an easterly direction initially, I would say the length seemed to be bigger than most airplanes  and helicopters that usually fly in our area. Up until that point I saw no planes, helicopters or hot air balloons in the sky.  The object seemed to rotate or flip on it&#39;s side and move up in the straight up in the air.  At this time I thought it might be a plane, but it then disappeared.  It seemed to faded in the background of the sky, but there were no clouds or anything else to hide it.  I continued to look for any signs of planes or anything that could explain this but I cannot find any.  I continued to look in the southern sky for the next 5 minutes but could not find any signs of it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I FOCUSED MY GAZE UPON IT AND NOTICED IT WAS SPHERICAL. I WENT INSIDE TO GET THE BINOCULARS. THE OBJECT WAS STILL THERE WHEN I GOT BACK OUTSIDE. THE OBJECT WAS VERY CLEAR WITH THE BINOCULARS. IT WAS A SILVER SPHERE.THE EASTERN SUN WAS REFLECTING OFF ITS SURFACE. THE SPHERE HAD FIVE SILVER LEGS UNDERNEATH IT THAT WERE POSITIONED AROUND ITS PERIMITER.

BUT THE SPHERE HAD NOT MOVED FROM ITS INIITIAL POSITION! I STUDIED IT MORE CLOSLY. IT WAS SOLID AND SILVER AND REFLECTED THE SUN. IT DID NOT MOVE WITH THE BREEZE. THERE WAS NO SOUND FROM IT.

I WAS AMAZED TO SEE THAT IT WAS STILL THERE! ONLY IT WAS HIGHER UP IN THE AIR AND HAD ASCENDED DIRECTLY UP FROM ITS STATIONARY POSITION AND NOW IT WAS AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH IN SIZE FROM WHERE I WAS ON THE GROUND. I WENT BACK INSIDE AND RETURNED OUTSIDE AT 11:00 A.M. TO SEE THE SPHERE CONTINUE TO ASCEND INTO THE SKY UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In addition to myself, the event was witnessed by my wife and four masonry contractors who were installing our patio. As the prior witness reported, the object was a large translucent silver sphere with six legs positioned around its perimeter. A line extended from its center with a ball shaped object attached at the end. There appeared to be a pulsating pale yellow light within the interior portion of the object. The contractors humorously likened the object&#39;s configuration to that of a huge jelly fish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained static and fixed in its position for more than three hours. The contractors reported that it eventually ascended and moved westward out of sight at approximately 11:00 AM. A friend later called to report that he initially observed the same object at daybreak hovering over his nearby home in Scottsdale. He also advised that the sighting was first reported by the local news media as an experimental balloon launched by Arizona State University. A second report stated that the object was a NASA experimental craft and that it had crash landed somewhere outside the local area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the object might have been a large, helium-filled balloon, as indicated by the witness.

It WAS the middle of last week between 4:30 A.M. and 5:15 A.M. I got home from work and parked my car facing east. I climbed out facing north and noticed that somebody had moved Venus (the Morning Star) and I thought, how did they do that?, why did they do that?, who did that? I then looked where Venus was supposed to be, and lo, there it was! So I look back and it starts darting around as if the driver is getting a feel for the controls. It was between the ladle end of the Big Dipper and the horizon when it sped away quickly enough to SEEM to blink out, however, I did note a very faint light trail. My perspective suggested a diection slightly to the right and below the lower right star at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;m a wanna-be astronomer - I don&#39;t know the names of constellations, but I know what my sky is supposed to look like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s the only reason I even noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I focused my binoculars on the ones that didn&#39;t belong, it was very difficult to estimate the altitude.  If I were to guess, I&#39;d say it hovered at about 500&#39; - 1000&#39;.  The object was not obviously solid, and appeared nearly the same color as the sky.  As it went overhead it had a more discernable shape, a &#34;dim&#34; triangle with a light at each point and one light in the center. It appeared slightly darker, but remained a close match to the sky color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 minutes of watching, the craft quickly accelerated from it&#39;s position directly over Bedichek Middle School at William Cannon and South 1st to what was probably about 500 mph or faster and didn&#39;t appear to change altitude - it was observable for another 5 to 6 seconds, and traveled directly over my house in a West (slightly SW) direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it moved, there was absolutely no sound.  It was palpable, though, felt almost like the air became thick and humid, and there was a barely detectable &#34;electrical&#34; smell in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> about 1 minute after the ufo sped away, an aircraft (normal jet from Austin Airport in a normal pattern) passed over<n>

The light would move left and right and up and down in small, seemingly uncoordinated actions.  There were different colors that were emitted...Green to Red to Orange.  The light was also emitted from the &#34;Corners&#34; of the object at 45 degree angles relative to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the ten minute interval that the object was visable, there was a commercial aircraft inbound to Seattle vacinity that showed no difference to object.   Within a minute of the commercial aircraft, there was another aircraft that looked as if it flew withing a few hundred feet of the object and after passing the object, none of the aircraft light could be seen anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event was witnessed by two adults and four children.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wow.<n>

KK. Directly in front of us about 1 mile away looking west through an open area of the tree line we saw 4 orange lights appearing to be situated on one object. Two rows of lights each row having two lights of the same size and shape.  The horizontal distance between the top two lights were about twice that of the horizontal distance between the bottom two lights which were centered under the top two lights. The vertical distance between the top and bottom rows were about the same as the horizontal distance of the bottom two lights. As we moved closer to the Hwy the treeline blocked our view of the object. I then backed up for a second look and my wife and I once again clearly saw it through the opening in the tree line. It had not moved away and was still in the same position. We heard military aircraft flying close by  (this is a military operations area and they practice here nearly every day). Directly across the highway is a county road where I once lived as a farm boy and the area is very familiar to me. My wife and I proceeded down the road to get a closer look at this object but never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: My father saw strange lights in this same area on 9/23/2003 at the same time in the evening and reported to this website. I would like to take a ride with these guys sometime as I am a helicopter pilot myself......as long as they promise not to do any abductions or cattle mutilations....I am not into that kind of thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up to see only a few stars in the sky; it was the very end of twilight. I then noticed a very faint star that had just appeared. Then I noticed it was moving, but it seemed very high in altitude. I thought perhaps it was a satellite, but there was so much light pollution and so few stars visible, it didn&#39;t seem possible that a such a small object would or could be seen and tracked. Then, suddenly, the extremely faint object (it was white, no colors that might indicate an aircraft) grew quite bright. I would call it a &#39;Flare up&#39; in intensity, but it wasn&#39;t flickering like fire might. It radiated a bright, pure white light for about 2-3 seconds. Then the object dimmed to it&#39;s original faintness. Then it disappeared altogether. My eyes were strained trying to follow it. A few seconds later the object appeared, moving in a dirction at a perfect right angle to where it had been traveling. Then it dimmed and disappeared. This was not an aircraft I&#39;m familar with. It was far to high for a helicopter, and no sound was heard. I&#39;m not really into UFO reporting, but I am into the truth. And this was high enough on the strange meter that I figured somebody ought to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed the &#34;flare&#34; from an Iridium satellite.

All of a sudden I notice 3 blinking lights in the sky staying still, then all of a sudden they start moving out to sea. one of the blinking lights moves over to another then back to its orginal position. if you were to draw straight lines to each they would have formed a right triangle. After they were out of viewing distance another single blinking light comes across the sky. 3 times did this ufo let off a light that lasted about 5 seconds each time and it was a orange redish glow that only shot upwards. That was it but remember during all of this it is cloudy no stars are visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a set of white lights (3 to be exact) in the sky, just to the south east of where I was. I was on the cell phone speaking to a friend at the time, and kept her on the phone. I described everything to her as I saw it occur.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watching the road and glancing at it, I was coming closer to it. I noticed that it was stationary over a little farm house next to the road. This is a very dark area at night. And few cars travel it in the night time hours. I only noticed 2 other vehicles in my 9 minute drive from Arlington. Where I had been visiting my sister and Mother for Tea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still on the phone with my friend, I soon was pretty much coming up underneath of this object. The color was very dark, a green, brown, possibly black color. I tried looking to get more detail, but didnt want to run off this country road.  However I noticed it had wings of a sort, but not positioned like any other plane I had seen before. And it was very disturbing that it had absolutely no sound at all. Scared me...nothing like I have seen before...you go figure? This object was near enough to the ground, I should have seen landing gear if this were a plane..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS:<n> <n><n> <n><n> In answer to your question, The sighting  was at approximately 8:10 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

Unknown altitude, but seemed to not be of very high altitude. It appeared to be near or south of the vacinity of Albuquerque Sunport Airport, normal air traffic was witnessed as well. It was very bright, altough at first thought it may be a planet. However, after arriving home and watching from my window, it was becoming brighter. I went outside, saw a neighbor with camera and telescope. He saw it as well and took pictures. It appears as possible weather balloon, semi-roundish upsidedown cone shape, with series of cylindrical objects attached to sides and &#34;ropes&#34; hanging from it, holding something at an apex. However, the odd thing. From the time I went from my window, to outside to observe, in a cloudless dark sky, it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

MUCH slower then any plane or helicopter ive ever seen in this valley... (wallingford is located about five miles from an airport.) after a minute of watching this object, i was puzzled, i saw no tail or wings as youd expect on a conventional aircraft, so i ran downstairs and grabbed a set of binoculars. once i got back to my perch at my window, i imediatley noticed the object was getting furthur away. once i got it into focus, the floater seemed to have no defining details. in fact, it almost looked two dimensional. then, i saw a second of the same description slowly fly towards it. after only a few seconds of seeing the two objects, they disapeered behind a tree near my window. i tried to move to a better vantage point but couldnt see them. pretty weird stuff. never seen anything like it around here.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object would stop every two minutes or so and flash red light between the two objects, then the larger of the two object would flash a green then blue light towards the ground.  The objects were hovering or flying above a farm. After about twenty minutes the object then departed they were spun off, like someone had a rock tied to the end of a rope and then let go of the rope, they left in a high rate of speed.

This story is the second of the two.  Having my evening smoke and staring into the night sky.  I saw a very strange bright red light.  Comparing to other passenger planes. Normal craft has a blinking white light with a constant orange light. the light i saw was bright blood red.  Normal planes in the sky has a vibration, this didnt.  I saw it pass a plane the lights turned off and re-appeared in the same path it was on.  At first I thought i lost it and thought if it was a satelitte.  I know this wasnt a satillite cause this was zig zagging slowly.  Very hard to notice.  Also the red light patterns were 3 slow blinks then three seconds later they would repeat.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One was in front and much further behind the other two followed the same distance apart.  They formed a triangle as would three planes in that formation.  No visable blinking, they were not alot brighter than the satelite we were watching.  (I would just like to know if we have satelites that fly in formation)  Nothing exciting here and I would rather it not get posted.  This happened in September 2004.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

He was messing around on his skateboard while I was sitting on the curb.  After he messed up a trick he was working on he looks up to the sky and says, &#34;Is that what I think it is?!&#34;  I look up to see three white lights in the shape of a right triangle flying directly over my head moving from west to east, rotating slowly clockwise.  It was travelling at a speed faster than a helicopter but slower than an airplane.  It made absoutely no noise and blocked the stars behind it.  It is hard to judge size and altitude of the craft but I would guess around 15-25 feet from point to point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it got to a point in the sky it stopped moving, but kept rotating in place slowly drifting around.  We watched it for a good 15 minutes when my friend&#39;s brother showed up in his car.  I ran to him and told him to turn off the car and look at this.  After a minute of trying to point it out (it was rather hard to see at this point on account of how bright the stars were and how far away it was) we realized that me and my friend were actually watching two different crafts that everyone could see, both hovering and rotating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10 minutes after the 3 of us watched the crafts, one just randomly vanishes, while the other&#39;s lights turned to a red/brown color (maroon?) and took off extremely fast heading north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But that wasn&#39;t the end of it! 	Freaked out, we kept staring at the sky for another 30 minutes or so before we spotted 4 white lights in the shape of a trapezoid once again going from east to west, the lights slowly moving in and out of the shape of the craft.  This one didn&#39;t stop to hover at all it just kept moving until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after my next door neighbor pulls up seeing us staring at the sky and starts asking questions.  It didn&#39;t take long for him to start talking about his various UFO experiences and then again we saw more lights like the trapezoid, except this time it was two groups of two lights acting the same way the first one did, moving closer then further together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well we stuck around for awhile long staring at the sky talking about the occurance trying to rule out any explanations.  It was spring time and geese will  fly in formations similar to what we saw the last three crafts.  Shortly after that came up we actually saw geese flying not east to west, but south to north.  They were slower, loud, and not pulsing in and out like we saw before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three years later, around the same time in the year, I was working at a restaurant in the same town.  It was about 11 or so at night and I out back taking a smoke break when I actually saw two more pairs of two lights pulsing in and out, heading east to west just as I saw on the night that I had just described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also like to note that about 100 miles west of where this all happened is a military base.<n>

(CST), 15 SEP 04, in SSW direction from Copperas Cove, Texas a UFO (glowing and blurry elongated object) moved at multiple velocities in an east-west direction back and forth.  The movements were accompanied by altitude adjustments as well.  Movements were further characterized by rapid (erratic) changes in direction.  The object appeared to have mostly a reddish glow to it however at times it appeared yellowish.  The object appeared and made numerous movements and then vanished; however it would reappear shortly after (perhaps 15 seconds) again.  Observed several occurrences of this object then decided to request three other family members to come outside to observe the object.  Again 4 of us observed several iterations of the object moving.  This started a long discussion on what we thought this object could have been.  The object did not move with the characteristics of a standard aircraft or helicopter; there was no accompanying sound.  I suspected that the object was several miles from our location; however, other family members were not so sure.  No photos were taken.  Bottom Line:  This was a UFO sighting for sure; I have not previously witnessed any known objects with its appearance or flight characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were still and did not move from their position in the sky.  Thing of a square on its corner with all 4 corners pointing north, south, east, and west. The lights appeared at the points of the square almost in a diamond shape.  There were no street lights in the area which allows me to believe I would have seen the shape of the object, yet I saw nothing but the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been thinking about this day for years and everything I think it could be I rule out from common knowledge. It couldn&#39;t have been an airplane or helicopter for there was no noise. Nor a weather balloon as the lights would have continued to appear as it rose up and away. A flair is out of the question for it rises and falls. There are no cell or any kind of towers in the direction I was facing.  I don&#39;t know what I saw but, it was definitely something I haven&#39;t seen before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I am a very experienced and educated man. with 20/15 eyesight. I understand depth perception, etc. this had the depth of a planetary body. these were not airplanes, they had the depth of planets. planes usually have a flashing light and disappear with depth horizon slowly and systematicly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first 2 sightings were white star shines that moved very effortlessly accross the sky then grew very bright, and immediately vanished.  I know what a shooting star or meteorite is and what it looks like.....This was not a meteorite!

It looked like something was exploading. It was about the size of a full moon. It glowed about 2-3 seconds then a tiny light shot out of it at a high rate of speed. The tiny light continued in the Southwest direction. We watched it for 8-10 seconds before the light went out of view. Then 8-10 seconds later another light approched from the North. It looked exactly like the first tiny light,,,,,same speed,,,,same direction. We watched the second light for a minute or so, it was very, very high in thr sky. After we lost view of the second light, a third light appered out of the southeast, going towards the north. It also was very,very high and fast. We heard no sounds at all...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was partly cloudy switching over to a slight overcast that gradually cleared to partly cloudy skies. With all the clouds in the sky the ambient light was very high from the all the city lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my backyard facing due North. I had observed other aircrafts previously that night as there is an airforce base( Tinker AFB ) East of where I live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had observed these objects (atleast 12 but I&#39;m sure it was between 15 and 20) in a group formation. They were point light based. About the size of the lights you see on aircraft. The color of the light was offwhite like Christmas tree lights. They were solid non-blinking lights first seen grouped together loosely in a oddshaped ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had spotted these lights in the North Eastern direction and they were loosely grouped together moving at a steady speed. About as fast as a small aircraft in flight but fairly far away( had to be in the space between Eastern Ave. and S. Sooner Rd ) flying North to South (perhaps slightly South East)  As these lights flew they slowly separated from their initial grouped positions(all at steady speeds) and spread out horizontaly. Halfway through the sighting I made a note that these lights were fairly low as they were under the cloud layer, and at that time they passed behind trees in the next backyard. After passing behind the trees these lights were even more scattered, flying at the same pace and same brightness (still not blinking or changing colors). The lights headed in this direction untill I lost them infront of the Integris medical building that is a block away from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can take a picture and mark the direction and appearance when I have time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Traffic was heavy during the 5 o&#39;clock rush hour.  I was going about 15 mph.  Suddenly in the sky ahead of me about 1/2 mile away appeared a large gray rectangle.  I estimate it&#39;s length as long as a football field.  It was gray with panels that were somewhat reflective.  It floated motionless and then drifted to the right.  I lost sight of it behind the tree line as I drove along.  I had time to remove my sunglasses so I watched it for approximately 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove along toward the campus, there were several auto accidents.

As we were passing it I noticed a movement close to the ground. It was a silver colored triangular planform moving eastward at a fairly leisurely pace.  I can make no certain estimate of its size but it appeared to be fairly substantial. It took a left turn proceeding around the edge of a basin in the desert.  It then proceeded to make another left turn, maintaining a similar speed.  This was followed by another left turn that placed it facing a peak that anchored the southeastern corner of the basin.  As it completed this turn the craft appeared to suddenly accelerate as though launched from a slingshot and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no further sign of it.  I don’t believe it hit the peak, which, from my window appeared inevitable.  It may have turned edge-on, but if so the rate of rotation was phenomenal or it may have employed a cloaking method.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mentioned my sighting to the pilot later and he was not surprised and let me know that he had seen a lot of strange things in that area - none of which officially happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would connect the loitering plane with the craft. I was unable to determine if the Boeing was a tanker or perhaps a command post of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really can’t fathom why the powers that be would have scheduled such an outlandish exercise as an airliner was passing overhead full of nosey people like myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))  October 4, 2010<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was driving toward the sunrise. They were very bright, metallic looking, almost as if there were four very bright lights on the bottom of the object.  They looked as if they were maybe a mile away from where I was, although that is hard to determine because I don&#39;t know how big they really were.  The objects did not move and as I got closer, they got larger. As I was stopped, I saw them in the same position and used a tree as a measurement to movement.  They did not move.  I continued to watch them for at least 5 minutes.  I pulled over to take a picture and they disappeared out of thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He decided to take a cool bath before bed, as we did not have air conditioning, and our bedroom becomes very warm. He had just gotten out of the bathtub when I asked him if he would like to step outside before we retire for the night and feel some of the cooler night air. He agreed that it was a good idea, so, he grabbed a cigarette, and we stepped outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have a paved patio of sorts right out the backdoor and that was where we were standing when this unexplainable &#34;something&#34; came shooting out of nowhere. Out of habit, we both always end up looking at the sky in the evening in hopes of seeing a falling star, which is what we were doing at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, there it was. I yelled, &#34;Money, money, money&#34; as is my custom when I see a falling star, however, I realized before I even said the third &#34;money&#34; that this was not a falling star at all. When I first saw it, it was coming down fast, like a falling star would, but it kept coming, and it was getting bigger, and it had no tail, flame, or anything I&#39;ve ever seen before. And before I could even blink, it was there, maybe 3 or 4 football field lengths above our house. It was an amber color, and it was shaped like a tylenol capsule. It was huge. It was giving off this amber light, yet, it wasn&#39;t like any kind of light I have ever seen in my life. It seemed to absorb the light around us as much as it seemed to be giving off the light as well. I realize this makes little sense, however, I am at a lack of words to explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed there. I have no idea how long. I ran out further into the yard when it then sped toward the center of the town we live in. We have a lot of trees in our yard which blocked my view, so I ran out into the street to see where it was. We have a building here, it&#39;s the tallest I believe in our town, and this craft hovered there above it. Again, I don&#39;t know how long it did, but it seemed about a minute. Then suddenly, it shot straight back up and utterly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what this was. We immediantly came back inside, and went to a few sites that forcast or inform about any celestial happenings in the sky such as meteor showers, auroroa borealis, etc.. and there was nothing. Nothing at all that was reported to happen that night. I just wish I understood what it was that we saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The date is approximate as I remember the time of year because I had just finished building a deck on the rear of my home and that was in mid-September of 2004.  I am a high school debate teacher and had only started school a few weeks earlier, so that also reminds me of the approximate date.  But I cannot recall the exact date at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up around 1:00 in the morning for no particular reason and could not fall back asleep.  After sitting in the living room for a bit, I decided to go out on my  deck to have a cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a completely clear night.  I do not recall if there was a moon or not.  As I was smoking, I spent time just staring up at the stars.  I am not much for astronomy, but there was nothing else to really do and I was trying to get myself back into a mode for sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed something in the sky to the west of my home.  I was sitting in the back of the house which faces northeast.  I had been sitting outside for about 20 minutes at this point.  I did not identify what I saw as an &#34;object&#34; at first.  There was a triangular shape, but my first thought was that it was a flock of Canadian geese.  I continued to watch only because it was something to look at.  The shape continued to come slowly from the west heading roughly southwest at what seemed to be a rather slow pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After what felt like less than 5 minutes of watching, the shape was pretty much directly over the back yard of my neighbor to the immediate west.  This is where I had my first impression that what I was looking at wasn&#39;t a flock of geese.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, as it was coming toward my yard, it seemed far too rigid lines to be geese.  The shape seemed fairly low to the ground too.  I estimate it was no higher than 1000 ft, but likely less.  As the shape moved over into my yard, I noticed that the stars didn&#39;t seem &#34;right&#34; between the two lines of the &#34;V&#34; shape.  By that I mean they seemed a bit fuzzier and dimmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really convinced me that I was not seeing geese was when I noticed a straight line connecting the two ends at the rear of the &#34;V&#34; shape, making it a triangle.  As I tried to &#34;come to grips&#34; with what my brain was saying I was seeing, I also noticed a strange distortion along the outer edges of the triangular object.  I would best describe it as being like the heat waves one sees coming off of hot pavement.  This distortion was visible on all three sides, but I am not sure I would have noticed it if the sky hadn&#39;t been so clear otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no noticable lights coming from the object and absolutely no sound.  Any other time I have seen geese flying in a &#34;V&#34; formation, I recall usually eventually hearing a goose call or two as they fly overhead.  Here, it was total silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued to move in a straight line to to the southwest.  As the object moved past my yard I could no longer see the outer edge distortion, however there were still three distinct sides to the object.  After about a total of 10 minutes or so of viewing the object was out of sight again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We saw a couple of shooting stars or meteors and began watching intensly. I saw a tiny flare of light that he did not see and as I pointed in the direction I said, &#34;It happened by that triangle of stars&#34;- THere were three immobile lights in the shape of a triangle that weren&#39;t too close to be cluster but were close enough that no other &#34;stars&#34; interfered with their pattern. As we looked at the triangle, we noticed that it suddenly began shifting to the left, past other stars. The three lights moved in perfect proportionate formation for about two minutes, traveling slowly across a small strip of sky until they abrubtly disappeared all at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was crystal clear, with no cloud cover and the moon was not visible which made viewing the stars ideal. At around 10:30 PM EST, a very large triangular shaped object began to move very slowly above us, we estimate around 10,000 feet, but it was hard to tell, due to it&#39;s size and there was absolutely no sound coming from the craft. The object traveled over Moosehead Lake and as it shrunk from view just across the lake, it began to climb straight up, then it began to reverse direction in an arc like motion and head back in the opposite direction across the lake. There were 3 very large, glowing gold lights on the object that were stationary and no other lights or blinking lights were noticed. The object disappeared out of viewing range once it crossed the lake. This was the most unusual and large flying object any of us had ever witnessed. One of the witnesses flys helicopters and planes and is an expert in aviation and even he remarked that he&#39;d never seen anything like it and could not even guess what it might have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

As I glanced up at the sky I saw a light that appeared to float across the sky.  At first I thought it may be a plane, but it&#39;s brightness dimmed and the object turned sharply and shot across in a different direction and dissapeared.  Immediately after, two more objects came into view and seemed to fly in tandem and then they circled and shot away.  As I kept on watching these objects seemed to dance in the sky in the same general area.  It was cloudy, so I thought they may have been birds, but the more I watched, I could tell they were flying in front and behind the clouds while illuminating brightly and then dimly.  Some appeared to be triangular in shape, but only when at their brightest.  I watched for a couple of more minutes and saw up to five of these objects dancing around the sky.  I was facing north west from my home and distance was very hard to judge, but it appeared they were in the proximity of the DFW airport.  I did not want to be alone in the sighting, so I called to my wife to look, she was asleep, but I still called to her to look.  It took her a couple of minutes to shake away the sleep, but the objects were still there.  After she began to see what I pointed to, she was asking if they were planes.  I saw a plane flying and pointed out that the plane was moving at about 1/3 of the speed of these objects and that the objects flight patterns were erratic at best.  What amazed me even more was that the intensity of the brightness seem to come in phases.  It was difficult looking through the clouds, but there were definitely five at one time that appeared, danced around each other and moved at high speeds away from each other and together.  I watched with my wife for about another 10 minutes until I decided to get my digital camera.  It was dark, so nothing came out, but I wanted to try anyway.  We watched for a total of about 20 minutes until I was positive that what I had seen was not an illusion or my imagination.  I am 35 years old and in all my life I have never seen any such objects in the sky with such speed and intensity.  I was so amazed the hairs on my body were standing straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

ANYWAY, I WENT OUTSIDE TO WATCH THE SUNSET (AND SKYWATCH). I FELT THE URGE THAT I SHOULD BE VIDEOTAPING. AS SOON AS I STARTED RECORDING, I NOTICED A BRIGHT ORANGE/YELLOW OBJECT THROUGH THE SCREEN OF MY CAMERA. I LOOKED UP TO LOCATE THE OBJECT WITH MY EYES BUT WAS UNABLE TO SEE IT. I CONTINUED RECORDING THE OBJECT FOR A FEW MINUTES. DURING THAT TIME I WAS ABLE TO ZOOM IN ON THE OBJECT SEVERAL TIMES. FROM A DISTANCE IT JUST LOOKED LIKE A ROUND, BRIGHT ORANGE/YELLOW LIGHT. WHICH HAD TO BE VERY BRIGHT CONSIDERING THAT IT WAS SUNSET AND THE WHOLE SKY WAS ORANGE AND YELLOW. ONCE I ZOOMED IN ON THE OBJECT IT NO LONGER LOOKED ROUND BUT SEEMED TO CONTINUALLY BE CHANGING SHAPE. IN THE CENTER OF THE OBJECT IT WAS A VERY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT WITH YELLOW, ORANGE AND RED EMITTING ALL AROUND IT. IN SOME FRAMES YOU&#39;RE ABLE TO SEE BLACK OR DARK AREAS. IT&#39;S DEFINITELY HARD TO DESCRIBE. FOR THE FIRST COUPLE MINUTES IT JUST SEEMED TO DART AROUND AND THEN IN THE LAST MINUTE OR SO IT GOT LOWER AND LOWER IN THE SKY AND ALSO NO LONGER WAS BRIGHT. IT BECAME SORT OF NEUTRAL IN COLOR AND VERY HARD TO SEE. THEN IT WAS JUST GONE. THIS ALL HAPPENED PRETTY QUICKLY. I THINK THE TOTAL FILMING TIME WAS AROUND 3 MINUTES. I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND THE CORD THAT HOOKS THE CAMERA TO THE COMPUTER, SO I CAN&#39;T SEND YOU THE VIDEO YET. BUT I HAVE TAKEN A BUNCH OF STILL SHOTS FROM THE VIDEO SO THAT AT LEAST THERE&#39;S SOMETHING YOU CAN LOOK AT NOW. I AM EMAILING YOU A FEW OF THEM. IF YOU WANT ANY MORE OR NEED ANYTHING ELSE, JUST LET ME KNOW.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to go from a size similar to a very large star to a size similar to the moon then back again. It also seemed to travel through the clouds. I hope it was a meteorite because it freaked me out a bit. I came across this site about a week ago and have been looking in the skies a bit since, lol. I have also seen two stange lights in the sky before about 5yrs and 6yrs ago that defenently were not meteorites or venus or car lights or squid boats!. I also know quite a few people that have seen strange lights before. Whatever they are i think they need proper and absolute investigaition on behalf of the all the scientific comunity, instead of one half claiming there alien spacecraft and the other claming there holograms and every other excuse in the book.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first my dad and i thought it was caused by the military because of the nearby training ground, but we soon realised that these flashes were not aircraft or any form of illumination flare. They were extremley sparadic which occured every few seconds with no sound what so ever. We were very interested by the light and drove up the other side of the valley to get a closer look, on the way up, we saw what seemed to be an enourmous ball of light which flew below the hill line and then shot up towards the sky and just seemed to vanish. Once that had happened the light&#39;s had stopped flashing and we havn&#39;t seen any thing like it since. I also tried to film the lights however they did not pick up on the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As it dissapated, it became redder and sharper and I could even make out &#34;fire chunks&#34;.  A few seconds later, it ended as a pinpoint glowing ember and then this disappeared.  The whole event lasted approximately 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights appeared to be aproximatley 2 miles above the 20 miles ground distance. A friend of mine witnessed the lights as well but discounted it, claiming it must be a plane. When my friend went inside the lights came closer at a rapid rate (1/2 mile away gound distance), stayed at the same altitude, made a sharp 45 degree turn, hovered in place for 20 seconds, untill the lights went off..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t really believe in UFOs but what was it? A blimp or helicopter can&#39;t travel at the speed that it did and a plane can&#39;t make such a sharp turn. Plus all must have their lights on at all times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/13/04 20:25|South Phoenix|AZ|Light|Apprx. 15 min.|Amber lights appearing over South Mountain repeatedly.|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39754.html|227|ndxe200409| Amber lights appearing over South Mountain repeatedly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a night security officer at a plant in South Phoenix. From approximately 20:25 to 20:40 on 9-13-04 myself and one other guard witnessed four amber colored lights fading in and out in perfectly straight lines appearing one after the other. One light would fade in then the next would fade in next to it. Then the next would appear until there were four in a row; then the first would fade out and reappear in line on the other side of the others to continue the line eventually all fading out in order of appearance. First they lined up parallel with the ground and next in a 45 degree angle from the ground aligning upwards. They were completely stationary while lit. They did not appear in exactly the same place each time although in the same relative vicinity. They were below the top of South Mountain but above the ground. I checked out that area a few days later and could find nothing but a residential area and what appears to be an unmarked city water reservoir. I could find nothing that would emit these types of lights. I could not find any roads on that end of the mountain (northside on west end). My conclusion was that these lights would have had to have been approximately 150-250 feet off the ground. Occasionally the lights would flash very bright. A few minutes later fighter jets were flying over and helicopters appeared searching the mountain. On my investigative journey there were three helicopters patroling the mountain with spotlights. This may or may not be related. I saw the same exact thing nine days later on 9-22-04 at the exact same time of day. The same guard was working. He said that earlier in the day (he works an earlier shift which overlapped with mine) he thought he saw something triangular in shape which was transparent and sort of blurry. I can not vouch for his day time report; I can only say that he told me about his day time sighting before we saw the evening lights on 9-22-04. This for me provided some validation. All sightings were witnessed below the mountain top almost due South of the I-17 freeway bend (turns from North/South to East/West). I approximate that the lights would have been above Elliot Road and 27th Avenue roughly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports of similar phenomenon, submitted by the same witness, for Septebmer 22, and October 20, 2004.

At first I thought it was a bright star next to Cassiopeia, but being familiar with astronomy I did not know what star it was, and that is what got my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I started to remove my son from his car seat I looked up again, and still wondered what star I was seeing. I started to talk to my son who was now out of his car seat and moving out of the truck, when it caught my attention again as it started to move. At first it moved slowly for a short distance, but then accelerated rapidly before coming to a complete stop. I then noticed the strobe lights of two aircraft, and the object started to move again in the direction of the aircraft. I was then able to determine it was much lower in altitude than the aircraft, and it had no strobe lights of its own. The object zigged and zagged several times before moving very rapidly and vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the fact that it was stationary, then moving in a controlled manner several times over the three to four minutes this lasted, I determined it could not have been a meteor disintegrating. It must have moved away at such a high speed, I could not follow with my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw, and as I said above it lasted several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Suddenly, a blueish light sphere in the sky cought my eye. At first sight, I thought it was a planet because it was so bright, but I then noticed it was moving slowly so I started eliminating the facts of what it couln&#39;t be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fact 1- Even though it was as bright as Venus or possibly more, it couln&#39;t be a planet, because it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fact 2- Air planes flew by higher up in the sky, so its altitude suggested it definatly couln&#39;t be the space station or a satilite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fact 3- Comparing it to a plane or hellicopter, their were no flashing lights on its sides, or under it, or over it. Just a bright white ball of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fact 4- No sound was coming from it. At that altitude, about that of a small plane, or hellicopter, I would have been able to hear sound coming from it, yet there was none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fact 5- As it passed over me and headed away from me, the bright light/sphere simply faded away after about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fact 6- It couldn&#39;t have disapeared into the thin clouds in the distance, cause it wasn&#39;t high enough. Plus I could see faint stars through those clouds, so I would have been able to see the object very clearly. I was able to see the light sphere for about 20-30 seconds at most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was interresting too is that during 14 minutes after the sighting of the light sphere, I saw two satellights and a shooting star near the constellation Cassiopeia. I also saw a dot (like the appearence of a satellite) at the altitude of a satellite traveling about twice as fast as the previous satellite I saw a second ago.

I immediately looked up and what I saw was a brilliantly lit, sphere shaped, bright orange object, silently slipping thru the atmosphere at a fairly high rate of speed from a north to south direction. The object appeared to be close to the ground opposed to being up in space. Possibly the altitude of a low flying airplane just above the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size could be compared to a street lamp at about 100 yards away. I thought it could possibly be the space station but the object seemed so close and too large to be the space station in my opinion. I work at the airport around helicopters and fixed wing aircraft and I can positively rule them all out without a doubt. The 90 degree angle that I saw the object (directly below) with nothing behind it,no sound and the high rate of speed. It appeared to be a flying light bulb with no tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was finally clear after the rain and overcast for the most part of the weekend.  I was outside of my girlfriends parents’ house having a cigarette and enjoying the peacefulness of the evening before heading off to bed.   After leaving the side-door of their house, I turned North (left) to go to the back yard.  Before I got all the way into the back yard, I paused and lit my smoke.  I then went to the fire pit (about 15 steps from door) and sat down on a bench.  I noticed that there were an extraordinary amount of stars in the sky and I couldn’t help but look, however, I could not get the glare from a near by streetlight out of my eyes so I went and stood in the shadow of a big willow tree directly behind the house to gain a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It only took about 30 seconds of me being in the shadows until I seen this thing.   I was standing with my body facing North, North-West.  From where I was standing, to my left was a wooden fence found in most residential areas and to my right was a large willow tree.  Now, also from where I was, I could not see the horizon.  I could see the roof of the neighbors 2 car garage directly in front of me, behind the fence, and a row of 4-5, 50 foot Pine trees in the neighbors yard across the alley to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, as I was looking up, out of the north I heard a whooshing sound like a light breeze going through the tops of the trees or light winds blowing through taller grass.  I turned my head right and to my astonishment I seen flying from behind the trees a black triangle with 3 dimly lit orange lights on the base of it.  It moved from North to South West.  It did not make any noise.  I could see this was a 3-Dimentional object as it flew across the sky because the tail of the triangle looked like it had depth, it had what looked like columns that extended up from the base (at different angles to create X&#39;s or Diamonds) to a lip and what I would think is another surface (the top of the craft).  As it flew from my right to left I could not see depth in the &#39;nose&#39; as it was too dark and I feel the color of the craft may have blended with the night sky but I feel it could have depth as well.  As it was in front of me, I could make out a distinct triangular shape by the light reflecting off the bottom of the craft from either the lights on the ground or the 3 orange lights on its base.  As it moved farther to my left, that’s when I could make out the tail-end and suggest that it is, in fact, 3-D.  The triangle flew like an arrow head with a point in the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took about 10 seconds to cover what I would estimate to be about 150KM of sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could only see it as it came out from behind the trees until I lost it in front of the neighbor’s house.  I wanted to go to the front and keep an eye on it but I was petrified, literally scared stiff.  I could not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft seemed to be darker in color, possibly a dark grey/black, or a charcoal color but stood out from the color of the clear night sky once a person got a bead on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would think it was the size of an average house but am not sure as it was some distance away (the tail-end suggested the size of a Greyhound bus).   It also seemed to be distinctly blurry or hazy compared to the sky when it was moving.  I had to ‘catch-up’ to it with my eyes at least 2 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At an arms length away, it was about the size of a book of matches and quite similar looking if you were to look at one moving from right to left at an arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have made a few sketches for memory but it was quite an interesting experience I do not suspect I will forget this night for a long, long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/12/04 23:00|Moca (Dominican Republic)||Disk|20 seconds|Saucer shape , noiseless, changed color from greyish black to black and seemed to emit black light. to camouflage itself in darkness.|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54795.html|236|ndxe200409| Saucer shape , noiseless, changed color from greyish black to black and seemed to emit black light. to camouflage itself in darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw it in the darkness of the town. It was saucer shape with the center of it like a dome on top of the aircraft. The disk area did not appear to be very thick yet much, much bigger than the dome area. It was big, about 2/3  the length of a 747 but round. It was pretty low, about the height of a five story building. I would not necessarily use the word &#39;metallic&#39; to describe the material of its exterior, neither was it plastic: it was something else, like maybe a combination of materials. It did not make any noise nor was it showing any lights. Neither was it blowing any air out very strongly as it was near some very tall trees and the branches were not moving.  It seemed powerful, it hovered there with precision. We could all see it from the balcony; we were a block away from it. Then, as if they/it realized that we could see it, the grayish black color of its exterior which made it visible in the darkness in a matter of seconds began to turn black and well it was as if it was emitting black light around itself to camouflage itself at the same time it started to move up slowly. Then it completely disappeared. We went outside where it had been and we tried to see if we could still see it in spite of its camouflage by perhaps seeing that it was covering a part of the sky. But, no, it had completely disappeared from sight. That was some impressive technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why Moca? There is absolutely nothing of interest happening there. Perhaps worth mentioning, however, is that the previous year for the first time in the history of the region an international airport was inaugurated at the town&#39;s border with Santiago. The craft sited however does not appear to need an airport to take off and land. It could just go up and down. The other possible thing that could be of interest is that a 6.7 earthquake had just occurred - a couple of weeks prior to the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what I saw. I did see an unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this information helps someone, someday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I looked up and noticed an object very high up and moving VERY fast. It seemed very high up because it was much smaller than even the small airplanes that I see a lot and it made no noise. Because it was so small and seemed shiny, it looked just like the stars around it. Because I didn&#39;t know exactly how high up it was, I couldn&#39;t guage the distance very well. However, it moved from star to star in the clear night sky very quickly. Every couple of minutes it would come to a dead stop and change direction completely. It seemed to be indirectly heading from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes, another object of the same sort but a little larger joined it. It must have stood still the whole time because we had thought it was a star in the night sky and it startled us to see it move. It moved a bit faster in the same direction, only following one path. It passed from one star to the next in only one or two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the second ship moved, the first and smaller ship began acting as if it were running away from it. The ships moved from east to west for several more minutes in the same manner and we went inside, still a bit startled and confused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I could see a large circular shape with spokes on the bottom of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home Sunday evening at around 9:00 pm. My two granddaughters, 5 &amp; 8 were with me. As I crossed the McCullough Bridge heading north on hwy 101, I happened to look to the North East and spotted a low flying object which seemed to be coming from the Haynes inlet area traveling in a South westerly direction. It was brightly lit with many flashing lights. I thought it must be a low flying plane of some sort or even a helicopter but it just didn&#39;t look quite right. It was flying slow and low over an area of homes just above the tree line. I than lost site of it as I continued North. I noticed it again as I passed Marine Lane on my right, which leads up to an area of nice homes. It was coming back into view as it passed over the tree covered hill heading for the dunes and ocean. As I was passing Spruce road (approx. 400 feet North of Marine Lane on the left) it emerged and passed over the highway directly over my car. A strange shape, maybe wedge shaped? It was dark but I could see a large circular shape with spokes on the bottom of it. It wasn&#39;t a helicopter for sure, and if it was a plane, it was not like any I have seen. It was flying very slow and it was quiet, no sound. I am reluctant to talk about this because I would think many people would have seen it - it was so visible, but there have been no reports of anything strange. It was very near the North Bend Airport, yet it was not in any flight path to land, it was headed toward the ocean. If anyone else saw this, please post it. It would be comforting to know if someone else saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was Black, no lights, looked solid- I didn&#39;t see any windows or lights or anything-, and was a perfect triangle.

All I can say is that I am not a person who makes things up. I think I am a very careful observer and I can only tell you what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday, Sept. 12 I went out on my porch to look at the sky. It was about 8:00 P.M.. My 2nd floor apartment faces Southeast. I looked to my right (Southwest) and saw a bright, large, white light approaching at low altitude. This looked very similar to the object I reported on the 7th. Only this time the object appeared much lower in the sky. I have no way of knowing for sure, but I would estimate the object was only 1000 feet up or so. This time I did not hesitate. I ran inside and grabbed my pair of 7 X 35 binoculors. As I came back out the object was just beginning to pass over my head. It was moving in a straight Southwest to Northwest direction. I estimate the speed at somewhere between 100-150 MPH. Looking at the object did not change much. It still appeared to be a solid ball of white light. I tried to stabilize the binoculars on one of the porch columns to get a steady view. At one time I thought I might have seen a small dark (almost black) triangle leading this light, but I am not completely sure of this. It made absolutely no sound whatsover. It passed by me and continued it&#39;s steady course. As it got to the Northeast it took on a reddish hue. I thought this might be from haze. It then dimmed and seemed to blink out. I couldn&#39;t help but think it was turning off it&#39;s lights as it would be approaching Bradley Airport just north of Hartford. I looked carefully, at no time were there any other lights other than the one solid white light. This object appeared the same from every perspective. It was a ball of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one minute later a small private plane flew by travelling at about the same altitude and direction. However this small plane was a greater distance away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could hear the small plane clearly and also see directional lights as well. The small plane was travelling about the same speed as the object. I watched the small plane as it flew off in the Northeast. It never dimmed and I could see it&#39;s lights until it flew over the treeline in the distance. So much for the haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe 5 minutes later I saw a bright white light coming from the Northeast. I thought the object might be returning. But looking with binoculars I could see 2 small white lights in the center, and the red and green directional lights on the wings. This was an airliner which I see many of every night. One thing occured to me. As this airliner flew by I could no longer see the white lights on the front. I could also hear it clearly and it was at a much higher altitude than the object I observed.<n>

I was sitting on the patio when my young daughter heard an airplane. I looked to the sky to spot it for her and that&#39;s when I saw it. It looked like an ordinary star, except it was very sunny with a few clouds.  Certainly too light out to see any stars. This star was also unique in the fact that it was moving.  It was at about the same height as the clouds and was moving very slowly.  Now, I have seen airplanes in the sky when the sun would shine on the fusulage and I know that this is not what I saw today.  This &#34;star&#34; was moving very slowly in an eastely direction, yet it would subtly move to the left and right. It moved very slowly and eventualy out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were on a porch that faces east and the object was sighted when it was directly above us.  Two people saw it immediately and two did not, then when the all four were aware of it we went to the front door facing west.  This offers a good view of the sky to the west, but the UFO was not sighted, as it was travelling at a high speed, faster than a commercial airliner or private plane.  Only two people out of four actually viewed the object, as the other two were not in a good spot to see it.  The UFO seems to be ruled out as a meteor breaking up and displayed two sources of light, at either end of the object.  The form was seemingly cigar shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

These were obviously quite high up. Then going west to east came a rapidly flashing light red,white. Moved slowley and silently, about 500m altitude. As this crossed the sky another came into view directly underneath the first at about 200m altitude, moving same speed,in formation. This pair drifted passed followed by another 3 sets of pairs all going the same direction.The strange thing was that i could see the lights flashing down the side of the craft(?) and on the back could be seen two fixed lights(exhausts?) but the objects themselves were invisable.I first thought military helicopters,but the lights were too rapid and there really was no sound at all for something flying that low. Struck me as being like the flying tringles that have been reported. This was then followed by a standard plane going south to north, much higher, which I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked in its path and noticed another white what I thought was a star at first and thought its going to pass overit - it didnt as the satalite approached the light it never came out from passing over it.  I waited and watched and suddenly what I thought was the star then moved in the opposite direction to the way the stars were moving I watched it as it went forwards and backwards before moving off a lot slower in the opposite direction.  At firat I thought it must be the space station grabbing a satalite but on going into the NASA web site there are no sightings last night at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/12/04 03:00|Palo Alto|CA|Triangle|10 Seconds|Triangle Shape Zooms overhead , no noise, pulsates, changes sizes 3 times, then each point of light seperates and zooms off.|9/29/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39238.html|247|ndxe200409| Triangle Shape Zooms overhead , no noise, pulsates, changes sizes 3 times, then each point of light seperates and zooms off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2:55AM on Sunday Morning September 12 I was on the my computer listening to late night talk shows.  My 2 dogs started to scratch at the door rather aggressively, which is unlike them (Lhasa Apso is a small, long-haired dog).  I assumed they wanted to go outside to the bathroom. So I gathered their leashes, and walked them outside of my condo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the dogs did their business I stood by the side of the entrance way to my condo, I scanned the sky as I always do every chance I get.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen several UFOs since November 18, 2001.  I have seen Boomerangs, Flying Triangles, and Orbs.  They seem to fly by every November during the Leonid Meteor Showers, and if you want to check for your self, just do an Internet Search for the phrase: Leonid Meteor Showers Boomerang UFOS .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was conciously thinking about the fact that I do not have my video camera with me, and what I would do if a UFO appeared in the sky. Just as I completed my thought a LARGE Triangle swooshed from behind the Condo and sort of stopped mid air as it was traveeling North.  I have seen Triangles before, but this one appeared to &#34;Fall out of the Sky&#34; as if I was seeing a Triangle Constellation of Stars just fall from the sky and sort of &#34;Bounce&#34; in mid air.  This Triangle pulsated and changed size aproximately 3 times..... It pulsated and got bigger, and then bigger, and then back to it&#39;s &#34;Original&#34; size......  and then each &#34;point of light&#34; seperated from the Triangle Formation and became indpendent lights in the sky.  At this point the almost looked like they could be 3 Big Birds or something in the sky playing tricks/dancing... and then Swooooosh..... off they went.... Heading North till they were out of sight, and just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t so much the sighting of this event that is worthy of note.  I seem to live in a major hotspot in direct path to the Stanford University Sattellite Dish.  I am about 10 Miles north of Moffett Field (NASA/USAF BASE).  What made this sighting unique (to me) was the surreal feeling of observing it.  I have been having lots of dreams of UFOs lately and look for them whenever I venture outside at night.  To be thinking about a UFO and then see it swoosh over you is a very un-real feeling dream like feeling.  Especially since I have seen them several times before, and have been having surreal/lucid dreams of &#34;flying triangles&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I know, and if you take the time to research the phenomena of these &#34;Boomerang&#34; and Triangle Craft appearing during the Leonid Meteor Showers you will to.  I have this overwhelming urge to encourage people to look up in the sky during this years Leonid Meteor Showers if they want to see that UFOs are real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting lasted no more than 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the disappeared from my site, I ran inside to get me wife, (who has witnessed several sightings of Boomerangs, and Triangles with me Since November 18, 2001).  We both are having recurring dreams of Triangle Crafts, and other anomalies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife came outside for a few minutes to see if the craft would re-appear, but no such luck.  She went back inside, I stayed outside for another 30 minutes or so. I did observe 2 &#34;Shooting Stars&#34; , and what appeared to be strange looking clouds and/or chemtrails in the sky where I saw the Triangle Craft.  However, I cant be sure they were Chemtrails or just partly cloudy.  It is a clear and beautiful night tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will encourage the witness to attempt to photograph the objects he apparently is witnessing.  With regard to the issue of alleged &#34;chemtrails,&#34; we strongly suspect they don&#39;t exist, at all.  PD))<n>

We were heading north on College Rd. when an intensely bright light appeared in the sky. The light seemed very distant, but it radiated a strong diamond like glow. I must reiterate that it seemed very distant and at first glance appeared to be a planet shining very brightly. It stayed in the same place for the next five minutes as we continued north on college Rd. We decided to stop and observe the object because of the luminosity it possessed. A radar tower blinked red directly below the object, only the tower was closer to where we were parked and the object was at a very high altitude and many miles away. I mention the tower because i was able to notice that the bright object was slowing moving to the west to the left of the tower, my friend and I could see the object no longer was inline with the top of the tower. We watched for the next hour noticing faint variation in light and brightness as well as slow movement. After another hour the light got faint as if it were moving away from out spot, it got brighter for a short time moved about erratically then begin to get smaller and smaller until it faded altogether. The following half hour my friend and I observed two more occurences of the light appearing very dimly a good ways above the surrounding hills then disappearing from sight. I was completely blown away by this because the light emitted a glow that looked more akin to a flash light shined through a fancy diamond, rather then the light a star produces. I was also in aww at the fact that it stayed relatively in the same place for a number of hours then began to move and eventually got smaller and smaller until it faded completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have observed a celestial body, perhaps a twinkling star.  There is a very bright, very chromatic star in the northeastern sky currently, which may have been the cause of the sighting.  PD))<n>

It was around:00 am Sunday morning (9-12-04 - just after midnight) and I was sitting outside all by myself gazing at the stars.  It was then that I noticed a light flash in the sky.  It wasn&#39;t a big bright light or anything beyond the imagination, but it flashed once and that was it...at least that&#39;s what I thought.  I thought for a second that maybe I was just seeing things.  But about 2 minutes later, it flashed again.  So I started counting.  I was counting a little slow, but when I hit 1:45 (one minute 45 seconds) it flashed again.  The weird thing was the fact that it wasn&#39;t moving.  It stayed in the same spot and flashed every 2 minutes concistently for the 30 minutes that I watched, and it never changed locations.  I know it wasn&#39;t a satellite because I&#39;ve seen satellites and it was bigger than that, and it didn&#39;t move.  It wasn&#39;t a star, it wasn&#39;t a plane, and it wasn&#39;t a helicopter.  I have no idea what it was, nor will I try to come up with ideas, but I would definately like to know what it was if anyone knows anything else about it.  If it would have been a constant light, it would have looked just like a star...I know that much.  If anyone knows anything about this, please let me know!<n>

I did witness one satellite heading from north to south, but it was kind of faint, so I did&#39;nt pay much attention to it. After about a half hour after that, I decided to call it a night, but, as I was about to head indoors, I looked up one more time, and caught site of a single light heading from the south to the north. This light was about 5x brighter than that of the satellite, and quite a bit nearer to me, I would say at about 25-30,000 ft. I know it was not an airliner, as there were no flashing or strobe lights seen. I witness a lot of aircraft in this area, as I live almost right under the local AFB and SLC Int&#39;l flight paths. This was too low, and too slow to be a satellite<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed an overflight of the International Space Station.

Looking at the clear night sky, I noticed a bright flashing light low in the western sky; given the date, I was more attentive than usual.  Since we see a lot of air traffic out of Mercer County Airport (not far to our west) and elsewhere in the NY-PA area, I first assumed it was a plane, but glancing back once or twice I noticed that it didn&#39;t appear to be moving.  I guessed it was a trick of perspective, but after five or ten minutes I felt something must be amiss, so I went to grab my only -- and unfortunately low-resolution -- pair of binoculars.  It was larger than a star and flashed much more rapidly, again, like an airplane, and in multiple colors as well.  All that I was able to make out was a stationary object emitting a bright white light accompanied by intermittent red and blue flashes.  My wife confirmed this sighting and feels as clueless about it as I.  I checked on its status repeatedly, and the object continued to hover for well over an hour, although the last few times I checked it appeared to have lowered imperceptibly toward the western horizon until, between 10:30 and 10:45, it had sunk out of my viewing area behind trees and houses.  There was frequent air traffic in the area, and a few planes even seemed to pass close by the object without any change of course.  My eye isn&#39;t well-trained enough to get any sense of how far away the object may have been; west of here is, again, the airport, and not far beyond that the Delaware River and Bucks County, Pennsylvania.  Honestly, I don&#39;t know a thing about UFOs, but typing the search terms &#34;red blue flashing object&#34; into Google turned up a multitude of sightings, which is why I decided to submit this report.  If anyone else in the area saw this bizarre object, I&#39;d love to hear about it.  Many thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have observed the quite bright star in the western sky.  PD))<n>

This fireball continued unabated across the zenith on into the northern night sky. At approximately 30 to 40 degrees above the northern horizon part of the fireball detached itself, seeming to plummet earthward, and the fireball became much dimmer. I suspect that we witnessed a satellite launch but can find no record of an announced launch. The evening was crystal clear with a slight off-shore breeze.

At the Lonoke exit, traffic was beginning to slow down and I looked up and saw a bright object on the sky which reflected light brighter than the sun in the sky.  The object appeared to move very slowly in a southerly direction.  Then the object appeared to be stationary for several minutes and banked or turned which showed a triangular shape.  The traingular object was now moving north, very slowly.  By this time I was at the I-440 interchange and the object appeared to be moving along I-40 towards me (eastern direction) when it slowed down and rotated again and headed north, only this time it went north very fast and went out of view. There were faint lights on the apices of the triangle that were in contrast to the object.  The  triangular object made a faint hum.  Oddly there was an outbound flight that flew past the object(above) the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))|9/29/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39231.html|269|ndxe200409| Colored lights near Brandenburg Kentucky<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of September 10th at around 22:45-23:00hrs my wife and I were on our back deck in Vine Grove Kentucky, enjoying our hot tub and looking at the stars with our oldest son when I noticed a bright colored light to the west north-west.  My son got our telescope out to get a better look, the object was definately closer than we first thought, maybe 20-30 miles which I know is very difficult to judge at night. The light continued to change color probably twice a second from red to green to light yellow to light blue and repeated.  The light was stationary in comparison to our deck, the treeline, and the stars for 10 minutes or more, then it began to slowely move to the north and west and was visibly moving in comparison to the surrounding terrain and stars in the sky. We were able to view this for another 10-12 minutes as it moved north west until it was obscured by the neighbors trees. It was about twenty degrees or so above the horizon and was brighter than any surrounding stars in the western sky. The light never pulsed or faded, it remained brightly illuminated but continued to changed color as previously described which is what caught my attention and thought was so odd. I&#39;m a private pilot and airplane owner with close to 500 hours logged in the last two years approximately 50-75 hours at night.  I am familiar with GA and commercial aircraft anti-collision markings at night as viewed from the ground and while in the air.  I have also been on active military duty for the past 18 years and am familiar with military aircraft markings and operations.  I have to say this was deffinately not marked like any civil or military aircraft that I&#39;m aware of to date. I would have placed its location or direction of movement near Brandenburg Kentucky or perhaps slightly to the south west. The weather conditions were clear with a slight haze and no moon. I called Louisville tower watch supervisor to see if they had any aircraft in that direction on radar, they did not.  I also called Godman Flight Operations (Ft. Knox) to see if we had any military activity to the west of post, again the answer was negative, though he did say that the Brandenburg 911 office called the previous week asking the same question due to some calls they recieved from residents complaining of bright lights in the sky. (No further information was available).  I have no idea what we saw, but I know that planets don&#39;t remain stationary, brightly change color, then transition across the sky from south to north west against a stationary background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded quite credible to us.  He is a retired member of the military.  We suspect that he may have been witnessing the very bright star that currently is in the western sky, which gives off a very prominent chromatic display, although that is just a guess.  PD))<n>

We did not see the moon. The object stood out because it was brighter than a star or planet and it flashed colors. As we looked at it through binoculars we were able to see the colors clearly. The colors were rotating from green, red, dark orange, to white. On the top of the object above the rotating light was a very bright white. The object was hovering then it moved to the left but not straight, it was in an angle, then to the right It stood there for a few minutes then it started to move northwest direction and it looked like it was moving up in elevation the color of the object was like a yellow. As the object left to the northwest it arched downward not straight like a airplane. My older son told me it was a rounded triangle shape. We all saw the same thing. The strange thing about this was that military planes have flight patterns through here every evening or night, and when we were looking at the object the military were flying to right of the object at a northwest direction and they were flying on the left of the object going at a southeast direction. The object was much brighter, and much bigger and much higher than the military planes. When the object disappeared from the horizon, we looked up and the big dipper was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My friend was driving his truck. We where headed towards MEDLOCK BRIDGE RD on STATE BRIDGE RD going down the hill before the   DOUBLEGATE subdivision. This is where they have been doing road work for over 4 years. My friend and I are consumed in a conversation about girlfriends. I first notice something in the distant horizon. I dont know how it got my attention but I guess my eyes were wondering. I noticed a small oval shaped object. I would say it was silver but I have no idea. It also had a shimer of light coming off of it. The light was white/silver but again this could have been a reflection off of the sun/object. I pointed it out to my friend who then stopped talking comletely and we both looked at it in AWE. I quickly said the first thing that popped in my mind. &#34; Dude do you see what I am seeing?&#34;. He responded with the same amazement. The object appeared to be hovering. I judged this based on the fact you can see a radio cell phone tower in the distance over the horizon as well. After no more than 5 seconds on originally spotting it the object begain to move to the left slowly. It then moved back to the right slowly. Then all of a sudden before I could react, the object then shot across the entire horizon. I very quickly yelled &#34; oh my god, look at how fast its going. That cannot be an airplane, seriously look at how fast it is going.&#34; Now by the time I had the whole sentance out the object went from one side of the horizon to the other and dissapeared behind some trees. The windows were rolled down and there was no sound other than traffic that I could hear. Although this does not mean there was no sound to the object, I just could not hear anything. My friend and I both talked about it to everyone we knew that night. Nobody would believe us. We have kept this secret until now when I found this website. I wanted to post this only for the fact of documentation and also to do my part at uncovering the truth behind UFOs. I MUST say that this was in NO way an hallucination. WE saw what we saw. I know for a fact this could not be a normal aircraft. I cannot say this was absolutly spacecraft either. What I can say is that the craft was deffinatly unidentifiable. It moved faster than an airplane could. Once it started moving it went from one side of the horizon to the other in less than 10 seconds. the whole sighting lasted maybe 15 seconds. The span of the horizon is about a 7-10 miles in distance. The object was just above the tree lines (which also includes several upscale neighborhoods within those trees.) and couldnt have been more than 100 yards up in the air. Still to this day I can recall the fellings I had when it happend. I became very uncomfortable yet very interested at the same time. I have been affraid of UFO/Aliens for many years until I became interested in the truth. I have only seen one other unidentified object before. Nothing that made me feel the way this did. Please someone confirm they have seem SOMETHING like this before. Please I want to know I am not crazy. Thanks for taking time to listen to my report. I swear on my life this is the truth and nothing has been misconstrued or exaggerated. I now keep a camera on me at all times in hopes I will be able to capture a UFO the next time one is spotted.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/9/04 23:00|Kansas City|MO|Disk|1.5 Hours|Pulsating lights dance over Kansas City's downtown Exhibition Center.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of birds.  PD))|9/29/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39221.html|284|ndxe200409| Pulsating lights dance over Kansas City&#39;s downtown Exhibition Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting:  Thursday Evening, September 9, 2004.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very clear sky, stars easily visible, single-engine plans and one helicopter clearly visible during sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a 37-year old (male) design architect that has lived and worked in downtown Kansas City,Missouri for 14 years for the same company.  I live with my wife and 3 year old son near Raytown, Missouri, a 30 minute drive from downtown.  On the evening of September 9th, at approximately 11:30 PM, I was leaving my office to go home.  I park my car in a free-standing parking garage (3 story structure) immediately to the northwest of our office building.  To the west of our office building, in a two block area, is the downtwon Convention Center, Exhibition Center, and Municipal Auditorium.  The Exhibition Center is a prominent feature in the KC skyline with its large suspension structure and four stainless steel &#34;futurist&#34; sculptures artifically lit from within and below (refer to attached images).  These art pieces were erected in the mid-1990&#39;s to crown the Exhibition Center and symbolize Kansas City&#39;s aspirations for a bright and progressive future.  Naturally, working downtown all these years, I tend to take them for granted, but on the referenced evening I happened to look up at them while walking to my car.  I noticed a number of small point-sources of light moving above and behind the main sculpture on the east-most pylon.  At first I thought the light objects were a swarm of bugs attracted to the sculpture lights, but it became clear (even from my vantage point on the ground) that the light objects were too big and solitary to be swarming insects.  I stopped and looked more critically now thinking the lights must be the under-belly of pigeons or some other large birds illuminated by the sculpture&#39;s lights as they flew over.  I almost walked away and went home at this point but just before I turned to go I noticed the light objects didn&#39;t dim or disappear into the darkness as they moved away from the sculpture&#39;s light array.  In fact, some of them got brighter and grew in size as they moved away.  This peaked my interest so I decided to go up to the top level of the parking garage and get a better look.  Sure enough, from this elevated vantage point, I could clearly see as many as ten illuminated objects moving in random patterns what appeared to be directly above the Exhibition sculptures.  I still thought these might be birds so I watched carefully for any unusual behavior.  My first observation was to try and determine if these objects were self-luminous or simply reflecting light from the street or sculptures.  Without question, they clearly demonstrated they were the former.  This became most apparent when some of the objects made hard, angular cuts, they became much brighter and changed color (from a bright white dot to a larger arc of yellow and orange light).  Then the light would diminish and sometimes simply disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s important to note this light behavior occurred over, behind, and away from the sculpture lights.  No obvious connection could be made between a reflective object and the sculpture lights given their changing proximity to the Exhibition Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In most cases, the light objects were roughly twice as large and bright as any other fixed light in the night sky.  When they cut at sharp angles or accelerated, their light intensity and relative size grew to roughly thre to five times that of any fixed light in the sky.  Because it was such a clear and cool evening, I feel very confident about the accuracy of these comparisons.  In addition to demonstrating self-illumination, I also observed these objects manuever in patterns no normal aircraft (and, frankly, no bird) could possible duplicate.  The objects moved with a mixture of chaotic zig-zags, dips, jumps, straigt-line accelerations, stationary pauses, collision course acrobatics, etc. etc.  This activity was sustained and though apparently random, demonstrated intelligent control.  At one point (around midnight) a single-engine plane, presumably leaving the downtown airport, made a straight line path through the light objects.  At this point, I would estimate six to eight objects moving in the area just over the Exhibition Center.  From my vantage point, the plane appeared to be a few hundred feet lower than the objects (which assumes the objects were a few thousand feet in altitude).  However, it appeared as though the light objects moved farther apart as the plane entered my field of view.  Then, they resumed their dance back over the sculptures.  Several other small planes came through the same area, as did one police helicopter, but the objects didn&#39;t adjust their position for these craft.  I literally watched this go on for a solid hour totally amazed by what I was seeing.  Taking their self-illumination, changing illumination, and manueverability, I had to conclude these were not terrestrial-based craft or animals.  Clearly, these weren&#39;t ballons, ball lighting, or swamp gas either.  They were something I can&#39;t explain.  All I could think was these objects are playing with each other whatever they are.  Like some nutty game of high-speed cat-and-mouse, they looked like kids let out to play.  That&#39;s the best description I could come up with.  And more importantly, they decide to play with unabashed clarity over one of the most visible monuments in a populated city.  You couldn&#39;t miss them if you tried, they were that close and that visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To get a better look, I got in my car and drove a block south to a large surface parking lot that is a bit higher in elevation than the top of the parking garage and less affected by street lights.  I thought this would help me determine the actual position of these objects relative to the Exhibition sculptures.  From this position, I could sse the objects even better.  They were indeed flying directly over and to the west of the Exhibtion Center.  Some of them would dart off in all directions and disappear, only to reappear near where they disappeared.  Others continued this amazing light display during acceleration and hard turning.  I could see the color changes much better from this darker position.  When the objects intensified, they looked like what you see when a rotating steel blade heats up due to friction.  They had a pronounced rim of orange light that lasted a few seconds then they would turn yellow or white and I also noticed a little bit of red.  I could also tell the light pulsated softly as they moved in a linear direction.  I heard no noise from these objects which is odd given how fast they were clearly moving.  On a whim, I grabbed a flashlight from my car and &#34;signaled&#34; toward the moving lights.  I don&#39;t know Morse Code but I thought if these objects are guided by some intelligence, perhaps they&#39;ll see my light and signal back or do something to let me know they see me (foolish, I know).  Seeing a grown man flashing a light in the night sky might give some pause to think I&#39;m nuts, but this was an extraodinary event.  I did this for about 30 more minutes and decided to go home.  The lights were still zigging and zagging as I drove away, still pulsing and blinking out of sight.  It was quite the event, I&#39;ll never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just confirmed with a really good pair of binoculars that the objects I saw the other night over downtown Kansas City are in fact birds and not unexplainable objects.  I&#39;m terribly sorry for jumping the gun and making a report that turned out to be something so simple and quite natural.  Please disregard my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll be more cautious in the future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

As the lights moved closer you could make out that the craft had 3 large, round, very bright (non-flashing) white lights on the underside that formed a triangle. The craft was VERY silent, flying low and moving at a slow pace across the moonless sky. We went out in the backyard to get a better look as it flew just about directly overhead. We were able to see only a slight outline of the craft due to the lights shining so bright. We lost sight of the craft as it headed southwest in the general direction of Lansing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I looked up there were two flashes of light, almost like small balls of fire. Then immediately after I followed a horizontal line of lights. Each one perfectly horizontal with the one before and as soon as one light would go out there would be another light up. I&#39;ve seen planes before and I&#39;m sure this wasn&#39;t one. After 6 lights, they disappeared. The sighting was towards the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, I thought it was a group of military helicopters, as they seem to use a white strobe as their only marking at night (at least, I see these from time to time).  Looking at it, though, I noticed that there must be a huge cloud of helicopters, then... because there were a LOT of white flashpoints of light; spread over a really what looked like a huge area.  Also, it was perfectly quiet.  I went back in, and got my wife to come out too, so she brought our son and 1-year old daughter outside (I had to make sure that I wasn&#39;t the only one seeing this).  My wife and 4-year old son saw it too (my wife was pretty awestruck, like I was... my son was just freaked out).  It may have been one of the freakiest things I&#39;ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing, from when I saw it to when it was too far for us to see, probably lasted about 5-10 minutes (I wasn&#39;t really watching the time).  Whatever it was passed to the south of us... most likely just to the south edge of Lincoln.  It didn&#39;t change direction or anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking about it, it looked a lot more like flashbulbs in a dark stadium than strobes.  They were flashes of white light, but the certainly didn&#39;t strobe from the same place.  There was absolutely no discernible shape or pattern that we could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t say that there was any opacity to it in any way.  With no noise, and no shape... not much of anything remarkable other than so many white flashes of light, and such a large area.  It was very strange to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked with the local FAA control tower this morning, and they hadn&#39;t had any reports or picked up anything strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It&#39;s altitude was very high.  I am an airline pilot with over 12,000 hours experience.   I started flying when I was 18 years old and I am now 39.   I started in General Aviation and today my job is a First Officer flying passenger jets for a regional air carrier.  I know the characteristics of aircraft and how they behave.

It made the turn instantaneously.  I  mean like a 90 degree turn that you would draw on a piece of paper.  No aircraft that I know about can do that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a member of AMSAT, I also know satellites and how they perform.   Satellites don&#39;t make 90 degree turns either.  There were no NAV lights or strobes, just a ball of white light. I would estimate that its altitude at above 60,000 feet.  In fact when it went by, I pointed and showed my wife and said look honey a satellite...and then about 10 seconds later in the blink of an eye.....it turned 90 degrees and disappeared from view within about 20 seconds.  The luminosity of the object never faded.  There was no sound or trail as with a meteor or bolite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 21 years of flying professionally, I have never seen anything like I saw tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The International Space Station passed to the south of Racine at 20:10 hrs. on this date, so if the time estimate by the witness is correct, the object could not have been the ISS.

I then noticed one object that was moving at a VERY high rate of speed.   Its altitude was very high.  I am a pilot with over 12,000 hours experience.   I know the characteristics of aircraft and how they behave.   This was no aircraft.  My wife and I both watched the object as it moved from WSW to ENE....and then it turned 90 degrees left (North) and maintained the same rate of speed. It made the turn------------- instantaneously.---    I mean like a 90 degree turn that you would draw on a piece of paper.  No aircraft that I know about can do that.  As a member of AMSAT,(www.amsat.org) I also know satellites and how they perform.   Satellites don&#39;t make 90 degree turns either.  There were no NAV lights or strobes, just a rectangular structure that was dimly lit...not a glow.   In fact when it went by, I pointed and showed my wife and said look honey a satellite...and then about 6 seconds later in the blink of an eye.....it turned 90 degrees North and disappeared from view within about 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am no stranger to the night sky.  I have built homemade telescopes and have enjoyed the stars and messier objects for at least 15 years.  The &#34;seeing&#34; or turbulence in the air was non existent as none of the stars appeared to &#34;flicker&#34;.  Our position in observing the object: We were facing North, looking up between 75 to 80 degrees towards zenith.  If I had to estimate the altitude, I would say..Low earth orbit, as for speed, I think it would have crossed from horizon to horizon in about 14 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object made the 90 degree left turn, North, the object never decreased in Luminosity, but with distance in the atmosphere, the amount of &#34;air&#34; we were looking through, made the object shimmer.  So to try to make this description easier, My wife and I picked up the object on its trajectory at the 75-80 degrees from the zenith...and after its turn North, it shimmered out of view at about the 40-45 degree point from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unrelated to this sighting, I have seen 2 other unexplained sightings.  One a black triangular object with white lights on each underside corner, in Plattsburgh, NY in 1993 on the shore of Lake Champlain, at an altitude of approximately 100.  Each of the white lights was drawn-- in and out-- towards the center in a circular fashion.  The lights did not propel downwards but just lit up&amp;.sort of like the lights on the old disco floors. Those lights were circular in dimension.    Since I was outside at 0230AM&amp;.hanging a discrete HF antenna (dipole) in the trees behind the apartments, as it approached there was no noise, and no moon. I became very frightened and ran back towards the apartment building approximately 200 feet away, through about 2.5 feet of snow. Plattsburgh, NY receives lots of snow.    As I got to the back entrance door&amp;the lights extinguished and the object moved North, at a very slow speed.   I did not know to check for missing time as I was unfamiliar with the term at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other instance was when I was flying a between KSYR and KPLB (Syracuse and Plattsburgh, NY) also in 1993 at FL250.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That object even turned its luminosity on and off, with our selecting our landing lights, on and off.  Boston Center even acknowledged, no traffic within 200 NM and NO night Aerial refueling in the Military Ops area just NE of Syracuse and up into the Adirondack mountains. (KC-135s with Getty call signs) So the captain and I never repeated the story to the company or anyone else.  But we found it to be very odd.  The Unidentified object left our 1&#39;oclock position at a high rate of speed toward our 6 oclock position.  I never saw a structure, but the light trailed away a rapid speed. Weather that night....We were on top of an overcast layer....no moon.  Anyway, I have had some interesting occurrences.  Thanks for listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was a solid white light and moved about as fast as a fast jet would go when in high altitude or as fast as a small plane would at about 1000 feet up.  This object did not appear to very high in altitude it appeared to be at the altitude that a small plane would be at to travel across the valley (3,000 to 5,000 ft.).  There were no other lights on it and did not have any blinking lights or colored lights.  The same brightness was observed when due south and when moving into the east.  I looked at it through my binoculars 10X50 and only a bright light could be seen.  I have look at Mars (or is it Venus) with the same binoculars and see the changing colors, I did not see any change in color while viewing this object.  It just went over the horizon (behind the next house).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched the object for about 10 to 12 seconds while it moved at a high rate of speed that i have seen from other known flying aircraft.  it was about 1/8 of an inch long from where i was sitting to the altitude where it was traveling.  it was going south west to north east from raeford to the direction of fayetteville.  not to sure if it was an object burning in from space or something else.  it had a constant speed and a constant direction the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were in view for less than 15 seconds, but were viewable across the breadth of the sky.  They appeared to be very light blue in color; they were more of a glow than points of light.  While I couldn&#39;t really see the shape of a craft I had the impression that it was Hershy Bar-shaped; the glowing appeareed to be at two points on the leading edge of what would be a wing, if there were one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had seen this several times before but did&#39;ent take the time to look closely.This time I got my binoculars . This bright light stood still most of the time but at times it bounced to the left or right and up or down.When looking at it through the binoculars it was triangle shaped and was blinking 3 colors red,blue and white or yellow. What was realy strange was it looked like you were looking through heat waves. It shimmered and seemed to be spinning.It was very hard to watch.It was also over a place where there is only woods and a lake,also a place called mingo swamp wildlife refuge.I watched for apx. 30 mnt.got spooked and went in.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When my attention was drawn to a white disk shape object in the sky.  I believed it to be about 2 to 3000 feet in the air. Object was south of the freeway.  I pointed object out to my wife.  As i was watching the object for 23 seconds it appeared smaller very fast till i couldnt see it anymore.  I had visual contact with object for about 25 seconds.  I could only conclude that object left in a big hurry for it to vanish so quickly.  I could see jets heading in to land at dallas fort worth International also during this event.  The jets were heading south to north.  I know this was not a small airplane for i have seen small planes many times and i know i would of been able to distinguish wings and such but this object had nothing of the sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The neig|9/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39176.html|303|ndxe200409| I was watching a video when I heard a noise outside.  The windows were open because it&#39;s been very warm here in the Bay Area.  The neighbor&#39;s dog was loose (as usual), but it sounded like someone might have tossed a plastic cup on the street, so I went out with my flashlight.  Seeing the dog loose, I figured things were OK.  As I turned to come back into the house, something in the sky caught my eye to the east.  Being an amateur astronomer, it&#39;s quite common for me to give the sky a glance, even under such circumstances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw amazed me.  Just below the waning Moon yet above the constellation Gemini was a large burnt orange &#34;planet&#34; in the sky.  The reason I say &#34;planet&#34; instead of &#34;star&#34; is because it looked like a larger version of what Mars looks like when it was at its closest approach to Earth last summer (or the summer before, I forget at the moment, I&#39;m nervous).  It was moving like a satellite, but it was too huge to be the space station.  I have seen it before.  It was heading towards the northeast.  The constellation Auriga was high above it.  I watched it for at least a minute.  It was moving so slowly, I decided to go in and grab a pair of binoculars.  The first pair I found was an old trusty 7x35 Tasco (114 m/1000 m-341 ft/1000 yrds).  I rushed back outside, took my glasses off, and zeroed in on it.  What I saw astounded me.  Not only was this object not circular, it had amazing detail to it.  The bottom of it shone with a bright oval glow, just like it was a propulsion of some kind.  It reminded me of the Gulf Breeze photos of that Polaroid UFO.  Above the smaller, oval &#34;bottom&#34; to it was a larger body above it, attached to it.  It looked like three orange beams with at least two dark columns between the glowing parts.  Above the &#34;columns&#34; was a dome of some sort, and it all seems to be one piece moving together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be turning, like a tumbling satellite, but I could actually see parts of the craft seeming to twist, giving itself new shapes as it went along.  As it continued, the bottom shone brighter and dimmer, and so did the rest of the &#34;craft.&#34;  It took on a long string-like shape with three prominent oval orange lights, top, middle, and bottom after a while, and when it did that, orange sparks began shooting from the bottom of the &#34;oval&#34; glowing part.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.  It made no noise, and I&#39;m led to believe it was a dying satellite of some sort, but I&#39;ve never seen such detail in a satellite, let alone with such a small pair of binoculars.  I watched it for at least three minutes.  I have a digital camera, but it&#39;s hard to even catch the Moon in it, and this object was not as bright in magnitude as the Moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Venus was rising when I went back out to take a look at the direction it traveled.  It was much larger in size than Venus, although not as bright.  To the unaided eye, the object&#39;s magnitude was pretty much evenly distributed over its area.  Saturn was above and right of Venus, and you could have used 7 Saturns just cover this object with the unaided eye, easily.  Did anyone else see this???<n>

At first thought they were birds, but realised they were travelling too fast. After about 3-4 seconds they stopped dead, then the right hand one went in a 45 degree angle towards the other one and then stopped dead. The left hand one then did exactly the same away from the right hand one. They repeated this about 4 times each, stopped, then flew away from me incredibly fast. Each time they stopped dead and without visible accelaration started moving and then stopped dead. There seemed to be no decelaration to stop. One second moving, then stop, then moving again. No noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were initially observed overhead and proceeded SE in a straight line until they were no longer visible. The sky was clear except for some clouds low in the sky far to the east. The lights were a steady off-white color, not as bright as aircraft lights (several of which were visible at the same time in other parts of the sky.) NO navigation lights were observed. The lights appeared to be slightly smaller than a No. 2 pencil eraser held at arms length. The western light was about 8 eraser widths from the lead light and the eastern light was about twice that distance. They did not appear to be connected; stars were visible between the lights. There was no noise that we heard. They appeared to be lower than the other aircraft in the area and if that is the case they were travelling very fast to go from overhead to out of sight that quickly. Observers are a 51 year old female, administrative assistant for a major gas and electric utility and a 63 year old male, retired engineer, former Navy submarine officer and amateur astronomer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I heard a low humming sound very soft at first then it was a low rummbling sound and as I looked in the direction and this huge ship or craft was approached right straight across my view to the right on us.  This thing was very slow and it was very low as well about 4 hundred feet or a little more as far as I could tell by my estimation. This ship or vessel was shaped in a triangle and it&#39;s lights were glowing from underneath it an those lights seemed to alternated in a pattern as it passed over me.  I grabbed my flashlight an shinned it up at the thing as I watched it going slowly over our area of town, someone else had to see this thing I would supposebut it was so quiet man.. it seems to take forever to go over the area..I was just in shock to see it I guess..under the circustances..guess I was kinda stunned just to see this ship..so low.  I called loudly to my mom in the next room after a few moments and when this thing came over us you could only hear the light rumbleing or humm or something, you know not like normal engine propulsion. All I know is it was very big and slow. I then grabbed my flashlight and ran off the porch to the street corner to get a better look as it left our area then after it reached the edge of town or my view the thing just to off out of my range of night site. This ship or whatever this was..like I said was two or three minutes seemed like I had view or watched the vessel, it seemed like forever to me at the time. What was so shocking about the thing was it was not a loud humm or just very little noise. my mom heard it too and we have also seen various other sitings as well in our area in the last few months, but this thing was huge.. my God what or who was flying this ship and where are they from..is it the military or what? is, well you want my oppinion? it is not the government in my view, but I don&#39;t know what this ship was, all I know it was the strangest thing I ever saw in my life...I just know this &#34;if I had not been wondering what the low humm was or had not looked up at just the moment I did, I would have never seen the thing at all I believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought at first it was a plane, but it did not move. It flashed in sequence red, white, blue, then white, blue, red, and again, white, blue, red.  This continued through the night.  At around 3:00 am I went to bed.  On September 8th,  around 21:00 again, my son, this time ran in the house and told me to come outside and look,  it was the same as the night before with it moving more to the east.  It was in a slightly different location than the previous night.  I tried to find an astronmer club to see if this was a planet or a star.  But noone seems to be able to help me.  I am more convinced it was something besides planets or stars because of the continued light sequences.  My camera of course would not pick up the image.  Tonigt, September 9th, it is gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the star, &#34;Sirius,&#34; in the NE sky, at present.  PD))<n>

It was around 8:30 P.M.. We had just finished dinner and I went out on our porch to have a cigarette. We live in a second story apartment in Torrington, Ct. Our house faces almost directly Southeast. We get an excellent, almost unobstructed view of the sky. I am an avid sky-watcher and have enjoyed amateur astronomy from a very young age. I know most of the constellations in the sky on sight. Other than some clouds on the horizon to the Northeast, the sky was clear tonight with good visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat down to enjoy my smoke when I noticed what at first I thought was a very bright 1st magnitude star. It was about 30 degrees above the Southeast horizon. At first I thought good, it is clear and will be a good night for looking at stars. But then it struck me that this bright star was out of place. This would be in the constellation Capricorn which does not have any bright stars at all. I could see the Great Square of Pegasus to my left. I could see the bright star Altair much higher in the sky and a little to my right. I could see the constellation Sagittarius low in the sky to my right. I am just telling you this so you will know I am not mistaking this object for a star. So I was confused by this &#34;star&#34; and stared at it, trying to figure out what it was. This star looked large as well, about the size of a BB held at arms length. And though it was very bright, it was not brilliant like a star. I looked at it for about 10 seconds, then I thought it started to move. There are wires from the telephone poles that run directly in front of my apartment. Using one of the wires as a reference, I could detect this object moving lower in the sky very slowly. Suddenly, it moved very quickly toward the South. As it did it decreased in brightness and faded from view. It also seemed to change from white to bluish, and then slightly green. Even as it quickly faded it was very strange. It appeared to be illuminated from within. At the last before it faded from view, it was very dimly lit and looked like a crystal ball. It looked transparent, like a globe or sphere. From the time it moved quickly till it faded out could have only been a second or two. This quick movement probably covered 10 degrees of sky. I see planes every night flying into Bradley Field in Hartford and further east to Boston or Providence. In fact, I probably saw at least 20 planes tonight. This object moved at least 4 or 5 times quicker than the planes I see. It never made a sound. This object must have been at a fairly high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house and grabbed a pair of binoculars I keep on a bookcase by the front door for stargazing. I was back out in seconds and searched the area hoping to spot the object but it was gone. I stayed out for another 30 minutes or so, but saw nothing but stars and airliners crossing the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This may seem like a long story for such a short sighting. But it was a very strange sight. I believe this object was under intelligent control. You even get the feeling that it knows you are watching. Wierd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is about the 4th or 5th time I have seen these objects in my life, all quite different from one another. I can only attribute that to the fact that I spend a great deal of time looking at the sky and have all my life. I am a very down to earth person. I do not really believe in extraterrestrial life, but I cannot deny that there are some very odd objects flying around. I have my own theories about this. I think they might be spiritual in nature, but that&#39;s just my opinion. I really don&#39;t know for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 50 years old and have worked as a Quality Assurance Technician at the same factory for the last 15 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From my friend&#39;s house in Lakeville along cedar we saw four green solid lights in the horizon about 3 miles away (about.)  These sperical orbs rotated counter-clockwise for about 8-10mins and changed course spontanoiusly.  They rotated clockwise for a short time and eventually stopped rotation and retained at square and stationary decent twords the ground.   As it decended the orbs sowed their roation and sunk twords earth.  The total specticale was only about fifteen minuted till we decided to hop in our cars and follow the cellestial visit - about five minutes later by the time we reached the main road the UFO sank faster then we could trace it so it so as far as we know it just dissapeared.  These sperical green-lighted orbs seemed inquizative and changed its roation at an unrecognizable frequincy whilst my companions could only watch in awe at the most fucked up sight we&#39;ve ever seen.

I have seen many planes in the sky at night and none have ever even come close to that size. It would&#39;ve appeared at least 5 times smaller, but these 3 stars we saw moving were very high in the sky and were clearly not a plane.  I don&#39;t know of any plane that has 3 stars attached to it at perfect angles. It moved for about one minute then just stopped.

From my bed I have an excellent view of the eastern sky. I noticed a bright, pulsating, stationary light in the sky at a distance of at least 15 miles. I observed for a minute and woke my wife. While she observed I ran down to find my binoculars (10x25 Nikon). I observed the UFO for a minute and then handed the binoculars to my wife. Without any comment from me she described what I had seen; three equidistant, white lights, apparently attached to some sort of object. After about 3-4 minutes of observing it moved to the east and remained barely in view for another 10 minutes and then become impossible to view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the third incident in about two months of an anomolous occurance in the same area. The first was bright, stationary object that I thought was a planet. While observing it dimmed completely out and then came back &#34;on&#34;. Unless I lost my bearings and confused it with a planet it remained there until sunup.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second sighting was of a very bright object at 9:00 in the same area. Again it appeared stationary as I gauged it to the stationary horizon. Honestly, it looked like it could have been an airplane reflecting the sun just right, but then it dimmed out. It very well could have been an airplane but it must have been moving directly away from me as it appeared stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third sighting described at the beginning of this report was very distinct in that we could make out something that did appear to have structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, still can&#39;t be sure of anything but perhaps this will get some more eyes trained on the area east of Montrose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus.

I took the garbage to the complex&#39; dumpster, it was about 11 pm. it was silent lonely and cloudy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked to the dumpster I looked to the sky  I saw some lights that at the biggining I thought were like from an helicopter as the object approched more (it was very hight) at an speed that a normal place would reach, I saw with astonishing that the shape was not that of an helicopter, as it approached the area I was in (near the called intracostal between North Palm beach and singer Island)I saw the real shape above, it was an oval and i got astonished when I clearly saw that the oval underneat had an spiral and it rotated as giving impulse to the ufo or so, I do not know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 things called my attention.  First, there was no noice and that made me stare at the object when approaching and Second, as the object approached, what I thought therewere lights, might have been the bright of the top part of the object, therewere no flushing lights or so the third thing is that as the object cleared my location and I could saw completally the underneat shape (oval and spiral)and it was not bright, like from a different material, the color was dark could be easily disgazed and camuflated in the clouds, as if purposely it had been colored to disguised in the dark clouds. All this ended in about 2 mins but was like the time stopped. The object did not follow me or stopped, just kept flying its destination somewhere west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to look someone was near me but nobody was arround as witness, just me. passed but no body was near me.<n>

This appeared to be at a very high altitude. The most notable feature of this object was its ghostlike nature. It appeared similar to a telescopic view of a nebula and had a diameter of about 15 minutes - about half that of the lunar/solar disk. It was very faint but distinct. I was enjoying the crystal clear dark sky on the Labor Day evening. I don&#39;t think I would have noticed it otherwise, but I happened to be looking straight up at the time just as it passed across my line of sight. I followed it until I lost sight of it to the southeast at about 45 degrees elevation. It was not pointlike like a meteor and was not brilliant like a fireball. It was a diffuse, ghostly object that swiftly passed overhead. I have never seen anything remotely similar to this. I report it here because it was astounding and I couldn&#39;t identify this flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be very high in the atmosphere and moved across the visible horizon in less than 30seconds, possibly less than 15seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object itself was not visible.  It looked a little like a meteor entering the atmoshere.  The &#34;contrail&#34; was a elongated tear-drop shape.  Yellow/white in color and less than 1/2&#34; long if the length was messured at arm&#39;s length.  The &#34;contrail&#34; pulsed on and off in a very periodic fashion.  Three pulses with a pause and then three more pulses.  It completed about 4/5 cycles of 3 pulses in the time it took to disappear over the horizon.  The direction of travel was South to North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: we saw a shooting star and several satilites over 2 nights of star gazing.  This object did not resemble any of these sightings.  The sky was very clear and aircraft often crossed at high altitude directly overhead on a West to East heading and this object also did not resemble a civilian aircraft in speed(UFO was far too fast), altitude(UFO was higher), or apearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They levitated in the South Western sky for a few hours. I watched them for 3 hours then got bored and went to bed.At one point, a third object joined the two and as suddenly as it appeared, took off to the west at an incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I thought the object to be triangular was because the lights did not rotate in a circle .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sitting on the concrete and looking up into the sky, around sunset. Suddenly I saw what appeared to be a star at first, shimmering and white, only it was still daylight. I thought that maybe it was just the first visible star in the sky at night, so i looked around to see if other stars were visible. There were none. As in the other post from euless, I too was directly under the DFW International Airport flight line. There were many planes flying in from the South, going North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shrugged off the light/sphere as a star, and continued talking to my dad, when I happened to glance up again. The sun was shining through the clouds and casting an orange/red tint on everything, including the planes in the sky. That was when I noticed that this object glimmered just like the planes, as if the sun was casting a reflection onto it as well. At this point I called my dad over to take a look, and just as he was walking over to do so, it blinked off like a light bulb. It simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what it was, but for a couple of days, I thought about it, found my way here, and saw the other Euless post. I would guess that the object was at least 5000 ft in the air. It seemed to be higher than the flight path of the planes, though I am certain that they would have seen this too. It was white, but not extremely bright, just bright enough to catch your eye. It would be impossible to guess the size, other than to say it appeared small in the sky compared to the planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This entire event lasted about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, but in the last glimpse of the object, when the sun hit it, I could see definite shadow, and shape, which is why I started doubting it was a star at all. It was just perfectly rounded sphere that put off a slight white light. Thanks<n>

It was making unbelievable circular maneurvers<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were traveling northbound on Interstate 79 north of Pittsburgh on Sept.6,(Labor Day) 2004.  Traffic was heavy.  As we crested the hill past the Evan City entrance to I 79 we spotted a Y shaped white/silver craft above the treeline west of the highway.  At first we thought it was some sort of remote controlled airplane because it was making unbelievable circular maneurvers above and within the treeline.  However, it seemed too large (over an inch in size) to be a radio controlled toy airplane. Also, the Y shape was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. The air show lasted for less than 20 seconds. We lost sight of the craft for approximately 15 seconds as we were traveling about 70 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we began to descend down into the valley towards the Zelienople exit, we saw what we believed was the same craft traveling in a straight pattern at a high rate of speed east by north east toward the Evan City - Butler area.  The craft was approximately 45 degrees above the horizon. At this height, the craft was about 1/2 inch in length. My boyfriend was surprised at the speed and size of this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we got home I had everyone (my son age 13, my boyfriend and myself) draw a picture of what they saw.  We compared pictures.  Each was Y -shaped - simliliar to a Mercedes Logo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this was an experimental plane (remote controlled or otherwise)and not a UFO, it was certainly beautiful to look at and remarkable to watch.  It would have been very dificult to make circular patterns above and into this heavily forested and hilly terrain next to the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was blue with some clouds, and the Y shaped craft really stood out. It should have been visible to many people on the highway. I would be very curious to know if anyone else traveling on the highway at that time of day happened to catch the airshow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the witness send a graphic illustration of what the object looked like, and will compare it with known aircraft.

The object was glowing quite brightly. It was hard to judge altitude on it. the object was traveling north/northeast and it was moving at least 10 times faster than the commercial airliner which was headed due north. I heard no sound from the object but the jet that was flying over probably would have drown out any sound from it anyway. The object left no contrail and I saw no other lights on it except for the glow from the object itself. It flew a straight and level course until I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We have made this a game and play daily, during the daytime and nighttime.  We are close to an Cabinis Field Airport and relatively close to NAS Corpus Christi, so we see aircraft all the time.  When she said &#34;airplane&#34; I instinctively looked up.  What I thought we were looking at initially was two birds - seagulls. Then as I watched them I realized they were aircraft as the reflection of light made it obvious that these were metallic.   There were two of them flying in formation.   We have an airshow coming up later this month, so I assumed that they were military jets practicing for the show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stuck my head in the back door and told my husband what we were watching and he came outside.  As we watched them, we began to think they were birds again, not because of the way they looked but because of the way they were flying. Constantly in formation the two aircraft were manuevering several different patterns including tight circular patterns that we have never seen aircraft perform.  I&#39;m not good with estimating altitude, but these two objects were flying below the few clouds we have in the sky today.  As they turned away from us and toward us, the reflection of the sun hitting the objects made them seem 5 times larger. They were silvery white objects of triangular shape.  There were no sounds as the aircraft went nearly over our heads.   There were no vapor trails or contrails coming off the aircraft either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there watching, not sure of what we were looking at and they just disappeared. Weird. I didn&#39;t have the presence of mind to grab my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We thought we were watching a possible plane crash, after watching for over 30 minutes we went inside.  At first glance we thought it was a bright star until seeing the lights red and green occassionally blink, again would have quit watching until it seemed to sort of fall from the sky a ways and then a few minutes later jump back up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers live in a rural area, in their mid 40&#39;s.

(I checked the clock in my kitchen)  Usually I go right back to bed after a sleep interrupting &#39;pit stop&#39; but it was late enough in the morning and I was not ready to go back to sleep so I did what I always do on such an occasion which is go into the living room preparatory to turning on the light and engaging in some mindless reading till I am ready to zonk out again.  At that point, I looked out my window (which has a southeast exposure over 26th street in the neighborhood of Chelsea, Manhattan (only blocks away from Madison Square Garden where the convention was held) and I noticed an orb of light pretty high up in the sky suspended over 8th Avenue.  I immediately got my field glasses and trained them on this orb, which appeared sparkly with refracted light, like a diamond.  I put my field glasses down and it was then that I noticed that this was not the only orb of light in the sky.  I began to count and saw that there were between 11 and 13 other orbs of light that were hanging, motionless and soundless, in the sky to the south of the first one.  There was at least one more light  far to the left of the first one to the north.  The other orbs had a softer glow to them, perhaps because the sky was slightly more overcast to the south.  The orbs to the south were in an odd formation that actually looked, on closer inspection, like the big dipper constellation.  (I can say with certainty that I was not viewing the constellation itself; I know what stars in the night sky look like and they are considerably smaller than these orbs.  Furthermore, the amount of light pollution in New York, even at 5:00 in the morning, and the fact that it was somewhat cloudy and overcast, would make it impossible to clearly see any astronomical phenomena easily, or even at all.)  I continued watching for some time and finally went into my kitchen to make some decaf.  I set up the pot and walked back into the living room.  The lights were still there, unchanged in their position.  It was about 5:45.  I walked back into the kitchen, loaded up the pot with ground coffee and water and then noticed that the sky was beginning to lighten in the east.   I walked back into the living room for another look, and the lights were gone.  I did not (I&#39;m sorry to say) see them disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot be certain, but we suspect that the witness may have been looking at Venus in the southeastern sky, and stars in the morning sky.

At 12:35 I started hearing what sounded like a large engine running (like a utlity truck or something) on the road in front of my house over the howling wind.I thought what is a crew doing out in this .I had heard earlier on TV all county vehicles had been orderd off the roads.Then the sound got louder like it went in to a great strain and more of a roar. About this time I realized it was getting closer to the house comeing across the front yard. Then I thought OH CRAP Tornado,but in my mind that didn&#39;t jive.I ran to my back door which faces north and stepped out on the first step and looked up.The wind was comeing from the south and all kinds of debris was going past the side and over the house to the north. Now the sound was right over the house and had changed to what I can only describe as the roar of a rocket at lift off, deafening. Still looking up I jumped to the ground (to get a better angle) just in time to see a yellowish light pass over the tree line of my back yard. The trees are about 30 feet high and I could see the tops silhoueted by it just a few feet above them. What ever it was it was going west to east cross-wind to the storm. I couldn&#39;t see a shape but I could tell something soild was there. No way was this a plane or helicopter.In a couple of seconds it was out of sight and hearing range due to the storm.I&#39;m 50 years old and have worked electrial mechanical all my life. I&#39;m sorry for taking so long to report this but we&#39;er still doing clean up from the three storms that crossed us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The movement was like a commercial airliner:  steady rate of speed with no deviations in direction. I called my wife to look at it, which she did. We followed it until it went behind my apple tree.

The center of the object was a bright white with red flames sparking out behind it. The size of the object was similar to the size of a jumbo jet.

I noticed a moving light the shape and intensity of a small star, and at first concluded that it was a satellite since it initially had a velocity typical of satellites. However, to my surprise the light decelerated, and changed direction about 90 degrees for a certain distance. At this time I pointed the light out to my friend who witnessed the rest of the event with me. The light changed direction back again about 90 degrees so that it was more or less heading along its original trajectory (going north-to-south), and continued on and out of sight (unfortunately lots of light pollution in the city!).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But i then noticed it moved quickly from side to side and was able to stop instantly.  I gave my head a shake because at first i thought my mind was playing tricks on me, but then i saw it again, it moved to the left, and then on an angle down into the water.

One was in the lead, the other two were following, one on either side.  As I watched, I turned on my night vision to possibly get a better look.  Looking through the night vision, I confirmed the three objects and noted that they seemed to be travling either East or maybe away from earth. They were not moving really fast or anything, just moving enough that you could tell they were not stars.  They were definately not in our atmosphere, WAY UP. Anyway, the one behind and to the right of the lead one began overtaking the lead one and then they dimmed out into nothing, disappeared, whatever.  I don&#39;t know.  What was it?  You Tell Me?  The NEO website did not show three things that were supposed to be together in that area of the sky at that time.  I don&#39;t believe there are aliens prowling around, I don&#39;t believe in them at all. I&#39;m Christian.  If there were, I believe there would be better evidence than what there currently is.  One problem I have with UFO sightings is this, If these beings are so advanced and traveled so far to get here to our insignificant planet, then why do they need running lights on there space craft?  Don&#39;t you think they would be able to move around in the dark without being seen?  I just want an idea what this could really be.

(i was looking away and did not see this)... there was a helicopter that flew up to it and then left and came back, it seemed like the copter was trying to figure out what it was. could not tell if it was a news or military copter (too far away). it did not appear to be a hot-air balloon (b/c the balloon would have been easy to discern even from far away, it was kind of a speck that did not appear to be bigger than the copter, and it was odd b/c it was just hovering there. after the copter left, it became engulfed behind the clouds. we did not speak to anyone else about it, but no one else seemed to notice (they were all jogging along the lake or observing a rainbow nearby).<n> <n><n> <n><n> the weather was clear- blue skies, lots of clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> so, we were wondering... what this was, and if anyone else in austin saw it?<n>

Because it was so far away it would be too large and too long to be a &#34;Blimp&#34;. It wouldn&#39;t move so it couldn&#39;t be a plane...so I took some pictures with my digital camera. Then it just dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home, I enlarged the immage and it is clearly a cigar shaped allumminum looking thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object appeared very high in the sky in full daylight, no clouds. Saw two planes pass underneath with a seemingly great distance between them. Object was moving from east to west at what seemed to be fast, erratic pace. Object left no visible trail. At first glance the object appears to be round, but after watching it move for about a minute or so, I thought that it could have been cylindrical shaped. Object was observed by myself and one other witness. I went inside to get binoculars, could not locate object when I returned.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked to the east and noticed a white rectangular object floating sky.  I estimate that it was floating at an altitude of 1500 feet.  It appeared to be to the right of the water tower.  It resembled a bed sheet.  There were no lights or movement.  It was just floating.  At first I thought it might have been an advertisement banner, but there was no writing on it, nor was it being pulled by a plane.  I have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/4/04 11:00|Murrieta|CA|Triangle|3:00 minutes|Dim Luminous Large Triangle / Grouped Lights|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50047.html|362|ndxe200409| Dim Luminous Large Triangle / Grouped Lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi Art  I was just listening to your show and felt compelled to write you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have two different events to share with you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First off, some background on myself.  I own my CNC machining business.  Have been a race engine builder for years.  Worked with GM for years.  Studied astronomy, physics and engineering.  Very down to earth person.  I don&#39;t look for phenomena, but have always had a major interest in the natural world.  I quest for knowledge in all my endeavors.  I not easily swayed, I seek facts and details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could go further, but that being said, here&#39;s my events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> September 04;  I was driving home from my shop ~ 11:00 pm.  I turned right on Jefferson from Date Street heading north.  It was a warm night and I enjoy the solitude of the night sky.  I had the drivers window down and was glancing up to view the night sky and stars as I normally do.  A dim luminous object in the sky caught my eye at about 11:00 above and to my slightly forward left.  I had to look out the window and look almost straight up to see this object.  I drove almost two miles to Murrieta Hot Springs road while slowing and viewing this object.  While driving the object never moved from it&#39;s position in the sky.  The object was the size of my thumbnail at arms length.  To not alter it&#39;s position in the sky over two miles horizontal on the ground says something of the height and size of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was exactly triangle in shape.  It&#39;s luminosity was about a 10 watt bulb viewed from across a large room with an old lampshade covering the light.  It was a dull brown/gold in color.  It had a distinuished dark band that outlined the perimeter and appeared to be darker than the moonless night sky.  However the most strange element of this sighting was what appeared to be the underside, the side I could see.  The surface seemed to be in turmoil.  I would describe it as what you would see on a TV set with a screen full of snow on a channel without programming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over just before I got to Murrieta Hot Springs Road to grab my camera in my glove box.  I just got back from Lake Mead with my boys and had not yet turned in the disposable camera for developing.  I stopped my truck while still watching the object.  In the time it took me to reach over to my glove box for the camera and look back out to take a picture, the object was gone.  I was standing outside the truck with a complete view of the sky and saw no hint of the object anywhere.......<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had not noticed any sound.  The object appeared to be very close to me, but with the distance I traveled and the object maintaining it&#39;s position in the sky, it had to be very large and very high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> February 2006;  I was again driving home late at night, ~12:00 a.m. from my shop.  My girlfriend was with me at this time.  We were heading north on I-15.  Just pass California Oaks off ramp, we both noticed a very bright light hovering just above the horizon about NW, 10:30 from our position.  It was very strange in that there was no traffic in our direction.  No lights ahead and one set of lights very far behind us.  Very unusual for the busy I-15.  We commented on the brightness of the lights.  Like they were pointed right at us.  They were brighter than any aircraft lights I&#39;ve ever seen.  But there were 3 together but distinctly separate.  We thought it may be a helicopter.  It moved ever so slightly towards us, maintaining it&#39;s altitude.  We continued to comment on the strangeness.  As we approached Bundy Canyon, the object seemed to start to draw a bead on us.  Again there was oddly no other traffic in our direction, but a sporadic car passing on the opposite side heading south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we passed Bundy the object was now even with us and within a 1/4 mile to the direct West of us and falling slightly behind us, say to the 8:00 position.  It&#39;s altitude was maybe 200&#39;.  It then turned and maintained running parallel to our direction exactly off at 9:00.  It maintained that distance for ~ 1/4 mile, then moved in to us.  It continued to fly directly over the truck.  I become very uneasy and speed up to around 100 mph, because I felt like it may hit us.  It flew directly above us for maybe a 1/2 mile and then started to veer off to the East and disengaged slowly.  I could not see it off the passenger side except for just a couple of glimpses.  My girlfriend continued to eye it.  She said it then shot off to the East at an extremely high rate of speed.  Faster than a jet she said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange facts:  NO noise.  This object made absolutely NO noise, even flying about 100&#39; above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three aircraft type landing lights up front and two of the same type lights in the assumed &#34;Rear&#34; of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NO traditional navigation lights or strobes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And the most amazing aspect of all is that there was no visible body.  We could not make out any physical type of structure to the object.  NO wings, NO fuselage, NO body.  Just lights and void between the lights.  Even as the object came over head, we could not see any type of body.  The object did appear to be circular only becuase of the way the lights were positioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate the size to be maybe 20&#39; to 30&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured you may like to add these sightings to what ever compilation you may have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

9/4/04 09:00|Glendale|AZ|Teardrop|10-12 seconds|Silent black tear-drop shaped craft going above mach speed.|9/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39138.html|363|ndxe200409| Silent black tear-drop shaped craft going above mach speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was to the east of me when I spotted it. It was about 4 to 5 miles away between 500 to 800 feet off the ground. The object was traveling due north. This object was black, had no markings, no blinking lights, no propellers or rotors, and no hanging jet engine pods. The object also had NO wings or any tail surfaces that I could see. The object travel beyond my line of sight(estimated to be 50 to 60 miles visibility or more)in between 10 to 12 seconds. That should have put the objects speed well above Mach and it made NO sound and there was NO sonic boom. The object did not leave any kind of contrail either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/4/04 06:30|Huntington Beach|CA|Light|5 seconds|A shooting bright red light intermittently visible in eastern sky near Saturn.|9/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39096.html|364|ndxe200409| A shooting bright red light intermittently visible in eastern sky near Saturn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While attempting to view Saturn/Venus through intermittent cloud cover early Friday morning, my husband and I witnessed what appeared to be a red light falling through the sky.  There were four separate sightings of this light, which appeared high in the eastern sky very close to Saturn. Each sighting lasted approximately 5-10 seconds, and spanned a total period of about 10 minutes. The unusual light (or object) was similar in appearance to the red dot that is produced by a lazer pointer, but brighter and larger. It appeared to be rapidly falling in an &#34;s&#34; shaped pattern, almost as if it was weaving in and out of the clouds. However, this description is somewhat inaccurate since we were able to view it clearly through the heaviest parts of the morning mist/cloud cover, even when Saturn (and everything else) was temporarily obstructed from our view. I am not sure whether this could have been a reflection from some sort of dust particles, since the sun was just coming up on the horizon. However, I have been star gazing for a while and have never observed anything this unusual. If anyone else witnessed something similar, or has any idea what it could be, please post it, as I am totally mystified.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/4/04 06:00|Watsonville|CA|Light|45 mins|Bright red, plasma-type object  seen hovering over Mt.

Madonna, are for 45 mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watsonville, CA I went out side to smoke a cigarette and have my coffee at about 6 am. It was beginning to get light out side, but the sun hadnt appeared yet. I was looking at the mountains to the south east ( about 15 miles from my back yard ), and noticed a red burning object in the sky. It looked like the tail end of a missle, the way it was burning. All I could see was the bright red tail (megenta color) . I thought that a missle or rocket was being launched from the hills, but the wierd part was that it didnt go any where. It stayed in one general area fo about 30 mins, slowly moving around. It then started to slowly move east, toward Gilroy, Ca. It dissapeared over the hills for about 3 mins. , then reapeared again, this time moving south. It didnt look like any plane or helicopter Ive ever seen. when the sun came up over the mountains its red-plasma-like color started to slowly turn translucent/white. I assume that it was alot larger than a jet, it also looked like some parts were tranparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know what I saw, but Im sure plenty of other people in this area saw it too this morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/4/04 05:30|St. Augustine|FL|Cylinder|6 seconds|Large gray cylinder hovering just above tree tops|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57530.html|366|ndxe200409| Large gray cylinder hovering just above tree tops<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were just exiting the house and walked onto the front porch.  My wife heard a bird and looked up to see what kind it was and she observed a very large gray cylinder hovering over our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was also on the porch and looked up and I saw a very big gray cylinder hovering just above the trees.  There wasn&#39;t any sound to this object.  I walked into the yard and tried to position myself to observe more of the craft, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way to discribe what I had seen was as if you were looking exactly at the side of a blimp from two feet away.  There were no windows, no sound and no movement noticable. I am a retired 30yr law enforcement officer and thought that I had seen everything, but this was unexplainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We told a few friends about the experience but never reported it until now.  We just have to get this documented in case there are others out there who saw the same thing.  No one reported seeing any UFO that day, which I felt sure that someone would because of the size and location of this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

9/4/04|Kalispell|MT|Triangle|2 Minutes|Triangle Craft  ((NUFORC Note:  NOSS satellite formation??

Right when we all laid-down underneith the stars, we started looking for falling stars and satilites.  Immediatly I saw a 3 point formation (triangle of lights, star size) move across the sky.  They were a bit larger than satilites, and didnt break from their triangle formation.  The craft made no noise, and flew from West to East.  Later on about 10 minutes later, the same craft or another of the same style flew over head, going south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a month later I saw the same craft, but at 8pm.  I was in town and in my car at an intersection.  The craft flew over head from the north turned and headed east, away from my car.  The craft, unlike the previous two, had beams of light connecting the points of light on each corner of the triangle.  Like the craft had side doors along the length of each side and they opened, and a soft peach colored light glowed off the sides, then the stopped, then did it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just talked to a friend of mine who saw the 2 craft during our camping trip, and he saw 2 more just this last week (september 9th, 04)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a time for the event.  We suspect the witnesses may have observed the three satellites, which fly in formation, and which we believe are part of the U. S. Navy &#34;NOSS&#34; satellite program.  PD))<n>

I watched<n> <n><n> <n><n> While sitting at Pyramid lake in Nevada, this is near Reno, Nevada. I notice a small light to the right of me, I was sitting in my car, but this light was close to the water, everytime a car would come the light would circle about the water as if it was hiding from the car. and circle back to the same spot.  and after awhile across the lake is a tall mountain, and a light was coming over the mountain, it was huge! but it seemed to get smaller as it got close to the water. where it just sat. kinda stayed about 30 to 40 ft above the water. but when a car came along the road it floated upward into the sky, the light went out. and the other light on my side would circle around.  after the car would travel distance away. it would come back with lights and all.  I light a cigarette and It seemed to have seen the light and went into the sky,  the other light didnt do anything.  by the time morning came it floated into the sky light a star, and sat, the other light to my right seemed to have turned red, and kinda came towards me, and went upwards and disappeared. I was scared and yet wanted to watch. and that I did... !!!This lake called Pyramid Lake is on a Paiute Indian Reservation in Nevada.  It is in the desert away from lights and city,, it way out in the middle of nowhere.. alot of mystery goes along with this lake, and yet alot of Native Americans have stories to tell. I wittness one, on this night, early in the morning.  while on my way home. this is has alot of questions to ask and I dont know who to ask.??? help me out???<n>

On the night of my sighting, I was a passenger being driven south on the New Jersey Turnpike, and as we passed by Newark Airport, between Exits 14 and 13, I looked west toward Newark. In the distance over the skyline, about 30 degrees from the horizon, was a slightly oval-shaped glow that had about the same size, color, and intensity as a full moon being obscured by clouds. It could not have been the moon, however, because it did not change shape or intensity at all, as would have been the case if it were being obscured by moving clouds. Moreover, the moon that night was a half moon. This object just sat there in one spot, unchanging for the entire time I viewed it. It did not look like a helicopter or blimp, and it clearly was not an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He did not see it much in the manner as if you try and point out a shooting star to someone.   It passes so quickly. That is what happened with this object.  I saw it and pointed very excitedly but he did not see it.  I watched it pass over and saw its shape.  I knew it was not a plane or a helicopter or a satellite or anything else I am familiar with seeing.  It was definately a UFO and I am 100% certain I had an alien encounter of the second kind.  I was so certain, I also quickly sketched its shape so as not to forget.  I am very excited to ascertain if others in my area were out and viewed the same thing as I am very certain of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request a copy of the graphic.

The colors of green red and yellow were distinctive. My husband was an Air Force navigator for 21 years and said it was not a planet, but an airplane coming into SeaTac airport. The light did not move as if it was on an approch. I observed it off our back deck between two trees that at distance of about 75-100 feet were about 3-4 inches apart. I watched thru binoclars because out telescope was not set up. The light took about 15 minutes to travel the three to four inch distance between the two trees. It was heading almost directly east from the northern view from my deck. It was quiet obvious from the light distortion and the time it took to cover the distance between the trees that it was at a very high altittude, and yet the colors were very distinct. I don&#39;t know what crafts that are up there to explain this light<n>

I posted one on 8/24/04 stating that I saw a very bright object in the sky over in the western sky area on 8/19/04 (I&#39;m from river falls wisconsin). My telescope showed a very strange teardrop object which remained for a few hours. I am posting one again because I saw the exact same thing , but much higher in the sky (hence closer to where I live), but this was a bit different. I ran to get my telescope, put it outside, turned it on, and bam! it was just gone. It couldn&#39;t have been there for more than 1 minute, but I swear to God, whatever that thing was, it knew I was about to look at it with my scope and immediately fled. I don&#39;t know why the object didn&#39;t flee when it was over such a large city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have one more thing to say: the other UFO reports in this data base where low-flying craft have been spotted are probably just military craft. If they were aliens, why would they fly so close to the ground, and in plain sight, if their goal was secrecy?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

On my balcony you can see planes approaching Bradley Airport in Hartford, Ct.  I paid no attention to them at first assuming they were a plane when i noticed that there were no flashing indicator lights, just three bright lights in the shape of a triangle. I continued to watch as i called my girlfriend from inside to come see but by the time she came out the lights had proceeded to fly over my building slowly and gracefully until i could no longer see it past my rooftop.  It was shaped like a triangle with bright lights at each point.  I could hear a low rumbling that got slightly louder as it flew over my building.  I could not see anything in between the lights just black, the stars were out and you could not see them between the lights,  It appeared very high up and appeared no larger than your tip would look at the and of your arm fully stretched out it also did not follow any of the flight paths that the approaching/departing planes would take.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After 3 or 4 hours, I came back home and I copied the image files from digital camera to notebook. The next day, as I arranged the image files in my notebook, I found something strange in the corner of an image file. It seemed a bird or an insect. It was zoomed in with image viewer program. But not the bird or the insect!!  It has dark brown color, an empennage-shaped wing above the body, but absolutely not the aircraft as far as I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to recall the time when I had taken the photograph. That time…I’m not sure, but I had gooseflesh and I had my hair stand on end little bit as I had looking the LCD monitor and operating the functional button on digital camera. But I didn’t hear any noise at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was quite misty at the time being a typical lovely english late summer / early autumn morning and quite still and quiet. I could also liken the sound to wind howling around a building, but with no wind today at all. I can&#39;t stress enough that this sound was extremely loud for quite a few minutes, enough to wake my wife up, and quite unlike any sound I&#39;ve ever heard in my life before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A light was at first observed relatively high above the car. The driver thought it was a satellite moving but suddenly it approached the car extremely fast and took position beside and above the car, perhaps 1-2 meters away. The object was the size of a small car and very bright and totally illuminated the car on the inside. The driver stepped on it and the object followed up to a speed of approx. 100 mph. When the car approached a few houses close to the road with street lighting, the object gained altitude - perhaps to 50-150 meters. About two kilometers later, the object suddenly turned left and crossed a fjord ca 4 kilometers wide, and took position above the drivers house. The driver arrived about 20 minutes later and the object was still above the house. Driver and passenger went inside and brushed their teeth, intending to go to sleep. As the object was still outside, the driver then went out and took some pictures with a digital camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was bright and multicoloured. The photos are not particularly clear, probably because the shutter on the camera closed because of the bright light. However, some lights in a triangular shape can be made out on one of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The driver in question is my wife&#39;s cousin and the passenger his girlfriend. Contact me if you are interested in contacting him or getting more info.<n>

It was cool because there was like no air traffic all during the convention over the city, but this was the night of the last day.  It was a clear night and there were stars out, nice to see over the city.  Then I saw the flashing lights in the sky, blueish white, no noticeable pattern.  The objects would move a little bit but not too much, until another aircraft entered the air space in the general area.  These two lights seemed to escort every single jet that passed out of the area in some what of a formation trailing each other.  Once a jet liner flew over, probably a gov. plane, that was escorted by a fighter jet and was still followed by these two flashing lights.  Every time the flashing objecs would zip back to there positions over Manhattan.  I thought this was crazy so I had to go wake up my girlfriend to show her.  I had already been sitting watching these objects for over 30 minutes and she saw them as well.  She went back to bed I continued to watch them do the same thing over and over again.  They moved so smoothly and quickly through the sky it was amazing and flashed the whole time.  I know dying stars tend to flicker and sometimes seemed to be shooting stars but after every movement, north or south, they would return to their original position over the city.  From the time of this sighting and the location being the over Manhattan on the last day of the RNC, it is my guess that this was not alien but US military related in origin.  Whatever their origin, this was an amazing display of aviation.  I eventually became bored and went to bed with the objects still doing their thing in the night sky.  I don&#39;t drink or do any drugs so this was seen with amazinglly clear suprised eyes.  One of the coolest things I have ever witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I jumped up and looked outside and witnessed a huge fireball traveling low on the horizon in a straight line from West to East, it then curved downward and disappeared.  It was bright and from our house it appeared the size of a basketball, white in color and traveling slow. It also didn&#39;t leave a streak or a trail and when it disappeared it didn&#39;t appear to break up or anything it just faded out.

I was preparing my home and property for the storm. As I walked around my pool, I noticed off to the west what I thought was just a bright star and only looked at it for a second as I was quite busy. A few minutes later I thought to look at it again just because it was so bright. This time it appeared much closer so I watched it for a moment. It was a clear evening with just a few puffy white clouds moving to the west and I knew this was an object other than a star because it was moving to the east, towards my location. I called into the house for my wife and friend to step outside and watch the light. It got to within I would say a mile off where I was and it height was below the level of the clouds as I noticed one pass behind what ever it was I was looking at. It slowed to a stop and began to hover and then it went dark. We could tell there was something there but even with binoculars we could not make out the shape of the object. There was no sound that we could connect with the object but it was right in the middle of a large residential/commercial area and within a mile of the executive airport. What really got us a little freaked out about it was when the object began to expell some sort of mist or fumes that took the form of wings or some type of venting and both of the flumes, for lack of a better word, were huge. I estimate they were more than 100 yards one off to each side of the object. After 15 minutes or so, the craft moved off to the north and appeared to be going higher. As it disappeared out of site a cone shaped, I want to say vortex, appeared way up in the sky about where we last saw the craft. THe point of the cone was pointing towards space but angled off to the north a bit. I have no clue what this could have been but it was truly a life changing experience for me as it has truly opened my mind far beyond what I would have previosly considered within the realm of possibilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

It moved very slowly at a a seemingly low altitude.  The whole craft was lighted (unlike a plane with spotlights) and the color of light was like a halogen bulb would give. There was only one craft.  I observed it travelling east from north Seattle over what seemed like St. Edwards Park.  It was like it was mapping something.  Speed was very steady and slow.  When I noticed it, I immediately went outside to observe.  It didn&#39;t give off any sound.  I have never seen an aircraft like it and called my husband to see.  He, too, felt that it was like nothing he had ever seen before. We lost sight of it when trees obstructed our view.  I wondered at first what it was, trying to think of what aircraft would give off such light.  I first thought about a blimp as it was somewhat the same shape.  It seemed larger than that though and the lights didn&#39;t jive with that.  If it is a domestic plane, it was VERY large, quiet and the whole thing was lit up!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Several other reports.  A blimp is in the Seattle area, currently.  PD))<n>

It was just hovering over the mountain as noted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was a radio tower light as it stayed in one place too long to be a helicopter.  However the next day we looked for a tower and realized that there was none plus with the height from the mountain top (which we positioned via a tree from our apartment) that it was two high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We face north towards Grouse Mountain and the light was a slight North East direction. We noted it Fridays and Saturdays for about three weeks.  It has since progressed to three ships; for lack of a better word; every night they are in a triangular sector of a great yet equal distance apart (based on kilometers about 70 k apart.... One always shines brighter and we assume it is closer to our location.  Two nights ago as we watched the closer set of lights shot out three bright beams of light to the North East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We usually observe said lights on and off for about three to four hours each night now as they appear early now; usually around 9:00 PM.  They do change position after a few hours but as we do not sit outside for the full time we do not see that actual change of position, but the spacing between said lights always seems to be consistent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight (September 2, 2004) there has been a change as now there are four separate sets of revolving/hovering lights.  We can readily see them with the naked eye and once we can purchase a telescope we intend to look closer.  We have been contemplating contacting the Vancouver Observatory but we are not sure if they will take us serious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do not have photos to send as at present we do not have a camera.

But, what was strange is there were no other stars/planets around because it was still light out.  So, I was just watching the bright star shaped object.  Thinking that maybe it was some sort of reflection from a high flying plane.  But, it wasn&#39;t changing direction or flickering.  As I stared at it trying to get my roomate to look at it.  I noticed that it seemed to be going into the atmosphere.  It was getting dimmer and dimmer.  Until it disappeared.  But, it wasn&#39;t like the &#34;light source&#34; was dimming.  It was like it was being enveloped by the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were looking into the sky and out of the corner of our eyes we seen two white cicle ufo&#39;s flying at unimagable speeds for anything human could have created. They flew in circles above my house. Not to long after the objects were flying around bright cicle lights apeared on the clouds as of some sort of spot light but no spotlight can reach the height of the clouds. Then after that the ufo&#39;s flew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This object was following the usual flight patter for aircraft going to Los Angles International Airport. However, what caught my attention was the color and brightness of the object and that it had no flashing lights like many aircraft do. The object was an orange color and seemed to be about twice the brightness of the other aircraft in the sky. I observed it for 2 minutes as it moved from the east to west in the southern horizon. Approximately halfway across the sky the object seemed to have stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then observed the object though my window screen using 10x binoculars. The object didn’t appear clear due to my screen being dirty, so I went out to my balcony with my binoculars and observed it there. This time I got a much better look at it and could not see any aircraft or shape in the bright orange light of the object. It appeared like a bight star about 5 times the size of the surrounding stars. Its color was that of hot burning coal, being that of a light orange color. While I observed it, the object was motionless and appeared to be hovering in the sky. I observed very closely thought my binoculars and this object didn’t move or drift at all. I could tell that it did not drift due to its distance from the background stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 2 minutes of watching the object hover, it ejected a much smaller object about 1/10 its size. The second object was the same color as the first object and appeared to be about half as small as the background stars I was viewing though my binoculars. It appeared to fall straight down from the first object and left a streaking orange trail as if fell which then disappeared the farther it fell from the first object. This smaller object looked like a falling hot coal or ash, like someone would see at a fireworks display except there was no smoke or flame, just an orange glow. It might have been possible that there was another object in the streaking trail when the first one was ejected. It was hard to tell due to the glow of the streaking trail. I followed this second object as it fell for about 3-5 seconds. In that time it fell about half the altitude of the first object. I then looked back up at the first object to see if it would eject more objects. The original object didn’t eject anymore objects but this time it appeared to move towards the northwest. It moved slower to the northeast than it originally moved when it was going east to west. As it moved it went over the roof of my apartment and I lost sight of it, so I went downstairs to the parking lot to see if can follow its movements. When I got down stairs and looked to the northwest it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object when first sighted was probably 3-4 miles to the south of me over the cities of El Monte, CA or Temple City, CA and then it moved north over Arcadia, CA where I was located. It was very hard to tell the size of the object or its height. I estimate that it was about 3000 to 4000 feet in altitude. However, it was very hard to tell its true altitude or the size of the object since it had no shape except that of an orange glowing light. Its speed was from what appears to be 100 MPH to zero.  It traveled about as fast as the background aircraft traffic when it was moving. There were numerous background aircraft traffic to the south of its position along the usual LAX landing patterns. Also there is the smaller El Monte Airport to the south about 5 miles away with mostly light private planes flying out of it. However, there were no background aircraft near the object itself, just in the distance several miles away. This object and the second object made no noise during the whole sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw this object I simply thought was the standard aircraft that fly in the area. However, it was the brightness and the color of the object that got my attention. Observing it made me think that it was something other than an airplane or helicopter. First I thought that it was a balloon that was on fire, especially when I saw the other smaller object dropout of it. I thought that it was a burning ember falling from it and that it might land on someone’s house and set it on fire. Then I thought about it and realized that this light showed no flames and that if it was a balloon on fire that it would have burned up very quickly.  If it was a helicopter then I would have heard noise from it and it would have drifted a little even while hovering. This object made no noise and didn’t drift in the slightest when hovering. The light it emitted hid the shape of whatever object it was. Whatever this object was I don’t believe that it was any conventional flying aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My father was also vacationing with us.  It was during the last week of August, right before Labor Day weekend.  One night, after putting our son to bed, about 10:00pm, I walked out onto the balcony and looked out over the gulf waters.  In the sky, there were two round lights.  They were white &amp; amber colored, kind of like far away headlights.  As a matter of fact, that&#39;s exactly what I thought they were...plane headlights, really close ones.  But they weren&#39;t getting any closer.  They weren&#39;t moving at all.  I called my dad and husband out to the balcony to take a look, but then they were gone.  They just disappeared in the exact same spot they had appeared in.  All the while, there were no sounds except the tiny waves that make it into the gulf. All of this transpired in 45-60 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 60 seconds went by, and  right after my dad &amp; husband made it onto the balcony, the lights re-appeared in the exact same spot.  At first just the two of them came back.  Then, as my dad, husband and I stood looking at these two lights, another one appeared to the right and just slightly above the others.  Then another one to the right and slightly above that one.  And then another.  So, now, there were five lights with the first two being side-by-side and the other three extending up &amp; out to the right in a diagonal line.  Still, I could hear no sound except the calm ocean.  After watching these lights appear and stay lit for about 40 seconds, I turned to run inside and get my camera.  As I went through the sliding glass door, I looked behind me, afraid that the lights would be gone.  Just as I turned and looked at them, they faded to black and I could no longer see them.  I did not get a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat on the balcony for a few more hours, until about 12:00 midnight.  We sat out there talking about what we had seen and looking out over the gulf, waiting for the lights to come back, but they never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I&#39;m not sure what we really saw out there.  I know that Eglin AFB is really close to this area.  Maybe the lights had to do with that.  Also, maybe there was a ship way out there in the gulf that we couldn&#39;t see, with air craft taking off from it.  I guess maybe, we&#39;ll never know.  However, if anyone out there knows what it could have been, or has seen something similar, any information would be greatly appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving south at the pace of a low flying airplane (reasonably quick), but it had no flashing lights and made no sound.  Because of this, I assumed it was VERY high up.  But I wouldn&#39;t think a plane that high would move quite that fast.  After watching it for a couple of minutes, it began to dim.  I watched closely as it faded to complete invisibility within about 20 to 30 seconds.  At this point it was still near the highest point in the nights sky, according to my vision.  In other words, it was nowhere near the horizon.  I thought it may be a satellite, but if it was in orbit, why would it vanish so quickly as if it were moving away from earth?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The description is not inconsistent with a satellite, we believe.

It appeared to be very high up. It appeared to move very slowly,however this may have been due to it&#39;s distance from me.I called my husband out to our deck to see it. It appeared to kind of meander around in the sky in a northerly direction. As it moved away from us the light became dimmer and dimmer. The following evening, around the same time, I saw two of these &#34;moving&#34; points of light. First I saw one for a short time and then it became dimmer and dimmer as if it were moving farther away from the earth. About a minute later I saw the other one. It moved in a southwesterly direction in the same manner as the first but then did an odd thing. It became somewhat brighter, sped up and then made a half circle as is it was going around something or avoiding something.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I normally do, I was watching out my passanger side window (facing maybe west or northwest). shortly after the car came to the center area of the bridge i noticed a bright light just below the treeline.  i resembled somewhat of a flare but stayed in one place, not appearing to move.  at first i thought nothing of it, untill the car came to a point in the bridge where the view wasn&#39;t blocked by trees. thats when the light proved to be more than just that. as i watched the object it appeared to split into 3 similarly sized triangle shaped objects, each with its own weaker light at each of the three points. i could not make out a solid form between the lights, maybe a glare of some sort distorted them. at this point only a few seconds had actually passed. the first trianlge shape that had emergered slowly drifted away along the horizon and disapeared. it was shortly and quickly followed by the remaining two, moving at a speed so fast they seemed to vanish in the blink of an eye. when confronting the other two persons in the car soon after witnessing this, it became clear that unfortunatly i had been the only one to actually notice it.<n>

It was so loud even the dog, who was hunting chipmunks under the railroad ties, looked up. I stepped out from the porch and looked north toward the sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw, at a fairly low altitude, a long white shape-it could have been a plane with short wings. Just above it,picked out by glints from the sun, were two shiny, gold colored orbs. I wondered if somehow I might have seen a distortion of helicopter rotors, but they seemed to be orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The combination was soon lost to sight in the blue of the sky. It was not traveling very swiftly, but I guess the white made it easier to disappear in the sky. It was invisible to the eye long before the noise disappated.<n>

I was on the roof and asked one of the guys on the ground to hand me a nail gun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As he handed up the nail gun, he said, &#34;Hey, look at that&#34;.  &#34;What,&#34;  I said.  He said, I don&#39;t know, look. So I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw nothing and was busy so I blew it off for a few minutes.  Then he said check it out.  I turned and looked at the sky for several minutes and saw nothing.  It was 10:00 in the morning and the sky was almost clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then a small cloud was drifting across above us.  He said right there above that cloud.  Do you see it?  After a few more minutes, I did.  It looked like a little speck of cotton off of a cottonwood tree, way up in the air, only it wasn&#39;t moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to get back to work, so I did. The next chance I got, I started looking for the dot again.  Now all 4 of us were looking for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes the person who originally spotted it, spotted it again.  An airplane was flying alomg now and we used it as a guage to let eveyone else know its locatuion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pretty soon, we all saw it It looked like a silverish metallic orb with the sun shining off of it.  It&#39;s altitude was way greater than the airplane or the cloud that went past earlier.  It was not moving.  I thought for sure it had to be a satelite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone else went back to work except for me and the person who spotted it first.  After about another four or five minutes the object moved in a direction that appeared to be down for about a half a second, then went to our right (west) very rapidly until it went out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object moved the speed appeared to be constant.  No starting slow and then going faster, and when it went out of sight, it was due to the fact that the sun reflecting off of it quit shining on it, so we couldn&#39;t see it anymore, not that it went behind the mountains or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate the speed to be about five times as fast as the speed of the planes that were flying over at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at my friend and said did you see that?  Yes he said.  I said what did you see?  He said he saw the dot drop down and then take off that way, (indicating towards the mountains).  Me too, I said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was about all that was ever really said about the incident.  It was just forgotten and dismissed as one of those things that make you go hmmmm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget what I saw though.  And I still remember it as if it were yesteday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My opinion.  It wasn&#39;t an alien spacecraft.  It was something our government made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

This time the object was much like the last one I saw a couple of weeks ago. It was staying still for about five to eight minutes and was very bright. The object was only one color light yellow almost white. After remaining still for awhile it began to move very slwly in a circular motion eventually becoming very bright actually affecting the way the sky looked. It then shot off which looked like it either went out to space or traveled to a different dimension or something. This is twice I have seen this sphere like light this summer and several summers ago I witnessed two UFO&#39;s different to this one with my whole family. I just found your site today and that is why I am writing this. I have a feeling after seeing two on the same night with each other years ago and now two this summer on seperate occasions that my house might be a hot spot for UFO activity and I will try staying up more often to try and get a picture or video to send. I also have a strong feeling inside that more and more UFO&#39;s will be showing up all over the world and that more should be put into investigating what these are, what they are doing, and why they are here. I will be visiting your site more often and will be telling everyone I know that is interested in this subject to check out your site. Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When me and my roommate pulled over, because of and accident we steped outside to look at the strange looking craft. what made it look strange was that the crafe was doing flip low to the ground. then would take off behind a building and then another craft would come out and do the same flip. both of the flying crafts were flying low to the ground and were not making any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was afraid maybe the gov&#39;t or someone would want to question me about it. But now a few yrs after, I want to tell my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working on my computer one night then got a bit tired b/c it was getting late. I lied down, the bed was facing the windown and my toes were pointed right at the window which was about 4 ft away from me. Within secs of me lying down, my eyes were slightly open, I noticed a very bright fluorescent blue light that flashed for 2 secs. outside my window. I had off white curtains that covered most of the window. then right after that 3 small greyish figures flew into my bedroom, heads first one by one, then elongated and stood by my bedside. to on my side and one at teh end. They looked at that point about 5&#39;6-6 ft tall, very slim, long skinny body, almost looks as if they were naked or wearing some sort of greyish suit that clinged tight to them. I couldnt tell if they were male or female, b/c they had no breast and didnt seem to have any male genitals either. They didnt appear to have any ears, a nose that only had the nostrals(little holes)showing, and very big almond shaped eyes and barely a mouth, just a slim line around the mouth area, which I&#39;m assuming is their mouth. they didnt speak one word to me the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so scared but I was motionless, I dont think I even tried to move. My first instinct was, okay i should assume they are evil, so i calmed down, but then the one closest to me reached their hand down at my chest area, I then pushed its hand away. i looked at one of the figures in front of me and it seemed scared that I was able to push the other&#39;s hand away. then they flew/floated out of my window heads first and were small again to fit through.  then there was the same fluresent blue light that flashed for 1 sec. then I got up from my bed and turned on my light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so terrified, i stayed up the entire night, and kept saying to myself, i can&#39;t believe that happened to me, This never happens in a well populated place like NYC. I was so scared that I didnt tell anyone until recently and since I didnt write down teh date or my experience anywhere out of fear, I dont recall teh exact time or date, but can only estimate. My encounter has stayed in my memories, that I could not erase. I dont think these beings are friendly though, and I dont think they are harmless either. if someone or something does something to you without your consent or without you knowing their intention, then they are violating us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

In my van, I also had with me my two daughters ages 12 and 14 and my niece, age 13.  We saw numerous airplanes, which were flying to and from Airborne in Wilmington (I know this because I used to work there), but we saw these three brighter lights that stood out.  Two quickly faded out, but there was one left that was the brightest.  I stopped my van on the road to observe this light.  It never moved but it &#34;twinkled&#34; at times, but remained bright.  It was a pretty clear evening out, mabey a few thin clouds.  After observing it while parked, it then faded out and was gone.  We waited for about 10 minutes to see if it would reappear but it did not.   This light did not look like any other star.  This light looked too bright to be a planet.  It was approx. the size of a peanut at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am guessing it could have been flares, but who knows so we thought we should report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
