It hovered for approxmentally 5 minutes then seemly blinked out. Their was no sound and at the time of the sighting their was no traffic passing by on the heavly traveled highway we lived on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the garage to tell my parents to come take a look but they wouldn&#39;t as they were involved in a heavy dicussion. I do know my dad was having trouble with his power equipment working at that moment and I tried to tell him it was because of the UFO across the road. Then I ran back out to watch the UFO as I didn&#39;t want to miss it&#39;s departure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WE wern&#39;t scared, more so intriqued by it all. I didn&#39;t see any other people in the neighborhood witnessing this event.<n>
7/25/68 23:00|Freeport/Rockford|IL|Disk|10-15 minutes|Late night brilliant round object following our car for several miles.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63723.html|2|ndxe196807| Late night brilliant round object following our car for several miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is an absolutely true experience that occurred in 1968, when our son, now 54 and a helicopter flight instructor, were playing in a band with four other junior high school boys.  This more than memorable evening developed after he and the band were finished playing for a birthday party one summer night in Freeport, Illinois, twenty some miles from our homes in Rockford.  Two dad&#39;s drove up later that night to pick up the boys and their equipment to bring them back home.  Our son and two other band members were going to ride home in my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, the other driver headed back home ahead of us as we had several musical instruments, amplifiers and speakers to load into my vehicle.  Shortly after leaving the area, we were back on the main highway, with mostly farmland between Rockford and Freeport.  There was very little traffic at that time and after driving for almost 15-20 minutes, I noticed in the rear view mirror, an extremely bright light coming up behind us on the highway.  I mentioned that to the boys and then stated that it was probably a motorcycle and I wished he would turn off his bright light and flip the dimmer switch. The blinding light continued to remain behind the car for several additional minutes and I couldn&#39;t believe the incredible brightness coming from this one single light.  Within a few moments, the light disappeared and I assumed the &#34;rider&#34; had turned off or stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, in the next couple of minutes, the quietness within the car was broken when one of the boys sitting in the back seat literally shouted &#34;Look outside, next to the road!&#34;  The brilliant round light was now moving parallel to the car, alongside the road on the passenger side, actually following the contour and swales on the ground.  I couldn&#39;t judge how close it was to the car, but I imagined about 20-30 yards from the highway.  It was an amazing sight and our &#34;parallel&#34; visitor continued on for at least three or four minutes, staying alongside our car at a speed of about 60 miles per hour.   The next thing to happen was even more unbelievable as the brilliant round object slowly tipped sideways and then accelerated at an incredible speed into the darkness and disappeared.  The boys were really shaken up by this wild incident and I thought I should stop at the Illinois State Police Headquarters a few miles down the road, but they wanted to get straight home.  The UFO story was never reported, but there are four of us &#34;earthlings&#34; that will never forget that summer night and the encounter with a truly unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish a Camcorder was available at that time as it would have been more than newsworthy to quite a few individuals, maiinly the United States Air Force.  (The typical skeptical answer of &#34;It had to be a weather balloon&#34; will definitely not be accepted by this adult and his three witnessess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My summer vacation was spent working on a farm. At 3 p.m., on a Saturday afternoon, while waiting on a township road to be picked up by my mom and dad (15 y.o.a.) for ride home for the weekend, I heard a very strange sound, somewhat akin to the sonar on a submarine.   I looked around the area and to my amazement observed a gray disk about the size of a hood on a car basket weaving between the high voltage power lines that were located by the road.  On seeing the object I became fightened and wasn&#39;t sure what to do.  I then put my head down on the mail box and closed my eyes.  I heard a sharp distinctive sound, differant from the first.  I raised my head and looked up to its original position and then scanned the area of the farm and saw it again.  It was directly over the apex of the farm house&#39;s roof.  On looking at it again, it appeared to be spinning on an axis of some type, wobbling slightly as it turned.  As I observed it, it took off in only what I could describe as an arc at a high rate of speed unlike anything I have ever saw.  Then after it was gone from my sight there was a loud snap as if a gigantic rubberband and been stretched until it broke.<n>
7/20/68 14:00|Cleveland Heights|OH|Oval|1 minute|UFO object seen over Cleveland Heights Ohio during the sixties.|3/23/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35663.html|7|ndxe196807| UFO object seen over Cleveland Heights Ohio during the sixties.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother &amp; I were both teenagers at the time and were throwing each other &#34;high fly&#34; balls in the backyard.  So we were both looking up when an oval, silver disk flew across the sky from east to west and stopped almost directly overhead.  It did not make any sound.  It remained stationary for around 30 seconds.  The day was bright and sunny and there was only one little cumulus cloud in the sky.  My brother and I stopped playing catch and remarked to each other about the object.  We couldn&#39;t believe it stopped in midair.  It was about the height that small planes normally fly at-(pretty low).  It was the size of a medium sized aircraft.  After about 30 seconds it suddenly shot north at a high rate of speed.-(perpendicular to its former direction). We ran into the house and I called The Cleveland Press newspaper to report it.  The person who answered the phone said that so far no one else had reported seeing that object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing is that a couple weeks later that same summer I saw another strange object in the sky.  This time however it was a more conventional type aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a regular sized jet aircraft that did not have a body. (A flying wing) One of the wings was on fire.  It looked like it was going to crash. I also reported this object to the Cleveland newspaper.  The next day in the paper they reported that an experimental air-force jet had crash landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on the fact that both of these clying objects were seen so close together that summer, I have always considered that the first object was also some kind of experimental craft.  However, the first one did fit the sterotype image of a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, my brother &amp; I never talked about the object until a few years ago at a formal dinner.  He asked me if I remembered that UFO-type strange object that we saw together when we were teenagers.  How could I forget?  We just never told anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ps - I had to put a date on the sighting but to be honest I really don&#39;t remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it was in the middle of a bright summer day when I was a teenager. (13-15 yrs old).  But that&#39;s about it.  I could ask my brother if he remembers.  Also I thought we could look up records of experimaental aircraft crash landing.  It was the same summer.  By the way there were no other aircraft in the vincinity at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother&#39;s name is ((name deleted)).  He is a professor at ((name deleted)) University.  I doubt if he wants to talk about the incident.  Like I said we didn&#39;t even mention it again for 30 years to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will encourage the witness to explore newspapers to try to find the article.  If any reader of this report knows the date of the crash, please contact us.  PD))<n>

For many years my mother and grandmother have kept this story a secret, mostly so that it wouldn&#39;t scare us until we were old enough to understand.  The fear in my mothers face when my grandmother tells the story is real and I am convinced that the story is sincere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandmother lived in a house close at the border of a large field that turned into a lightly wooded forest that became a large blueberry bog.  The field was used in part to grow crops and for their livestock to graze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night in July my grandmother was getting the house hold ready for bed when the pigs that lived in a pen adjecent to the house began to screetch she looked up and saw a large, fire like green light just before the treeline and the field through the dining room window.  She says it was very large, 80 feet or more long and nearly as tall as the trees and just incredibly bright, illuminating all the trees and out buildings.  She says it was bright florescent green and was oval shaped but didn&#39;t look like a solid structure and it just seemed to appear there silently.  Though startled by it she calmly walked up stairs to my mothers bed room, who at the time was 16.  She woke my mother and said &amp;quot;Linda, you need to come and see this&amp;quot;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and my grandmother walked down the stairs and they both witnessed the object together for several minutes when suddenly it accelerated into the night sky vertically at an amazing rate and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a significant bog where they lived, and when asked about the sighting being swap gas my grandmother explains that she has seen swamp gas having grown up there and this was most certainly not.  What is almost more compelling is that she contacted a local airport / national guard post the next morning.  Who told her they did have an unknown blip on their radar screen the same time she and my mother saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Grass at edge of the treeline and field was discolored and &amp;quot;crushed&amp;quot;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have heard this story over the past 5 years or so and it is always the same and continues to make my mother very uncomfortable and often renders her speechless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is interesting and perhaps disturbing is that I and my brother have had similar experiences before ever knowing this story of our family history.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what to make of it.<n>

I am now a retired police sergeant. We heard a faint hum then out of a dense woods across the road. At tree level we saw an elongated triangular shaped craft. It was just above the tree lines and was moving South to North.  Dad and I watched as the craft, now silently glided directly over our yard and ourselves. The craft was so low that it brushed the top of an old apple tree in the backyard.The tree was probably a story and a half high.I will always recall looking up at the bottom of the craft. It looked like I was looking at the underside of the a nearby railroad bridge (girders, supports.)There also appeared to be a large square in the center of the craft. I am unsure if the square was a door(opned or closed) or a structure. The craft rose rapidly as it glided northbound then zipped outa sight to our east. The apple tree&#39;s leaves turned brown and curled up, like live brush exposed to a fire. The tree&#39;s interior subsequently dry rotted, the tree died and Dad had to cut it down. Dad and I discussed this event until his death August 2001.

We observed the phenomnon for twenty minutes the left the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This encountered occurred about thirty years ago.  However it left an impact on the both of us to be not forgotton.  I and my friend were playing in a Large field in Rosemead Ca.  It was a place we went frequently to play and as we were riding our bikes to &#34;our fort&#34; we had built in the field. The time was in the morning around 0700.  As we were riding our bikes we both noticed something &#34;hovering&#34; in the field before us.  The distance I can approximate to about 500 yards away from us at a 15 degree angle from horizon.  The size of the object was approximate three inches (as I would see it from my view).  The object was cigar in shape with red lights around the length of the Object.  It appeared to rotate on the longer axis, slowly. Both my friend and my self looked at each other to confirm what we were looking at.  We both agreed to what we saw was the same.  We continued to watch the object for the next 15 minutes(5 minutes or so had transpired).  We noticed that the object made no noise that we could hear (at that distance).  It continue to rotate and hovered there.  We then both looked at each other and again reaffirmed what we saw and be came shakened, left in a hurried mannner to our perspective homes.  My mother noticed I was visable shakened and scared.  I told her what had happened to us.  She preceded to call my friend&#39;s mom to confirmed my story.  My friend&#39;s mother told her that he (my friend) had reported the same to her. Both parents dismissed the occurance. Since then, I have spoken to my friend after the occurance (twenty years later) He still affirms the events of that fateful day.  To this day It has bothered me and will always remember.  By coincidence,  Years later,  Southern California Edison has built there corporate office over the very site. Thank you for reading this persons account of a event he will not soon forget.<n>

Sleeping outside in the backyard, it was warm and clear. We were laying on sides talking and did not notice the object until we decided to go in house and get a snack, which required climbing stairs. When tilting my head back, I saw it. Round with neon like light, Green in the center and a orange ring of light on the outer edge.  Very intense.  Could not see any structure such as doors or windows etc. As far as size, hard to say against a night sky, but if Space Needle is about 600 feet high,this may have been 800 feet and about 50 feet in diameter. It made no sound and was perfectly still. It disappeared in an instant. Minutes later a Navy fighter which was flying so low and slow I could read stuff on the bottom of the wings. The plane was headed south east. May have come from Whidby island navel station. This happened in the Greenwood area in north Seattle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

I struggled for years as to whether this was an actual event or just some sort of hallucination...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The year was 1968, I was playing guitar and traveling the country with a band in a small VW van.  We criscrossed the USA playing music, groovin&#39; with the groupies and partaking of the various indigenous plant life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in Arizona playing at a local club just outside of Phoenix, can&#39;t recall the name of the place, but it was a stone cold groove that night!   After the gig around 2 or 3 AM we were hanging out in the van having some &#39;sandwiches&#39; when one of the guys noticed a bright light in the distance.  We all thought it was the cops cause it was so bright, like a search light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being ever suspicious of the &#39;man&#39; back then, we stowed our &#39;sandwiches&#39; and waited.  Well it didn&#39;t take long before we realized it was not a cop car search light.  But something we could not explain. At first I thought maybe it was the &#39;sandwiches&#39; but I wasn&#39;t the only one that saw this thing.  Some of us started giggling uncontrollably, I wet myself, and our sound guy fainted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next thing I know I am in a room laying on a table looking up at some very bight lights.  Not cool... I was freakin&#39; out.  Then things started to get weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two skinny pale dudes, with big eyes.  I can&#39;t talk about what all they did, I think I blocked it out to keep my sanity.  However I had the a sour stomach for a couple of weeks afterwards, difficulty urinating.  Kind of a cruel preview of how things are for me at age 60.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember being returned to the van, but we all woke up in the van naked, which in itself was quite traumatic.  Several hours had passed, but none of us could clearly recall what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of use ever talked about what happened that night, it was too weird and strange, even for the 60&#39;s, and that is saying something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this all sounds crazy, but it REALLY DID happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What can I do to get some help?  I still have night terrors, flash backs and more from this incident.

TV picture went to snow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived on ((Deleted)) Ave. in Norwich, Connecticut  in 1968. I shared a 3rd floor apartment with ((Name deleted)), his wife ((Name deleted)), and their son ((Deleted)). On a hot summer Friday evening in July, we were sitting watching Johnny Carson having put ((Deleted)) to bed at 10 pm. It was very hot so we had all the windows open. The bedroom window had no screen and led to a fire escape. The TV started to go to a snow.  We heard ((Deleted)) crying around 11:45 and ((Deleted)) went white. I saw a glimpse of someone in the room and jumped up to see who it was. ((Deleted)) and I Got to the bedroom door in time to see someone go out the window. When we got to the window, the thing had flown away and was about 150-200 feet up and several hundred feet south of us. It was going toward an object in the sky that was ruby red in color. In seconds the thing was a silver dot and it merged with the object along with 3 or 4 other dots. The object then  rose to 1000 ft. and went southwest at high speed. The thing was about 4 feet tall with large eyes and fang-like teeth. The arms were disproportioinately long, like a chimpanzee&#39;s arms. He had a silvery colored suit and his feet didn&#39;t appear to touch the ground. He rather floated across the room and out the open window. I am not exactly sure about the date but I am definite about the time. The details of the encounter are still rather vivid in my mind as the experience we shared was very traumatic. ((Deleted)) was from Longview, TX and ((Deleted)) was from Kilgore, TX.  I haven&#39;t seen either of them (or ((Deleted))) since 1970 when he was discharged from the Navy and moved back to Texas.<n>

Late one evening, my father was listening to the Arkasas Traveler&#39;s baseball game on a local AM station.  At one point during the game the station broadcast that numerious people were calling in and reporting that a UFO could be seen in the night sky over North Little Rock. Upon hearing this, my father, mother, and one or more of my siblings went outside to observe. On that paticular evening, I was camping out with a friend in his backyard. His house was about a block down the street from my parents house. Not really expecting or looking for anything unusual my friend and I observed an object to the east traveling north.  It moved silently across the sky and and several amber lights that traveled in a circular motion around the exterior of the object as if it were rotating. We were in our early teens and did not really think too much about what we had seen. When I arrived at home the following day, my parents told me what had happened the previous evening and about the radio broadcast.  They too had observed the same object my friend and I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition there was an article in the Arkansas Democrat the next day stating that jet aircraft at the Little Rock Air Force base had been scrambled but was unsuccessful in their pursuit of the object.  If anyone else has knowledge of this event and can relate the specific year and day I would appreciate it as I would like to find the article in the Ark Democrat archives.  In addition to this event there was another similar event that occurred in Jacksonville Arkansas in the late 60s where jets from the Little Rock AFB were scrambled to chase an object. This event was also documented in the Arkansas Democrat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date is approximate.  We will invite the witness to obtain the exact date from the newspaper.  PD))<n>

The voice I heard in the Control Tower identified himself as a USMC Captain, the Duty Officer. He said there were four or five other observors in the tower with him. At one later point the object departed (tracked by Washington FAA Center) and proceeded down the Potomac River (north bound), climbed to an alt of approx 1000&#39; AGL and speed of about 100 kts. It was tracked by the Center to a position directly over the White House where observers saw it turn upward at a high angle of attack and flash out of sight. The object was later reported (according to Washington Center) by a NW airlines B-727 at FL330 NE of WashDC enroute NYC. It tracked the airliner for a few seconds then turned and flashed out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I listened impatiently as the oldest stuttered out that there was something HUGE up in the sky blocking the stars and it was a triangle and it wasn&#39;t high up but it wasn&#39;t low either and there were stars all around it and it WASN&#39;T MAKING ANY NOISE and ended with, &#34;we&#39;re scaaared!&#34;.  (I&#39;m not sure if I remember he noticed lights or not).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I laughed and said I would check it out and they pleaded with me not to, but I told them mom and dad wouldn&#39;t believe us unless I saw it, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked outside and up and it was exactly as he said.  A big black triangular void with no noise and no movement and no emissions, yet stars all around it.  I also noticed a complete absence of bugs, birds or pets making any noise and that&#39;s when I really creeped out and fear overcame my curiosity and I backed into the house slowly, keeping my eye on the unknown object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed like it was no more than a couple of hundred feet up which would mean I should be able to hear something!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents thought we made it all up of course and suggested it might be a weather balloon or experimental aircraft from Bush Field Airport or Fort Gordon Military Base.  I never believed that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the stealth bomber years later it reminded me of it, although this had what appeared to be equal angles (equilateral) but again, there was no noise, no movement, and no emissions.  Just a big black triangular void that was definitely a solid object silently hanging in the air.  I don&#39;t remember seeing lights, but my brothers might, I&#39;m going to ask them when I get a chance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was the summer of 1968 in the middle of the day, bright sunshine and very hot and humid as Houston is known to be, we lived on Telephone Rd.  I remember waking up in my bed and thinking “why am I taking a nap?”  I get up and go to my parents’ room, they are both asleep on the bed, sun is coming in through the windows, and I can not wake them up.  I go out the front door and proceed down the driveway, it is deathly quiet, no birds, no cars, no planes, nothing is moving anywhere.  As I get almost to the end of our driveway I hear an unusual humming noise.  I see a disk shaped object floating over the roof of our neighbors house, it is, I would approximate, 6 feet in diameter and is big enough for 1 occupant, it has a glass dome and is a brushed silver color.  There is a humanoid in the UFO; he appears to be driving it with a “joy stick”. He is a dark greenish gray color and I remember thinking &#34;was that his skin or a body suit?&#34;, he also has on goggle type glasses very round and thick. I am frozen at the end of our driveway, terrified.  He does not see me at first.  He progresses over the neighbors’ yard and crosses our street.  Suddenly “he” jerks his head around to the left and looks directly at me.  I become paralyzed and fall off the driveway into the little ditch that boarders the road.  I can still see but cannot move.  The next thing I remember is waking back up in my bed.  The little TV in my room is on and has only “snow” on the screen.  I scream “they are in the TV, they are in the TV!” I grab the electric cord to the television and pull it out of the socket and keep pulling until the TV falls off the dresser and breaks, much to my relief.  This wakes my father from his “Sleep” and he comes in and spanks me for breaking the TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We had stopped at a rest area on the interstate just before sunset. Vega, TX. is the nearest town, according to the Rand McNally Road Atlas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was sunset (approx. 20:30 hrs) and the sky was orange in front of us (westbound). and stars were already visible to the east and most of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our vehichle was a 3/4 ton Ford Ranger pickup truck, with a medium-sized camper shell on the back. My dad was in the camper cleaning up a little and changing clothes, as we had planned on finding a restaurant to get a bite to eat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside of the truck, throwing rocks and such as a nine-year-old would do at a rest area in the middle of the Texas panhandle. A pickup truck with a full-sized over-the-cab camper on the back was parked directly behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon hearing the screaming of children&#39;s voices, I looked toward the camper. I distinctly remember a girl&#39;s and a boy&#39;s voice seperately telling their parents that a flying saucer is across the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, instead of looking across the road, I was compelled to look at the big camper behind us in which the screaming kids were in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned to look at the camper of the frightened children, I saw the parents both closing shades and turning off lights in the pickup camper. The mother said very loudly to be quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that the campers behind us were all quiet and &#34;blacked out&#34;, I felt a heaviness come over me. Fear as I have never known before (or ever want to know again) came over me. I was frozen in place as I looked across the roadway and saw a disc-shaped object with counter-clockwise &#34;flowing&#34; lights rotating about the top of it. It was in a descent that caused it to come to a &#34;floating&#34; landing behind a small range of rocky hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not being able to move, I called for my father by saying, &#34;Daddy! Daddy!&#34; I wanted to yell, but was unable to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When he heard me, he looked out of the camper and as I could not move, he noticed me looking across the highway. He then saw what had caused me to be petrified and jumped out of the back of the truck without his shoes on. He grabbed me and put me in the passenger seat of the cab and we drove off in a hurry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning we were at a pancake house in Santa Fe, NM. and we heard several people talking about the incident. Dad and I remained silent and listless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No conversation of this was brought up between us regarding this until just a few years ago. My dad remembers it as clearly and vividly as I do. That is why I needed to share this with the rest of the &#34;Encounter&#34; community...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whether it is indeed not-of-this-world or a secret gov&#39;t aircraft, the fact remains that my father and my lives have been changed forever in a way that really cannot be explained. Our minds have surely been opened, and that is a good thing!<n>

We had all gone for a walk, probably around 9pm.  We were living in the foothills of Santa Barbara - Montecito to be exact.  There were no street lights, thus it was very dark.  I believe it was I that said, &#34;What are those lights over there?&#34;  What we observed were maybe five or six rounded lights that were just hovering in the night sky, not high up, not flying around, but moving slightly, ,..not fast, just twinkling in the sky very near us.  Similar to a helicopter when trying to hover over an object.  They moved, but not much.  My father immediately said, &#34;Oh, those are weather balloons!&#34;  I thought he was nuts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember the lights having a whitish hew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed them for maybe five minutes and then just walked back to the house.  Not a word mentioned ever again, except by me over the years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved out of the house the following week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Under hypnosis many years later, I returned to that night, and quickly realized that I had been abducted later that night.  In all of my hypnosis sessions (3) I return to that incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It would be on the far east side then in a flash would be over the far west side or north of us. It finaly hovered directly over our vehicle for a time.  I was driving and could not really look at it, but the rest of the people in my car were hanging out the windows.  I suddenly realized I was only going about 30-35 miles an hour and was worried about getting run down until I noticed every other car was doing the same because they were looking at this craft, too. This was a Friday night....all of us took such a ribbing over the week= end from family, etc., I decided not to tell anyone else about what we had seen.  When I arrived at work on Monday at Federated Dept. Stores Area Research Dept. in downtown Cincinnati, a co-worker, Karen, came in a said &#34;Guess what we saw out at Tri-County Drive-In Friday night?&#34; Well, the conversation went on from there. She told us they had even shut the drive-in down to watch the craft!  (By the way, there was a game playing at Crosley Field that night.) The craft looked like a saucer, the windows were rectangular with rounded corners and located around the perimeter.  The light was a &#34;strange&#34; color, sort of a blue-ish white, and we could see silhouettes in some of the &#34;windows&#34;. I know this sounds a little crazy, my husband still asks me what we were drinking that night at the baby shower we had been to! (The answer is NOTHING) But we all know what we saw. The craft made no sound at all.....totaly silent as it moved. What I really would like to know is this, are there any other reports concerning this particular sighting?  If so, what are they?  Could I have access to this information?<n>

I looked to see if someone threw them but no one around and the speed and flat trajectory inconsistent with a throw. I don&#39;t remenber how they disappeared and years later when we discussed what we saw, my version varied I only saw objects moving slow my brother said he saw them curving out of sky and moving fast untill they were on flat trajectory parallel with phone line. My brother has since passed on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The first one is at dusk in the sky I saw 3 oval saucer shaped UFOs that appreared to be of a shimmering light almost like they were not quite solid is the only way I can describe them. They were over the woods nearby and if they were 20 feet in diameter they would have been approx  one half mile away. They moved forward and backward and zig-zagged back and forth. I heard no sound. I ran away  from the scene. The same month I saw a number of smcall red lights in the sky at night which lasted for hours and I heard neighbors commenting on them. They didn&#39;t appear to move much but would disappear then appear. There were over 20 or 30 of them more on the horizon of the sky than overhead. Within days of the above I saw an extremely bright starlike light directly overhead in the evening again. It appaeared to look like a shimmering star but was as big as the sun in the sky. Slowly over a period of maybe an hour it shrinked to the size of a small white light. I thought of getting my Bebe gun and shooting at it as it seemed only a few hundred feet up ( I was 16)  but my good sense prevailed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to locate other observers for corroboration.  PD))<n>

It was summer and just about dusk when we noticed a bright blue light in the sky, just hovering above us.  There was no sound and it didn&#39;t appear to be moving.  We just stood there looking at it wondering what it was and then all of a sudden it just disappeared.  I was so scared that I just ran home and left my friend standing there in the field alone.  When I got home my mother told me that the lights had gone out for an instant and there was no reception on the T.V.  To this day my friend reminds me of how I left her standing alone in the field.  There were reports that it had landed on the mountain and the government had roped off the area.  There were all kinds of military trucks coming in and out of that area.<n>

We were board surfing in the irrigated lawn of the property. We noticed something high in the the sky it looked like a formation of aircraft in a triangle. The objects appeared to shine from the late evening evening sun. We didn&#39;t think to much of the sighting until the objects started hovering then moving in a zig zag formation and appeared to be travelling faster than any aircraft we ever saw before. Just before the objects moved they were there and then gone in a flash. It has been almost 35 years since I seen this and it has always stuck in my memory what the hell was that!!   I have not seen anything like it again and I am still watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We saw a second shooting star that came from the left and stopped right next to the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the second one stayed in position and the first one moved about 45 degrees and out towards space and met with a third shooting star that also just stopped in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the third one went and stopped next to the second one and the first one headed into deepspace in a direction of about 1:00.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second one went back in the direction it came from and the third one went in the direction that the first one came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first two disappeared quickly but we were able to watch the third as it disappeared into the stars getting smaller and smaller until we could not see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Sonora California,  several years ago I was coming across the mountain pass at 2:00 am.  There was no moon out that I remember it was very dark.  All of a sudden everything around was lit up with a green light it was pretty weird.  My two daughters were with me.<n>
