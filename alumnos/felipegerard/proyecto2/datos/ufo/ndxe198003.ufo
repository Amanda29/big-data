I believe it was early 1980. I was 12 years old at the time. My mother, grandmother, brother and myself were going to go shopping at Zody&#39;s in the Canoga Park area of CA. Zody&#39;s is no longer around but the location at that time was at the corner of Topanga Canyon Blvd and Roscoe Blvd. The sun was setting so it was still fairly light but getting dark quickly. After we parked and were heading to the entrance of Zody&#39;s, my brother and I were lagging behind my mother and grandmother. I then realized that my brother was not beside me and so I thought he stopped to tie his shoe so I stopped and turned around and that is when I saw the lights flashing. My brother was looking at it too. The craft was a disk shape, appeared to be made of metal and had white lights around the perimeter that flashed in sequence and gave it the illusion that it was spinning but it was close enough and still light enough outside to see the underside of the craft and I could tell that it was not spinning. It hovered completely still and made no noise at all. I watched it for about 10 seconds and then realized that mom and grandma may have already gone in the store and I didn&#39;t want them to miss out on seeing this. I turned and looked towards the entrance to the store and saw that mom and grandma were also watching the craft as were a bunch of people who were either on their way into the store or had just come out. I don&#39;t know the size of the craft because I don&#39;t know how close it was and I don&#39;t know the altitude because I don&#39;t know it&#39;s size. From my perspective it was the size of a dinner plate held at arms length. After watching the craft for about a minute it suddenly began to move to the right without changing altitude. Then it slowed to a stop and just as it came to a stop it suddenly shot straight up and was gone in only about 2-3 seconds. The entire experience lasted approximately one minute. By the time it took off it was dark enough to see the stars. We stayed there and watc! hed the sky for a little while thinking it might come back but it didn&#39;t, at least not while we were out there. My family acted different after that. They were more quiet than usual and I kept wanting to talk about it and I&#39;d say, &#34;Wasn&#39;t that strange? What was it that we saw?&#34; but nobody said anything. It seemed like we should have had more time to shop but it didn’t feel like we were in the store very long when they were announcing they were closing and that we’d have to bring our purchases to the front. I don’t know if this was an indication of missing time or not. After we did our shopping, on the way home I still couldn&#39;t get anyone to say anything. It was as though my family were in a trans-like state, except me. It wasn&#39;t until we got home and we were getting our purchases out of the back of the car that my mother started saying, &#34;What was that thing we saw? Wasn&#39;t that strange?&#34; There were many witnesses but I don&#39;t know if any of them reported it at that time or since then. We didn&#39;t report it at that time..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were coming out of our neighborhood in my moms car and both noticed somthing at the corner of our eye. We both looked up at the object and noticed its shape and suddenly it took off faster like a reflection a mirror makes on a wall when you move it. It is one of my most rememberable thoughts of that time in my life.<n>
3/20/80 20:00|Paterson|NJ|Disk|one minute|HUGE disk hovering over the city of Paterson in the very early 1980's.|10/17/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32262.html|3|ndxe198003| HUGE disk hovering over the city of Paterson in the very early 1980&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure of the exact date, but it was around 1980-1081. My now husband, then fiance, were sitting in a PARKED/TURNED OFF car at Garrett Mt. New Jersey, which overlooks the city of Paterson. He was sitting in the drivers seat and I was sitting in the passenger seat. We were looking at each other and talking. Suddenly, we noticed a HUGE disk hovering over the city of Paterson! It seemed as huge as the city itself. Underneath the disk there were round lights of red, blue, green and yellow. The lights seemed as though they were rotating. Within several seconds the radio started to flicker on our PARKED/TURNED OFF car. It was a fuzzy, unclear signal. I remember the car sputtering as though the engine was trying to turn over, my husband does not remember that; he only remembers the affect that the craft had on the radio. Then, just as suddenly as it appeared, the disk was simply gone. There were other people parked there that day. The odd thing is that we never got out of the car and nobody got out of their car. We have been searching for someone else who saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/20/80 02:00|Not Sure|NH|Other|15 SECONDS|Multiple Object Sighting.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45318.html|4|ndxe198003| Multiple Object Sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember the incident as if it was yesterday.  But in fact it happened 25 years ago.  This is the first time that I write about it, although I have discussed what I saw at the time to family and friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 24 years old at the time of the sighting and of sound mind and body.  I now discuss what I saw as what I remember and with clear mind, if anyone trys to discredit my story, let it be known that I do not care about anyone else&#39;s opinion, I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working the second shift at a large automotive assembly plant on a Friday night.  I left work to go skiing for the weekend @ 12:30 am, heading for the North Conway ski area of New Hampshire.   At the time of my departure at work there was a bad rain/ice storm pelting the highway all thru my drive up Rt 495 in Massachusetts, then onwards up following Route 3 north.  Because of the bad weather, I was for the most part the only vehicle on the road.  Proceeding northward all the while the weather continued to be stormy and difficult to proceed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once past the state capital of Concord, now traveling on interstate Rt 93 the weather stopped raining/freezing raining.  The cloud cover was billowy but close to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden I saw what looked like an unusual light coming towards me in the sky, below the very low cloud cover directly over the highway.  As this strange light got closer, I began to stop my car, Due to the storm and late time, I was alone on the road.  The light came closer.  Suddenly, over my car what first appeared as a light turned into a multiple sighting.  I counted perhaps 8, maybe 10 objects that were a green neon in color, shaped like what my high school science books used to describe what a while blood corpuscle looks like, only in a glowing neon green. One after another these objects flew over my car in total silence, following the highway, but only up maybe 100 feet in the sky. As they passed over these objects were moving at a resounding speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As these objects passed, they all were following one after the other, except for 3 at the end. These three were to one side of the rest.  Looking in my mirror they continued onward and disappeared into the low cloud cover. I distinctly remember seeing the green glow in the clouds behind me as these objects disappeared into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although it has been a long time that I saw this the image and experience is still fresh in my mind. This is the first time that I document my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was 20' from craft, the engines star|8/30/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08826.html|5|ndxe198003| A 12&#39; circular light was on the bottom of the craft. It was hovering silently over my farm pond. I was 20&#39; from craft, the engines started up with an intense wind coming from craft--about 100 MPH wind.  Pinned me against my pickup truck, as it shot straight up faster than a rifle bullt and disapeared!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I built an underground house, sucluded in a wooded area. A pond laid right beside it. One night as we arrived home around midnight, I was crossing the pond levee(which was my driveway) Immediatley the pond and hillsides were light up like the middle of the afternoon.  Then I stopped the truck and got out looked above the pond about 10&#39; and witnessed a 12&#39; circular light on the bottom of some sort of craft.  There was no noise heard, I then yelled at them to come on down and they&#39;d be safe. The craft stayed until my pregnant wife with my young son ran for the house. When my wife disapeared around the house, the crafts engine started and almost blew me down.  The wind was at least 100 MPH. It shot straight up until it was out of sight, faster than a rifle bullet! I believe that the craft seemed to be taking up water into it. Shortly after this incident my infant daughter was born and developed an virus that needed medical attention, and the doctor ask my wife if she had been to South America.  Because there was no cases of that type of illness in the U.S. We believe the craft may of had something to do with this illness.  The next day from viewing the craft there was a 12&#39;  diameter circle mashed into the weeds where it must of landed. That was my first and last sighting, it has changed my way of thinking forever. It was definetly something from another planet, with way more technology then we have today.<n>

The kids flew their kites and many adults also flew kites and we had a nice picnic.  They were giving prizes for the best kite, the highest flying one, etc.  They even had a hot air baloon for the kids.  Anyway, about 5 pm, the announcer told the crowd that one of the kites was caught in a &#34;thermal&#34;, a hot air convection and was about 800 ft and going up.  So, everyone is looking up and I was eating.  I stopped, looked up and saw some white bugs in front of my eyes, or so I thought!  I refocused and suddenly realized that I was focusing on some silver dots flying about 30,000 ft up.  They were going from east to west directly into the soon to be setting sunlight. I think the sun set at about 6 or so.  Anyway, 2 of the disks suddenly moved quite a bit ahead of the others, which seemed to be swarming.  They then were lost in the sun.  My friend came from the other side of the park, about a mile away and asked, &#34;did you see those things flying up there?&#34;  He said all the people were really excited about seeing something, but it happened so fast that you didn&#39;t realize what you were seeing until you actually thought about it a bit.  They looked EXACTLY like the old movie of the UFOS in Montana in the late forties.  Silver dots and I would say they covered half the sky in 10 seconds.<n>
3/15/80 02:00|Concord (north of)|NH|Other|10 seconds|Multiple Neon Green Objects Flying In Formation|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70640.html|7|ndxe198003| Multiple Neon Green Objects Flying In Formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back in the winter of 1980, I had been spending  my weekends skiing in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.  I had been traveling every weekend to the North country throughout the winter, always in the early hours of Saturday morning as I had a second shift engineering job and I would not leave my Massachusetts workplace until 12:30 am.  So, the times of my being northbound on US Route 93 was 2:00 am onward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the early March Saturday morning in question,  there had been a terrible rain and snow storm.  This storm was typical of the type of late winter storm that occurs in New England.  Because of the weather conditions and the time of night, there were no vehicles traveling, or if they were, vehicles were few and far between.  As I proceeded North conditions remained treacherous.  I had just passed  the city of Concord NH on US Route 93 when the stormy weather suddenly stopped and driving conditions were back to normal.  No slush on the highway, no freezing rain or snow falling.  It was just me and the highway with a smattering of vehicles moving normally in both north and south directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, ahead of me, I saw a strange glow moving south heading towards and directly ahead of me.  This glow was below the very low cloud cover.  I remember I was watching the sky anyways as the storm had just stopped and the driving conditions had returned to normal. This glow was moving very quickly, like a blink of an eye.  Then, the low flying glow became this neon green light.  My view to the sky was keen as the car I owned then had a very large windshield that came up to almost my driving position and provided me with a panoramic view of the sky.  As the green glow quickly came to me, I suddenly saw a large number of what I would describe as objects in the shape of white corpuscles, only neon green.  There were, as best that I can remember, about a dozen of these objects all flying in formation, one after the other passing directly overhead of me.  The last three were abit a skewed to one side but still in formation, one after the other.  I saw these objects fly in total silence over my car moving just under the low cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first reaction was to quickly stop my car.  I turned around and saw these objects continue on their southerly direction following the ribbon of highway and disappear into the low cloud cover.  The clouds reflected the green glow. Then they were gone as quickly as they had appeared. I remember thanking God for allowing me to see something that I could truly not explain. I also saw just a very small handful of cars stopped on the north and southbound side of the highway as I was.  I regret not jumping out to talk to these drivers about what we had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember this experience as though it had happened yesterday, the vision still fresh in my mind.  I don’t tell people about it as they would not be able to comprehend it.  I have a BSc degree from Dalhousie University on Halifax N.S.  My career has been in Engineering and up until last year I was a Unix Analyst for ten years with a major American investment company.  I swear that this statement is true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was difficult to guage the distance and the light was not flashing so I immediately pulled over to see what it was since it was moving fairly slowly.  As I pulled over and opened my window I stuck my head out to see the light immediately accelerate at an incredible rate over my vehicle and continue (possibly) following the path of the road.  During the initial part  of the siting we watched the light for perhaps 15-20 seconds.  After the light accelerated I jumped out to see where it was going and it was gone from sight in only a few seconds. It was a quiet night and we did not hear any sounds from the object whatsoever.  Less than a minute later a police officer pulled over and questioned us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were all in shock that by the time our eyes could focus correctly it was gone as quick as it showed up.The disk was very big and it had multi colored lights spinning on the bottom of it and it had many small windows around the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I lived in Bisbee Arizona for about twenty years, moving to Erie in 1992. In looking for accounts of an extended sighting of an aerial object in Bisbee in, I believe, 1980, I came across ((name deleted)) account on your site of another set of sightings I am not very familiar with. I do know ((name deleted)), consider him a reliable witness and he is one of the many witnesses to the 1980 affair. This was reported, years later, 30 Nov 95, in a Bisbee newspaper in an article by their staff reporter. None of the published accounts were even remotely like what I saw and carefully noted in my mind. Doing further research and field work, I found that this reporter was known to be inaccurate- to be kind about it, and even prone to gross sensationalism, this being the likely cause of the bizarre accounts published. No intended reflection on the publisher. I didn&#39;t think to remember the date of this incident but memory serves perhaps well enough. It was not hot, just comfortable, breezy and my recall of the nature of the lighting and timing and bearing of the sunset would all together lead me to estimate the time to be late winter, early spring. The news account gives the year as 1981 but I think it had to be 1980 from my own reckoning. I don&#39;t know how to contact ((name deleted)) to verify his account in the newspaper article. I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t give you folks there at Citizens Against UFO Secrecy an account of the 1980 spectacle. It was truly stunning.  ((name deleted) was quite a ways further away from it but still had a good view. I and another fella, ((name #2 deleted)), stood nearly under it for quite some time. I cautiously state that we did so for 10 minutes (no watch) though it was likely quite a bit longer. ((name #2)) and I (my first name is ((name #2 deleted)) too) were Bisbee&#39;s two leading mechanical shop owners and good observers of physical/energy realities. I had worked previously as a telemetry collector/analyst in the ASA for the NSA and so was! quite familiar with spacecraft and their capabilities, even being able to make the dubiously embarrassing claim of being a rocket scientist! This event occurred at about 6pm at ((name of fuel station deleted)) station on the Bisbee traffic circle. The object was nearly directly overhead, stationary, clearly visible!! ((name #1 deleted))  was about a mile and a half away, in South Bisbee, I seem to recall him saying that when he came upon us after the object left. We were about 150-200 yards from the Lavender Pit copper mine. I arrived from Douglas Arizona as ((name #2 deleted)) was closing his station, which he customarily did at 6pm. He and I stood for a few minutes talking, each with one foot up on the front bumper of my white 53 Chev panel truck on the station parking lot in the waning sun. I then had an odd feeling, looked about, then almost straight up and was shocked to see an object had appeared and was absolutely still above us. It was over the back of the Chevron property, overlapping onto an area called the Shady Dell. The sun was just disappearing down behind the Phelps Dodge mine track embankment, as seen from where we were standing. The object itself was in full sunlight, being higher up. My hand, at arms length, would not cover it up. There was a slight breeze. ((name #2 deleted)) then looked up to see what had me agape and was himself riveted to the sight. I finally looked over at ((name #2 deleted)) and asked him, &#34;Do you see what I see?!&#34;. ((Name #2 deleted)) said &#34;I sure do!&#34; We then looked it over keenly, both of us comparing notes of our observations. We were in agreement about what we were looking at. I&#39;m sure we both had thoughts run through our minds about whether we should leave the area immediately. We didn&#39;t feel threatened at all. It was just so extraordinarily strange to be in near company with such a thing. We had no idea what was going to happen and waited with bated breath. I, at one point, cast about looking for a stone to throw up at it to try and get a clearer sense of its height above us, and it&#39;s size. Then decided my action might seem unfriendly (stone! age savages it would appear) and for that matter the stone might come down and cause some property damage. Or some antimatter reaction. I abandoned the idea. It was a fair sized object. I thought that perhaps a low humming I was hearing might be coming from the object. We talked it over and finally decided that the slight noise was 60hz hum coming from the nearby overhead electrical wires. We had a kind of feeling about the object&#39;s presence that I can&#39;t quite describe, sort of as though there were some being up there observing and aware of us. The fact is though, we never saw any sign of such a sentient being. Just the handiwork and actions thereof. We noted that many of the cars coming around the traffic circle were slowing down, somewhat dangerously, then most accelerating vigorously on through the mine track underpass, itself nearly under the edge of the object. The cars could then be heard accelerating hard away from it onto the pit circumference highway up to Old Bisbee. Nobody stopped although they could be seen leaning down and forward briefly trying to get a better look. I think a lot of those people wished they hadn&#39;t seen it, my judging their reactions as they exited the area. I remember pinching myself and slapping myself, almost jokingly, to make sure I wasn&#39;t dreaming. In fairness, I should now describe the object though there is little to be said even though it was likely within a stones throw of us. It was an oblate spheroid. In more common terms, it was like a flattened or squashed sphere. From the top or bottom it would appear to be perfectly round or circular. From the side aspect it had kind of a horizontal football shape except the ends weren&#39;t pointed but instead gently rounded. It appeared to have curvilinear symmetry above and below the arbitrary ‘belt line’. It did not revolve or move whatsoever in the gently gusting breeze. It appeared to be made of stainless steel or perhaps aluminum or titanium or beryllium with a finely brushed matte finish. The disturbing thing, to a couple! of good physical observers as us two ((name #2 deleted)), was that the thing was absolutely perfect. There were no seams, slight irregularities or distortions, plates, rivets or any other deviations from it&#39;s monolithic perfection. The nearest thing that I can call up from our technologies would be a metallic balloon somehow squashed into the oblate spheroid shape. This would have stress lines and wrinkles though. It could not possibly be perfect, as this was. It would also be bobbling in the breeze. As I stated, this object was rock steady. As well, our observer sense of it was that it was hard bodied. We peered intensely at it for a long time. It was not hard to see at all, the object was nearby in full late afternoon sunlight. Atmospheric conditions, late afternoon, were good, with some slight shadowing on the object on the side away from the sun. There was no significant cloud cover other than a little bit of scuddy, stringy stuff.  We were not in a position to see where the sun angle would have thrown the objects shadow, unfortunately. That would have been an astute observation to make. I also did not attempt to walk directly under it, which would have given us a good lateral distance and from that a better guess at height off the ground and, of course it&#39;s size. We were a little too awed, I think, to put that plan in motion, thinking that something could happen at any moment, though I thought it out at the time as I tried to estimate those parameters. Making this process even more nebulous was the fact that the object had absolutely no features except for it&#39;s shape, color and finish appearance. There were no rivets, as I said, no seams, plates, ports, lights, hatches, vents, doors, windows, antennas, pitot tubes...nada. Featureless. ((name #2 deleted)) and I both discussed this back and forth as we carefully looked it over. Nothing. Nothing by which one might then judge it&#39;s size, distance and nature. It couldn&#39;t have sat up there any stiller than it did. After quite some passage of time, it suddenly did a small maneuver, ! almost comical, like the wobble of a top as it spins down. I would relate this as being a precessional wobble as of the physics of a gyroscope spinning down through it’s structural harmonics and beginning to lose it&#39;s stability. The object wasn&#39;t spinning though, just wobbling. It was over in about three seconds, a couple of wobbles, and was instantly and fluidly moving quite steadily in the direction of the copper pit at about 10-12 miles an hour for the first hundred or so feet, which took it out of our line of sight behind the ridged embankment which carried tracks for the copper operation. It then appeared to us, visible over the tracks, in the direction and going in the direction it had originally disappeared in, approximately a mile away and going fast. It was now proceeding upwards at a steep angle at probably a thousand miles an hour, clearing the mountain containing the Queen Mine next to old Bisbee, and proceeding straight on out of sight at that angle, roughly in the direction of the setting sun. Surprisingly, considering the great speed it was now moving at, it still made absolutely no sound. These movements gave some hint as to the elevation of the object and it&#39;s size though not too reliably so. I would then estimate that it had been stationary over our heads at about 250 feet and was probably 80 to 100 feet in diameter and about 35-40 feet in height or thickness. ((name #2 deleted)) and I were surprisingly tired out by the experience and could conclude little other than what I have related. No little green men. We don&#39;t know what we saw. But we know what we saw. Paradox. It was nothing that our technologies could do then or even now unless it was an extremely realistic hologram projected from a satellite in space, as in Ronald Raygun&#39;s space based missile defense technology projects or something of that nature. I don&#39;t think so. Whatever it was, I don&#39;t think man had any thing to do with it. My memory is a little fuzzy about this but possibly ((name #2 deleted)) wife arrived at which point ((name #3 deleted)), ((name #4 deleted)) and a friend of theirs drove up, greatly excited. I can&#39;t remember the details of what they said they saw but I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t what was reported in the Bisbee news 15 years later. I then left, heading out down the pit highway towards Old Bisbee. I had gotten only through the mine track underpass, through the first S turn and was just straightening out towards Bisbee Blue when I heard a tremendous, shattering roar, echoing wildly about. It kind of scared me, I hunkered down in the seat of my old truck and looked out the window to see the second astonishment of the day. A jet fighter plane on flaming afterburner, flying an extremely risque trajectory from over Warren out over the pit, to my left not a hundred feet above my elevation, going in the same direction and flight path the object had a couple of minutes before. This aircraft actually had to bank hard left to miss Sacramento hill, or what&#39;s left of it on the edge of the pit, then hard right back on track followed immediately by a hard pull up to clear Copper Queen mountain. It following the path the object had, moments previous. Obviously in pursuit. Our government knows about these things. Who is kidding who here. Breathtaking. End of story.<n>
3/1/80 00:30|Oxford|CT|Cigar|2 Minutes|Large Cigar shaped object very close.|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38281.html|14|ndxe198003| Large Cigar shaped object very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my 3rd report on this site. I seem to be one of those people who are fortunate (or maybe unfortunate?) to see these objects. I am not sure of the exact date, but my best guess is around March 1980. At that time I worked 2nd shift at a small shop in New Milford, Ct., but lived in Waterbury, Ct., maybe 30 miles away. I was driving home from work on Interstate 84 around 12:30 A.M.. It was a beautiful night. There was a very bright full moon, and it was perfectly clear. I had just passed though Southbury Ct.. There is a large hill as you come to the exit for Oxford, Ct. From this hill you can see Waterbury in the distance maybe 5-6 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving east, and I was coming down this hill. I looked to my left over the 4 lane highway. Just above the treeline on the other side of the highway I saw what you would first believe to be a blimp. This object was dark against the bright sky and I could see it clearly. It looked to be almost 100 feet long, and 15 feet high. It had no undercarriage of any kind, nor wings, or vertical/horizontal stabilizers as blimps usually have. It was round on each end. It really did not look like a blimp. It was too long and narrow. Most blimps I have ever seen are much fatter than this object was. It was maybe 150 feet to my left, and was flying VERY LOW. It did not look to be more than 30 feet above the trees that lined the highway. So it was maybe 60-75 feet above the ground. This object was going east just like me, but slightly faster. I was probably going 65 MPH, I estimate the object to be travelling at around 80 MPH. The first thing I did was roll down my window to see if I could hear it, but all I could hear was the wind blowing past my car. I left the window down so I could get a good look at it. Fortunately, there was no traffic at all, so I was able to take a pretty good look. What looked extremely strange and shocking about this object is that it had 3 large, perfectly round port-holes on it&#39;s underside. They looked exactly like the port-holes on a ship. They were windows. I could see inside this object. A blue light shined out of each port-hole downward into the trees. All I could see inside this object was blue light, but I am positive I could see into this object. Then, as the object gained on me, I could see another perfectly round port-hole on it&#39;s rear end. I could also see inside this window. But this port-hole was different. A green light shined out of this port-hole and out behind it. I was looking into this port-hole. But all I could see was green light inside the object. None of the lights were difficult to look at. Now, the object was starting to get pretty far ahead of me. Then it did something that amazed me. At the bottom of this long hill the highway curves sharply to the left (north). When this object came to the curve it made a smooth left turn. It was following the highway! That was a very strange thing to see. By now I was getting to the bottom of the hill myself and the object was getting pretty far away. I lost it in the glow coming up from Waterbury. There is one more thing I want to say. I know many people mistake common objects for UFO&#39;s. But I have thought about this object for many years, and do not believe I am mistaken. The ONLY object this remotely resembled would be a blimp. But I am sure it was not for several reasons. 1) It did not look like a blimp. I could see it clearly. It had no undercarriage for pilots, nor any wings, vertical or horizontal of any type. 2) It was quiet. I have seen the Goodyear Blimp and other blimps many times. They are quite loud. You can usually hear them many miles away. Even though I was driving, this object was so close I should have been able to hear it clearly. 3) It was too low. I cannot imagine anyone flying any aircraft just above the trees like this. Even if the military had some secret aircraft, I sincerely doubt they would fly it at such a dangerously low altitude. 4) It followed the highway. I guess an aircraft could follow a highway, but I can&#39;t imagine why. I made a picture of this object on my computer using Paint. I am not an artist, the colors are not right at all, but it will give you the idea. It was a pretty easy object to draw. You are welcome to use it if you wish, but please do not disclose my name or e-mail.
