6/30/89 22:30|None|CO|Other|8-10 seconds|A square doorway (bay door?) opened in the night sky, two craft came out, disappeared over the horizon and the doorway closed.|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79665.html|1|ndxe198906| A square doorway (bay door?) opened in the night sky, two craft came out, disappeared over the horizon and the doorway closed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were backpacking on our way to Pike’s Peak in Colorado.  The first night we were laying on the ground in sleeping bags looking at the stars.  We were a few miles WSW of Pike’s Peak, at about 11,100 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother pointed up at something he saw first but I saw right away too.  It was a thin rectangle of white light pretty much directly overhead.  It grew, in about 1.5 to 2 seconds into a square of white light.  So, to be clear, it looked like a large sliding door that opened into this square white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one second later two round lights came out and stopped.  They came out at the same time, sort of dropping out and then stopping slightly outside of the square opening, exactly in the center of the respective side they came out of.  They were separated by 90°.  That is, each one was centered on a side of the square, outside of the square’s edge by maybe 1/4 of the square’s width, and they were on two adjacent sides so, 90° apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a! one second hesitation, they took off at exactly the same time and were both going at a high speed instantaneously.  They both made large arcs going below the horizon, maintaining their 90° separation.  The large arc must mean they were very high up, (like outside of the atmosphere?). Otherwise they would have disappeared over the horizons in a relatively straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as speed, I’ve seen the space shuttle go overhead and it’s just a point of light and takes 45 minutes to pass overhead.  These two lights made their big arc and went below the horizons in about 1.5 seconds or slightly less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about the same time that they disappeared, the square door slid closed again just in the way it had opened.  Before it opened and after it closed, the stars in that same area were visible (although we’re not 100% sure of that).  The size of the square was maybe the size of my thumbnail at arms length.  The fact that it was obviously high up and that big means it had to be huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The [fact] that the stars were visible before and after can only mean one of two things:  1. If a craft, it would have to be miles in size (cuz the “bay door” would certainly be just one part of it) and would have to have some light bending cloaking technology so it would look like nothing was there    2.  It was some kind of doorway without a ship being involved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/30/89 21:30|Coolidge|AZ|Triangle|1 min|UFO's or not|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69025.html|2|ndxe198906| UFO&#39;s or not<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been on my frontporch and I noticed what appeared to be a bright green meteor coming down at a angle.  It seemed to be coming from the South east. I did note that there seemed to be something unusual about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching and called for my wife to come out to see it.  While I kept watching I noticed that it seemed to be getting close to a treeline in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it flipped totally around and that was when I noticed it was triangular in shape.  The broad end of it flared bright red and it shot almost straight up into the sky.  My wife had just missed seeing it. Last month of this year we are in the same town but a different house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed on two seperate occasions a bright object moving almost deliberately but smoothly across the sky. I did not see any blinking or recognition lights.  The object would then arc upwards out of sight.  One I saw had been traveling east-north-east.  The other one had been going east-south-east.  My younger brother on the other side of town had also witnessed these craft and also noted the direction of travel as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He also has a some photographs of some kind of disturbance in the sky.  In one instance, upon closer inspection you can almost make out a triangular shape in the middle of it.  It almost reminds me of the description of the aura given in the tale of the Philadelphia experiment.  My brother had a source tell him that it appears to be the new kind of camoflage being used by military aircraft.  If so, then it just may be using something similar to electro-magnetic fields to make it work.  He said the images were not visible or noticeable until he got the pictures back.  They are on the negatives.  The camera he used was a 35 mm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/30/89 21:00|Banning|CA|Triangle|30 min.|My son and I saw two triangular craft hovering about 100 feet above the roadway.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33989.html|3|ndxe198906| My son and I saw two triangular craft hovering about 100 feet above the roadway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects were hovering approximately 100 feet in the air and were absolutely silent.  We could see the entire shape was made up of rectangular pieces with something that looked like rivets holding them together.  There was a huge white light in the center and the light came straight down without diffusing outward.  The objects were black.  One of the objects was a little higher that the other but close.  I estimate the size to be about the size of three small fixed wing aircraft.  Although we were about one quarter of a mile from the Interstate 10 freeway right next to the Banning airport, all the ambient sounds dissapeared.  We were afraid to start our vehicle and sat there watching about one block away from the two objects.  All of a sudden both craft went upward, the lights on both craft went out and without a sound disappeared into the sky.  I was 42 years old and my son was 14 years old.  I had just picked him up from little league practice. I first noticed the light when I was backing out of my driveway to pick him up.  I lived about one and one quarter mile North of the airport at that time and noticed the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was around 11 or 11 years old I believe and was with my 2 younger brothers roughly 4 and 8 at the time.  My mom and dad were taking us through the drive through of Burger King in Ellenville NY to get some food late night after visiting family members.  We saw a huge what I would describe as a building in the sky that was rounded but tall, several stories high with many lights/windows.  Besides me and my family seeing this, the girl working the drive through window also looked out and saw it, it was not like anything I have ever even heard of and have not seen anything else online about UFOs that look like flying buildings but it was unmistakable. Ellenville is around 12 miles from Pine Bush where there are many UFO sightings and also where I would have my second sighting of a UFO around 2001 or so that was more up close and I will post the story online here separately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/30/89 19:00|Birmingham (UK/England)||Light|2 minutes|A red 'sun' that pulsed back and forth in an unbelievable way.|9/13/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24896.html|5|ndxe198906| A red &#39;sun&#39; that pulsed back and forth in an unbelievable way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my sister (who were about 9 and 8 years old) were in our back garden playing and we spotted in the sky what we thought was the sun. It perplexed us that the &#39;sun&#39; was much more red than usual and was not that low on the horizon. After looking at it over the fence for about 30 seconds the object started to pulsate back and forth (it is very hard to explain how it did it). It was as if it was pulsing bigger and smaller towards us and then away from us. We both ran away into the house and I remember before I ran indoors I got on another fence to check if what I was seeing was real. I started to cry when I saw it from this view and ran indoors. We told our parents to come out to see it and after about 2 minutes after we had convinced them to come to have a look the red light in the sky had gone and was nowhere to be seen. The object was a dark but vibrant red and was circular. The pulsing it did was eerie and it scared us both in the way it pulsed, it was just unlike anything I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates date of June 31.

My sighting was during the day.  They traversed from east to west at a fantastic speed. They had the same angular width in the sky as do the sun and moon, and they were bright like fire, and perfectly round.  I believe they were less than 5 miles in altitude. They followed one right after the other.  I had always believed what I saw to be ball lightening, until recently when I started researching this topic.  I have found that the orbs that I saw are being seen all over the world.  I don’t know what to do with this info.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/30/89 01:00|Fort Jackson|SC|Triangle|1.5 minutes|I saw this object at night about 300ft above the ground back in 1989 while I was in the Army bivouacking at Fort Jackson, South Carolin|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79026.html|7|ndxe198906| I saw this object at night about 300ft above the ground back in 1989 while I was in the Army bivouacking at Fort Jackson, South Carolina.  I hopped up to go to the bathroom (treebark) outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very dark with no moonlight but a slight glimmer of light from the city was enough for me to walk around.  As I was doing my business, a very low reciprocal hum was coming from just about everywhere around me.  I looked up to notice a large dark trianglar shaped object with soft but bright lights on each corner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was moving very slowly, yet it was the size of about 3 football fields.  Behind this object were three orange-red lighted spheres about the size of a car.  I watched this until I could no longer see it over the dense tree line.  I felt a bit numb all over my body, like I was in a sealed box with no moving air.  Kind of like feeling static electricity all around me with no movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a minute later, 2 low flying F16&#39;s flew in the object! s same path and direction at about 80-90 knots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not my first sighting so I was not in shock, nor did I tell anyone because of the jokes that would sure follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason I am talking about it now it because of the North Charleston sighting in broad daylight in 1989, I came across today, was the same object I saw about the same time of year in 1989.<n>
6/30/89 01:00|Des Moines|IA|Disk|30 min max|craft hovering over Des Moines River in Iowa|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48684.html|8|ndxe198906| craft hovering over Des Moines River in Iowa<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t remember much of this as I was a young teen at the time and personally was not able to see it myself, although I have been a witness since this episode around 1998 which was unbelievable, but I will go on with that later. Anyway, I do remember that this article was in the Des Moines register with a Picture of the Craft itself hovering over the River which is next to down town. This picture was very clear and ther was no mistaking that this was not something we created here on earth.I really cannot remember the exact date this happened(1980-1990&#39;s) but I do know this was a huge story that went on for a while but I am uanable to find anything out on the web on it. I am very interested in finding this story as I&#39;ve heard so many stories from &#34;the saucer was using the water to stengthen itself?&#34; to getting power from the Electricity poles in the surrounding areas. It crazy some of the stories people can come up with. I&#39;m positive these quotes were not something the newspaper had said and I am also not sure of exactly how long the ship was there but I know many people seen it driving across the bridges to get to work down town as did the traffic controller that moniters traffic from his news cam via helicopter. This was a huge thing. I&#39;m hoping you can help me find more on this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My other incident was in the late 1990&#39;s. Myself and a boyfriend at the time were standing outside talking on a warm summer night at a desolate softball diamond behind the appts I used to live in altoona, Ia. All of the sudden we look up and there is a flat shaped saucer. You could see the dimension of it so well due to the full moon. There were no lights on the craft that we could see. we both watched this as I would hover in one spot for 10-15 seconds then it would move straight to its left and stop and hover there where it stayed for much longer. At this point we went inside to get my dad to come out and see it adn of course he insisted we were seeing things and that we were. I grabbed an old telescopr that most likely was going give me no help since it was very old and we came back out where it was still there. I was so quite out side that it almost scared us but intrigued us even more. No sooner did I get the telescope out of its holder, the saucer shot straight out to the south and dissapeared. There is no way this was shooting star, or a plane or anything else made by humans as planes and such cannot hover in one spot and move at the speed of light with no noise whatsoever. There was not a trail, sonic boom, nothing. I am now 33 years old and to this day I believe in what I seen what not my imagination nor was it the person I was with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My brother was going blah blah blah in the passenger seat, and needless to say I had him on ignore until he said something about my girl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I snapped my head up but instead of giving him grief I saw the red cigar thingy couldn&#39;t of been rescue vehicles as it was floating very slowly over the field towards the screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hit my brother to shut up then he saw it as well. It had only traveled roughly a 1/4 mile between when I first saw it till the second time I didn&#39;t think anything could fly so slow and no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People started pom-ping their horns and getting out of their vehicles pointing to it as it drifted behind the screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden there was a tremendous racket and we covered our ears, Three air force jets flew over top of us and flying in formation they maneuvered behind the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The jets flew a little closer but maintained there distance.  About 10 minutes later it was over millbrook area and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some cars sped out but we sat and talked and enjoyed the movie, my brother was not in the  drinking mood just in aah.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t drinking that night or nor am I drinking now as I&#39;m a Christian. I hardly ever discuss this as it just confuses things but in my long life I only seen 1 UFO and that&#39;s more then enough for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I seen that movie with you on it and could not understand but could appreciate your character of thought and dedication to investigate.

6/23/89 22:00|Palm City|FL|Light|5 minutes|Bright orb, hovering just above the tree tops for about 5 minutes.  It was a light green color.|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61329.html|11|ndxe198906| Bright orb, hovering just above the tree tops for about 5 minutes.  It was a light green color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seems like I can remember this experience like it was yesterday, although it occurred decades ago.  I vividly remember the feeling it gave me when I saw it, yet somehow I can never really explain it. I still remember weeks later when Independence Day came around I saw all the fireworks and used that as a way in my mind to rationalize away what I saw, though, I always knew that it was nothing like a firework.  I never did tell anyone, not one of my seven siblings, parents, or friends.  I knew I would be made fun of, I was smarter than that.  It wasn’t long ago that I told my wife about it, she is very supportive and takes things at face value with me.  In spite not speaking a word of this to anyone else in the 19 or so years since the occurrence, it seems reasonable to report the incident in case it has some value to someone out there studying the subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was fairly young, 11 years old to be exact.  We lived in a comfortably large home in the spread out private community of Martin Downs.  We had 3 or 4 acres on nice little lake in the back yard.  All the homes were spread out, our area of the neighborhood was fairly open, and we had a great view of all the homes on the lake.  Most of the homes on the other side of the lake were nestled in trees, very private.  Mostly long needle pines with Palm trees speckled in with Palmetto underbrush, standard Florida Foliage.  I remember it being a late summer evening, it was a Friday night and all my older siblings were at a church dance down in Palm Beach. My younger siblings were in their rooms, I remember turning the corner from the long hallway that lead from our rooms to the living room and shockingly seeing this very bright light hovering just above the treetops on the other side of the lake.  Under normal conditions the view from our living room is breathtaking at night; the wall toward the outside is mostly glass going into our ‘Florida room’ which outside wall was entirely glass sliding doors down the breath of it.  The house is built up a little bit so you have a great view when normally things are very flat in the area.  So looking through the two rooms you can see the light from the houses on the other side.  It must be between 200 and 300 yards to the other side of the lake, and this light was bright, frighteningly so.  It was a light green color; I really couldn’t tell what shape it must have been so I would guess an orb would be a great description from what I could discern.  It frightened me to the bone, but at the same time it was so mesmerizing, I could not take my eyes off it.  So I stood there, half hiding behind the corner of the wall, as it hovered, moving ever so slightly to the west for about 5 min.  The westward movement was so slight, during that time it probably only traveled about 40 yards or so.  Then, as I watched it, it just disappeared.  As I thought about what I saw I was astounded! , shocke d, my world of what I knew had changed.  That image still sits in my mind today, hovering just over the treetops, as I go back and look at pictures of my back yard, I can see that it moved directly over a house.  I wonder if anyone else saw it, I really do wonder.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were looking at the sky, looking south.  A huge, black triangle appeared before us just over the roof of the neighbour south of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both saw it, both screeching, &#34;What is that?&#34;  It was so low and so big.  We could see orange light bulbs in lines down the two sides.  It was completely silent and had NO exhaust.  Had there been exhaust, I would have been able to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought immediately that it was atomic powered.  It was not gliding. It passed slowly, with an even speed, and in a straight line.  The little orange lights looked vaguely comical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up and ran out to the front of the house to follow it but it went over the neighbour`s house and quickly was out of sight.

I was camping on a high elevation, on the top a rocky and treeless overlook, in a family tent with 4 other family members. They were all asleep. I was lying on my camp cot inside the tent.  My point of view was initially flat on my back, looking out of a very clear, new and clean net window.  Since I was on my back, what I saw at first was upside down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw lights at first, which ordinarily wouldn&#39;t have interested me, except that these were arranged in a small tight circle, and were spinning very fast, rising into the sky sharply with out sound, stopping and dropping suddenly.  I rolled over, sat up, and looked out of the window. There was no cloud coverage, no known or readily identifiable lights present other than the ones I a describing as unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way I can give a familiar visual of what I saw is to compare each lighted object as shaped exactly like the cereal called &#34;Honeycomb Cereal&#34; but with lights where the holes are.  Each object would enter my line of sight from the lower left corner, from an area hidden by a ridge in the foreground.  Each one would &#34;shoot&#34; rapidly into the sky from the lower left area, diagonally across to the upper right, stop, spin rapidly for seconds, and fall faster than it ascended, and all in silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each one was followed by another, in rapid succession, by other objects of the s! ame shape and lights, however some were smaller in diameter.  Each object was circular, but like the cereal, I could tell at the moment  that they would pause before dropping, that there were lights on the sides which spun around the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were oval, not round.  The lights underneath, about three per object, were round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the lights were white, they did not blink.  The round lights were starionary and moved with the object-attached.  The oval lights were also attached, but did not seem to be stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 14 seperate objects.  I remember very well, because I took care to count each one as it appeared from behind the ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot explain why I could not wake my family.  I couldnt stop staring at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also couldnt speak because I tried.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

They seemed to be moving about slightly but the 3 lights of each group stayed in perfect syncronization as if they were 3 separate craft just hovering. We estimated them to be about 1/4 mile away.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was starting to doze off durring the david letterman show. i was awaken by a repetitive sound kinda resembling a phone of the hook but alot louder and definitely more profound.as i started to rise up off the couch i noticed it took a great deal of effort as if i was drugged or something. Ofcourse i wasn&#39;t, but the physical feeling of a struggle to raise up off the couch was definitely present. As i could only sit i couldnt stand still have no clue as to why. i noticed the woods behind my house was completely illuminated as if there were flood lights on or a landing light on a helicopter as if it was searching. I know for a fact it wasn&#39;t any rotory aircraft. I also recall as if i was very cold and started to develop goosebumps in a big way. Eventually i was able to force myself to stand up. Only took me about 5 or 6 minutes to push myself up and walk over to the double french doors which lead to our sun patio. as i stood by the window the light faded with a slight flicker then was gone. Now im not quite sure how much time has past since this first inccident to the 2nd but, it wasnt too long after. I had made myself go to sleep in my beedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was awaken by the same erie noise as before except this time its directly out front and above my room windows. I have 3 windows in my room 2 large windows in the front and one smaller window on the side over top of my garage. Whatever this light was, shining thru my windows as if to see or whatever . I just knew somehow or for somereason this wasnt right. I knew enough to stay outa the lights. i do remember a chilly, cold like heat coming from outside, kinda like a vapor rub type wind. i know it sounds strange but thats the best way to explain it. almost menthol like. i wasnt able to yell but i was able to move and walk better this time . So being the wimp that i am i hid in my closet like a freak and never told anyone about it til now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up in the morning in my closet to a beautiful day. Even though for days i havent been able to sleep alone. This really scared the crap outa me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr.D, When I made this post, I was unaware of the time allotment. This happened to me quite some time ago. It wasn&#39;t recent. It took a long time for me to even get the courage to really come forward to post this. I heard about this site a few years ago and didn&#39;t take notice of my mistake. This event happend on June 20th 1989. I beg of you to please let me know if anyone ever had an experience simular to this one in your experience. It is something I desperately wish to have some answers on. Everytime i think about the noise i heard. i get goosebumps and feel exactly the way i did that night and the night after.<n>

I was tired of hearing it, so I went and sat down on the seawall and cast my line.  I started staring at the sky and became fixed on what I thought was the north star... after they finished their fight, my brother came over to chew my ear off in his venting process.  Because the light was so bright, he also became fixed on it as we sat there talking... then, all of the sudden, at light speed it zipped up and away leaving that streak of light behind it.  I was still disbelieving what I saw when my brother asked &#39;did you see THAT?&#39;  I let him tell me, just to be sure that he had really seen it too.

My uncle said in responce &#34;If that&#39;s the moon, then what is that?&#34; everyone froze and stared at the huge object that seemed to look like a big glowing baloon. It was like a light bulb! and it had colors circling on the bottom. I was so scared that I jumped behind some bushes on the right of the sidewalk. My step dad and my my mom were arguing over what it was. My step dad said it was just a baloon lighted from the inside, while my mom told him it couldn&#39;t be because it had no sign or seemed to advertise anything. I am sending you this because around that time there seemed to be other reports. please tell me if there were any. I want to confirm if it was really an unidentified craft or some baloon.

We lived within 10 mi. of the border. As we were arriving near our turn off I noticed a glint of metal moving towards a draw leading into the Galton Range. At first glance I thought it was a hang glider, but then realized that it would be unlikely. I watched with facination as it slowly floated toward the mountains. The craft had no wings nor rotar.

I was in my living room sitting in the dark talking on the phone when I noticed out my picture window lights moving in the dark sky.  Thinking nothing about it, I continued on the phone still watching the lights, when I noticed they were coming towards my house. Thats when i became alarmed.  I told my friend on the phone about this as it was happening.  Now my house sits atop a big hill and I have a large tree in my backyard at the bottom and this thing with flashing green white and red lights started moving in a circular motion in the backyard between my house and this tree.  Well I sit on my knees looking out the window watching this thing making a circle in my yard.  I open my window to listen to it and there is nothing to hear! It&#39;s size is maybe comparable to an SUV, maybe a little bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, after 1 1/2 circles, it stops and, OMG!, it turns on a VERY! bright white light that shines directly into my living room!  My two year old by this time has awaken and come in to see what was going on, had fallen back to sleep on the couch, was awaken again by this bright light.  It was so bright and even gave off heat!<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I was scared to death.  It was like it had seen me watching it.  So I &#34;ducked&#34; below the window.  After a few seconds the light went off and it continued to finish its circle in the yard and then it slowly headed north for about 10 seconds or so, then very very quickly it flew out of sight!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tumbling, white object which appeared to be disintegrating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have attached another report which I came across, which is the reason I have submitted this report. I was struck by the amazing similarities between the experiences, right down to the geographic area. In the summer of 1989 or 1990, I don&#39;t remember which, I was driving with my then-girlfriend north on State Line, near 89th Street. It was probably no later than seven o clock, because it was very light. She was first to notice what appeared to be a tumbling, white object. It appeared to be disintegrating, but was not throwing off light. It was traveling S-N and seemed to be on a near level path. We were in busy traffic and lost sight of it. My girlfriend noticed it because she thought it was a plane crashing! But there was no report of any crash that day, and I was aware of no one else who witnessed the phenomena. I would have loved to have watched it standing on that road instead of navigating a car through busy traffic at 40 mph! I was amazed how similar this report was to mine, and was especially intrigued by the geographic proximity of the two sightings. I had always chalked it up to a meteor, but the lack of light and the fact no one else seemed to have seen it (it was really spectacular) always puzzled me. Now I don&#39;t know what to think! Occurred : 11/30/1997 19:11 (Entered as : 11/30/97 19:11) Reported : 12/1/1997 07:05 Posted : 12/15/1998 Location : Kansas City, MO Shape : I witnessed what was obviously a single object entering the atmosphere. It descended from north to west at a 45 degree angle at about 30 degrees above the horizon. It burned a very bright white and I witnessed sparks flying off of the object. I have witnessed many meteor showers, and while this object was similar it seemed lower in the atmosphere, very large and extremely bright as I was in a brightly lit part of the city.<n>

It was looking straight at me, leaning on its right hand, its left hand (four fingers) stretched out towards me.  It looked to be about four feet in height with long, lean fingers and big, black, bulging eyes, two tiny slits for a nose and a small slit for a mouth. Its head was larger in the cranium, the neck spindly.  I could tell it was reading my mind and since I was pregnant, I was really afraid.  I immediately screamed and jumped out of bed, running into the living room where my husband was watching television.  I&#39;ve not seen another one of those since.

In 1989 june around sunset me and my two older brothers 22 &amp; 17 I was 11 years old, but ill never forget that day. We were playing football outside in the street when  when my oldest brother was staring up into the sky. My brothers face was confused perplexed I asked &#34;what are you doing throw me the ball&#34; he said &#34;what the hell is that&#34;. When I turned around I immeadiately looking at an amazing craft hovering very low maybe 4 stories high. I never belived in disc but here was a disc hovering no sound and was glowing in neon blue plasma surrounding it. The disc was flawless as the shinest chrome I&#39;ve ever seen like a platinum liquid mercury. Standing amazed my brothers told me to get away but I said no way ill remember this day forever and I&#39;m not leaving till that thing leaves LOOK. So I stared into this thing an could plainly see a revolving off white light around the craft it moved in different patterns. Also the craft was messin with my eyes it seemed so close I could touch it. Finally it began to move UP it moved so slow it was like it shrank but was now a small blue dot in the atmosphere then gone. We were amazed not many people belived us very saddening because they are REAL. The weird thing is afterward my dreams became so vivid I&#39;d feel like I had left my body then return exhausted. The dreams had a lot to do with God &amp; Satan but more now than ever I&#39;m attracting people who have had encounters an have never spoke about it. I don&#39;t understand truly what all this means I&#39;ve had a vision that they are gonna reveal themselves to the masses. Hundreds an fleets of crafts an ships are gonna appear and people are gonna panic. The govenment can no longer fool me I hope they let the people know because they are REAL. Don&#39;t let anyone tell you they don&#39;t they lie. I have nothing to gain more to lose but you deserve to know the truth<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

As we stood there by the pool, the ufo turned at 90 degrees and directed its course along the west wing of the building. As the ufo made its 90 deg turn, it rose upwards by about 20 feet. It moved along the west wing, and then made another abrupt turn to the west, and it slowly vanished from our view. The ufo did not have any lights on it at all and we only saw it as an outlined shape moving against the evening sky.It was either rectangular or cigar shaped. It made absolutly no sound as it traveled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to have his friend submit a report, as well.

6/7/89 22:00|Hooverson Heights|WV|Other|1 minute|zig zaging point of light witnessed by dozens in northern West Virginia|11/26/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33148.html|30|ndxe198906| zig zaging point of light witnessed by dozens in northern West Virginia<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember the exact date or time but this event is varifiable by a local newspaper article (I believe it was the local news paper in weirton, wv ).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was completely clear.  There was very little ambient light in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was in the southern sky.  It moved covering the area between 40 and 70 degrees vertically from the horizon and a horizontal area of about 30 degrees.  The object did not make any sound that I could here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved at a continuous velocity.  When I say a continuous velocity, I don&#39;t mean on average.  I mean that it&#39;s motion was mechanical in nature.  It&#39;s motion made it obvious that it was an engineered device of some sort.  It was very precise in it&#39;s movement and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object would move in a straight line for a second or two, and then continue at another angle between 90 and 180 degrees of the preceeding path.  It did not stop or even slow down for these changes in direction.  I can&#39;t call the changes in direction turns, because the motion was not at all curved.  The changes in direction were precise corners with no change in velocity.  This motion reminded me of the motion of a spot of light on a vector CRT or that produced by vector controlled laser optics.  By the way the object moved, it looked as if it had somehow been projected onto the clear night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object itself was a point of blueish-white light not much different from any star in the sky that night.  It was dimmer than the brightest visible star but brighter than any moving satalite I&#39;ve seen with my eyes alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this while relaxing with my grandmother on her patio.  We would often stay out late, listen to the radio and talk.  I was very dissapointed when the object finally vannished low in the sky.  I was unable to get my grandmother to see the light.  I wanted a witness to my claim but went to bed knowing I was the only one to see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning my grandmother and grandfather called me into the kitchen.  A small article in the local paper explained that dozens of people in northern West Virginia, including law enforcement, had reported seeing a ufo that zig-zagged across the sky befor disappearing behind the hills.  It seemed I had some witnesses after all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bit about my background-  This was my first UFO sighting.  I was about 14 years old.  My grandmother was in her 50&#39;s.  Everyone in my family- I mean everyone has or has had a belief and interest in the spiritual/ paranormal.  My interest in such things is probably the strongest out of any of my family aside from my uncle when he was younger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had many dreams about future places and events.  Some have already come true in ways that were very obvious to me, others I feel will, in time, unfold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a background in electronics, fine arts, and music.  I have composed two feature length musical scores for B-budget films.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I hopped on the kitchen table that was beside the big kitchen window in order to get a better view out of the window.  I had a habit of watching the stars out of that particular window quite frequently when beeing dark outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I gazed at the stars when I started to see some lights rising on the horizon of our small mountainous terrain here.  The lights quickly grew to light-spheres while coming down from the top of the little mountain that was straight ahead of the window.  They were moving in a straight decending line directly towards our house, keeping rather near to the ground at all times and very very fast.  So fast that for a moment I even feared they would crush into our house.  In a splitsecond they stopped dead ahead of the kitchen window at only a few, maybe 3 to 5 meters away.  The whole travel could not have lasted more then 3-4 seconds in total.  I just checked from Google Earth that the top of the mountain is approx. 500m bird-line from our house, high-differential of maybe 100 meters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I could see the orbs / spheres very clearly.  There were maybe 5-7 of them, each one kind of translucient, still radiating a quite strong light.  Each one in a different color: blue, orange, red, purple, yellow, almost like a rainbow.  The colored light seemed the come from the spheres outer shell only, beeing unevenly distributed.  Kind of like the soap-bubbles having this kind of oily, uneven texture.  The texture now only beeing unevenly distrubuted patters of light.  The spheres must have been about 1/2 to 1 meter in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a few seconds the spheres where hovering still before my window.  Then they started to move again, spinning around our house, light sipping in from the different windows in the different rooms.  That got me freaking out and I started to panic, as I realized that I was alone at home that night, my parents beeing on some of their parties.  I think i started screaming, running around eratically around the house (of that I am sure). I was really really scared and I don&#39;t remeber having any clear thought in that moments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weird thing is, I do not know how it ended.  That is why I was always struggling with myself, pondering wether it was only a dream or something real.  And I still am. I was wondering if there is anyone out there, having experienced something similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although having a strong interest in the matter of UFO, I try to remain sceptic. To this very day I have not seen anyting that has convinced me of UFO&#39;s or e.g. dimensional things beeing real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the above stated reason I will give permission to release my contact info. At this stage I will only hand out a synonym (+email), not my real name of course.<n>

As the night wore on it was evident nothing was going to happen. I thought I saw a small private plane in the distance approaching, so I turned up my camera and set it on bulb, hoping the passing plane and its lights would cause a streak on the film.... anyway, as the craft approached, it was evident that it was flying very low and very slow. When the damn thing passed me overhead... about 60 feet in the air, it wasn&#39;t a plane at all, but a rectangular craft about 20 feet wide and about 50 feet long with a series of lights on the bottom lit up in no particular pattern. By the time I arranged my camera it was out of range. I snapped pictures but nothing came out. The craft was totally silent. I contacted the Air Force in nearby Warner Robbins and the tower told me they had no activity on their radar at the time I reported it. I feel especially lucky to have seen not only this craft close up, but another when I was quite young. I would like to experience regressive hypnotherapy to re-live the events and determine if other details are missing. These were not teeny lights in the sky, I could have hit either of these crafts with a well thrown rock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

She described a bright light with lights shooting off of it and circling around and then rejoining the main light.  Several of us that were there went outside to investigate.  We walked the half block down the gravel road to the Farm to Market road to get a better view.  Just coming into view was an object flying very low and slow.  It was coming out of the East and moving directly West following the FM road.  I would estimate it&#39;s height to have been around 600 ft and it&#39;s width to be about 75 yards wide.  It was triangular in shape and had several lights down each &#34;wing&#34;.  The lights were different colors but of the same configuration on each wing.  I remember 4 lights on each wing of blue, orange, and white colors.  Where the tail of a normal aircraft would have been were three lights arranged in an L shape but we could clearly see the straight line across the back extending to the tips of the wings forming the triangle shape.  In the center of the object was a red check mark.  It was similar to an arrow pointing in the direction of travel, dead center on the bottom, but was missing one of the lines that would have formed a complete arrow, instead resembling an upside down check mark.  The craft made absolutely no sound as it travled and continued moving very slowly until it passed out of our field of view.  We observed the craft for about 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my grandfather who was a dispatcher at the local Sheriffs office to see if he had heard any reports and he had not.  He went up on the county courthouse roof where he worked but did not observe anything.  He was about 3 miles to the southwest of our location.  I also contacted the small municiple airport in Commerce, TX which is about 25 miles to the SW of our location to see if they knew of any military operations in the area.  Their response was that if they did they couldn&#39;t tell us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very shortly after the event, the neighbor who had alerted us to the object and had described something very different from what we observed was suddenly stricken with Pancreatic cancer and passed away very suddenly.  She seemed to be of perfect health and went into the hospital for stomache pains,  a few days later she passed away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been watching the sky ever since and have never seen anything like it again.  I&#39;m an avid aircraft and military &#34;buff&#34;.  The B2 bomber was unveiled around this time and I just chalked the sighting up as a lucky view of some secret test flight.  Of all the pictures I have seen of the B2 since, I have never seen any with anything like the light configuration I described above.  It was a well lit night and we could clearly make out the edges of the craft and it was triangular in shape and was missing the jagged tail profile of the B2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They pulled over on the side of the road, got out and looked up to stare at them. The ships had white/yellowish lights  on them that went around. They got back in the car after 5 minutes until they were out of site of the ships. The ships remained until they could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;m in to health food products, and a co-worker told me that there was one near my place of employment. She said that she believed it was a small store.  At 5:00 P.M., I left my job and started looking for the store. I figured that it would be nice to be able to purchase items like vitamins, etc. on my lunch hour. By the time you get off from work and travel to these little stores, they&#39;re closed.  I walked down the street slowly, looking on both sides of the avenue, trying to find the store.  Eventually, I came upon a small store that I figured had a good chance of being it.  The building above it was abrownstone that was boarded up.  I steped down the one or two steps and opened the door to the shop.  Almost as soon as I walked in, I had a feeling that this wasn&#39;t the best place.  There was a man there.  He was my height 5&#34;6&#34;, skinny, dark, but otherwise normal.  I have a very clear, loud voice, and because of my previous vocal instructions over time, somewhat loud.  I asked the man, whether he had whatever the herbal remedy was that I wanted.  He became very angry and said in a voice that was almost as loud as mine&#34;you got some nerve coming in here with all that attitude.&#34;  I immediately answered him with &#34;what the hell are you talking about atitude.  Without saying another word, He aimed his finger at my heart and something that I coiuldn&#39;t see hit me in the heart.  I have ben know for having a lot ot courage so me being me, I just stood there and stirred at him. Then he said, &#34;I could have just killed you.&#34; I then realized that I was in more danger than I realized. I also knew what I had accidentally come upon.  There was a conversation that followed where I sought of asked where he was from, but he only said that it was a long way from here.There was great emphysis on long. Every time he moved around the store, you never saw him move to another location, he just appeared at that spot. Some how, I was asleep and while still standing, I felt my feet being kind of numb.  I had been standing in that same spot for a couple of hours. When I finally got up the nerve to say that I was leaving, he said&#34; we are leaving tomorrow to. That would have been Wednesday. I walked to the door, and as I looked around he said, &#34;when you get home tonight I want you to say xxxxxxx.  I didn&#39;t say it then and I won&#39;t say it now.  As far as I am concerned, that could have been some password the he could have used to take me aboard his space ship.  As I placed my hans on the door, his face blurred and changed to what he really looked like.  He was still my height, very dark, but his eyes were large but that skin around the eyes reminded me of a crocodile.  Ther was a thin yellow line running from one corner of the eye to the other. And he laughed out loud. He surely wasn&#39;t pretty. I really wanted to ask more questions, but thought better of it.  On Thursday, the day after he said they were leaving, I walked down to that store, near the curb.  I wanted to see if there was anybody there.  Would you believe, the place looked as though no one had ever been there.   It was empty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rode past on the bus ther other day, and the place had been undergoing renovations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s now a nice looking brownstone with a store.  I&#39;d like to know who rented it before.  The things that I saw him do, couldn&#39;t have been done by anyone other than an alien.  I&#39;m now actually glad that I had the experience.  It told me what I suspected all along, that we are living with these people and cannot tell the difference. When I saw how he just changed his appearance within one or two seconds, I was surprized, to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This really happened in 1989.  I was sought of afraid to mention it because I didn&#39;t know whether or not I should.  Don&#39;t know who you&#39;re speaking to these days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Across the street behind the row of houses is a large building (a refractory) a parking lot is between the road and the houses and has lighting in the parking lot.  Not very much light gets behind the houses it is still very dark and perfect for using telescope.  Behind the houses it is farmland While I waited I saw what looked like a large dark bird over the building.  As it got closer a largeer it was a very dark triangle, like very dark glass , see through moving over the  street and the houses.  I estimated the width to be at least 200 feet as it covered five lots as it passed.  It made no noise had no flashing lights or any lights that I was.  But looking up at it it was darker than the sky and seemed to have stars in it as though I was looking through it at the night sky.  I watched it go out over the field behind me, it made no noise or disturbance at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was probably 100-200 yards away above some houses, it had blue lights circling around it.

It seemed like the whole ship was spinning.I starred at it until it disapeared eastward behind some houses, when I looked at my sister she was facing in the other direction.To this day no one believes me, but that night is one of the clearest memories I have of my childhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Our departure time was approximately 8:00 pm, hazy, but with partial light still in the sky.  Climbing out of DFW on an initial 185 degree heading, and just passing through approximately 1,000&#39; AGL (above the ground), I spotted a very large object out of the copilots window.  I immediately made the statement to my copilot, &#34;What the @#*! is that?&#34;  It appeared to be elongated and &#34;cigar&#34; shaped, a grey metallic looking object, moving very slowing from right to left (west to east), and it appeared to have many small, dark, and slightly fuzzy looking, rectangular &#34;windows&#34; running longitudinally along the length of the object; a line or band of windows?

He replied, &#34;No, why do you ask?&#34;  I told him I wasn&#39;t sure but that we thought that there was an object out ahead of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first seeing the object, which was initially located in the right third of my copilots window from my viewpoint, I thought that it might be the undercarriage of a 747.  The object appeared to be moving very slowly.  However, as we accelerated on climb out, the object did not appear to be changing in size indicating that we were not going to have an immediate collision.  I had seen mirages many times before in the past, and so I initially thought that this might be a mirage.  Because of the hazy sky conditions, moisture in the air, and dusk, it didn’t appear to be a mirage, but still a possibility.  As we climbed out of 4500’, the object was now leaving us toward the east but still visible in the left third of my windscreen when departure had us turn to the northwest on our way toward Denver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t think much of the incident until years later when I happened to turn the television on during one of my layovers.  The program, &#34;In Search Of&#34; was on and this particular segment was about a sighting over Montreal (Torronto?), Canada.  In that program, several hundred witnesses described exactly what my copilot and I had seen on our departure out of DFW during the same time period.  The announcer stated that through triangulation, the objects length was determined to be 6,000’ long.  That’s a mile long and would explain why it appeared that we were not closing on the object we saw!  I thought my sighting above might have some interest for your research?  Other pilot friends have had different encounters.  Back in 1979, I was flying with one 707 pilot and he told me that during a nighttime letdown approach into LAX, when still east of Palm Springs, California, he and his Captain had to take evasive action in order to avoid hitting another flying object.  As they pulled back on the stick to avoid colliding with their “UFO”, they could clearly see inside the “cockpit” of this craft and clearly saw the “pilots”.  Both of the American pilots were former USAF pilots and they both knew what oxygen masks looked like, the type worn by military pilots.  What they saw on the “UFO pilots” face(s), helmet or oxygen masks, they said was nothing they had ever seen before.  In their estimate, it was not of this planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  We have encouraged the source to try to determine the exact date, using his flight logs.  Also, we have requested that he have the other pilots submit reports, as well.  PD))<n>

I drove for a distance then tried to wave the vehicle to pass me.  The light was at car level, so I didn&#39;t think much about it.  I tried to wave it over again, but it wouldn&#39;t pass.  I slowed down.It slowed down.  I sped up. It sped up. Keeping my exact speed.  I backed up, it backed up. Finally I pulled over to the side of the road to let it pass,cane roads are very narrow, one lane.  It stoppped. I shut off the engine, there was no sound coming from its engine.  I got out of my car but the light was so intense that I couldn&#39;t see what was there.  I started to walk towards the light.  I stopped about 10 feet from it.  I still could not see or hear any vehicle.  Only silence.  I thought it wasn&#39;t wise to persue this any further, so I walked back to my car and got in.  Now this was a matter of a few minutes.  As soon as I started to drive away the light disappeared. When I got home, a 15 minute drive, my roommate asked me where I&#39;d been.  I told him I came straight home.  Why?  Then He told me it was 10pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told him what I had seen.  He didn&#39;t want to talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone else seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t go anywhere but to see this and straight back to my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it has been some time since I&#39;ve seen this, but I didn&#39;t know about these sites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Some friends and I were outside playing basket ball and it was just starting to get dark (dusk) when we noticed a white light in the sky. It looked like the sun slightly breaking through some clouds. We joked about it being a UFO and then continued to play ball. About 1-5 minutes later the light was so bright that it instantly lite up the area we were at and we could barely see above us due to the brightness, however I recall seeing a almost saucer type outline. Then just as fast as it happened, it raised into the clouds and shoot off. I could see the light as it faded and it looked like in may have landed sever 100,000 feet away, but I am not sure it landed or just faded. The funny thing was, there was no sound or wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I had an approximately 45 minute ride which took me through the town of Rhinebeck, NY.  Lots of traffic, as it was rush hour &amp; many people were on there way home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traffic started to slow &amp; it became dark, as I looked out my window I realized that the sky had gotten very dark very fast, and people were stopping their cars, pulling off to the side of the road.  I looked up and was surprised at the sight I saw.  Hovering above us was a huge, very dark  almost black, object,chevron shaped, very large and covering not only the road but buildings on both sides of the road.  The sky was completely blocked out it was that large an object and although I am not sure exactly how high up it was, nothing could be seen around it.  Dark gray/black underneath...silent, not a sound did I hear from it and moving extremely slowly.  There were some lights underneath, but I did not count them or take note of any color.  To me they were just bright, but small lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People were pointing up, and some were out of their cars or nearly stopped in the roadway.  This object continued moving forward slowly along Route 9 East, heading towards the Route 9G intersection, East.  It sped up a bit, but never any sound could be heard and it disappeared heading towards the town of Red Hook.  I later heard reports of it being sighted on the Taconic State Parkway heading South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was low.The bottom was in the tree tops. It seemed to glow from within. There was a black sort of platform in the sky at the bottom. It was the size of a round water tower&#39;s bowl. It seemed to glide in a very controlled maner as if on a magnetic field. It did not float nor look like a ballon. It was moving rather slow maybe 35 mph. It descended into the trees and went out of sight and seemed to be landing back in the trees about a half a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving to work at about 06:50 when I suddenly realized there was a florescent orange sphere low in the sky just ahead to the right. It seemed to glow from within. It made no sound. It was the size of a round water tower&#39;s bowl. At the bottom of the sphere was what looked like a black sort of platform. (Shape wise it looked like a basketball sitting ontop of a cassette box) Except the sphere was perfectly round and had sort of a mesmerizing presence to it,an aura . It sat directly on top of the rectangular shaped black object at the bottom, no straps or anything visible holding it down or attaching it. The black part was obscured by the tree tops. I was trying to make it out, although it was hard to see the black part, it seemed to have some part of it folded up under it at the bottom like legs or something. As I was traveling about 50 mph heading west it was moving north west out over the trees and slightly slower about 35mph. I was gaining on it. When I came to a stop light the car behind me pulled up along side me to turn right. The driver gave me a look like, you see that? And nodded towards it, just before he made his turn. The light turned green and then I was trying to get as close as I could trying to see it better. I kept saying &#34;what is that&#34;. It continued out over the trees and it seemed to glide as if it were being controlled some how and like it was riding on a magnetic field. It did not float like a ballon or appear to be a balloon. The road I was on began to bare to the left and south. As it did I was looking back over my right shoulder as I watched it go down into the trees about a half a mile away until I could no longer see it. I have never been able to forget seeing it.<n>

I saw a round blip on the outside ring, (15 miles), heading directly to the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were closed for another 5 minutes so I just kept doing my opening checklist.  I kept an eye on the target occasionally because in a few minutes I figured I may be talking to him.  Primary target only, but the target was exceptionally large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Visibility was unlimited and no cloud cover.  I expected to see some lights and here the pilot transmit on the common freq with closed tower procedures.  I glanced again and the the target was moving fast, so it got my attention.  I saw it the last time on the 5 mile range ring then I saw a round ball, no lights, unable on color zoom low level directly over the tower.  Unsure on altitude but it caused me to reflexively duck, so low very low.  I thought at first it went through the tower over my head.  But I realized that was not possible, I think it&#39;s speed and low altitude caused this feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size, very small, smaller then an airplane.  Hard to estimate, dark, fast no lights, no noise.  I would say a little larger than a beach ball.  Maybe smaller though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Long time ago, I never reported this to anyone.  Hope this helps with your investigations.  Below I checked other aircraft in vicinity, these aircraft were all buttoned up on the flight line.  No airborn aircraft in vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only other guy awake that time of the day at Mansfield Airport is the radar guy, he saw the target, but I did not discuss the incident with him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Showing me by a virtual reality show of their future response to events coming to our planet and our people.  I did not understand at that time that it was not coming then, I thought it was.  They did in no way harm me and in fact were very gentle, kind and loving, I was in no way afraid of them or ever felt threaten by them at all.  In fact I felt they were very much concerned for me and our planet.  They explained that they would be removing animals from our planet in order for life to continue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1974 I was  moving from PA. to CA. towing a trailer with the assistance of my brother I was 19 and he was 17 at that time.  Somewhere in the middle of farm country of OHIO at 3 am my brother was driving and I was awakened by his screaming my name.  The ford pinto I owned at the time was going on and off, all the lights engine and radio. Then all of a sudden it totally died.  Lights, radio engine completely shut down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got a flashlight out of the glove box and got out lifted the hood to see what we could see, naive as  neither of us had a clue what we could do.  I suggested we get back in the car and what until morning and perhaps hitchhike to any near town as we were about 35 miles from any town.  So we just curled up to go to sleep and then there was a small red light that went flying over the nearby farm field in a flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes later my car came back on radio, lights and engine started right back up.  Because everything had shut down we had not turned anything off so it just came right back on. From that day to the day I sold it I never had this ever occur again or any electrical problems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 77 or 78 when Close Encounters of the Third Kind the movie came out my brother called me from calif to tell me to go see this movie without telling me why. And there in the movie was exactly what occurred to us.  I was never one who was someone who read any science fiction stories.  I may have been a Star Trek fan and I have always been a believer in all things are possible. But I was never one who was looking for these kind of encounters or interactions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was recently living in Montana and had 4-5 encounters there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

And the Chicago tower has identified it as an unidentified flying object.  (He did not use the acrynom UFO).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in a window seat on the right side of the plane and looked out the window.  I didn&#39;t see anything except absolute blackness.  Then I saw three small specks of light in a triangle formation in the far distance.  In less than a minute, these lights had gotten brighter and larger as they quickly moved towards the plane, in straight line.  It was as though they had been catapaulted closer.  Then they stopped moving and appeared to be stationary, moving at the same speed as the plane and maintaining the same distance from the plane.  They appeared to move with us as the moon does in the night sky.  Then as quickly as they appeared, the lights suddenly started moving away.  The movement curved a little bit as they moved away.  They moved very fast but not so fast as to cause a streak in the sky.  The lights just got smaller they moved further into the distance.  Then finally fading into the dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have told my daughter, who was a toddler at the time about this story.  I&#39;m not sure she believes me or others I have shared this story with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure if O&#39;Hara Airport reports these sightings by commercial aircraft, but I am a witness to one such event which they were aware of.

It had a few lights beneath it around the outer rim area that didn&#39;t seem to be on the whole time we were watching it, suspended in the sky just behind our home.  I pointed to it and the children and I continued to observe it for another minute or so. Suddenly we heard the noise of helicopters coming from behinds us; two (possibly three) appeared on the scene and seemed to be after the UFO (chasing, investigating it or supervising it) when it began a rapid zigzag movement away from us and the helicopters (at many times the speed of any jet)and before the UFO was out of site, it just dissappeared. This was not a sighting of something that looked like a strange object, from where we stood, it was in plain sight and in broad day light. Our house bordered near two highways and I was sure many would have seen it too but when I called the police department and asked if they had received any calls of any strange sightings, they said no and I didn&#39;t report it.  The children never spoke of it again and I too forgot about it. Maybe the word isn&#39;t &#34;forgot&#34; but &#34;brainwashed&#34; because when it came to mind, I couldn&#39;t believe why I had not shared it with my husband or closest friends emediately. When I approached the kids to talk about it after months had gone by, they didn&#39;t feel comfortable talking about it.  Today, after about 10 years, they still remember it clearly but didn&#39;t want to be reminded...&#34;so strange&#34;.  I almost feel there was a &#34;force&#34; silencing us... or maybe it&#39;s just a &#34;normal&#34; fear that overtakes us because of such an extraordinary/paranormal event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date appears to be approximate, perhaps sometime during the late 1980&#39;s.
