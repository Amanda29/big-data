9/7/43 14:00|Milford (Republic of Ireland)|N/A|Cylinder|30 seconds|Standing on a height of land when fat cigar shaped object with port holes passed in front of me silently.|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48281.html|1|ndxe194309| Standing on a height of land when fat cigar shaped object with port holes passed in front of me silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing on a height of land that slopes down to (lake) Lough Fern which lies parallel to the road from Milford Co Donegal, to Kilmakrennan, Co. Donegal. The object came into view coming downward from a height, and from the direction of the town of Milford which is two or three miles from my location. It moved quite swiftly from my Left to my Right leveling out as it passed in front, and slightly above my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no memory of any sound associated with the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object might be described as a fat cigar with round features distributed down the side, somewhat like portholes. I don&#39;t recall how many. There did not appear to be any wings or lights. The overall impression that I have is that it had a metallic greyish appearance, with a slight blue or turquoise cast.  I remember it as being quite large which may be a reflection of my own size at the time.  Memory tells me that it was about as long as the width of the field below me.  It achieved level flight before it passed my position, and maintained it untill it disapeared to my Right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember anything about my circumstances at the time, either before or after the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have questioned my parents about this, but they have no memory of any incidents that correlate.  An aircraft is unlikely even though the occurance would have been in the latter stages of WW2.  There is only one incident reported in which a crippled German aircraft passed over our home at right angles to the incident in question.  This was clearly remembered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
