It did not move and no sound was audible. We watched fot about an hour and as I became agitated, Dad sent Mom and me ro bed. The next morning on arising,I ran outside to see it, but it was gone. Dad said he had watched ir for 3 or 4 hours and finally came to bed. Dad was 28 and a Radio repairman, Mom was 24, a factory worker, and I was about 7 ears of age.<n>

The caller identified himself as a retired 72 YOA Duluth Georgia businessman.  He stated that he and his &#34;date&#34; had witnessed an unusual event in 1949, but he had not reported the incident to anyone due to being temporarily AWOL from the Air Force in order to go on the outing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness stated that it was either the spring or fall of 1949 and he was in the U.S. Air Force, attending a military training school, and was overdue because of his date.  He and his friend were in MARION ALABAMA (Perry County, west central Alabama) near her farmhouse home.  The weather was nice and mild, and they were standing under a tree in the front yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She suddenly observed something in the sky behind him and pointed it out.  He looked and they both observed several ROUND, AERIAL, BLACK ORBS in the far distance.  They were in what he described as a diamond formation, appearing back-lit, seeming to make them black, and about the size of an ASPIRIN held at arms length.  He recalled there being FOUR ROUND OBJECTS/ORBS, perhaps 15 degrees above the horizon.  As they watched, said orbs DOVE DOWN toward the horizon and vanished.  Event duration was much less than a minute, perhaps just moments, and occurred at what he recalled was about 3:00-4:00PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness DID NOT notice any unusual physiological or psychological effects, nor any influence on his watch or other devices.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This witness is obviously intelligent, educated and well spoken, and seemed very forthright and serious during the telephone interview. His recounting of the event remained CONSISTENT as FOCUS was applied to several areas of his experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While a field investigation into such a BRIEF event so REMOTE in time is not feasible, this report is being documented for HISTORICAL PURPOSES. Efforts will be made to locate similar accounts in that general area and time frame. That part of Alabama is rural today, and was MORE SO in 1949, being just SW of the massive Talladega National Forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any Alabama citizen with additional information regarding this event or having a similar experience in that general area and time frame, please contact Tom Sheets, Director-Georgia UFO Group, at 678-817-4555 (Fayetteville Georgia).

7/1/49 11:00|Fairbanks|AK|Disk|2 minutes|Enormous metallic disc in Alaska sky, 1949.|12/23/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105503.html|3|ndxe194907| Enormous metallic disc in Alaska sky, 1949<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was born and raised in the Territory of Alaska and in 1949 I was a student at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks.  During the summer of 1949 I worked as a transit man on a survey line for the Civil Aeronautics Administration which was beginning the development of the Fairbanks International Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a clear day in July, in a sky void of sound or activity, there appeared an enormous metallic saucer-shaped object directly above my line of sight, but at a great distance from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shouted to my two chainmen and pointed to the object which was approaching rapidly until it appeared directly above us, but still at an altitude higher than any aircraft I had ever observed.  Its size was enormous.  I imagined it would cover several city blocks in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was visible for about a couple of minutes before it made a sharp right angle turn and climbed out of sight.  Only one of the chainmen saw the object.  The time of the sighting was about eleven o’clock in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At noon it was time for our break and we headed back to the survey station where the sighting was discussed with others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the end of the day our story had reached the military at Ladd Field and when we arrived back at the station we were approached by an Army officer who interrogated us separately regarding the sighting.  When I was asked how high it was I responded that it was at least at an altitude of 30,000 feet.  The officer asked why I would choose that altitude and I said it was because I knew of no aircraft that could reach that altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am aware that this was a very early sighting but understand that your organization is nevertheless interested in recording all reliable sightings, and since I am now in my eighties there is no time like the present to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your response to my report.  The insertion of &#34;California&#34; as a county name was not intended.  It was an interesting technical error as I had inserted &#34;no county&#34; in that column.  Alaska was divided by districts for the purpose of  voting in Territorial elections and for judicial purposes and I assume that remains the case today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regarding the name of the co-worker who was a chainman, his name was ((name deleted)). I assume he was in his forties at the time while I was 22 years of age.  As I reported, surveying was summer work during my college years, but I was late into college as I spent time in the military as World War II was ending.  I was stationed at Kodiak as a ((deleted)).  ((name deleted)) was a typical &#34;oldtimer&#34; in Alaska picking up work where he could find it.  A very good man.  In those days in Alaska, everyone seemed to know one another.  In the early 1940s before the military began to arrive the population of the entire Territory was about 75,000.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for forwarding the very interesting story regarding the sighting from the Eklutna area.  I graduated from the Anchorage High School and during my summer surveying, I worked in many remote areas.  Alaska abounds in great stories!   Incidentally, your website is most interesting and well-organized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>
