It was a clear night, with a bright moon, but there were a couple of puffy clouds that were illuminated by the moon.  As I first looked up, I saw an object that I thought was a meteor or falling star.  Then after looking closely, I saw it was a bright white cigar shaped object sort of falling at an angle like the hands of a clock from 1 to 2.  Suddenly it silently moved at an impossible rate of speed across a large arc of sky to end up behind a cloud.  It made no sound, and looked just very white with no other distinguishing features.  My girlfriend saw it too after I said &#34;look at that !&#34;.  The funny thing was, I got the feeling that it sensed it was seen and fled like an animal.  I never saw it again.<n>

We pull of to the side of the turpike,(like four other vehicles did also). We all got out of the cars and started to observe the oval(UFO) craft?  It look like sparkles were coming out from it,and made no noise at all. We stood there for about five to eight minutes looking at it. It did&#39;nt do anything except for the sparkle like things coming out of it.After a while, we all (the other people that had pull of the road like us)just got back int our vehicles and drove away.To this day,I still don&#39;t know what type of craft (UFO) it was, or were it came from? I know that during those days, they had over sixty sighting in and around that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We continued to look for a short time because of the extreme speed of the object.  The light made a 90 degree turn and climbed out of sight in about one second.  The light passed between existing lights in the fore round and back round.  Unless I had been looking at just the right spot I would not have seen it.  At the time I was active Air Force reserve and the Civil Air Patrol so I have been trained to observe and report.  This is the only time I observed anything near this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw something I can not explain and get quite angry when some quack starts telling fairy tails on TV, and makes everyone look like idiots.  If you dug a tunnel a thousand miles long, where did our government put the dirt?  We have a 15 or 20 miles and that dirt covers about 100 acres about 200 feet deep.  The 5% lunatic fringe is alive and talking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We could see square shaped lighted up windows (like in an airplane) and two wheels going around the aircraft.  There were no wings.  It stayed above us for a while and then a bright light along with a hissing sound shown out one side of the cigar shaped object.  The light started to form a bell-shaped object out of one end side of the craft.  Then it silently started to rise and disappeared high into the night sky.  We called the Bonham Airforce Base, but they said that they saw &#34;nothing&#34;.  The next day I read in the newspaper that a lady who was fishing at night saw a UFO with a &#34;bell shaped light&#34; coming out of one side. However, no one believed us so we said nothing.<n>

Can&#39;t remember any enjory<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving to the Talahassee forest in a Winnebago on the newly compleated Interstate 10, I noticed a red light in the sky to the south of us out over the Gulf of Mexico.  It started moving towards us as I was traveling at about 50 MPH.  The closer it got the lighter it got in color.  It turned white and started moving along with me about a mile away and 500 feet in altitude.  It stayed abrest of me after making a 90 degree turn.  I pointed it out to my wife and she laughed it off as a plane.  Planes dont travel that fast and make 90 degree turns I said.  I stayed visable in my side window for 10 or so miles.  Then suddenly jumped from the side window to my windshield view and hovered with a sudden stop.  Wife said Helecopter.  No! I said can&#39;t be.  I was Marine Air Wing and what it did was imposible.  When I came abrest of it it started pacing me again.  Then climed away from us and slowly turned red at a distance of 30K feet and 20 or so miles away then the light went off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We reached the camp ground at about Midnight and driving through the woods reached a clearing.  Over the trees miles away the red light came back on.  I stopped and it raced toward us turning white it stopped over us with out a sound, it hovered. and glowed.  I started to go out and see what it was and when I ouened the door my skin crawled.  Our little girl came out of the bed screaming, crying for us to stop the noise it hurt her ears.  We heard nothing.  with that I jumped into the drivers seat and turned the Winnebago around driving out of the forest.  It started moving and I stopped looking in the large trucker mirrors. It went streight up, no sound turned red and dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/15/73 18:00|Colbert Heights|AL|Disk|5 minutes|Hovering object with circulating yellow and green lights slowly began to move before attaining hyper speed from virtual dead stop|11/3/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47144.html|6|ndxe197311| Hovering object with circulating yellow and green lights slowly began to move before attaining hyper speed from virtual dead stop<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving towards a remote and rural school pearched atop a small mountain ridge for an evening athlethic event in extreme northwest Alabama, my mother and I witnessed an object that appeared to be hovering just above (500 - 700 ft) the school that we were driving towards.  We were drving up hill and the winding road caused us to lose site for a couple different moments, but it became visable again each time our vision cleared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not see the school, but we could see how the night sky was slightly illuminated by the presence of the school and associated ground lights.  It appeared that the hovering object was observing the location.  The object appeared circular in shape (not round, but more disk shape).  There were slowly rotating lights that I beleive to have been yellow and green in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After having watched this object and having seen it for a sustained period of time, and from different angles, there was no doubt that we were seeing an actual object and not any type of projected light or reflection, etc...<n> <n><n> <n><n> As peculiar and interesting as the sighting had been, what followed was most remarkable...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would suspect our distance from the scene to have been about perhaps a quarter of a mile, at the time.  We noticed that the object began to move slowly away from the ground illumination, and then, in a instant the object from an almost dead stop accelerated to an incredible speed that took it away from our vision in a fraction of a second.  It didn&#39;t just disappear, it disapppeared as a result of distance covered from our location.  We saw it go truly out of sight.  It left no light trail of any type whatsoever. What we saw was clearly visible and clearly trackable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night and we had even discussed the event as it was taking place.  Our view was excellent for the sighting.  It truly looked like it was observing the mountain top scene, and simply left when it was done.  It&#39;s possible we spooked it off as we progressively drew closer to the locale with our car lights pointing in its general direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event is etched in my mind and always will be.  I never gave much (and still don&#39;t) to the idea of it being extraterrestrial in nature, but it was without any question and unidentified flying object unlike any known then or today.<n>

The craft had a bank of alternating green and red lights that rotated around it as it moved slowly from our right to our left. It travelled directly across our line of sight, slowly at first. The rotating lights seemed to correspond with the speed of the craft as did a low pitched, deep whirring sound. As the craft sped up, the lights and the frequency of the sound increased accordingly. We watched it for about 10-15 seconds, when all of a sudden, it streaked up into the sky at an incredible rate of speed. We watched it until it virtually vanished high in the sky. It was reported to have also landed inside the navy base, as several other sailors indicated in their report to the commanding officer of the base. The base was unexpectedly closed 3-4 weeks later. I witnessed the same craft less than ten days later at another location on Key West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At dusk, it came towards me with a constant speed and altitude of ten meters and multiple lights flashing with absolute silence. The way that I judged its size was that I saw that it would just fit inside the two car garage that it flew over. I remember that there were several reports of similar sitings in the local newspapers. It was 1973.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Our camp was situated on a mountain side that had been prepared by the wildlife service. It was graded out of the side of the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were just finishing up dinner when one of the guys said, what is that and he pointed down in the valley toward the road.  He asked me if that was an airplane because I am a licenced pilot.  It looked exactly like a small plane trying to land with its landing light on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden it stopped and seemed to appear right in front of us about a mile away.  My distances are not going to be accurate.  It appeared to be about 500 feet above the ground which would make it just about even with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it appeared there was no landing light but it was surrounded with round light that were very bright.  It seemed that the top lights were smaller in circumfrance than the bottom lights.  There was no definite shape to the craft but it appeared to be saucer shaped with a bubble shaped top.  It seemed alot like CE-1 Vallee:  I that is why I&#39;m saying something about my sighting now after all these years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is a little curious is the fact that we waited for the object the next night and it appeared in exactly the same place but with no landing light, it just seemed to come from the northwest if i remember right and hovered for 30 minutes then left in the blink of an eye you might say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went down to where I thought it was hovering but found nothing. We left the same day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen anything like it again but sure would like to, it was very exciting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

REALLY,SINCE THE EVENT.  I DID TELL MY ORDER BROTHER ABOUT IT LONG AGO, HE WAS THE FIRST AND THE LAST, HE LOOKED AT ME STRANGLY, SO I NEVER TOLD A SOLE, TIL NOW. IM NOT A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE, SO PLEASE BARE WITH ME. IT WAS NEAR TO NOON, PROBABLY AFTER,MYSELF AND A FRIEND WERE ON OUR WAY TO THE FLOOD CONTROL. THIS IS THE SANTA ANA RIVER BED THAT RUNS NEXT TO THE 91 FWY.  IT WAS A CLEAR DAY, BLUE SKIES AND NORMALLY BREEZY.  WE WERE SITTING THERE HAVING A SMOKE(CIGARTTES)WHEN I NOTICED ABOVE AND TO THE RIGHT(WEST)OF THE ANAHIEM HILLS, A BLACK CIRCLE(HOLE) IN THE AIR. THATS 40degs(estimate) ABOVE THE HORIZON. IT WASNT A PERFECT CIRCLE, IT WAS TIPPED EITHER TOWARDS ME OR TIPPED AWAY FROM ME. I COULDNT TELL WHICH WAY IT WAS TIPPED, IN FACT I/WE COULDNT TELL HOW FAR AWAY FROM US IT WAS.  I WAS THE WIERDEST THING TO TRY TO GAUGE. I WOULD LOOK AWAY AND THEN TRY TO FOCUS BACK ON THE OBJECT.  I WOULD LOOK JUST ASIDE FROM IT AND THEN BACK AT IT AND THE PERCEPTION OF DEPTH IN GAUGING IT&#39;S DISTANCE WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO.  THE BLACK OBJECT WASNT JUST BLACK, IT WAS &#34;EMPTY OF LIGHT&#34;, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? THAT WAS THE OTHER CONFUSING THING ABOUT IT.  I THINK IT WAS ANOTHER REASON FOR THE DIFFICULTY IN GAUGING THE DISTANCE.  BACK TO THE LACK OF LIGHT.  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE LIGHT WITHIN THIS OBJECT, IT HAD HARD, I MEAN, HARD DEFINED CIRULAR EDGES TO IT(A HOLE), BUT THERE WAS NO LIGHT TO IT. I HAD ONE REACTION TO THIS OBJECT I VIEWED FOR 40 MIN, MY FRIEND HAD QUITE ANOTHER ONE. MY FRIEND,AFTER 10 MINUTES, REFUSED TO LOOK AT IT ANY MORE, IT FRIEGHTEND HIM AND SHOOK HIM UP BAD, A CURIOUS REACTION FOR HIM.  ME ON THE OTHER HAND, COULDNT TAKE MY EYES OF IT, I WAS, WELL, ALL MY NERONS IN MY HEAD WERE FIRING, I WAS AWED. AFTER 15 MINUTES OF TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS OBJECT AND TRYING TO GAUGE ITS SIZE AND DISTANCE. I DECIDED I WOULD LOOK AWAY AND LOOK BACK AT IT, ALMOST GAME LIKE, BUT IT WAS ALAWAYS THERE.  IT NEVER MOVED, CHANGED SHAPE OR VAREED IN COLOR( IF BLACK IS A COLOR). WELL, 40 MINUTES IS A LONG TIME TO LOOK AT AN OBJECT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE. I DIDNT GET BORED WITH IT, I ALMOST GOT TIRED LOOKING AT IT, IT WAS DIFFICULT TO VIEW BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF PERSPECTION, IT HAD ALMOST NO DEPTH. IT WAS EITHER 1/4 MILE OR 5 MILES FROM US. IT DISAPPEARED AND I DIDNT SEE IT LEAVE THE AREA, IM SORRY TO SAY. I HAVE ALWAYS DEEPLY REGRETTED NOT SEEING IT LEAVE OR DISAPPEAR. I LOOKED BACK IN ITS DIRECTION,AFTER TELLING MY FRIEND TO,&#34;GET A GRIP&#34; AND IT WAS GONE. I CAN STILL SEE IT IN MY MIND TO THIS DAY. IT WAS WONDERFUL AND STRIKING, FOR APPARRENTLY  BEING,&#34;NOTHING&#34; AT ALL. I HAVE NEVER MADE ANY CONCLUSIONS TO WHAT IS WAS. MAYBE IT WAS,&#34;NOTHING&#34;, MAYBE IT WAS JUST THAT,A HOLE, AN ABSENSE ANYTHING AT ALL.............A  P U R E  V O I D. HERES THE SIZE. IF YOU HOLD A DIME AT 9FT AWAY, TILT IT SLIGHTLY TOWARDS OR AWAY FROM YOU, THATS THE SIZE IT WAS. ON DISTANCE, MY BEST QUESS WOULD BE 1 MILE AT 40deg ABOVE THE HORIZON.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/1/73 23:00|Bentwaters AFB (near Woodbridge) (UK/England)||Fireball|5 mins|Bentwaters 1973|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43157.html|12|ndxe197311| Bentwaters 1973<n> <n><n> <n><n> During 1973 I worked at the USAF base at Bentwaters in Suffolk, England.  I was travelling home with a friend who was in the Air Force and we saw a bright yellow fireball behind some trees in the Tunstall Forest, east of the base.  Thinking a plane had crashed we drove around for about 15 minutes on forest roads and nver located anything.  Nothing was published on the fireball we saw and no planes reported missing.  This might just have been one of those unexplained mysteries, except that there were always those kind of mysteries around this area and this was 7 years before the now infamous Bentwaters incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was born and grew up in this area and as child in the 60s regularly saw things that I realise could not be explained away now, as they were then.  If I asked an adult then, it was always explained away as &#34;they must be testing something at the base&#34; but never as the Orford Ness Lighthouse as some have tried to explain the 1980 incident.  Anyone living there knew those lights and what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bentwaters closed abruptly in the mid 80s and local speculation is that it was to do with the incidences that occurred there during the 70s and  especially in 1980 and 1981. There has always been local talk of tunnels from Bentwaters to Woodbridge and other talk of secret testing that went on at the base and at nearby Martlesheam Heath  (an English base during WWII and now a Governement run installation).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another writer on this site proclaims the military never messes around when it comes to nukes.  Not really true, when one considers that in the 60s and 70s, Bentwaters was proclaimed as not having nukes and all the while kept a very low profile, while Greenham Common was busy with anti nuke protestors. Lakenheath was considered the headquarters USAF base in England and yet had no real &#34;mission&#34; at least at that time, yet their security was very tight. Meanwhile on Bentwaters, I as a civilian had my father drive me to the flight line to meet a friend who worked out there surrounded by nukes.  He pointed them out to us.  We could have easily have been someone other than who we were, which is a frightening thought in retrospect.  The security in and around Bentwaters was lacking and lots of people did come and go, virtually unchallenged, unless an &#34;alert&#34; was in force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really happened there, we may never know but I suspect there are lot of people who have come and gone from service at Bentwaters who have small bits of the puzzle and one day all those bits may just slot together and produce the finished jigsaw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

11/1/73 21:00|Viking (Canada)|AB|Sphere||First hand UFO report from 1973|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53574.html|13|ndxe197311| First hand UFO report from 1973<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last year, my Grandfather told me about a time he saw a UFO. I have heard the story a few times, but I got him to write it all down. This is what happened, in his own words-  Encounter with Flaying Saucers?  	One evening in November 1973, I was sitting in my living room reading when the phone rang. It was the mother of my daughter’s friend that lived about 8 km north of Viking, AB. She said to get my camera and come out fast as there is strange lights moving up and down the coulees - low and slow. The animals were going wild in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I phoned Don, who worked with me for Nova (pipe-line co) to go with me. On the way out we stopped at another farm. It was all lit up in the barn, the house and the yard. The dog was barking at the bush. We proceeded out to the friends place and they asked us in for a coffee. The TV was on and soon there was a lot of lines and static on the screen. Outside we go, sure enough there were seven orange colored lights in the south sky all in formation, roughly four miles away. I took pictures of this with a 400 mm telephoto lens. We got into the company half ton truck and headed out in the hills. I put the radio on a “no” station with the volume up and sat there waiting. Soon the radio had static. My companion looked out and up. There was a bright light right above us, roughly three or four hundred feet. How come the light appeared all of a sudden? We were looking all around, but didn’t notice it until the radio turned to static. I jumped out for more pictures. Being so close these pictures were all black. Maybe it gave off x-rays. If that’s the case why wouldn’t the whole roll be wiped out? And not just the close up ones? I don’t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light, to describe it was like looking into a cutting torch for welding, very bright orange and blue. It soon drifted off to the east, behind some hills. There was no sound at all. When I was photographing the formation of the lights, we could see some helicopters from the Wainwright Army base coming to check this. We would see the marker lights on them. These orange lights took off in a flash when they got close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Getting back into the truck, which I parked, it barely started, and that’s all. Something was running the battery down, for we could smell rotten eggs. This thing was reversing the polarity and running the battery down. Another few minutes and we would have been walking back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We returned to town to a service station where the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) and some people were talking about the sightings. A girl was giving her boyfriend hell for passing gas - but it was their battery. The police officer reported the same drained battery in his cruiser. The RCMP said the army base to the east, had nothing for maneuvers on and this cop had the farmer with him that owned the farm where we were. The cop, wanted to see my pictures first, but nothing turned out except the seven lights in formation at a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some farmers later told me their cows and horses they had run through the closed doors of the barn and into the trees. They would not come out as they could sense something out there. There was definitely something strange going on there. This gives a person a real eerie feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident in November 1973 is approximate.  PD))<n>
