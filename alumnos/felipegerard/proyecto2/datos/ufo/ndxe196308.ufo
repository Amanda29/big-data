I was lying in bed , at night , when suddenly , a bright blue light lit up the room , as if someone was welding with an electric welder, just outside my bedroom window .( My brother slept in the same room with me , but was not awakened. )<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up , and looked out the bedroom window , to see what was cauing the light ...  For some reason, I thought it was coming from a B-52 bomber  ( we had them flying overhead constantly back then, being on the flight path from Westover Air Force Base, in nearby Chicopee , Ma. They had nuclear weapons on the base back then ...)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway , there was no way it could be coming from a plane, as it was coming from the woods ,directly behind the house . There was a &#34; cart road there, that was the remnants of an old railroad track.That was where the light was coming from, but I could not see what was causing it ;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember CLEARLY thinking it was coming from a plane , but why , I don&#39;t know ... then, i could sense &#34;movement back there , no distinct figures at all, but, movement of a sort ,causing the light to change intensity .. shadows ,perhaps ... coming towards the house ...  and I suddenly got VERY tired , and for some reason, went to bed !<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my mom about it , in the morning, but she knew nothing about it ( my dad was working the late shift then ,and wasn&#39;t home .I had forgotten about that night , for ages , till I was watching something on the History Channel , that jarred a memory ..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then there was the time that My sister, brother and I &#34; disappeared , for the better part of a day ; We decided to go for a walk  ( we NEVER did that before, or since )  anyway ... we were gone all day ... and all I remember was suddenly finding myself standing on that SAME cart path , holding my brother and sister&#39;s hands ..<n> <n><n> <n><n> And i remember being yelled at , by my parents , for taking my younger brother and sister out into the woods ,,, ( I was 9- 10 , sis was 6 , brother was 5 ) ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something happened that day , but ... I don&#39;t know what ...  There have been other &#34;occurances at various times , but these were the two &#34;biggies&#34; .. there was another thing that happened ..  seems like a dream now .... involving one of those &#34; Gray &#34; beings ...   showing me something about Global warming , or something ,,, something to do with rain forests , coat hangers and an Electric drill... ????<n>
8/23/63 22:00|Broadalbin|NY|Light|10 min|I was 13 at the time and had a great interest in aviation,and still do with 32 yrs under my belt with USAirways.I was walking home and|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34494.html|2|ndxe196308| I was 13 at the time and had a great interest in aviation,and still do with 32 yrs under my belt with USAirways.I was walking home and saw two bright orbs in the sky behind the house over the trees. This is looking in the southeast direction.The orbs were not close and I would say they were at a distance of a few miles. They were very bright and stationary in the sky seperated but close. I called my mother and also our neighbor who was a high school science teacher.We all saw these bright orbs and the science teacher had no clue as to what they were.After awhile they started to move away from each other in opposite directions. One moved very slowly while the other was gone in a few secs. The teacher could not explaine what we had seen. He had 5 yrs of college under his belt in many sciences to be a teacher and had no clue. I might add at this point that the orbs were in the direction of the location of a US Navy Atomic Sub training site at West Milton NY. It was run by G.E.and had atomic ractors on this site to train navy crews for the subs. G.E. also tested ractors their. Admiral Richover father of our Nuclear Navy was always their. The site is still used today for the same purpose and is a secret base. I can`t be sure the orbs were over the site but it came to mind and was in the gereral direction. What was strange is what happened latter. I was in our home when we heard jets flying very low over our area. I ran outside and thier were jets flying low in sort of a search pattern. They flew over the house and i could see that they had streight wings not swept back wings. It was very odd and no orbs were seen at this time. The next few nights the same thing happened the. Low flying jets flying like they were looking for something. Again we saw no more orbs just the jets. As I said I have had a very strong passion for aircraft and this whole thing got me thinking and wondering. I was taken to an air force base open house at Griffiss AFB in Rome NY a while latter. It was about 65 miles Sout! hwest of Broadalbin.While their I saw RB-57`s which were based at the R&amp;D center at the base to do research in radars and electronic equipment. they have streight wings. Also there were T-33`s and F-89 Scorpians. All straight winged jets. I started thinking that some of these aircraft were the ones i saw those nights,but what they were doing or looking for is a mystary. They were not the orbs because jets don`t hang in the air motionless for ten mins. The orbs were not helos either because back then in the early 60`s there were none to be seen in upstate NY. Now we see them everyday but in the early 60`s helocopters were just not seen in the Albany Saratoga region.Ever since that sighting I have had not just a love for aircraft but started my interest in UFO`s.I know aircraft and those orbs were not aircraft as we know them and I think the Air Force was chaseing them those nights. I soloed in only 7 hrs back in 69 and as I said worked around all types of aircraft. When something strange landed at ALB people would ask me what the aircraft was.I always knew.I also worked on the flight line for 20 yrs on the night shift so I know what aircraft lites look like at night. Those orbs again were no aircraft. I have done aerobatics recently in WW-II AT-6`s and I bring up this point only because scientist like Seth Shostac saw there is no evidence. I say people like myself that have been in aviation know more about what is seen in the air to be an aircraft or an unknown. A pilot flying a 747 that sees something odd is not crasy.They don`t put crasy people in charge of airliners. When they speak up its to be heard not to be passed off. I have an example that will prove my point. I told this to Seth in an E-mail to prove that pilots say what they see as the truth. This is a true story and you might wantto bring this up on C.to C.  Its a true story. Back at Murak Dry Lake know Edward AFB in the 40`s the air force was testing the P-39 AeroComet. Our first jet aircraft. Above top secret. the plane had a fake prop put o! n it while on the ground so everyone would think that it was a propeller driven aircraft. The test pilot of the Bell AeroComet loved to play jokes so he would put a Gorilla Head on and a Top hat on this head and he would be flying this aircraft. He was seen close up in the air by other pilots flying the P-51 Mustang which was the top of the line fighter at that time. when they landed they would tell of seeing a aircraft with no propeller and being flown by a Gorilla in a Top Hat. The pilots discribed exactly what thet had seen but were not believed and sent to sick bay. This happened time and again with the same results. Its sort of proves a point that what a pilot sees and is brave enough to tell about should be taken as evidence and proof.They are up in the sky everyday and know when they see a flying object if its real or not. Just like myself. I know a star from a landing light on a plane. ((name deleted)) in Halfmoon NY   e-mail  ((e-mail address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

8/20/63 02:30|Camas|WA|Unknown|10-15 minutes|Prune Hill, Camas, Washington, a rural area above the Columbia River and across the river from PDX--I was in bed in a daylight basement|5/10/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36738.html|3|ndxe196308| Prune Hill, Camas, Washington, a rural area above the Columbia River and across the river from PDX--I was in bed in a daylight basement and something landed in my father&#39;s garden.  I could not move and my Siamese cat was beside me (2 times) and did not move and his body felt rigid.  Red lights whirled as if a red light rotating on top. RRR-rrr-RRR-rrr sound as it landed and the whole time. We had a part wolf dog who did not bark. The object stayed in the garden for about 10 minutes, it seemed but probably was less. Then it shot off and I was very aware of the dopler effect when it left. I think the lights became white when it took off. This happened 4 times over a period of 2 years and usually when my father&#39;s garden was flourishing. He had a lot of hybrid corn that he aquired from a friend. I told my family (I was 25-26 year of age at the time but spent Summers with my family) and they sort of laughed. Then my brother who had the room next to mine had the same experience and he heard someone going up the steps that went up to the upper yard and then believed me.  My father finally heard it and saw flashing lights in the upper yard (their bedroom was upstairs and on the other side of the house). This was probably five years after my experiences. My Father heard the sound and saw red lights through drapes but by the time he got up to look it took off.  Some years ago I mentioned to a friend who had just moved to Prune Hill if she had ever seen UFO&#39;s there and she gasped----She awakened her whole family and they watched a UFO in binoculars for 45 minutes in the middle of the night. This was probably 10 years ago. Camas is a papermill town and helicopters sometimes were heard there patroling the river where logs were often kept and I thought this was it at first but no chopper blade sounds. It was too close and I would have heard the blades. My explanation of landing there several times was to get samples from the garden. I have never documented this before so it is as best I can remember after all these years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, even though the witness does not indicate that fact.

I originally thought it might be a baloon, but they drift along and this did not. I estimate it could have been up to 30000 ft high.  I told my wife about it, but I don&#39;t remember if she came out to look.  I watched this for about 2 hrs. or more untill I finally got tired of looking up into the sky, and as it was almost sunset I went inside my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a final note I remeber it seemed to glisten in the sunlight, and that it was almost directly above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I have long thought that I should submit a record of this to someone who would add it to the data on this topic, and I am finally doing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me preface by saying that through the years, I have observed several objects that people who were with me at the time thought were UFO’s, but I knew they weren’t because I knew what they were.  One was a weather balloon, one a jetliner near the airport (when they have their landing light on at sunset, it is a striking sight), one a meteor close enough to hear the roar and light up the night sky and one a military missile in an inexplicable location.  However, the one sighting I can’t explain was the least visually striking.  I say all this to demonstrate that I have a decent amount of knowledge in explaining explainable sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One soft summer night which I believe was 1963, but may possibly have been 1962, my father, my three sisters and I went out on the patio to watch the Perseid meteor shower.  It was sometime in August.  We had a rollaway bed out there, and we all lay down on it sideways and side by side with each other.  We scanned the sky for shooting stars, which appeared at the rate of about one per minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of my sisters said, “look, two stars are colliding!”  We all looked where she indicated, and indeed, you could see two stars moving toward each other.  As we watched, they did, in fact, meet and merge into one, only to separate again after a few seconds.  After that, everyone else went back to looking for shooting stars, but I kept observing this phenomenon.  After a couple of minutes, I realized that only one of the two stars was in motion.  It kept moving on its steady path, and I kept watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it was a satellite.  Some months earlier, forewarned by a news broadcast, we had gone out to watch one of the early manmade satellites pass overhead.  It looked just like a moving star.  I suppose it reflected light from the sun, which enabled us to see it.  It had a steady progression across the sky and kept a fairly steady level of brightness.  After ten minutes or so, I realized it couldn’t be an orbiting satellite.  I noticed its apparent path across the sky was noticeably slowing.  I kept watching, and the next thing I noticed was that it was dimming.  I kept watching for perhaps half an hour, and it gradually slowed until it was essentially motionless in the sky, and it gradually dimmed until finally, it slowly became impossible to make out.  At first sight, it had the appearance of a medium to medium bright star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was clearly not a satellite or a meteor.  The only scenario I’ve ever been able to think of that matches my observation is that of a space ship in the process of leaving Earth’s orbit.  In 1963, we had no space ships which left Earth’s orbit.  What I saw was truly an unexplained flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be glad to answer any questions concerning this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

8/1/63 22:00|Wenatchee|WA|Formation|5 Seconds|V formation of 7 to 9 lights fly from horizon to horizon|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32533.html|7|ndxe196308| V formation of 7 to 9 lights fly from horizon to horizon<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the backyard of one of my childhood neighbor friends, with my friend. So this sighting was witnessed by my friend and myself. I am not positive of the date, this sighting occurred either in the summer of 1962 or more likely 1963. We were both shocked to see a V formation of lights composed of 7 or 9 points or globs of light pass completely across the sky, coming from behind the southern horizon, all the way to the northern horizon in approxamately 5 seconds. I had never then or now seen aircraft fly at this rate of speed. An airplane would take at least a couple minutes or longer to cross from horizon to horizon depending on altitude. I had the impression that their altitude was very high because there was absolutely no engine sound what so ever, although I have no way of knowing this for sure. They did not have the appearance of stars or meteorites, as they were not distinct points of light. They rather had a sort of oval or round shape but it was hard to tell because they had the appearance of diffused white light. We, as kids would, knew they were &#34;space ships&#34;. There was no other explaination. We had spent much time sleeping out in the backyard on hot summer nights counting shooting stars. I would be interested to hear if anyone else saw this that night, as they would have been obviousley seen by anyone in the whole Columbia River valley, that were looking up at the sky at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As an adult, the military has taught me to take on all challenges and to accept no fear, accomplish the mission. I am in my late forties and have done it all and seen it all.  Now before I die and leave this earth some day, somebody has to know this one little thing. I was about 7 and was in bed and the bright light flashed outside, so bright, the walls glowed. I covered up for a moment. Stuck my head out of the blanket and there was two things, big heads, large plate black eyes, slight glow looking dead at me. I hid in the blankets terrified for about 5 minutes, peaked out...they had their face right in my face. I have seen a lot of death and destruction in my military career, more than you can ever imagine, but this one childhood experience with this unknown thing lurking around my bedroom is the most frightening.<n>
8/1/63 02:00|Amsterdam|NY|Disk|3-4 min.|Observed 2 saucer shaped objects, traveling at high speed, vertically and horizontally.|6/2/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02892.html|9|ndxe196308| Summary : Observed 2 saucer shaped objects, traveling at high speed, vertically and horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Staying with friends whose home was in the country.  No surrounding light.  I Awoke out of a sound sleep, went to the window and was looking out when I observed a round, large object with visible bluish-green lights around the bottom of the object.  It was charging back and forth and up and down at a very fast speed.  At that time I woke my husband to view this, and we then both witnessed a second, idenically shaped object approaching the first one.  Together they would go up and down and after a minute or so they both took off at a very high speed.  I called the local police station and asked if they had received and reports on strange events in the shy, and the officer stammered and him- hawed around and finally said &#34;no Ma&#39;M&#34;  I could tell he was obviously not telling the truth.  Also the friends we were staying with had had a more spectacular experience about 10 months prior to this one.  They had a greenhouse, and one night as they were potting plants a large round object hovered over them, above the greenhouse.  At that time they became immobilized.  After a couple of minutes, this object soundlessly lifted off and flew away.  At this point our friends were once again able to move.  Out friends at this time were mature, 50+ people.  They were honest and never would have made anything like this up.  The wife had told me the story, only after making me promise never to let her husband know she had told me.  He rightfully thought that at time, people would think he was crazy.  They have both now passed on so I feel free to relate their experience.<n>
