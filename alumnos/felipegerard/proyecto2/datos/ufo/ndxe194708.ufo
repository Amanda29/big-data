The date, year, and time are approximate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When she was a young girl, her family lived near Baron Fork Creek east of Proctor, Oklahoma.  Around sunset, her father told her to go and fetch the milk cow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She headed toward a wind-break of trees.  Up from behind the row of trees rose a shiny silver, cigar-shaped ship.  There was no sound.  However, she could feel a vibration in her throat and lungs (may indicate a low, sub-sonic vibration).<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the blink of an eye, the ship zipped sideways and disappeared out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She fetched the cow home and never said a word about the incident to her family.  I asked her why.  She said her parents wouldn&#39;t have believed her and she didn&#39;t want to be laughed at by her brothers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

As I was young I was put to bed earlier but was listening to the adults talking in the living room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had no electricity or running water so when I wanted to go to the toilet which was an outhouse in the corner of the shed my father escorted me to the shed and went back inside the cabin door to get away from the mosquitoes where he could still see the shed.  While in the outhouse every minute or so I could hear a whirring from far away getting nearer then going away.  When I ran back inside the cabin and told my father he said it was probably just an owl or other creature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later all the adults were outside the back door as someone had gone to the outhouse and saw this disc shaped object which seemed to be slightly lit up and making a whirring sound coming into view from the south, passing almost overhead and disappearing around Mount Baker.  I sneaked out and actually saw one ( one passed every minute or so) before I got caught and was sent back in.  We had an old battery radio (tube) and when listening to the local news the next day we heard several reports of the same sighting from the village.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for sending in this interesting report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere to Brian Vike for sharing the information with our Center.

I was sca|4/1/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16880.html|5|ndxe194708| My grandmother woke me up to go to the front house get my uncle to check on the bright blueish light out behind our cottage.  I was scared to get wake my uncle so I WENT OUT BACK. I looked up and there was a large disk object hoovering over head with multi colored lights on it.  The next thing I know I am being woke up to explain how my aunts vegetable and flower garden are totally distroyed.  Completely to dried to ash like conditrion.  My grandmother tried to tell them it was something in the sky but they would not listen and called my mother to come get me, I could not stay the rest of the summer.  I complained about being sick and having severe cramps but they said I was facking it so as to get to stay.  When my mother got there to get me she was real mad at my grandmother for defendind me and mad because I was sun burn and blistered and my head was bleeding from a small hole or puncture.  She claimed I must have gotten hit with a nail or something.  I was 8, 9, or 10 years old because it was the summer my grandmothers brother died. It was on 8th street across from the golf course.  I went back to see if I would remember the house in the late sixties early seventies and the house had not been changed.  I did not ask to go in back or to see if the garden area to see if the ground was still dead. A short time after my expierence my uncle told me about Mr. Arnold and his UFO sighting.  My uncle was a pilot and owner of a single engine piper cub.  He took me flying once and I was thrilled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
