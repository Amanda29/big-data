It will no accept anything I enter.  This happened in 1937.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was back of our animal pens and looked up to the right.  I saw what looked like a mason jar with a light in it following the highway 99E about 500 to 1000 feet in the air.  It was silent and traveling about 30 to 60 miles per hour.  It followed the highway until it went out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The highway at that time was the only direct north/south highway between Washington and California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 12 years old at the time and I mentioned it but got no response from anyone.  I thought it might be a meteror but I know it wasn&#39;t because it was traveling rather slow and parallel to the groung.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
