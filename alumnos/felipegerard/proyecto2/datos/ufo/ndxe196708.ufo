We both grew silent and I observed what appeared to be two sets of lights alternately blinking.  These were in the northwestern sky about 100 feet above the ground and maybe 1/4 mile away.  After about 5 minutes, something prompted me to get in the house.  At the same time we both jumped up and ran inside.  We were 10 and 8 respectively.  I never knew how to describe it until I saw a similar video on the history channel.  In that video the craft was round with a row of lights around the middle.  There was the same alternate blinking of two sets of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved in a slow erratic path due north, sometimes appearing to wobble, stop and move again. As it moved overhead of my position the object was about the size of a dime held at arms length, I also could make out a blue halo of light around the outer rim and a yellow glow from the center of (crafts) belly. I ran into our house and yelled for my mother to come outside and we watched the UFO as it would dissappear and reappear at a higher altitudes.It also seemed to change shape as if it were plasma but it was far to our north by now and getting lost in the haze of city lights, it also seemed to be joined by another light but it was so far away it was hard to tell from our position. We never saw or heard any reports in the newspaper of what we saw, and later tried to contact Len Stringfield at his office in Cincinnati but he was out of town, and didnt contact us about it.<n>
8/25/67 23:30|Playa del Rey|CA|Oval|4-5 min.|Oval light (the size of a five story building) sighted from shore had no reflection on water, no sound and traveled at breakneck speeds|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67652.html|3|ndxe196708| Oval light (the size of a five story building) sighted from shore had no reflection on water, no sound and traveled at breakneck speeds<n> <n><n> <n><n> Intro: I am a 59-year-old retired clothing manufacturer and designer.  I am not one to claim UFO sightings at every turn.  My dad, brother and I did see a meteor fly over the west side of Los Angeles back in 1962 and thought that it landed in our neighborhood but in fact it landed in Canada, according to the news report.  I concluded that things in the sky are illusive, after seeing that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting: In late August of 1967 I was enjoying the warm evening with my girlfriend under a blanket on the west facing Dockweiler State Beach at Playa del Rey in Los Angeles.  It was about 11:30 pm and the beach was closed to the public by this time.  The beach is directly under the take off path of the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) but this night the planes were diverted to take off to the east.  This is a practice reserved for windy conditions but there was no wind that night.  The number of flights at the airport was down to a minimum by late night back in those days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had noticed a light due west from us at the horizon when we walked up to the area where we set the blanket on the sand.  I figured that it might be a usually seen tanker on the way to the docks in San Pedro.  We started smooching and an eerie feeling came over me, like someone was watching us but when I looked around I noticed the light on the horizon had begun to move closer to the shore at a swifter than natural speed.  It was at sea level, I figured, but some things were missing.  No reflective light and no sound.  This made me stop and pay attention.  As the object closed in toward the beach it’s size and altitude became more apparent.  I sat up when the light seamed to be about a mile off the shore and could clearly see that the object was actually about 2,000 feet in the air.  (I often frequented the Hawthorne airport and became accustomed to object altitude.)  I ‘guestimate’ that the size and shape was oval and the volume of a five-story building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light emitted from the object was not painfully bright but it had a glow or halo around it as though I were looking through a frosted glass.  It came directly toward me and slowed to a halt at maybe 100 feet from the shore.  I slowly moved to the right over the coast line to about the area of Venice Beach (about 12 miles from our location.)  This took less than a minute and then it returned in a flash.  It hovered over the are where it began to browse for about two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then rose straight up to about 4,000 feet and quick as a click it shot off toward the southeast.  I could not see it after it passed out of view beyond the sandy hill at Pacific Coast Hwy.  Perhaps it traveled as far as Disneyland in Anaheim.  I was not terrified but disturbed and uneasy about what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was trying to convince myself what had just happened when as quietly and quickly as it left it had returned to the position where it began it browsing just off the beach.  It sat there for about 15 seconds and began making its way back to the horizon.  At some point near the horizon it began to ascend at break-neck speed.  In an instant it rose what appeared to be in an outward arch and disappeared into the night sky.  The entire episode lasted less than 5 minutes but left a lifetime of excitement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((woman&#39;s name deleted)), my girlfriend, did not experience what I saw but was equally uneasy by what she did see.  I believe she saw the light as it left the area the final time.  She was lying down with her face up during the episode and for some reason I felt that I had to protect her from whatever I was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left the beach, tout suite, and never spoke of the incident to each other for fear, maybe, that we would know for sure that something was there.  ((deleted))  We soon broke up (not related to that episode.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
8/25/67 03:15|Princeton|ID|Disk|30 mins.|Flying Saucer: August 1967-A Teen's Observation|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43605.html|4|ndxe196708| Flying Saucer: August 1967-A Teen&#39;s Observation<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized recently that I have never written about this event or an in depth report anywhere.  A few years ago, I went to a site about UFO sightings and left a very brief version of it, but nothing more than a few paragraphs and it was incomplete. It seemed that everytime I began writing about it in full detail, it sounded like a bad screen play for a &#34;B&#34; sci-fi movie. Now, I have decided to recall and record as much detail and as many of the impressions that I can remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Summer before I entered High School was when the experience occurred, it was a week or so before school would start again. It was late in August 1967. I would 15 in a couple of weeks,  The closest I can calculate to the day would be August 24th, or 25th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were only a couple of kids my age in my neighborhood. One was a cousin; the other was a friend who lived just down the street, two houses down and across the street. He was one year behind me in school, but we were close to the same age. I liked hanging around with with him but he had a mischievous side that my Mom did not trust and our time together was always limited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One summer afternoon he asked if I could camp out in his yard and followed up by his Mom providing the assurance to my Mom that it was alright. Curiously, and in a very unaccustomed flexibility, my Mother said &#34;Yes&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, after dinner I ran down the street a few houses, crossed the street and starting hanging around with my friend and his younger brothers in their back yard.  I found out the plans had changed and we were going to sleep in his tree house instead of a tent. His brothers were going to use the tent, a small detail my Mom could be spared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An uneventful evening began to unfold. Earlier in the evening I went back to my house. My parents were gone someplace. I went into their bedroom and removed my Dad&#39;s pocket watch from his bureau. One I&#39;d given him for Father&#39;s day once. It had a radium dial which would glow in the dark. Then, went back to the treehouse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point his Mom came out with some snacks. It was shaping up to be a good night, Steve was being unaccustomedly polite to his Mom, a detail that gave me a sense of confidence that nothing was going to go wrong. As fun as Steve could be, I also had a bit of suspicion about him. He had a knack for practical jokes and doing unpredictable or dangerous things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We each had a flash light, enough light for us to play game after game of &#34;Fish&#34; or &#34;Rummy&#34; or &#34;Poker&#34; for pennies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got darker his brothers went inside at the behest of their Mom when it seemed they could no longer get along nicely. This was about 10pm.  Our goal then was to stay up as long as possible.  Since we never got the chance to hang out a lot we did a lot of talking. There were questions about my extended family...mostly the girls...an inventory of how I was related to this person or another, and  the same questions from me about him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Staying awake past 1 AM was not difficult.  Another two hours passed of playing cards and snacking. About three AM we were both getting sleepy. ((name deleted)) had to use the bathroom and went into his house and was out in a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the mean time, I snuggled down into some light bedding and I was ready to sleep. When ((name deleted)) returned, he was as full of energy as ever and was standing up in the tree house looking out over the wall commenting on how many stars he could see.  It was a safe structure, the walls came up to our chests but there was no roof and the old tree it was in just had some major branches. No leaves grew on this tree, it was mostly dead and we had an unobstructed view of the sky above us at all times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After just a minute, ((name deleted)) thought he saw something while looking at the stars.  From him...&#34;Gah! What is THAT?&#34;  &#34;Get up and look at this..there&#39;s is something FLYING around out here.&#34; ..  I was ready to sleep and didn&#39;t want to get up. I was reminded of ((name deleted))&#39;s penchant for practical jokes and could imagine his riducule if I had jumped up in amazement, I could imagine the story that would be told. I was stubbornly not taking the bait...<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I&#39;m asleep.&#34; I said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From him: &#34;No, no...you&#39;ve got to SEE this, it looks like a flying saucer or something!&#34; with a hushed but very excited tone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: &#34;Uh-Huh&#34;...&#34;You know jets fly around here all the time&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> True enough, Seymor Johnson Air Force Base in Goldsboro, N.C. was only 12 miles away, and my Dad worked there as a Civil Servant. Low flying jets were not uncommon night or day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From him: &#34;No, no!&#34;  &#34;Get up..Get up...this is really weird!&#34;  By now, I was getting curious...he said he saw something flying, but I heard no noise. How could this be? I knew he might be doing another one of his practical jokes. If I jumped up in alarm...he could tell the story for the next two weeks of how he&#39;d tricked me. Slowly, I got up and pretended to not be interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;What?&#34;...from me in a calm tone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Him: &#34;Look it&#39;s over there!&#34; And he pointed in the direction of the end of the street. Directly to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: &#34;I thought you said it was flying around&#34; (At first I didn&#39;t see anything.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Him: &#34;It was...it&#39;s over there now.&#34; pointing low, not high in the air but down the street in a low trajectory just over the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see the houses and trees and other things not darkened into shadows by a few of street lights and it was not a completely pitch black night either. The moon was out. I noted it was about 3:15am by looking down at my Dad&#39;s glowing pocket watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Down the street and across the road was another street, not exactly a continuation of our street, but a slight jog over. At the end of that street and not very high over the trees was a craft I could see but I wasn&#39;t certain of the distance or scale. It was ovoid in shape with only a few lights that didn&#39;t seem spectacular or unusual for any flying air craft. It wasn&#39;t moving but hovering in the same way a helicopter would hover.  I thought I was looking at the body of a helicopter head on without the benefit of being able to see the side or rear. The shape was like a bubble that was flattened on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said: &#34;It&#39;s a helicopter&#34;...Then, as soon as I got the words out of my mouth, I realized I was wrong. The object was closer than I had thought and a helicopter would be making noise, a lot of noise at that distance. The familiar &#34;beating&#34; of the air sound was not present and at this distance, it would have been a very noticeable sound, instead, there was no sound. It was only two &#34;short&#34; blocks away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when I really started looking to see what it was.  It continued to float without motion or sound but only for a few seconds. Then, it started moving in a straight line parallel to the street it was over and in our direction. We were mesmerized, mostly I think, because we didn&#39;t know what it was or wasn&#39;t. We didn&#39;t think to be scared and it held our attention out of curiosity, We watched it wondering what it was going to do next. The shape and size of became more clear as it approached our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It crossed the road at the end of our street, then it continued moving slowly until it was over an empty lot beyond the first house on our street. Then it slowed down seeming to drift. By now, the shape was distinct, and very much like a saucer or shallow bowl turned upside down with another saucer under it for a bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The path it was taking was directly in line above the houses across the street from us. It drifted over the first house.  It drifted over the next house, the house that belonged to an Aunt and Uncle. It continued and drifted over my house the third on the street. It slowed down and stopped right over my house. It was amazingly low. Only 75-100 ft. overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it moved forward again to the next house, the fourth house on that side of the street. I don&#39;t remember Steve and I saying a word by now, somehow thinking that if we breathed wrong it would give away our position. By now it was almost directly across the street from us, diagonal by only the width of one lot.  I could begin seeing some of the details more clearly. It was not the flashing light show many people report, just a couple of small lights in the front and the same near the back. It was about the size of two small houses. I&#39;d say 80 ft. end to end. There was some sort of structure that zigzagged across a segment of the upper domed portion, like a system of trapezoids, alternating in inverted shapes. This structure appeared to suggest windows, but there were no windows, just more of a segmented ovoid panel outlined in trapezoids in spaces where windows should be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds, the object floated backwards over my Aunt &amp; Uncle&#39;s house again and came to rest. It was high enough that I could see some of the under structure but low enough I could see the profile also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While floating there, a hatch slid open on the bottom which was evident by the light was visibly appearing from inside and projecting toward the ground. (The light was already on when the hatch opened.) The hatch was squarish and off center from the the bottom of the craft and this light from the inside appeared to create a shaft of light onto my Aunt &amp; Uncles&#39; house. Then the craft moved forward and became stationary again over my house with the shaft of light illuminating our roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds, the light appeared to flicker and the squarish shaft of light went out. A few seconds passed and another light flickered back on except this time, it was a different shape, not the  shaft of a light formed from the hatch opening, but a tighter and more &#34;focused&#34; light and it seemed to have movement, not the stationary light as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the hatch the source of the light then began a small sweeping and circular motion around my house, lighting up the back yard and it&#39;s immediate vicinity. Then the source of the light protruded from the hatch. It reminded me very much of the kind of search light that people used to mount on their cars. It began to pivot. It behaved as though it was on an articulating mechanical arm. The light started making circles around my yard and house and then in deliberate swinging arcs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light began swinging outward toward the neighboring houses and then across the street. It arced back and forth, sweeping it&#39;s light further and further away from it&#39;s location with each pass. ((name deleted)) and I stared silently and dumfounded.  In a couple of arcs, it was swinging it&#39;s light into the parking lot across from where we were, which co-incidentally was the parking lot for the municipal swimming pool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched as the light continued to swing and then the light hit the fence for the swimming pool and the arcs continued sweeping wider and further out.  I could tell that soon the sweeps would extend to reach our location, and right after that the light began to swing near the edge of ((name deleted))&#39;s yard. I was beginning to feel a little frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the next sweep the light made it&#39;s way toward us but before it arrived I ducked behind the wall of the tree house with my back against it. My friend however continued to stand there with his usual insensibility to danger. I remember looking up and seeing the tree we were in being lit up and my friend stood there squinting into the light, his hands still holding the top edge of the wooden tree house wall. The light did not appear to be of unusual brightness, but it had a bluish cast. By now, it was no longer swinging back and forth but fixed on our location. My friend appeared slack jawed above me and he was not looking away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said: &#34;Get down!,&#34; but he continued to stand there almost frozen and he began mumbling something I couldn&#39;t understand. Not wanting to desert him, I decided I would stand up. I looked at my father&#39;s glowing pocket watch again. It was 3:20 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood up and looked over the wall that came up to my rib cage. In the time that I was below the wall, the source of the light had changed. Rather than being the sweeping spot light from under the craft, it was coming from a smaller light that was emanating from the edge about one third of the way from the front.  I remember thinking thinking it could be some kind of bizarre craft from Seymour Johnson with Air Force personnel in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a little worried that word of the event might get back to my father, but then I thought, &#34;We haven&#39;t done anything wrong&#34;... we never even left my friend&#39;s yard that night. So I stood there confident that what was going to follow was not going to result in my getting into trouble. There was no sound from the craft, it was continuing to hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, another light came on near the other one and it began to point more directly at me. This light had a quick flickering quality as with some kind of semaphore or a pattern. I remember thinking, &#34;I will NEVER forget this.&#34;  Then the lights flickered off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I recall clearly was sitting down in the tree house and again looking at the glow of the pocket watch. It was 3:45am. Twenty five minutes had passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we stood up again to see the vessel continuing to float. I could then hear a low whining sound, it sounded as though some kind of momentum was building but it was very quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the vessel began to pivot. Still parallel to the ground it just turned away and it began to move off directly to the north with a slight gain in altitude. There was a purplish discharge of light around the entire vessel at this point.  It moved slowly at first then instead of speeding away with a steady increase in speed...it made a sudden leap and it was only slightly higher in the sky and about 500 hundred yards away.  Then moved off faster for a second or so, then it made another leap in speed and distance which would have placed it at the altitude of a low aircraft.  It appeared to be bright object in the sky at this point moving off quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it made another leap. This time, it made a long bright arc away from where it was. The bright arc went high and to the west and then it was gone. In all, this took about ten seconds for this sequence to pass. All of this without any sound other the low whining sound during it&#39;s initial ascent. There was no sonic boom, no sound of turbines, or an engine of any kind. An ordinary jet would have created a heavy sonic boom and this thing was flying faster than any jet I had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I stood there in astonished silence. I remember ((name deleted))&#39;s hair literally standing up on end and every time he touched it, it crackled with static. He said mine was the same way and my hair crackled as I ran my hand through it. This went away after a minute or so. Incredibly, we went to sleep after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, both of us remember feeling powerless to relate what we had seen, but this didn&#39;t stop my friend.  He thought we should be telling everybody we saw. I didn&#39;t. He began telling everybody about the siting which brought the predicable disbelief, which was also projected onto me now. He also had a reputation for exaggeration and now, the more detail we related was followed by an equally heightened disbelief by the listeners. He would have been the epitome of an unreliable witness by all past accounts, but this time...he was right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t talk about the event very much.  About a week later, school began. When he would see me he would begin telling the story and asking me to verify it. My verification amounted to little. I was going in to the 9th grade, he was going in to the 8th and I thought the best thing I could to maintain any credibility as a 9th grader was not to talk about it. The event then served to separate us, rather than creating a bond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fell silent about the event. I might occasionally mention I had seen a UFO when television began to popularize the topic during the 70&#39;s, but I never related any details. Even saying I had seen a UFO brought the usual scorn and disbelief. I did nothing to convince anyone of what I had experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept the experience to myself for a long time. Never talked about it. I would see so called pictures of UFO&#39;s in newspapers and discounted them as valid because they did not look like the one we saw. At that time I was not prepared to believe that anything other than the type of vessel we had seen was authentic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My senior year of High School, I did see and article in a newspaper with a photograph of an object much like the one we saw. The photo was taken in Norway. I have seen footage of a UFO shot in Mexico that seemed remarkably similar in the past few years. By some accounts, the craft I saw was not sensation. It didn&#39;t blink, or spin, or bounce and weave. It floated and flew off at great speed, sometime reports would have similar details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 25 years after the event, I made it a point to find my friend who is still living near our home town. Something was drawing me toward the idea that if I could write about it effectively, perhaps some of the scorn might have waned since there was growing number of reports in the media.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When he and I talked, the details matched just as we had lived them years ago. We never talked about the missing time, he seemed uncomfortable to go any further.  So was I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did find moon data on that night to verify how much ambient light there would have been since the object was not initially emitting any light until it left.

It was a cigar shaped object and it came to a complete stop, hovering in the air. As it did so, it started to grow and mushroom in size, throbbing and glowing circles of light around it. First one circle of light, and then another like as if you throw a stone in a lake and there is a ripple effect all around the stone. This is how the light grew around the object. We were not able to fully observe as we were scared, and ran inside the house away from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both very well balanced people, never had taken any drugs at the time and entirely health concious vegetarians.

There were three of us camping under the star lit sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were laying in our sleeping bags we were, of course, looking up at the sky, watching the stars and just talking about the day we had hiking and wading in the surrounding streams.  This was in the summer, July or August of 1967 or 1968.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I am writing you is about an event we all saw but have yet heard anything about in the news, UFO stories on the History Channel or any other media.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were watching the stars, my brother first noticed the peculiar event.  There was a bright light that appeared to have a body to it but it was in the area of the stars so it was too far away to tell exactly.  We did not have binoculars or a telescope but could see it plainly with our regular eye vision.   The light or object, as it was,  was moving in direct lines at no particular pattern knocking the stars that we could see, away from the center area to form a big hole in the star pattern.   We watched, amazed, for about 30 to 40 minutes as this object cleared the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We still talk about it to this day among ourselves and have, to many other people throughout the years, and nobody has ever heard of the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 60 years old now and to this day I still do not know what it might have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am, basically, just looking for a possible answer to ease my mind and that of my brother and my high school friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has there been anyone else that has reported this incident??  I am just real curious.  Please let me know.<n>

We were about 1 mile east of it when I mentioned to her that the object wasn&#39;t moving. As we approached the intersection, it was still houvering about 100 yds off to our left side above a house. The object made no noise, and was dark metailic gray in color. It had several lights on it, but no windows. It was about the size of a small piper cub aircraft.  It&#39;s shape was best described as a small boxcar type military plane. It begain to move sideways to the right as we pulled out onto hwy 50, and then disappeared over the hilltops. It did not make any noise, and moved very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As stated above, my ex=wife and I saw the object very clearly and drove ahead to my parents house which was about 2 miles from the sighting. We got a camera and went back, but never saw it again. We have told a few people the last few years, but felt that we would be ridiculed by our peers if we spoke of the event.  I have been a police officer all of my life and my wife was a homemaker at the time.<n>

8/19/67 22:20|Novomikhailovka (USSR)||Fireball|2-3 min|Fireball shape object over the Black Sea shore|3/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27059.html|10|ndxe196708| Fireball shape object over the Black Sea shore<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a warm and absolutely clear, typical southern late evening on the Black Sea resort, on the shore of the calm Black Sea. The small village (Novo –Mikhailovka, 30 miles West of Tuapse) positioned in the center of the small sea gulf and our camp (summer camp of Polytechnic Institute of Leningrad) occupied the shoreline right behind the pebble beach of the Black Sea. My girlfriend and I walked down the beach about ¾ of the mile towards the narrow shore and tall cliff with very rocky beach. Not too far from the beach (2-3 meters into shallow water) there was a square shape rock about 2x2x2 meters. It was really fun to climb on that rock and sit on its warm surface, slowly giving away its warmth accumulated during hot and sunny day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Typical for that area and time of the evening, sky was almost black and stars were bright and vivid,  no city lights. The horizon was barely seen against the sky, almost black against black background. The landscape of that area consist of hills and valleys, on the left (from my position on the rock facing the camp and gulf) I was able to see the beginning of the cliff. Straight ahead in the distance of 1 to 3 miles were hills, covered 1/4 on the horizon. At the foot of the hill I could see some lights from the small buildings and from our camp, stretched along the shoreline. It was dark, but I could see some elements of landscape and was able to judge the distances, thanks to the bright stars and very small lights from the camp. In addition I was well familiar with this area, it was my third summer I spend at this camp as the member of scud diving team. It was no wind and very calm. No sounds, except really faded sounds of music from the dance court in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I noticed rather bright object, moving silently from the left to right below the hilltops. The object I can describe as the &#34;fireball.&#34;  It had the size of the medium size moon. It was glowing and had the reddish in the center and yellowish colors to the outer diameter. It was slowly moving through the sky and was visible on the backgrounds of the hills. But it did not illuminate any area under it.  It had a visible diameter and shape of the round ball. I can roughly estimate its diameter as 4 to 10 miters Therefore the distance from me and to the object, and the fact that it was seen against the hills (known distance of several miles to the furthest hills) could be determined as 2/3 to 2 miles. It was slowly following the descending trajectory, slow and steady. It than quietly disappeared, I would say landed, in the woods within the hills, 1-2 miles from the shore. (The hillsides are covered with thick and mixed southern trees and bushes and it was practically impos sible to get to that area. The next day we made an attempt to find the place of where it could fall or lend, but could not find any signs of object.) The most unusual in movement and appearance of the object was the position of the tale of &#34;flames,&#34; which if it were a normal falling object or burning meteorite would follow the trajectory of the fall.  In reality the tale was turned about 10 -15 o counterclockwise, pointing the end of the tile to 8 o’clock position, and DID NOT FOLLOWED the trajectory like blown fire tale would normally be. That was very strange to watch such an unnatural movement. The tale size was about ½ of the diameter of the object in length and 1/3 of the diameter thick. The whole object had a shape of the mirror image of the punctuation mark, colon, rotated with the round point to the right and the tale to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object, at my opinion, was obviously not a meteorite: it moved too slowly for the falling meteorite. The distance of couple of miles or less from the moment I register it in my field of view to its disappearance in the hills this object being seen for 2-3 minutes. It moved really slowly. It also had a visible diameter and shape. And the most important, the position of the &#34;flaming&#34; tale,  it should follow the direction of the trajectory, but it was not; it was rotated down, counterclockwise 10 -15 degrees.<n>

I was behind my house in the Fairview Manor housing development(along Lake Shore Drive) and upon looking over the area of Newton Creek, I saw a perfectly round object that appeared to be a few hundred feet above the ground. It was dark-colored, maybe dark brown. It seemed to be about a quater of a mile away. It seemed to be about 150 feet in diameter. It moved very slowly from my right to my left and seemed to be shaped like a &#34;globe&#34;; after a few minutes, it&#39;s left to right momentum stopped and the object turned from being &#34;round&#34;, and started to look &#34;oval&#34; until it finally turned into a thin line that disappeared from my sight!I remember the urge to want to run and try to find a camera, but being totally taken aback by what I was looking at, even when it appeared as &#34;just a round object&#34;. It made no sound and was very well defined against the sky behind it. I realized as it disappered that I was looking at a &#34;disc&#34; the whole time!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was 13 years old at the time, and it was about 9:30 at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a round illuminated globe through the trees in the direction of south/south east. It was about the size of a full moon and I assumed it was till I realized the moon itself was out also more to the southest.  It was clear, no clouds and average summer night temperture.  As I stood in my back yard, facing in a generally south direction the object came over the trees towards me into view.  It was travelling north west about a lazy 5-10 MPH straight and level course was silent and with no trail.  It was about 200 feet from me. probably about 75-100 above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will now describe what I saw, even though its 38 years later I have a razor sharp memory of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a globe, approx 25-30 feet in diamenter. The globe glowed light green. It was not necessary a solid object, although it could be.  It had a haze around it, sort of like looking at a car headlight in fog.  Note however, that the haze only surrounded the object a foot or so, as it was a clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The haze was without question caused by the object. The haze was unusual in that it resembled fog, but was not fog. The were NO other lights on the object of windows or the like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was completely silent.  As it continued to approach in my direction and was not to far from being directly overhead, bright flashes began coming out of the bottom of the object. These were not lights or beams of light, but very closely resembled the bright white flashes one sees when you use an electric arc welder.  Almost identical.  So much so, I am sure it was some type of electrical device causing it.  The flashes were so bright it lit up the top of a 30 foot tree under the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time was there any noise.  At this point I had an intense feeling of fear and ran in the back door to my house.  I did not say anything to my mother, but she must have noticed something was wrong as she said, &#34;you look like you&#39;ve seen a ghost.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later I advised her what I saw, and when I gathered the nerve to look outside again, the object was long gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My guess is that it was one of the following. 1. an alien spacecraft. 2. Some sort of life form, or 3. some still unknown electical phenomenon.  I lean either toward an unknown life form or electrical phenomenon, as I don&#39;t feel there was a crew inside, but I also do not feel it was a natural occuring event, but was under some kind of intelligent control or the object itself had intelligence and I had the feeling it knew I was standing in my yard looking at it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bottom line, my mind doesn&#39;t know what to make of what my eyes saw, and probably I will never find the answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I don’t remember the exact year this sighting took place.  It was when I was about 7 years old.  That would place it in the summer of  1967.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My siblings and I often slept outside on an elevated deck in our backyard when the weather was warm. On one such night I was out there with one of my sisters who was already asleep. I was lying in my sleeping bag looking up at the sky. I noticed some lights low on the horizon over Puget Sound. They looked pretty much like the kind of lights you would expect to see on an airplane. I think they were white, green and red. They caught my attention because they were so low and they just sat there motionless. At first I thought they must be helicopters but there was no sound. I estimate they were one and a half or two miles away. It was a calm night and it seemed I should have been able to hear their engines easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them for a minute or two, trying to figure out what they were. Suddenly one of the light groups shot almost straight up into the sky at an incredible speed. It moved so fast my eyes could barely follow it. In less than two seconds it simply vanished in the distance overhead. It seemed to move in a jerky, stuttering manner, starting and stopping very rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My jaw just dropped.  At that moment I almost pissed in my pants, as children that age are prone to do when frightened. My next instinct was to jump out of my sleeping bag and run inside the house but I knew the door was locked. There were still two of these &#34;things&#34; in the sky. Using the logic of a seven year old I decided to hide my head inside the sleeping bag and stay very still, hoping they wouldn&#39;t see me. I never saw what happened to the other two objects. I was one scared kid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/15/67 20:30|Melbourne|FL|||Contact but not a vehicle sighting; 1967 evidence of collusion.|7/20/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/111/S111686.html|16|ndxe196708| Contact but not a vehicle sighting; 1967 evidence of collusion<n> <n><n> <n><n> Space Station:  One warm night when we were living in Melbourne Village, on West Pine Road, I was having trouble sleeping.  Our bed had its head against the wall and the two jalousie windows to the front yard passed for a head board.  I remember leaning on my elbows, and gazing out toward the ((name deleted--neighbor&#39;s)) back yard.  They had a cement-block compost station, into which they threw the copious mounds of palm fronds, pine boughs and cones which fell into their yard.  They were an older couple and had time to lovingly groom their yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> West Pine Road is a dead end.  Until recently, like many roads in the Village, it had remained unpaved and without street-lights.  Now, however, there was a street light and new asphalt.  Still, the road was quiet, deserted, the few homes set back in the trees of their large lots.  The ((name deleted--the neighbors&#39;)) yard looked like a park, like a glen in a small wood, a sylvan stand, idyllically bathed in the pale golden glow of the single street-light, high as the moon on its pitchy pole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But what to my amazed eyes then happened.  Something so strange and unexpected, so bizarre.  For years, I was unable to speak words to give my listeners an understanding of what I saw.  Now, thanks to 30 years of &#34;special effects&#34; and Sci-Fi technology, I can come closer.  Have you ever seen a film where travelers in future civilizations &#34;wink&#34; in and out of locations?  There seems to be a slit in the air and they step through?  Well, this is something akin to what I witnessed.  What I saw was the scene that I had been watching, the still, pastoral night-woods, &#34;freeze&#34; momentarily and become like a painting of itself.  From behind this &#34;set&#34;, this &#34;prop&#34; false-front stepped a dozen or more people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were intently walking, fast and purposefully, toward our yard.  They streamed out from &#34;nowhere&#34; like they were getting off a bus back there.  Crossing our yard, they went to the edge of our grove.  I sprang up and went out the porch door and toward their destination in our yard.  They were going up.  Whatever they were climbing, I couldn&#39;t see it.  But I got in there, in behind them, and went up, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, none of these folks were talking to one another.  It didn&#39;t seem like they were social or maybe they were just tired and everyone seemed to be giving each other some &#34;private&#34; space.  I was then in a small, round-shaped room; the light was pale gray.  I left that room through a large opening into a curving hallway.  On the outside of the hallway, that is, the larger side of the curve, were doorways.  The walls, the ceiling, were pale gray, very clean, very empty, very evenly-lighted.  The doorways to the apartments were set up about 8 inches off the hallway floor.  You had to step up to enter them.  The doors sealed tightly.  Everything seemed fitted, metal, cool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One such doorway was open.  I looked in.  The room was surrounded in floor-to-ceiling bookcases, filled with books.  A wooden room-divider, a set of shelves with no backing back then known as an “étagère”, extended from the wall beside the door for about three feet, straight into the room.  I stepped up into this &#34;apartment&#34;, and saw, in a glass dish on one of these shelves, a painted rock.  The rock was a smooth one on which was painted in yellow an area like the shape of the state of Virginia, and in black the words &#34;Souvenir of Virginia&#34;.  Just then, a woman stepped through the doorway at the far side of the room from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was  no one I knew.  I still can see her face, and I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever met her before or since.  She had medium-length hair, straight, auburn, cut in a &#34;page-boy&#34; style.  Her clothes were classic business attire.  She would have fit in at any American office, from 1950 to today.  She seemed surprised to see me there, but she did not speak.  Rather, I seemed to hear her thoughts.  They went: &#34;Oh!  You shouldn&#39;t be here.  My husband is coming up soon, and he&#39;ll take you back.&#34;  After this, I have no memory except of finding myself in my bed at home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, I do not think this was a dream.  I am writing this in 2002, over thirty years have passed, since it occurred in 1968.  It was not dream-like.  I was not asleep when it started.  I have never seen reality &#34;shift&#34; to a cartoon of itself and people come out from &#34;behind&#34; the scene before or after.  Only on recent Sci-Fi shows is there anything similar to this.  This woman was no one to me.  I cannot place any of these images as relating to my life then; I get no meaning from souvenir rocks and no association with &#34;Virginia&#34;.  These images were from outside of me, not from my mind and concerns.  It was not a dream.  I clearly remember getting up from bed and running out the door to the grove.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to comment on her attitude toward me.  It was the way we who are compassionate, treat wildlife.  Not like we treat a pet, but like we treat an intruder who is probably harmless if handled properly, something we don&#39;t want invading our &#34;home&#34; and we wouldn&#39;t kill it... unless that became necessary.  But certainly NOT like one of &#34;us&#34;, and certainly like a &#34;problem&#34; to be dealt with, an inconvenience and an impropriety.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The communication was there, but it was all one way.  There was no &#34;who are you? what are you doing here?&#34;  I was TOLD I was not supposed to be here and that I would be &#34;taken care of&#34; and soon.  Maybe I&#39;m being a bit precipitous.  Maybe her attitude was like the way civilians are treated when they innocently enter off-limit areas controlled by the military.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Above written 3-31-2002  Since this was written, I have re-thought how the vehicle which the commuters took may have been hidden.  Perhaps it was capable of mimicking its background the way some fish take on the color and pattern of the sea floor to escape detection by predators?  I happened to witness the craft &#34;gelling&#34; into its new, fixed location and when its &#34;door&#34; opened and let the passengers debark, they appeared to step from behind the scenery which had been placed in front of the nearly-identical scene.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How did it arrive at this spot without my seeing it in contrast to the background?  Could it have been invisible, immaterial prior to my seeing it &#34;gel&#34;?  Could it have come up from below?  If so, how did it do so without disturbing the ground?  Perhaps it arrived so quickly that it seemed to appear instantaneously?  Above written 12-21-2009<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The evening was a comfortable temperature and the sky was clear and void of any clouds and the stars were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were at the edge of the golf course, lying on our backs and gazing upward into the sky. The way were facing I observed a small star-shaped object moving very slowly from what looked like the 9:00 position and moving straight across towards the 3:00 position. I pointed this out to my brother and we were both watching this object at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A short time passed, probably 20 or 30 seconds then all of a sudden this object came directly down towards us, silently and quickly. There were no lights on the exterior of this craft and the craft silently came to rest to what appeared to be about 500 or 600 feet above us and was not moving. The craft was close enough for us to see inside. Windows were visible and there appeared to be two or three long windows with a divider between the windows, a frame that I thought to be part of the outer skin of the aircraft. Inside one of the windows there appeared to be some kind of console. It appeared to be square and tall and the closest thing I can relate to it would be something the size of a file cabinet type shape. There were no beings seen inside these windows that we could see and the craft simply hovered above us silently for about another 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden this craft lifted and continued on what appeared to be the same course it was traveling before descending. At the time of this sighting our father had a private pilots license and owned a plane in which we all flew on a regular basis. This is important as we would know what the elevation,(or come pretty close) of this craft. Also, our government had nothing, to our knowledge, that would maneuver like this did. My brother is still alive and our story can be collaborated.

I then just gave up looking and thought in my mind- WOW ! I just witnessed a satellite and oddly enough.I never really told anyone at the time what I had witnessed.Thinking it was a common thing to view at age 8,like watching a jet.Today ,now age 50 and more knowledgable on subject.It appears in character,that it was not a satellite.I understand today, there was a UFO flap in Canada -1967.ie Shag Harbour Crash<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

8/8/67 16:00|Alamosa|CO|Light|20 minutes|Alamosa UFO disappears after flash of blinding light.|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59395.html|23|ndxe196708| Alamosa UFO disappears after flash of blinding light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of us were driving west on Colorado hwy 160 toward Alamosa.  The road is called the &#39;gun barrel&#39; because there is a stretch of about 15 miles that is completely straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend, who has a private pilot&#39;s license, saw an orange light directly ahead of us and pointed it out to me.  We watched it &#39;fly&#39; north for about 5 minutes before we stopped the car to get out and have a clearer view.  After a few minutes we continued to drive west and watch the light.  It would occasionally change from orange to green, and then back to orange in a random sequence.  We stopped the car one or two more times to try to figure out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our approximate location when we first spotted the UFO was 37°28’09.17-N  105°35’52.42-W.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20 minutes the light was approaching mountains that are west of Alamosa, still travelling north.  With the mountains as a reference we could estimate size, height and speed.  We guessed that it was 200’ long (it had taken on a cigar shape as we got closer), about 1000’ above ground level (Alamosa is at 7500’ above sea level) and traveling at about 200 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was very near the mountains we suddenly saw a blinding white light and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we checked into our hotel rooms we went into the hotel restaurant.  As we talked about our experience we wondered how many of these kinds of things are seen and never reported.  It was 6:00 PM or so when we decided to call the local newspaper.  The editor happened to answer the phone.  When we gave him an overview of our experience he asked if he could come to the restaurant and interview us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before he arrived I went to the hotel desk for a Colorado map.  We marked the map with a line showing where we thought the UFO traveled as we watched it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We told him what we had seen and he took copious notes without asking many questions.  When we were through he said, &#34;Now let me tell you what other stories I have heard.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> He then told us about reports from many local citizens including ‘close encounters’.  I recall one of the events he told us about was an elderly lady who reported a huge UFO that hovered just above her house for several minutes.  He made it a point to make sure we understood that the other reports were from very credible people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The story about our sighting was reported in the Alamosa newspaper the next day.  My crew was in the area examining two national banks for two days.  We regretted telling our story because we took a lot of grief and ribbing from bankers and other citizens.  As we were checking out of the hotel the owner/manager asked us if we were the bank examiners who had seen the UFO.  We were very defensive by this time, but admitted that we were the people mentioned in the newspaper article.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She then told us this story.  Her 8 year old daughter had been visiting a friend’s house the day of our sighting.  Her daughter called the police to report a military jet that she saw shot down.  She said that it was chasing a light and the light shot out a light that knocked the airplane down.  Then she came home and told her mother what she had done.  The mother told her that it was not right to make false reports to the police and that she was in big trouble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the police showed up at their home to make sure everything was o.k.  The police and her mother told the girl that if an airplane had crashed, there would be search parties out looking for it.  Now, here is the part that makes me believe that this was a true report of what the girl saw.  She said, &#34;If they find it -- can I have it, because I saw it first?&#34;  I met the girl briefly and asked her to point in the sky where she saw the light and the airplane.  Her line was shorter than ours, but ended in the location where we saw the blinding white flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have decided to report this again just because I am old enough now that I don’t care what people think.  I have searched for the article and have not been able to find it.  I was not even sure which year it was until I remembered that the well-known case of Snippy the horse (mutilation) occurred about 2 to 4 weeks after our event.  The Snippy event was September 7, 1967 so our event would have been sometime in August, 1967.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have a way to access the Alamosa newspaper you will find our story there.  I would love to have a copy of the article if that is possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  However, he is correct about the date of the mutilation of the horse in Alamosa.  Reports of other mutilations south of Florence, CO, were circulating as early as June 1967, a fact which I know from personal experience there.  PD))<n>

When we arrived at my home , but still were in the street, I looked up and saw a round UFO with lights circling the perimeter of it, I seem to think they were colored lights.I would consider it to be a crude UFO more like a Lost in Space variety.  It was hovering above us, Actually very close. I would say about only 4 stories above us. It made no noise. I looked for a minute  until it hit me that it was a UFO and with that, I jumped off my friend&#39;s bicycle , ran to my front door , and started pounding on the door screaming for my parents to come out . No one else saw it. The next day my father told me he read in the paper that a weather balloon was out on Long Island , and that is what I must have seen. I believed he was lying to me, and still know that it was a UFO, Government or otherwise.  I also feel that if I did not look up and see it , some possible harm may h! ave come to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

8/5/67 21:00|Fort Smith|AR|Teardrop|3 - 4 hours|Unidentified objects witnessed by hundreds over Fort Smith Arkansas|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54327.html|26|ndxe196708| Unidentified objects witnessed by hundreds over Fort Smith Arkansas<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just after dusk on an August evening in 1967.  The A.M. station that my sister and I listened to began to report lights in the skies over Fort Smith.  Of course I immediately ran out into the yard to see for myself.  Huge oak trees largely blocked the view and after a few minutes of surveying the patches of sky overhead I gave up.  The reports continued to pour in and the disc jockey was at a fever pitch. I summoned my dad who listened for while, then I remember him laughing and saying that the station was playing a joke.  At some point he began to take the reports somewhat seriously and we climbed into his ’46 Plymouth and drove to a remote area known as Wild Cat Mountain Lake. It was wide open and afforded as much of a horizon-to-horizon view as anywhere in the Fort Smith area.  We sat on the hood for a long time until I bored and climbed back in the car.  Almost immediately I heard my dad shout something and scampering back out found him pointing at two white lights moving slowly across the sky from east to west.  They weren’t very bright and if they had not have been moving, would have easily blended in with the stars.  They were traveling side by side, about two fingers apart at arm’s length.   When they were almost directly overhead they suddenly made opposite 90-degree turns and quickly accelerated out of sight.  Shortly after, a solitary light, much brighter, tracked across the sky at a tremendous rate of speed.  It took probably less than 15 seconds to traverse the sky from the east to the west horizon.  We sped back home to find several of our neighbors in lawn chairs – in the street!  The next three to four hours we watched an amazing display.  As time went on the lights came in at lower altitudes and glowed the spectrum from white to orange, with the intensity (brightness) increasing as they became more orange. As I recall, they would glow brightest when hovering. At their closest and brightest, they were perhaps one-third the size of a full moon.  I can’t estimate the! altitud e, but at one point I did contemplate fetching my BB gun and taking a pot shot.  So, bad idea aside they did come in very low. They would fly in formations of two or three, stop suddenly, hover, make impossible turns, and accelerate out of sight in seconds.  It was almost as though it were choreographed for the benefit of the crowd below. At one point when a single object hovered directly overhead, I was able to observe it at length through a powerful pair of binoculars offered by a neighbor.  It was more or less triangular shaped, not sharply, but more like a guitar pick.  I’ve heard descriptions of spheres and chevrons being seen that night, but that was not what I was looking at.  If those other accounts are accurate then there was either more than one type of object or the shape was not static. This thing appeared to glow from within, like an old Christmas tree light bulb and there was some sort of structure resembling a grid or a checkerboard on the underside.  At least one television station and a radio station were broadcasting live from the parking lot of the Coca-Cola bottling plant, less than a mile west of the Fort Smith airport which shares a common runway with the 188th Fighter Wing, known at the time as the 188th Tactical Reconnaissance Group.  Both the airport and the air guard are in virtual line of sight of the parking lot and it was thought curious that no jets were scrambled during that evening, more so as antidotal evidence surfaced in the following days that the objects had been painted on radar.  Someone had a transistor radio out on the street that night and we could hear the crowd reacting on the live broadcast as the objects “performed” so we could be certain that we were seeing the same objects as those at the bottling plant parking lot, which was approximately 2 miles from our location.  The next morning the Southwest Times Record ran a front-page story on the sightings, complete with a low-resolution jerky black and white time exposure that to this day still ranks as the worst! UFO pho to I’ve ever seen.  Needless to say, the town and the media were abuzz. A couple of days later the Air Force out of Little Rock released a statement, to the amusement of those who had not seen the objects, explaining away the entire incident as swamp gas.  There are two things I can say with certainty about the objects I witnessed:  1) They were solid objects, not gaseous and 2) They were controlled (flying in formation, etc).   The speed and maneuverability that these objects soundlessly displayed, is still exponentially greater than any technology even today, almost 40 years later.  I would love to hear from others that were witness to the phenomenon that night in 1967.  My dad, the neighbor with the binoculars and I’m sure many others are no longer with us.  Let’s not let this story die as well.  I&#39;m guessing at the date based upon other reports, so if you are certain of the exact date please post.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I believe the date to be August rather than July, but otherwise the same event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 11 or 12 years old at the time.  I am a retired USAF fighter pilot, so this event has always been a memorable event. I remember the accounts at the time of the three lights, although that is not what I and my parents saw that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A relative called about 2100 all excited about the UFOs that were &#34;about to land out near the airport&#34; (where else?).  What the previous writer failed to mention was the significance of the Coca-Cola bottling plant locaton.  The Coke plant was within a half mile of the Fort Smith Municiple Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fort Smith is quite hilly with tall trees.  The area around the airport provides the largest view of the sky, Therefore was the area where people congregated to see the sights that evening.  Local AM radio station KFSA (there were&#39;nt any FM stations in town yet) had set up a mobile broadcast near the airport to provide a live account of the sightings.  As I remember, the first name of the on-air personality was Bill.  The station normally ended its daily broadcast at midnight, but stayed on well past midnight for this event.  A sizeable crowd gathered there and could be heard in the background on the radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents and I stepped out into our back yard to take a look at about 2100.  We saw only a yellow/orange/white single light moving slowly along the southern sky on a westerly heading.  It was moving slowly; about normal final approach speed for aircraft of the day.  There was no sound.  The radio reporter and people near him were watching the same object.  Surprisingly, the object began to accelerate until it was going so fast, I lost it in the trees.  This would certainly have been impressive accerlation for any aircraft of the day, or today.  Yet I heard nothing like afterburners or any jet noise. My dad went to bed, but my mom and I stayed up to watch and listen to the radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an extremely clear moonless night.  For quite a while nothing happened.  The radio reporter was running out of much to say when suddenly at about 0100 the crowd that could be heard on the radio became excited.  The reporter stopped mid-sentence to look then said, &#34;Yes, out of the northwest...&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked and there was the most fascinating sighting.  An object of very distinct shape was traversing the sky on a southeasterly heading at what, even today after all my military flying, I would say was very high altitude and very fast.  The shape was razor sharp and clear; a V or boomerang shape. There was no sound and no visible contrail. As an 11-year old, I had chills.  It was a little scary at that age.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly, the object slowed as it neared the southeastern horizon (the direction of the airport from our house), turned west and appeared as the earlier orange slow moving light.  Nothing more was seen by us that night or following nights.  Local newspaper articles recounted the event the next day.  They reported contacting Little Rock AFB about the sighting.  They reported no activity in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, what was it?  In all my military flying from 1977 until 1997, I never saw anything like this; nothing not easily explained.  So, the memory of this childhood sighting, witnessed by hundreds, has been a mystery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have three theories.  At the time, Little Rock AFB had a wing of B-58 Hustler strategic bombers.  The B-58 was a supersonic delta wing bomber that was one of the first to be built with new structural technologies and materials.  The skin of the aircraft when supersonic (certainly the leading edge of the wing) would become extremely hot.  I suspect that the 1am object might have been a B-58 on a high altitude night supersonic dash over the city.  What we saw was the glowing hot leading edge of the wing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another possiblity with regards to military aircraft of the day that this might have been is the XB-70 high altitude experimental supersonic bomber.  Only two were built and tested.  One was certainly still flying at the time, although one crashed near this time.  The XB-70 was also a delta wing, but much bigger and faster than the B-58.  Certainly, it could have been this aircraft in a high altitude dash which heated the leading edge of the wing creating the very visible V shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, the SR-71 Blackbird (or early variant) was flying by this time and could have done this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where was the sound?  Too high to be heard.  Sonic booms and jet noise dissapate from high altitude (over FL350) before reaching the ground...or so I have theorized.  I suspect that there are USAF records (flight logs, training records, maintenance records, etc) available to the public regarding these three aircraft that could be researched to see if my theory is correct that this sighting was one of these  historic aircraft...stirring up a lot of Arkansans...and one boy&#39;s dream of flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.

Smith chevron sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a follow-up to my recent post here regarding the specific chevron-shaped object.  I have since done some research that would dispel two of my theories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted a retired B-58 crew member who confirmed that the leading edge of the wing did not glow when supersonic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also researched the possiblity of the XB-70.  The Final Report on the the XB-70 program published in 1972 lists every flight of each of the giant delta wing aircraft.  A/V-2 had already crashed by the time of this sighting. A/V-1 was flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been unable to determine if the XB-70 did any night flying, or flying significantly away from Edwards AFB, CA.  From reading the chief test pilot&#39;s summary, I would highly doubt that this aircraft did either.  It was a very complex aircraft, often having malfunctions requiring unique support.  To intentionally stray from its support base would be doubtful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, it was a very crudely equipped and instrumented aircraft in its experimental form.  Its single TACAN worked poorly, requiring the crew to rely heavily on FAA ATC for help with navigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is one long-shot date of possibility. The aircraft flew on 8/24/67 for over two hours, reached over Mach 2, and an altitude of 58,000 feet.  If the actual sighting that I witnessed occured on this date, it would be an interesting coincidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I believe that leaves this sighting on mysterious footing.  Other possible aircraft of the day are the CIA A-12 Blackbird and its followers, the YF-12 and SR-71. That will take more research and will probably be more difficult to find records in the public domain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of this report for his having done such nice investigative work regarding his sighting.

A/V-1 was flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been unable to determine if the XB-70 did any night flying, or flying significantly away from Edwards AFB, CA.  From reading the chief test pilot&#39;s summary, I would highly doubt that this aircraft did either.  It was a very complex aircraft, often having malfunctions requiring unique support.  To intentionally stray from its support base would be doubtful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, it was a very crudely equipped and instrumented aircraft in its experimental form.  Its single TACAN worked poorly, requiring the crew to rely heavily on FAA ATC for help with navigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is one long-shot date of possibility. The aircraft flew on 8/24/67 for over two hours, reached over Mach 2, and an altitude of 58,000 feet.  If the actual sighting that I witnessed occured on this date, it would be an interesting coincidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I believe that leaves this sighting on mysterious footing.  Other possible aircraft of the day are the CIA A-12 Blackbird and its followers, the YF-12 and SR-71. That will take more research and will probably be more difficult to find records in the public domain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of this report for his having done such nice investigative work regarding his sighting.

My parents weren&#39;t home and my bbrothers and sisters were playing around the house.  I looked out my parent&#39;s bedroom window and saw the craft hovering about 75ft. above our back yard.  It completely filled the sky above our yard.  It was silent.  I ran to the back door and yelled to my brothers and sisters that there was a UFO over the back yard.  My two brothers aged 8 and 9 and my older sister almost 13 stood at the back door and watched it for some time.  We could see lights and windows with beings inside.  I don&#39;t remember anything beyond shadowy forms.  I don&#39;t know how long we watched it for, but eventually it slowly hovered down our back alley until it got to the end of the block, which was the edge of the city at that time.  It then accelerated at an incredible rate upward and to the N.E. and dissappeared in a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I noticed that I had scabs about the size of the end of a pencil on both shins I could not explain.<n>

It was an evening, on the way home from watching a movie, I approached a steep hill on my bike 2 blocks from my home, I decided to walk. Surrounded by large Pine Trees on both sides.  I heard a whiring noise similar to a simi-in the distance traveling on a freeway. I knew the noise was above me and when I looked up there was nothing, scanning to the right of me I seen a large cigar shaped object floating/hovering, moving slowly , finally clearing itself from the trees, and just above the trees. Approx  70 to 100 Feet high.  The object moved at a slow pace directly above and slightly to the front of me. From right to left I watched as I was froze in one spot on the road. I remember how scared I was. The Object glowed kind of a goldish brown, it was like looking into a black light, with fuzzy edges. I would guess it was 200/300 feet long and  60 feet wide.  It slowing went out of my sight do to trees and the noise stopped.  I raced home to tell my parants. I 15 years old. I had tears in my eyes as I told them. I remember hearing of alot of sightings in Wisc back then. I never went public with this information at the time fearing ridicule etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

A younger brother and myself (ages six and twelve respectively) stayed with him then in the months of July and August.   One night (I don&#39;t remember the exact date), my brother and I were in our sleeping bags talking and looking up at the sky before falling to sleep.  My best estimate of the time would be 9:30pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were talking, I noticed three non-blinking lights in the sky, in an equilateral triangle shape and traveling West to East (paralleling the islands length).  It was just off the South shore and about 400 feet above us.  I believe it was about midway in size to a small plane and a 747.  It made no noise.  The lights were not overly bright.  They may have been amber or a dim white.  I could see no stars within the triangle shape defined by the three points.  It appeared to be moving slower (perhaps by as much as half) the speed of a conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I directed my brothers attention to it but I don&#39;t think he paid much attention since he was immersed in his conversation.  When I asked him about it a few years ago, he didn&#39;t remember it.

One fellow pointed at a bright &#34;star&#34; approaching from the east (like Las Vegas). He felt it was unusual and we all watched. It was not a helicopter although it moved at about that speed. It hovered over Downey (probably more like La Mirada) for a few minutes. Then it took off on a new coarse (NW - like Point Mugu). We were all sure that it was not a plane. The curious thing is that the arc it described on the sky seemed to maintain a constant speed as it approached the horizon. That is, there was none of the normal &#34;gradual loss of motion due to the distance&#34; that one normally experiences. It was really booking!That&#39;s all folks!Sorry - no green women with galactic eyes and no abductions.But hey! a UFO is a UFO, right!<n>

I am presently 42 years of age and to the best of my recollection, have never seen what would be considered a UFO since this one experience. I still remember the incident vividly. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t recall the year. It was either the summer of 1967 or 1968 with an outside chance of it being 1969.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My older siblings were babysitting me one evening. They used to make colored popcorn but on this night, ran out and had to borrow some from a neighbor. When my sister went outside, she started shouting for everyone to come out. I looked out the window at them and they were all looking toward the sky in our backyard. I went out to see what was going on. When I looked up, I saw a circular pattern of red/green - about the size of a small full moon. The object, if it was an object, appeared to just &#34;hang&#34; there. It almost resembled more of a hazy &#34;bat signal&#34; than something solid. It could have been filtered through the clouds. Not certain about that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, our small neighborhood consisted of about 15 to 20 or so homes. Our parents were out so my siblings called other neighbors. All of whom saw the &#34;thing.&#34;  After a couple of minutes, my sister rushed me back in. I wanted to stay but she wouldn&#39;t let me. My brothers came in shortly after and said the thing was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember I wasn&#39;t afraid because at either 4 or 5 years old, I had no clue what UFO&#39;s were. To this day, I keep asking my siblings if they remember that night and they said they still do. No one has ever explained what it was that our modestly middle class neighborhood in Scheller Park saw that night. My parents thought they remembered some explanation of what it was however, the explanation didn&#39;t make sense to them and to the rest of us who saw it. I would love to know if anyone else remembers that night and more importantly, if this was a reported incident by other non-government types rather than just our observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went back home to Roseburg Oregon and interviewed the neighbor lady and her husband who still lived there who also remembered the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In August of 1967, approx 7:00pm in the evening, 3 saucer aircraft appeared from the west traveling toward the east, and hovered above our neighborhood (we lived in a valley), approx 500 feet off the ground.  I rememeber my sister ran in the house telling us her car was enveleoped in a blue light as she was heading to work in a local movie theater.  I recall being scared as my mother turned all the lights off in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them from inside our home for about 5 minutes,  then slowly went outside to look. There was no sound.  Silent. In the air above our home approx 500 feet up were 3 disc shaped objects, with red-blue-green swirling lights rotating around the craft in a clockwise circular pattern.  They were about the size of a house, quite large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember the colors being very striking, almost a neon glow only more intense.  On top was a large orange glowing dome, which reminded me of a lantern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 10 minutes, sprarks began to fall from beneath the crafts, at the same time.  Long showers of sparks falling with NO SOUND at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, they accelereated so fast in a northly direction that it almost looked as if they disappeared. There was NO WIND either, as the sparks were all that remained falling in the air where the craft were. The sparks did not blow around as the craft left. It was as if the craft &#34;disappeared&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event ocuured precisely at 7:00pm for the next 2 evenings.  Exactly the same things happened, with the sparks falling after 5 minutes of them approaching from the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 3rd day, my sister went to her wealthy friends house on top of a nearby hilltop.  They had a telescope for star viewing.  My sister said when they appeared, she plainly saw what appeared to be round black windows where the orange glow dome was.  The craft was metalic.  The lights swirling around the craft were something she said she has never seen before. Beautiful colors just swirling around the outside edge of the saucer shaped craft. There were flames and sparks emitting from the bottom/center of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The airport was called during the 3 day event. They said they saw it, as the airport was only 5 miles away.  They said there was nothing on the radar screen, yet there they were.  The local news station had a report on the objects on the evening news the next day.  But right after that, no one spoke about it.  There were military officers I remember in the news, but not a word about any craft.  My mother, sister, friends all talked about it amongst ourselves, but never to anyone else as people would think we were were crazy, so we never talked about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began recalling this whole thing about 15 years ago, and it has been getting more vivid, as if it just occured yesterday.  If I could take a photo of them from my mind, you would also agree this was not a helicopter or airplane that we know of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure there were pictures taken by townsfolk. There were FAR too many people who witnessed this. But what was weird was that it was NEVER talked about by the media again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At any rate, I felt I needed to report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Unfortunately, since I was so young at the time, I cannot really recall the exact date or time of when I actually saw it, but it is a safe bet to say it was definitely in the late 60&#39;s, and it was definitely in the evening and in the summer.  My guess would be around August of 1966 or 1967 at around 7:30 PM or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Aunt and I were in the living room in our home in Queens, New York and all of a sudden we heard this extremely loud noise of something flying over the house -- though, it was not the same type of sound like an airplane, a helicopter or even a blimp makes, though, if I were to pick which one of these it resembled in sound the most, I&#39;d have to say a blimp, though, it&#39;s hard to describe the sound really, but it was very loud, and it was different, so we both ran together to the front porch window and we both looked out just in time to see this huge object that had just flown over our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I recall, it was long and left a beautiful redish and greenish color streaked across the sky as it passed.  It was actually travelling quite fast, and was also flying quite low -- at least what had looked to me to be much lower than I had ever seen any plane fly in the sky at that time. As I recall, the front end of the object was like a big, red diamond-like shape object attached to what looked to me like a long rod-type of thing, and the bottom had a green diamond-like shape attached to it, which, as I also recall, was quite smaller in size than the red diamond-like shape. -- (It&#39;s actually been so long since I saw the object, that it could also very well have been visa versa -- the green diamond-like object could&#39;ve been on the front end of the rod-like object and could&#39;ve been the bigger one in size and the red one could&#39;ve been in the back, and have been the smaller diamond-like object -- I&#39;m not really 100% sure about that anymore -- but I do remember very vividly the red and green colors and how bright both shapes were, and how diamond-like in shape that they both were and how extremely loud the object was as it flew over my house -- almost like it vibrated the house a little as it flew over it!)  As I also recalled at that time, there was some mention on the news about there being spottings of people seeing a foreign object, so we really weren&#39;t completely shocked by the sighting, but just real excited about seeing it!  As it passed over more houses, it became out of sight, so I quickly ran upstairs and looked out my hallway window, but lost sight of the object after that.  However, as I said before, it left a beautiful streak of red and green in the sky, which lasted for a little while!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Aunt is deceased now, so I cannot ask her what her recollection of the sighting was, and if she remembered anything different than I did. -- But even today, I still get excited when I recall the sighting!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it would be very nice if you had some kind of message board or something like that on this site where people who have had similar sightings could talk back and forth with each about them if they choose to, as it&#39;s kind of nice to know that I&#39;m not alone in what I saw back then!  I also never even knew that this site existed until my friend just brought it to my attention....  But I&#39;m glad at least for the opportunity to post my recollection of the sighting -- and I thank you very much!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFOR Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was a very active kid and did not nap at that time of day, but this day I was inclned to nap, as well as my brother. My mother recalls the door opening and felt someone appraoch her from behind but does not recall much else, or at least will not admit remebering. My father ran a cheese factory, he normally returned home at about 5:00 PM, but this day he arrived at about 3:30 PM, I awoke a few minutes before he arrived. He ran into the house shouting come out here look at this, a space ship was hovering above a tree near our house, it was about 50-60 feet from the house and the tree was about 18 feet tall. It hovered there for a while, then it began to move ouer our vehicle and toward our driveway. The vehicle was a green briar, a first version of a blazed type vehicle. Then he asked everyone to jump into the vehicle and we followed it out to the highway, our driveway was about 1/2 mile long. When we approached the highway I could see my freind across the street and his father, they did not appear to see it. It matched our speed but was about 150 ft off the highway over a field, it seemed to disapear when we appraoched the forest, but when breaks in the forest or dips / valleys appeared on the terrain the craft had matched our speed and was still there. We followed the craft to the main highway into Wausau Wisconsin, and at that time it abruptly took a right angle turn and took off at a slight angle upward and quickly disappeared. It all seems surealistic looking back, my mom is willing to admit the event, my day is not so willing. funny thing is he was excited at the time, but did not want anyone to say anything and it seemed to be forgotten. I also recall round areas in the back yard that the grass was dark and the grass eventually died where the round spot was.<n>
