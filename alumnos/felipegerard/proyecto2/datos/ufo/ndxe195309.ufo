He was a decorated veteran of WW11, and was the owner of his own flying service in Ak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He looked over to his left, and there was a cigar shaped craft keeping pace with him, he said that he could see the creatures in their vehicle thru the windows.  They stayed at his speed for awhile, and then accelerated out of the area at high velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident was quite unique, because my father was not one to talk about ufos or the paranormal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened when I was in second grade up there, and was told to me later, when I was a mom with two boys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
