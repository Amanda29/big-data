[I don&#39;t recall who first sighted it, or name(s)] Aside from not even being sure if it was in 1947 or &#39;48, much less, the month and day, or if it was more cheveron shaped or a triangle - but memory favors cheveron (I would have said boomerang shape then).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The things that do stick in my mind are that it was moving slowly, with no sound audible. In addition, there was a blue glow all around the edges of the craft, which I think was grey or dull metallic color. It appeared to be about the same size as the moon appears when near the zenith, maybe a bit larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry, I don&#39;t even recall how it actually dissapeared from view -- we may have been watching for a long enough time to exceed our/my teen-age attention span. I do seem to recall that it was traveling parallel to the street we were on, which ran in a north-south direction. (I think it was N15th or N16th St. in San Jose)  (Could this have simply been a [US] millitary craft, so unique appearing, and silent, way back in the late 1940&#39;s ?? -- I haven&#39;t a clue!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It hung there long enough for me to realize it wasn&#39;t a plane or dirigible or balloon.  Then it disappeared.  I may have been momentarily distracted by my baby.

Around 3 PM, we looked up up see a cylinder shaped UFO crossing a clear blue sky at a high rate of speed.  The altitude was unknown but, it was close enough to get a very clear view of the object with a long trail of orange fire immediately behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling from northeast to southwest.

On a Sunday in July we had gone to Brown&#39;s Orchard nearby and got a bushel of pie cherries to can. We had just finished cleanin the fruit and I took the dishpan of waste to throw it out in the barrow pit behind the trailer. I just happened to look down the road about a quarter of a mile and tere was this huge,silver,Saucer shaped vehicle  about 200 feet in the air,just slowly gliding along as if sightseeing, It was going West. It made no noise and the sky was clear of all clouds, I stood there and thought--&#34;It cannot be a plane. It cannot be a balloon because if it was, it would be going East as the wind was blowing briskly,as the Sparrow nests were being blown out of the Locust trees that lined the pasture fence and the adult sparrows were having spasms.So what is it?&#34;(I felt almost hypnotized) Finally I shook my body and went to the door and called my relatives to&#34;come and see what I see&#34;!) We watched it for just a minute or so and then it took off like a whiz and was out of sight for a seconds,then it came back into view about 10 miles away and then in a few more seconds it was gone out of sight (to the West).Never thought much about it until 2 years later I was in a grocery store in Gooding,Idaho, and was turning a stand full of &#34;Pocket Books&#34; and here was a book&#34;Flying Saucers Are Real&#34;by Donald Keyhoe. I called to my husband and told him to come there, I said, &#34;That&#39;s what we saw out from Hazelton&#34;. Yes, I bought the Book and still have it stored in my Sons&#39; Shed (I hope) at Fairfield,Idaho where we lived at the time. I was followed by one in 1976 after dark when I was North of Gooding coming to Twin Falls where I lived by now. It was smaller,and had just a steady red light that I could see. It was about 2 blocks away and very low. It was really about even with me and not over 100 feet in the air. I stopped my car ,after pulling to the sides as I was o! n a hill road,Turned off motor and lights and was going to get out of the car and tha object made a right angle turn and was gone East toward Shoshone and out of sight in a few seconds. (I really am glad it did that,now,after hearing and reading about all the Abductions in later years. I have seen strange lights in the sky a couple of times since that cut some funny caper that our planes did not do,but won&#39;t go into that. Thanks for reading. I know there are Alien Craft of some kind. Sincerely, ((name deleted)) of Hagerman Idaho. P.S. I&#39;m past 82 but I remember those sightings as if it happened yesterday. Of course Mother and Auntie are gone to a better Land!!<n>

In 1947, he was with the Army Air Corps Judges office. He was in one of many officers that were charged to represent Army Air man that were being charge with a crime. he was station at Wright_Patterson Army Air base in Ohio. He got a case involving an Air man who had stolen several thousands dollars worth of Army Air goods. He was sent to the air base where the air man was at. Once there he reported to the Military Police station and told them he was there to interview the prisoner.The MP officer on duty knew that my great uncle was from Wright-Patterson and escorted him to a section of the stockade. This section had only one way in and one cell. My great uncle believing that he was to see the prisoner. My great uncle was shocked by what he saw, he told me that he saw a little man (believing that man to be a midget) dressed in an sliver-gray flight suit, the man was very pale (as if he was not out in the sun much) with white hair. The guard told my great uncle that the prisoner refused to eat. My great uncle relised that this was not who he was sent to see left quickly and returned to the MP station. While in Washington DC, I did research and found the old flight plan that show that my great uncle had indeed left Wright-Patterson Army Air base and went to Roswell Army Air base on july-11-1947.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was a very clear Saturday morning in the Olney section of Philadelphia, Pa.  I am sure it was Saturday because people were taking groceries from their cars.  We were playing a childhood game called wireball that involved throwing a tennis ball at the power line wires.  As I reared back to throw the ball, I saw something flash in the sky and stopped to get a better look.  The object that I saw was round, flat, very shiny (like polished aluminum) and proceeded in a southwesterly direction.  &#34;A flying saucer,&#34; I yelled.&#34;  The other kids all looked up and one of them said, &#34;Where?&#34;  I pointed up and said, &#34;There.&#34; Then he pointed and said, &#34;I see it.&#34;  I said, &#34;Not there...  There!&#34;  But when I looked at where he was pointing, there was another one.  Well, we counted a total of six saucers. All were very high and flying in the same direction with no apparent formation.  As they flew they would turn over slowly so that you would see them edgewise and they would occassionaly shoot off to the right or left but would maintain their southwesterly course. We created such a clamour that people came out of their homes and looked up.  I feel sure that at least twenty people must have seen these craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I learned very quickly shortly after this happening that you didn&#39;t speak of this to anyone that wasn&#39;t there that day.

The park overlooked Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountain Range to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happened to look up and saw a bright, oval-shaped object coming down from the upper atmosphere. There was no sound of motors.  The object had no wings.  The object made a very sharp almost 90-degree turn to the horizontal and then sped south along Puget Sound at high speed and towards Mt. St. Helens.  I was very surprised.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about the same time on July 4, 1947, a Seattle bus driver and U.S.Navy member saw similar objects over Seattle.   On June 24, 1947, a light plane pilot and a prospector saw nine silvery flying saucers flying in line at high speed from north to south  over nearby Mount Rainier and Mount Adams, Washington. On July 4, 1947, two airline pilots and a stewardess saw similar nine flying saucers flying from southeast to northwest from Boise, Idaho, towards Mount Rainier and Seattle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with the source of the report, and consider him to be an exceptional witness.

It was hard to judge their actual distance and speed, but they were moving quite slowly.  We watched them move slowly west for less than one minute; and then, one at a time, each object went from a lumbering speed to streaking away at a fantastic speed (i.e., we saw each leave a short green streak and it was gone in an instant).  This event would be analogous to the Starship Enterprise jumping to light speed, leaving the momentary streak of light (cf. Star Trek movies).   After they were gone, my friend and I ran to tell my parents what we had seen.  My Mom said, ‘Well, tomorrow go down to the local newspaper office and given them your report’.  We did just that the next day, but they were not interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While my friend and I now live in different states, we still recall/discuss this ‘sighting’ whenever we see each other.  Like so many others who have witnessed a UFO event, they often say, ‘whether or not people believe UFOs exist, I know what I saw’.  We know what we saw in the sky on that summer evening years ago, but we don’t know what they were.  I think it is fair to say that no earth-based ‘flying machine’ at that point in time could have possibly behaved as these four objects did.  When they streaked away out of sight, it was almost like they simply departed from our ‘optical window’ and immediately entered a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that our visual mechanism cannot perceive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never communicated the foregoing to anyone, except my own family; and for the record I have been a science professor at the university level for the past 34 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

While on school vacation at my uncles junk yard one evening I noticed on the horizon at dusk a shiney light moving slowly across it. As it moved it began to increase speed until it dissappeared. It moved from east to west across highway 19. I often wondered if this could be tied to another sighting soon after. I was always looking for airplanes and had observed many of them and I knew this was something that was far faster than anything I had seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
