It was either 1985 or 1986 on Halloween night. I observed a silver metalic disk hovering a couple hundred feet above a 6 story apartment building. I immediately nudged by friend and we both stopped and stared at the object for about 15 seconds. The disk made no sound and was motionless. The disk then flew away at a high speed towards Central Park leaving a steaking light behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Year is approximate.  PD))<n>

When he came in he said&#34;hey mom, what&#39;s that above our house?&#34;We went out to the backyard and right above our house was 4 balls of light rotating simutaneously at a very fast speed. My son and I stayed in the backyard for about one hour to see if they would go away or change positions ,but they didn&#39;t. we decided to go in when our dog started to howl and cry at the balls of light.  we also took the dog in the house ,but he kept on crying until they disappeared at about 3:00 am in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At the time it looked like just a white light.  At the time we lived near LAX and at first I thought it was an airplane. But then I realized there were no red or green runnung lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband continued watching the showers and was unaware of what I was seeing.  For no reason, I said, &#34;If you&#39;re not an airplane, come this way, come this way&#34;.  No sooner than I spoke the words, the object slowly veered west in our direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got an eerie feeling and I pointed the object out to my husband. It moved very slowly and when it reached a point of about one half mile from us we still couldn&#39;t make out a shape since the light in front was so bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there transfixed by what we were looking at.  It was only about 50-75 feet above us as it moved directly above our heads.  We looked straight up above our heads and it seemed so low I felt I could reach up and touch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a triangular shape,  dull black and there was no sound. It was gigantic.  At each point of the triangle was a dull white light with a very bright white light in the center.  It glided over us and slowly headed west towards the ocean.  There wasn&#39;t any noise or sound of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approximately one half mile or so, the craft veered back to the south as we watched it fly out of our line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, my husband, who was no longer watching the meteor shower looked at me and said, &#34;well it&#39;s time to go inside&#34;.  And that was the end of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1985 may be approximate.  Two major meteor showers occur during August and November of each year.  PD))<n>

It happend one night that my parents had a getogther with there friend and well they but all the kids in me and my brothers room so we all were playing loudlly so our parents came in to tell us to lower our screaming and playfighting. there was 6 of us so you know we made alot of noise. so we started to play another game to turn out the lights and stay quiet and who ever made a noise would get punched. so this quiet game turnd out to become a wrestling match in the dark. suddenly the Room turned a Bright Red we all noticed it and turned to the window and there was a ball of red light that i had to squinch my eyes a bit. this ball had to be at least 4 feet in diamiter compared to our window size. and it was steady there not moving at all just rock solid steady i think we all were shocked at what we saw and stared at it for over 1min. until one of the guys was bold enought to aproch the window and when he did the ball backed away from the window and dove down wered thats when we all ran to the window to see. We saw it droped down to like the 8floor ( we lived on the 13thfloor) and shoot stright out towrds P.S. 102 that was across a park from us the the ball cast the red light on the school and went stright up into the sky and was gone. we all stared yelling trying to tell our parent what happend and we got punished because they thought we were lying. now im 28 and my brother 32 and we both remember the event with exact detal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had just turned onto the street leading to our home and I looked up and saw this large oval shaped/saucer shaped object in the sky over an old cornfield near the local high school. I remember opening my window and pulling over to get a better look and it was just there-I heard no noise and the one thing that stands out in my mind was that this thing had lots of beige colored lights going around it-and some of them were not on. My younger sisters started to cry and I was scared so we continued driving down the road and when I turned into my neighborhood, it had moved over an area of houses in the neighborhood. again the same thing, no noise-like a plane or a military jet. it was very large and after that we just went home. and I was afraid at the time bc the tv show &#34;V&#34; was very popular and I thought they would come and get me. My parents werent home and I did not call the police for fear of them thinking I was crazy. We lived close to McGuire AFB so I thought maybe it was a test plane-but it did not look like a plane. I have thought about this incident often. I am now 35 and it is still on my mind-after seeing this site-I thought for once I could tell someone who wont think I am crazy. I also had a friend who had mentioned seeing something similar in the same town a year or two before me.  And like I said, the one thing that stands out in my mind was the size of this thing, the fact that it made no noise and the lights that were on and the lights that were not on. What do you think? Did I see something? Did anyone else ever report anything strange around that time? I dont remember the exact date-but I do think it was the fall. Thank you for listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My bedroom window faced S.E. and had a great view of the horizon over the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event occured 5 days straight with slight variations in activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What made this notable was this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the first morning at about 05:00 to 05:30 I awoke to a very bright light in the SE sky about 3inches (by extending arm to measure) off the horizon. Having a love of astromony at the time (and currently) I pulled out my favorite starchart and looked to see if it was a conjunction, venus, jupiter etc. It wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very clear out and it being extremely bright(the light) yet twinkling. ANd according to the chart it wasn&#39;t any fixed star either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it until the sun rose. Approxamtly 2 hours or so. And it did not move from it postion whatsoever. I knew then that the celetial sphere should have moved it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOW, it was daylight and the thing was &#39;still&#39; visible. Still twinkiling wildly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that day I mentioned it to my mother. She asked me to get her if I saw it again. And the next morning I woke up without prompting and there it was. I got up, brought over to see it. We watched it until the sun rose. This time I pulled out my &#39;kids&#39; telescope and we took turns looking at it. I can&#39;t recall the final magnification we used but this is what we both saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (the resolution was not the best) But it appeared to be oval or disk like in shape, appeared to have lights on the leading edge, red and blue/or greenish. ALthough I assume it was somewhat distored from the heat inside the room and the outside cold air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also saw what looked like 3 other pinpoints of light coming from and going back to the light. Making thier way down &#39;in a zig-zag like movement&#39; then another returning... This just continued for hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occured for 5 mornings straight. I only wish I got up earlier to see when it came visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The perspective of our &#39;point of view&#39; would land the light hovering either between &#39;Lake Ariel&#39; to as far as &#39;Moscow/Gouldsboro&#39; Pa.. Hard to say, but they lay in the line of sight from there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We wonder whether a celestial body might have been the cause of the sightings.

After a high school football game my mother and I were riding home down dark rural streets. Behind the trees it appeared to be a flying object flying paralell to us at about the same speed ( maybe 30 mph ). When we got to a cross road by our home we stopped , got out of the car, and looked up and was dumbstruck at what we saw. It was a clear open area (the crossroad ) and it was directly overhead, maybe 300 feet in the air ( very low ). From directly underneath it was round with 4 white lights and a red one in the middle. It was probably 75 - 100 yards long. It completely covered all the stars behind it and sat there for maybe 30 seconds hovering above us with NO noise what so ever. It then started moving away from us behind the trees and out of sight. When we got home I immediately called the Camden airport to see if they had anything on radar or knew of anything flying in the area , and they said no. I often wonder if they even had a Radar system. Anyway, I know what I saw, It was nothing I&#39;ve ever seen in life or on TV . I truly believe it was from a superior intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Needless to say, we never got to use the telescope. My daughter was laying in the back of my station wagon,and started telling me that a car was coming and that I should pull off the road a little more to avoid being in the way. I glanced back at the headlights coming behind us, and even though something told me that there was somthing wierd about the lights, I started to get in the car to pull over more.  Suddenly, my daughter started to yell that it was not a car, and for my friend and I to look behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights that had been behind us, were now lifting up and over the car! My daughter wouldn&#39;t get out to see it right away, because she was afraid, but my friend and I were transfixed on the craft. It, was definetly triangular, it made NO sound,the lights were very muted on the bottom of the craft. It&#39;s size was VERY large. I would say, (I know ther are better terms) the size of an acre or a little more of land. It was crusing very slowly, about 25 to 30 miles an hr. heading in a southern direction toward Muncie, In.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were watching this craft going off into the distance, and questioning each other to what we had just seen, when my daughter started yelling again,that there was another one coming up behind us! My friend and I looked back, and there was another craft, exactly like the first, heading in the same direction as the previous one! We all watched this one follow the same course as the first, noting again that there was no sound, and although there were lights, they were very muted. The outsides of the crafts were very dark,and appeared to be one with the blackness of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that unforgettable sighting, we raced back to town and called the Muncie airport to see if they had heard any reports or seen anything on their screens, but they hadn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend has since died, but my daughter and I will never forget what we witnessed.<n>

My friend and I were about 14 years old.  We were wrestling in a neighbors yard as we did often.  I had my friend pinned down and he was fighting to get up.  All of the sudden, he froze and stared into the sky directly behind me.  I turned around and saw three orange-red circles in a linear fashion.  This object was not moving nor did it make any sound.  It would have been approximately 50 yards in the sky at about a  45 degree angle.  After a few seconds, the object starting moving towards a wooded area about 300 yards away.  We followed it to the woods.  I probably would have never mentioned this except for the strange events that followed.  I honestly do not remember anything after we got to the woods.  I do not remember going home and as far as I can remember, my friend and I have never talked about the incident.  I remember one time mentioning the event in the presence of others and was stopped short of telling the story by the friend that was with me.  The part that has always stuck with me is the way he looked at me.  It actually frightened me and still does to this day.  I have always wanted to ask him about the event but, I always “chickened out.”  After that incident, I did not mention the event to anyone for at least 9 years.  I, of course, leave out the details of the mystery of the event to the 10 people I have told.  I just say the object disappeared past the woods.  I do not want people to think I am crazy but, I just cannot get the event out of my head.  I just felt I needed to say something.  I have started to report this incident many times but, always erase it and try to forget about it.  The comical thing about me reporting this is the fact that I never planned on doing so.  I wonder how many people out there never do report their stories.  I know of a few that never did.  I bet you would have at least twenty times more reports filed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was moving forward very slowly.  I ran out onto the front lawn and there was a round saucer directly above my house, about 50 feet in the air.  It was silver metallic and made no sound at all.  I ran back into the house and got my son who was 8 at the time.  We stood on the front lawn and watched in amazement as it silently passed over us and moved towards the strip mall across the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was large, about the size of my house.  Because of the strip mall and surrounding street lights we could see it very clearly.  It had a dome on the top and from the side we were on we counted twelve square blue lights so I figured there must have been 24 around the entire dome.  They would all go off and one by one come back on again.  At first I thought the lights might have been windows because of their shape but I tried to see inside and couldn’t see anything and then they went off which is when I realized they were lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there watching until it disappeared behind the strip mall which took about 5 minutes since it was only moving as fast as a person could walk.  I wish I had the sense to grab my camera and take pictures but it never occurred to me to do that because I was really in shock at seeing a UFO at all, especially up close.  The funny thing was we weren’t afraid of it, just in awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after seeing it I called my husband who was away on a business trip in San Diego and told him and I also told one friend but never reported it or told anyone else because I thought they would say I was crazy.  My son is 33 now and we still talk about it.  I tell everyone now and don’t care if they believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did read in the paper over the next few days that it was also seen later that night by one police officer on his beat, another police officer standing on his deck, and by a lady who was up feeding her newborn and saw it out her apartment window hovering over the bay.  I have looked online for those articles but haven’t been able to find them.<n>
10/12/85 23:45|Swansboro|NC|Disk|23:45 - 23:50|My sister and I observed a disk for about 5 minutes hovering approximately 120 feet away.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14568.html|13|ndxe198510| My sister and I observed a disk for about 5 minutes hovering approximately 120 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I were watching the Johnny Carson show and when a commercial came, my sister got up to go to the bathroom which is in the kithchen.  To get to the kitchen from the den, she had to walk right next to a set of sliding glass doors that ran parallel to the White Oak river.  She yelled for me to come into the kitchen to look at something, she had to call several times because she does the same thing at the site of  a cockroach, clearly an overexadurater.  This time however, she had spotted something much bigger than a roach. As I turned and looked through the glass and over the river, I caught my first sight of a black disk that must have been 30 feet in diameter and about 10 feet thick in the middle and tapering to about 3 feet thick equilaterally at the circumference. The craft was hovering about 50 feet above the water and approximately 120 feet from my siter and I.  That put our vantage at just slightly above the craft when I noticed the moon reflecting off of a semi-gloss black finish. We were stunned but not afraid.  We slid the large glass door open and walked out onto the first floor deck and the first strange thing I noticed was the complete absence of noise.  The craft was literally hovering noiselessly in front of me.  That is when the gravity of the situation hit me.  Living between Cherry Point Air Force Base and Camp Lejune Marine Corps base, it was not unusual for aircraft to fly directly over the house.  In fact it seemed that the Marine Corps had mapped a low altitude helicopter route directly over the house.  Helicopters do however make an unmistakable noise which would have been nearly unbearable at the range I was from the noiseless black disk. My sister and I walked across the deck and down the stairs onto the concrete driveway which was littered with shattered hickory nuts that had been run over by my mother&#39;s Buick.  The reason that I mention the hickory nuts is because I was bare footed at the time and the only thing that distracted me from the noiseless black disk was the incessant pricking on the bottoms of my feet.  It was for this reason that my sister and I walked off of the driveway onto the grass.  Myself having moved about 90 degrees horizontally, about 20 degrees vertically, and about 30 feet closer, it was fairly clear that the object was taking up 3 dimensional space. From the time that my sister called me to come see the object to the time that we were standing in the grass was a matter of about 2 minutes.  We stood in the grass for about 1 minute which also happens to be the amount of time we watched the craft before it left.  During that 1 minute, things went from being strange to being inexplicable.  The craft began to move slightly more into the bay and away from us, but it wavered a bit horizontally.  After about 30 seconds of that, it moved farther out into the channel.  At this position, it was equidistant from the shore and from the White Oak river bridge (of the two bridges, the bridge on the Swansboro side).  It wavered a bit in this direction as well.  Finally, as it slowly moved toward the bridge, it gained speed so quickly that its path was traced with a streak of light.  As it left, it moved forward much faster than upward, but it did move upward and to the left.  When I say it gained speed quickly, I mean that it was gone in a matter of a tenth of a second. When the last minute of the observation of the craft was over, the first minute of discovering its effect had begun.  Immediately I heard the noise of masses of minnows jumping in the water.  My sister and I walked down onto the dock to investigate the seemingly amplified noise.  What we discovered was a large area of foam.  In fact the water seemed to be boiling.  All around us the minnows were jumping.  Normally minnows swim in schools of about 30-60 which might measure 5 square feet in surface area.  While in a school, each minnow acts as one so that when one is scared the entire school is scared.  I have been in situations where maybe 5 schools of minnows will jump at the same time because I jumped on the dock, but never before and never since have I seen so many minnows jumping.  In retrospect I wish I would have put my toes in the water to see if it was hot, but I didn&#39;t.  I&#39;ve often wondered if the thick foam on top of the water was caused by all of the minnows jumping or if all the minnows were jumping because the water was foamy. At that point, approximately 7 minutes had passed and my mother had come outside.  My sister and I told her what had happened and I guess she was too tired to care.  A few months after the experience I drew what I had seen with crayons for a science teacher, and I bet he still has it somewhere. At the time, my sister was 13 years old and I was 8 years old.  My sister and I haven&#39;t talked about it since just after it happened.  During my education at a state supported University, I realized how contradictory what I have seen is to contemporary physics.  The truth is going to be nice.<n>

10/1/85 22:45|Lawrence|KS|Sphere||Red Light seen in Lawrence, Kansas, during Johnny Carson's Monologue|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67583.html|16|ndxe198510| Red Light seen in Lawrence, Kansas, during Johnny Carson&#39;s Monologue<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember the exact date since it was over 20 years ago but I saw something that I could not find any reason to exist save for being a UFO of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a light appear in the sky while I was watching my small (about 10-inch) black and white TV as I was getting ready to go to sleep.  The time is about right because I was watching Johnny Carson&#39;s monologue.  An ad break came on, so I just glanced outside and this is when I saw an orange-red ball of light &#34;hovering&#34; in the sky.  I stared at it for a moment, then leaned up to get a better look at it.  At that point, it zoomed away toward the left side of the window (which would equate to a northerly direction of movement) but returned when I lay back down on the pillow.  I looked around my room to see what might be causing a reddish reflection in the window but there was nothing.  I looked back at the window again and found that the ball was still just hovering there.  Testing again that it was something in the room, I leaned forward again and it zoomed off again, as before, and returned when I lay back down.  I tried it again and it zoomed away yet again but not to the left (north).  Instead, it dashed away nearly straight up and did not return when I put my head back on the pillow.  I tried sitting up and down a few more times but it didn&#39;t return.  At that point, as I had missed most of Johnny&#39;s monologue, I shut off the TV and went to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night, during the monologue, the object returned.  We went through the same ritual again but for less time this night: on the second sit-up from the pillow, it zoomed off and away again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This repeated for the next few nights but then never returned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no street lights that could explain this as there was only one light in the area and that was almost directly beneath where the sphere was seen.  It couldn&#39;t have been someone with a laser pointer since they were not common two decades ago and it would not explain the type of motion that I witnessed.  Further, I did hold up my hand to see if it was broadcasting a confined beam of light, such as a flashlight might project and nothing of that nature was in evidence.  I also made sure two of the nights that everything in the bedroom was shut off and unplugged.  (At the time, that included only my TV, which had no LEDs as it was an old-style dial TV with a built-in antenna, an alarm clock/radio, and an Apple //c computer with external SupraModem 2400 dial-up modem.)  The bedroom door was closed, so no light sources from another room were possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what it was but am convinced that it was not something as easily explained as a reflection or a terrestrial aircraft, not with the flight characteristics that the movements implied.  Thus, this, to my mind, equates to an unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was shaped more like a stop sighn (an octagone) with lights that borderd its edges we slambed on the breakes pulled off to the right hand side of the road ran up a small hill and watched as it took off threw the hills over creston, it made no sound what so ever. when we got home I called and reported it to the national defence department in washington d.c. I never heard anything back after that, they probably just got a nice laugh about it, Oh well, It did happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i did in the last box. full description in last box<n>

It was about 5:30am and we we|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59934.html|19|ndxe198510| Years ago, my husband&#39;s aunt and I witnessed something very strange on the way to work early one morning. It was about 5:30am and we were traveling north from Monroe to Matthews on Old Charlotte Highway. We had just passed the Bakers vacinity and were passing over the railroad tracks when I looked over at her (she was driving) to say something, and saw what I first thought was an enormous reddish-orange moon hovering on the horizon. I remarked that it was the biggest moon I had ever seen in my life, and she glanced over too and agreed. She was not a person to get excited about ANYTHING, so she just kept driving. I leaned down to get a better look, and instantly realized this was no moon! It was the size of a garbage can lid held at arms&#39; length at that point (enormous!), and it was perfectly round and glowing red/orange like the the color of lava. Because we were still driving, I couldn&#39;t tell if it was moving or just stationary. All this happened very quickly. I knew this was something very strange, and tried to get Aunt B&#39;s opinion, but she refused to look at it or comment on it (she was just that way, ignore it and it will go away). She said, &#34;It&#39;s just the moon&#34;. I thought it was awful strange that it appeared to be &#34;on fire&#34; and yet, it was not lighting up the entire sky like a glowing red fireball probably would. Instead, it appeared to be just glowing, as if it had an inner light source. Nothing else looked unusual about the landscape or weather. It was very clear and cold that morning. I looked around to my side of the road, thinking everything should be orange colored, and looked up at the sky and panicked when I saw the real moon way up in the sky, white as snow, and the shape of a tiny fingernail! I begged her to stop the car so I could get a better look, but she silently just kept on traveling. I again looked out her window, saw the giant sphere glowing in the sky beside us, and suddenly, we passed by a stand of trees that blacked it out for a moment, and when we emerged, it ! was gone ! I tried to find a explanation for it, but nothing worked. It wasn&#39;t the upcoming water tower (she and I both agreed on this) as it was yet to be in view, and it was on the wrong side of the road. To this day, she has never discussed it, and gets furious if I bring it up. I did report this to MUFON by email, and they responded that it was probably a &#34;ball of gases&#34; since there is a fault line in the vacinity. I don&#39;t believe that for one second! This was perfectly shaped, brilliantly colored, enormous and didn&#39;t appear to light up anything else around! I couldn&#39;t hear anything, but then again, we were still going up the road. I have no explanation for it, and am relieved to read on here that others have had a similar experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I saw a bright light, not very large, passing from the north and moving to the south, the light appeared to be quite high. I thought it was an aircraft passing overhead.The light was steady, did not blink. I did not notice any sounds, nor any delayed sounds due to a jet airplane overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light was directly over me it appeared to come to a stop, stayed there briefly, say 2-3 seconds, then moved at an extremely high rate of speedoff at a 90 degree angle to the west. In comparison to most obervations of spacecraft in orbit, which I have observed, much faster say within 2-3 seconds it was gone from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the light was about the same as most earth objects in orbit which I have seen over the years. I could not identify any details as it was much too high in the sky. However, the abrupt 90 degree turn after stopping was noted as unusual. This is the first time I have mentioned this to any organization.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
