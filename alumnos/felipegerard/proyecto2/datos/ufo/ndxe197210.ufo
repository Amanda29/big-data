10/29/72 15:30|Monroeville|AL|Cylinder|15 seconds|Fighter jet chasing object in the sky over south Alabama|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61225.html|1|ndxe197210| Fighter jet chasing object in the sky over south Alabama.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and myself 34 years ago were traveling down a dirt road on our way to hunt in some local timberland areas.  We are from a small town in southwest Alabama.  As we travelled down the road we were talking and shooting the breeze like most teenagers would be doing.  I don&#39;t remember which one of us first noticed the object, but, we observed a shinny object streaking across the sky.  We took the time to decide if it was a plane with the sun reflecting off it or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We came to the quick conclusion that it was simply a cigar shaped object moving at a very rapid pace across the clear blue sky.  We of course, could not determine the speed or size of the object , however it was quickly making its way out of our view.  Stunned at what we saw, we both decided it must have been a jet of some kind flying extremely lower then we antiscipated and fast, until we noticed a fighter jet on the same plane and general area of flight pattern as the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be chasing or mirroring the objects movements but obviously not moving as fast as the object had been moving.  But it was evident that they were not the same size and the sun was not reflecting off the jet, so the first object must have been different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whether or not we were witnesses to a ufo or not, it is a memory that will never leave me.  I would like to believe it was.  It has been a thought of mine for all my life, that we would be a very arrogant planet of people to think in all the universe, that we were the smartest or even alone in the vastness of space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Who are we to think God didn&#39;t experiment with many planets with many Adams and Eves.  And if on one of those other planets, Eve didn&#39;t eat the apple, wouldn&#39;t that society of people, all of like thinking without hate, judgement, and malice, all come together thousands of years ago to learn, invent, and explore the universe quicker than the way our society of warlords and human haters have done it?  Wouldn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t they have come a long way further in a shorter period of time than we did because we were greedy and self absorbed in ourselves rather then working together for the common good?  Our world is too busy tending to each others business and building technology to destroy each other, rather than building a united world toward the betterment of mankind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They would be so far more advanced then we will ever make it. I personally believe  all this is very possible.  If we developed in a world of togetherness, just what could we have invented or produced to this point?  Anyone who says we are alone in the universe, is a fool.  As much as anyone who says there is no God is one.  Athiest are the dumbest people around.  Smart wisdom would say that you should believe in God and the afterlife and other life.  After all, the atheist has nothing to live for after they die, but if they are wrong, they will be sorry.  Smart money says take the Christian way , just in case, we are right , and you are wrong.  You have nothing to lose doing it the Chirstian way, because your way just ends either way..  Why take the chance?  The same way of believing in ufo&#39;s.  If we don&#39;t believe as a society, then we lose the wonder of it.  If they do exist, then we have much to learn about how we treat each other.  If they do exist, then hopefully someone will prove it one day, and our world of greedy selfabsorbed people, might, just might, grow the hell up and work together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Enough said....  Tell me what you think.  ((e-address deleted))<n>

Very bright lights through ports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a nice fall evening,  My two youngest children were in the house with me, my teen age son was in the garage working out.  He came into the house and told us to come outsede, there was an object in the sky and the animals were making awful sounds.  We hurried out and saw the object, hovering quite close to the ground and I realized that I didn&#39;t hear a s ound.  It had very bright lights shining through the  ports.  I was aware that none of my dogs were at all concerned and were quite.  I went in and tried to call my husband who was at a Kiwanis meeting but didn&#39;t get him.  I went back out and it was still there,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next I went in and called the local troopers and told them to look in our direction and they might see it. I returned outside and it was still there.  Next thing I knew, my son had gone into the house and was returning with a gun, as he was frightened.  AT that point the object came toward us and rose quickly into the sky and just disappeared.  As it left, it appeared to be triangular in shape. I actually made another call, to a friend after I called the troopers.  I told her the horses were making noices.  Later she asked me why I said horses, because we had only one, and I told her it was because all three of the children were hearing noice from the nearby hill, which I did not hear.  This object was large and I would estimate about the size of a football field.  I was not frighened, just excited.<n>

Because you just don&#39;t forget about something like this, it&#39;s just to big.Maybe I am not intended to understand why or how.I do know you cannot erase these kind of memories from your mind.I only hope one day I  might find my answer,as so many others need to know also. as to why these events take place.I have had other strange happenings since ,another time ..thanks for reading…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Place:  North Tarrytown, New York.  I was 10 or 11 years old, playing in yard with younger brother.  We were called to front of house by mother to see &#34;something in the sky&#34;.  We saw a metallic, disk shaped object with dome and portholes.  Each porthole glowed with lights that were colorful and bright.  It was hovering at a height of 10 to 15 stories high.  Suddenly, it started to rise quickly and then took off north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime between fall 1971 or 1972. It was a cloudy day sometime between noon and 4pm.  I was 10 or 11 years old and my brother 8 or 9.  We were playing in yard when our mother yelled for us to come over to the front of the house to see &#34;something in the sky&#34;.  We ran over and saw, at a height of 10 to 15 stories high, across the street, and slightly to the right from our position, a smooth, metallic, disk shaped object with a dome and brightly lit portholes.  It was stationary but seemed to be slowly rotating and did not make any noise whatsoever.  What impressed us about the portholes is that they had bright, pulsing colors emanating from them. At this height it seemed a little over shoulder width in width from my vantage point (I am 6ft tall with jacket lenght of 42-44). After a minute or so, it rose straight up until it seemed the size of a dime and then took off in a northerly direction.  It was out of sight in about 10 seconds.  This happened when we resided on 138 Beekman Avenue in North Tarrytown, New York.  The residence was right next to a police station.  We were on the sidewalk looking up and slightly north.  My mother recalls the event but refuses to talk about it other than remark that she does remember it as I described it.  My brother remembers it clearly.  This memory resurfaced winter of 1992 and at first I thought it was of a dream until I checked with my brother and mother.  My mother seems scared about that incident, my brother has an interest in the subject and I have been staring at the sky and reading related information ever since.  I would like to know if this sighting has ever been documented by others and if there were any newspaper reports in the local papers. I have also had other, more serious experiences pertaining to ufos that I would like to discuss with someone.<n>

I was a teenager walking to school and for some unknown reason looked up into the sky infront of me towards the east. I saw an oval shaped UFO above the tree line, travelling at a steady speed going from north to south towards Lake Ontario. It was following the street ahead of me that was in the direction of north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was the color of tarnished silver and dented like a golf ball (but not as many dents).There was no lights or sound to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd thing about this object was that there was a strip of black symbols on the mid front half portion on the facing side of it. I tried to read them but couldn&#39;t because they were not actual letter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Each panel was lit for well under a second of time before the panel next to it lit. Only one panel at a time would light.

We were on Fork Shoals rd. and heading towards my home.  A huge light, It was the brightest light I had ever seen in my life.  It was so bright that we could hardly seen how to drive.  The faster my date drove the light stayed right with us.  Finally after about 5 minutes driving about 70 mph, the light just disapeared! We had no idea what it was or where it came from, all I know was we were young and never had seen anything like it before until in 1999 and I was driving a friend of mine&#39;s straight truck that we was going to Georgetown,SC to pick up her 2 mirrows and gas lanterns for her new house.  We had just left Florence,S.C. where we had stopped and eat and it was late, around 9:30. I had just pulled out onto highway 20 leaving Florence. I had just stopped at a red light and was not speeding and all of a sudden we saw a bright light behind us. The first thing I thought of was the police! I told my friend, oh, No! I said it&#39;s the police, and I started to pull over on side of the road and said to her...what I&#39;m I been stopped for? I just pulled off from the red light! As I started to stop, The light vanished! NO Police, NO Lights, Everything was gone! Not a car around us anywhere, and there were cars there at the light when we stopped. Everything went from bright light all around us, to no light and Nobody around us!! It scared us so bad, we didn&#39;t know what had been behind us, because no cars, no police went around us at all. We have never forgotten that night or I the night when I was only 16 years old and on a date! What was this light? It was like a HUG white/blue LED LIGHT and No sound. Twice I have been chased by a HUG BRIGHT LIGHT, WHY?<n>
10/1/72 23:00|Pickens/Pumpkintown|SC|Chevron|30+ minutes|Slowly moving boomerang shape with four bluish-white lights on each leading edge; made a humming sound.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17980.html|13|ndxe197210| Slowly moving boomerang shape with four bluish-white lights on each leading edge; made a humming sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Octber of 1972 while I was a student I was driving with a friend on a Sunday night returning home from a double date via a country road. We both noticed a bright white light moving slowly from left to right circling a large hill.  We thought that it was a ranger plane and drove on without interest until we noticed that it seemed to be following us.  We could see it sometimes in front and sometimes behind us.  By this time we were driving from 40 to 50 MPH, depending upon the curvature of the road, trying to keep the opject in sight.  Thinking of the height of a broadcast antenna, the object may have been 1000 feet above ground and seemed to be the size of a small fingernail held at arms length.  We also noticed that the FM car radio was being affected by unusual static.  After several minutes of driving during which I either increased or decreased speed trying to view the object better, it finally veered off toward a large empty field and stopped at what looked to be only a few yards off the ground.  I stopped my car and asked my friend to get out with me.  My friend, a large, burly &#34;country boy&#34; at first would not leave the car, but later consented to do so.  We observed the object for several minutes until we noticed that it was moving.  We watched in awe as this object slowly soared into the air moving upward at a 45 degree angle.  It looked like a &#34;chevron&#34; or &#34;boomerang&#34;, with the pointed edge at the front.  The two ends were both squared off, not pointed or rounded.  We saw four bluish-white lights on each leading edge.  The object moved slowly, perhaps 20-25 MPH and was possibly 250 feet above the ground and about 500 feet away.  At that height and distance I probably could have obscured most of the object with my open palm held at arms length.  We could clearly see the outline of the main body of the object, which was dark, against the night sky (the moon was almost full), and it was absolutely plain that there was nothing between the two sides of the &#34;chevron&#34; - so we could clearly tell that it was not an airplane.  The object made a steady humming sound, not a droning or cyclic sound, like a generator. The sound was not very loud - my friend and I talked as it passed by us - and the sound faded as the object became more distant from us.  The object moved across the road to a distance of several hundred yards where again it looked like only a single light as when we first noticed it, and stopped.  My friend and I got back in the car and moved forward on the road trying to keep the object in sight.  The object began to move and gain altitude and once again a sort of chase resumed, where the object would be either in front of or behind us as we tried to keep pace with it.  The object suddenly stopped at an altitude of perhaps 500 feet, and we stopped directly below it, watching it from inside the car.  The object remained motionless for about 3-4 minutes, and then suddenly shot straight up and disappeared.  Since that occurance I have retired from a career in the military, where I was exposed to all types of airborne craft.  I have never seen or heard any type of jet, plane, or helicopter that even remotely resembles what I observed that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

So this happened in about 1972-1974.  I was watching Charlie Brown,&#34;The Great Pumpkin&#34; so this happened sometime in October.  My Father would go out on the back porch at night to smoke.  The porch faced almost due west.  I went out to see what he was looking at.  It was your classic &#34;saucer shape&#34; with two lights hanging underneath.  It was floating low over the creek about 400 yards west of the house.  About 300-400 feet up.  The moon was about 3/4ths full and was shining brightly off the craft.  It had an almost polished aluminum color.  The lights hanging underneath slowly changed colors though the entire spectrum.  They remind me of some kind of stage light.  Clear quiet night, no noise whatsoever came from this craft.  My dad and I watched it for about 10 minutes, then he told me to go inside.  I continues to what through the door for about another 10-15 minutes until my dad came in and it was time for bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was between midnight and 6:00 am.  Both of us saw a lighted object ahead of us, not too far above treetops moving very slowly to the north.  My husband remembers it to have an orange glowing color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first saw the object, it was south of the highway and moving slowly northward.  We looked at each other and asked if the other was also seeing the strange light moving at the unusually slow speed.  Both of us did so my husband stopped the car on the shoulder of the roadway and we continued to watch from within the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lighted object moved northward across Hwy 380 very slowly.  At some point, when the object was north of Hwy 380, the object came to a stop and seemed to split into two parts.  The smaller part continued its northerly path, but at a very high rate of speed.  It was gone in a matter of seconds.  The other part appeared to returned southward across the highway from where it had originated but moved much more slowly than its first approach.  We watched both parts until they were out of sight.  The entire sighting took place over the course of  less than  5-10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have never forgotten it.  We have never seen anything like it since then, but both of us believe that what we saw was not something we have seen before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband born in Denton and was 32 at the time of this sighting.  He was employed by a local municipality where he went on to work until retirement 26 years later.  We raised two children and have continued to live in Denton.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I think the|5/24/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/007/S07567.html|17|ndxe197210| Iwas abducted around age 7 or 8. They came will I WAS Asleep. they look into my room from the hall. They took me to a room. I think they placed an implant behind my left ear and brung me back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this night of this abduction I was only 7 or 8 yrs old. The reason I have not said any thing for so long I have tryed to put this off as a bad dream. But the more research I done the more I would remember about my own abduction. It happened on a school night I was asleep in my room. We had old wood floors in our house that would squeek when you walk across it. And while I was sleeping that is what I heard. was the floor squeeking. I look at the door to my bedroom and (saw what I believe now where 2 gray ailen&#39;s)looking at me. I yelled for my dad.  And he found nothing or no one around and informed me if I woke him up anymore I was in deep trouble. Well they came back and stood looking at me from the hallway. I was so scared, I can not remember anytime in my life being so scared. They took me to a room with a table. Look like an operation room. I assume this is on their ship. I don&#39;t recall seeing a ship. But they took me to this operating room. There were three ailens there. One looked like a doctor or the one in charge. he was a littel taller than the others. It look like he had an assitant. And their was an ailen tring to calm me down. I was in a hysteria of fear. I was crying and screaming for my dad. And the ailen that was trying to calm me down just look at the others as if it didn&#39;t know what to do. Shortly after this a person came out that look like my dad and I calm down. But I was still very scared. They rolled me onto my right side and did something behind my left ear. I believe it could be an implant behind my ear. As soon as the operation was over they brung me back to my bedroom and the person that look like my dad told me &#34;don&#39;t play with that behind your ear untill you get up in the morning&#34;. I have not had any contacts scince. No any other memories of any such activity. I hope this helps. I hated it happening to me and I hope it dosen&#34;t happen to anyone else. But I know it dose. thats why I finaly said something.<n>
