The lights were ahead of him.  There were initially 4 lights and then there were 3.  These lights kept criss crossing extremely fast.  He pulled over, turned off the car and watched them.  They were heading toward Pardee Lake outside town.  This happened on a 3 mile stretch of back road.  There were no other cars to witness.  My son was very scared when he arrived home.  He ran in the house and went out the back door to see if he could see the lights.  The lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/28/09 20:00|Huntsville|UT|Light|about a half hour|An object that ommitted a very bright light, almost looked like it had three lights on it.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus.  PD))|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69003.html|2|ndxe200902| An object that ommitted a very bright light, almost looked like it had three lights on it<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving with my finance and son in the car towards property his grandparents owned.  He had a trailer on the property and we needed some stuff from.  On our way to the dirt road to get to the property I noticed a big bright object below the moon.  I didn’t want time seem weird but it stood out more so, but I thought it was just maybe Venus because it was normal to see Venus kind of big during this time of year.  It was brighter then Venus though and looked like it had three lights from it since it was giving off a very bright glow.  It still has my attention though and I keep my eyes on it, since it looked out of the ordinary and I was just trying to reason with myself. When we got up to the piece of property, my fiancé got out of the car to get to the trailer.  I was still watching this object trying to figure out why it was so bright. Then it started to move side to side, up and down, even looked like circles. I was alarmed since I was trying to figure out if I was out of my mind. I tried to debunk it too, but I was seeing planes in the distance flying and I could tell it was a plane too. But I could not tell this was a plane, it started to get closer then further away and it looked like it was flying at an angle to the left and tilted. It was weird. I told my fiancé when he came back to the car to sit in the driver passenger seat and look at this. He asked me, “Look at what?” and I replied, “Just come look.” He sits down and I point at the object and tell him to look. I asked him if I was the only one seeing this and he told me, “No, you are not. I can see it moving weirdly.” He left for a second trip and I told him to hurry since I was still alarmed. The object was still moving in a weird fashion and went out further in distance. It was still in the far distance and looked like it was searching for something. But we left at about 8:30pm and it was still in the far distance, when we hit the main canyon road we could not see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus.  PD))<n>
2/28/09 20:00|Yorba Linda|CA|Triangle|10 minutes|Triangular color changing object in the east|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69005.html|3|ndxe200902| Triangular color changing object in the east<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were outside for a walk in the neighborhood and we looked up to see 2 color changing figures in a shape of a triangle.  The objects were turning very slowly in one place.  They were changing various colors such as red, orange,yellow, white, and blue. One of the objects faded and disappeared in a blink of an eye.  The other object moved very fast to the west and headed toward us. As it past over it made no sound. Soon after we went inside we came back to find 3 other bright multicolored lights in about the same place as the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time the objects turned the same colors but one stayed white.  They were in a triangular shape while flying and soon broke off quickly into different directions.  As they broke off one went to the side and stopped turning colors then vanished for 10 seconds and came back.  The next one went the opposite way that it started and stayed turning colors.  The one that stayed all white went to the south side for a couple minutes then started heading toward us again.  All of these made no noise and soon dimmed into the night.  After about 30 minutes we went back to look again and there was nothing.   It was all clear except one tiny little star.  If anyone saw a similar sighting at about the same time (which is 8:30 pm on February 28, 2009) please report the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank-You!  ((names deleted))<n>

We were in the Abby Gardens when we noticed a formation of what we thought were black balloons (thought they might have been a cluster of parachutes too)   Each craft looked as if 2 hot air balloons were side by side and connected.  There were 6 to 7 total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were ascending and descending and moving left to right for the first couple of minutes.  I was able to capture a small video clip on my phone.  I do not know if the quality is any good yet.  I stopped a man to verify my sighting, and he agreed it to be a UFO of some kind (I did not get his name).  We watched them ascend out of site by 1710.  The formation was much more scattered toward the end. On the way out of the park I noticed a lone UFO craft that was speeding toward the direction the other craft had gone (1713).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear and affirm this story to be true. I even studied the local bird patterns to verify it was a UFO of some sort.  I have tried repeatedly to find a reason these were not UFO’s and I cannot find any.  My 10 year old daughter also witnessed the entire event from start to finish.  We were not on any substances or drugs nor do we suffer from any medical or mental conditions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We will be contacting the Bury Free Press newspaper with the story to see if there were any other reports.  Oddest thing I have ever seen in my life<n>
2/28/09 11:20|Phoenix (above; in-flight sighting)|AZ|Circle|5 seconds|small, silver ball with red light/glow low altitude|5/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81115.html|5|ndxe200902| small, silver ball with red light/glow low altitude<n> <n><n> <n><n> While descending into Phoenix, AZ on a clear, bright morning, I saw something that I&#39;ll never forget.  We had descended to at a relatively low altitude, maybe 6,000ft or less.  I was enjoying the view from my window when I saw something fly by my window in the opposite direction.  At the same time, I heard a woman gasp a few rows ahead of me which led me to believe I wasn’t the only one to witness this strange object.  The object was small (beach ball size), silver/chrome, round and had a red light or glow to it.  It was within 40 feet of the plane, above the wing on the left side (or right side from my perspective).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we landed in Phoenix, I had intended to ask the pilots if they had seen anything strange but when I got to the exit, the pilots were already gone which I found very peculiar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an avid world traveler, I have literally been on hundreds of flights all over the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything from a 13 seat Otter to a Boeing 747 and I have never seen anything like to what I saw that February day.<n>

It was about 5:00 am and still pitch dark with a clear sky.  A very brilliant white light just above my tree line caught my eye from a small second storey window looking north.  It is hard to judge size, but I&#39;d guess it spanned two or three tree tops from my vantage point, which would make it very large projecting outward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to stress that I did not have my glasses on, so I could not dicern shape, but that made the experience no less strange.  The light moved slowly from east (Eastsound, Orcas Island) to west along the tree line.  There was a slow pulsing light seemingly attached under the primary light of smaller size, but also bright white.  The light was bright enough to send rays through the trees, as you will sometimes see when the morning sun shines through on a misty morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cranked open a window to try to hear what this was.  It was virtually silent except for an almost imperceptible reverbant humm.  Velocity was constant, I&#39;d guess it passed out of view well inside of thirty seconds.  This is the first time I have experienced anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
2/27/09 23:30|East Fishkill|NY|Oval|1 minute|Large circular object stationary with very large white lights around it, more lights underneath & above the circular lights.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69011.html|7|ndxe200902| Large circular object stationary with very large white lights around it, more lights underneath &amp; above the circular lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on the Taconic State Parkway North at approx. 11:20pm. I was in an elevated area where the road winds between hills, and I saw what I thought was a low flying plane. There&#39;s an airport in the area and we see the low flying planes landing all the time. When I rounded the curve in the road, the object was stationary up on top of the hill with very large white lights in a circle around the object. Every other light would dim as the others would brighten. There were lights underneath the object, and a few above the circle of blinking lights. It was about the size of 3 houses. I realized this was not an airplane being stationary and circular. I was alone, and too frightened to stop, and it was too close for comfort. I sped away. Returned the next day for an explanation - Just trees up on the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/27/09 23:23|Camas|WA|Oval|seconds|White oval craft flying ridiculous speeds, changing direction in seconds.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68988.html|8|ndxe200902| White oval craft flying ridiculous speeds, changing direction in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving down 18th street in Camas, Washington, going about 27 mph.  I looked out the drivers side window and saw a fast moving aircraft parallel to the car [traveling south towards Portland airspace], I noticed it was traveling much faster then any other plane then I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked back towards the road and asked the two passengers to look out the windows and spot it.  Once they found it, it had changed course and was now perpendicular to us, moving west.  We all agree that it looked as if it was more in Portland airspace then in Washington, but distance is relative.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd thing is, on top of the Incredible speed, was the fact that the craft was purely white in color, I do believe that FAA standards regulate for a navigation light on at least the wings and tail.  There were none of these.  Only white lights all around the craft with one white strobe light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, it was going faster then I&#39;ve ever seen even an F-22 fly.<n>
2/27/09 21:00|Lake Mary|FL|Unknown|2 hours|My daughter and I saw at least 50 lighted objects in the sky within 2 hours and two of these objects were very low and slow moving.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68987.html|9|ndxe200902| My daughter and I saw at least 50 lighted objects in the sky within 2 hours and two of these objects were very low and slow moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of Feb. 27, 2009 my daughter and I were driving from the pet store on Lake Mary Blvd. to her place down Lake Emma Road in Lake Mary, FL., it was almost 9:00 pm. We noticed what looked like a very low flying aircraft, flying west to southwest, something about the way it behaved just seemed odd. It appeared to be triangular in shape, but it was difficult to really tell. It had 3 white lights. We stopped at her place to pick up a hat and then proceeded back up Lake Emma Road going north and started seeing a lot more lights that seemed rather low for planes and something about the way they were moving, while similar to a plane, was just a bit off.  The movements of the objects was smooth and steady, flying in one direction, but something just didn’t look right for a plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were on Greenway Blvd., almost to my house, we saw a larger, brighter lit object, with at least 4 bright white lights going very low and descending near the water treatment plant. This object seemed to vary in speed and almost appeared to be stationary for a short moment. We tried to follow it down the street to see where it went, but it quickly was blocked from our sight by trees. We did not hear any sounds from this object. We turned around at the library. On our way back could not locate the object we had seen several minutes earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When coming up the street next to ours moments later, we saw another large brightly lighted object flying very low, going west, but it to was quickly blocked from our sight by houses and trees. It appeared to be right over our neighborhood, within blocks from our house. We heard no sound from the object. The speed seemed too slow for a plane. This object looked like the object we had seen over the water treatment facility several minutes earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went to my house on Whittingham Place and stood out front and out in the back yard off and on for about an hour. Over the coarse of this time frame, we saw at least 30 more lighted objects. The lights on the objects varied. Some had one or two white lights with one red blinking light. Some had only white lights, at least 2 or 3 and were blinking very fast, all at once or all at different times. Some objects had bluish-white lights with red blinking lights. There were a variety of blinking patterns and number of lights on different objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out again around 10:30 pm, within 5 minutes I saw at least 12 more lighted objects, some were going southeast, some were going east, some were going west, some were going north. About half of them seemed to be flying abnormally  low. Several of them seemed to be much higher in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out again around 11:00 pm and in one minute, saw 7 lighted objects. There were 2 objects going to the southeast and I could hear what sounded like a helicopter or small plane engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I go out and look at the stars and moon often and have never seen this many objects  and ones that appeared to be so low or had the variety of lights and blinking patterns. I know we are about 5 to 8 miles from the Sanford Orlando Airport and are on the flight path for planes into and out of Orlando International, but I have never seen the planes flying this low in my immediate area or so many in such a short time, especially late in the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure some of the objects were in fact airplanes, but I do not believe all of them were. I thought this was so unusual, I reported it to the Lake Mary Police, they said they would note it. It was a clear night with good weather and visibility.<n>
2/27/09 21:00|Fredericksburg|VA|Unknown|5 minutes|Four or five lights appearing to emanate from the  clouds in the southwest sky|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68978.html|10|ndxe200902| Four or five lights appearing to emanate from the  clouds in the southwest sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 9:00 p.m. this evening I was taking my two dogs out for a walk.  The sky was cloudy and the wind was blowing at about 10 to 15 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and noticed four or five white lights in the clouds making wide circles (in the south west sky).  At first I thought it might be a search light (and it could have been) but I also noticed that the lights were moving slowly west.  They would make wide circles, then join in the middle, separate and continue making wide circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for about two or three minutes, then noticed that they changed from clockwise to counter clockwise orbits. They gradually stopped, one at a time.  From the time I began observing them to the time they fades was about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shift westward from the time I began observing them to the time they faded was about 20 degrees.  I am reporting this because I could not discern any beam of light coming from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like the lights were embedded in/emanating from the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called for my 16 year old daughter and she also witnessed the lights.<n>
2/27/09 19:10|Salt Lake City|UT|Triangle|3, 4 1/2, 5 seconds each|UFO's..... I seen over Salt Lake City, Utah, Feb. 27, 2009!!!|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68990.html|11|ndxe200902| UFO&#39;s..... I seen over Salt Lake City, Utah, Feb. 27, 2009!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO’s over Salt Lake City Feb. 27, 2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (1) The first one I sighted at about 7:10 pm.  It had  3 very dim lights on the bottom?  The lights were in a triangle pattern moving very fast, silent and NNW direction.  It appeared to be bending light around it?  It was like it was invisible, like you could see though it in a way, except for the lights on it.  The lights didn’t blink at all and were white in color with a very slight gray yellow tint, and was very dim and hard to see.  Very stealthily, no sound at all. The bending of the light around the lights reminded me of the movie “Predator”. Like when the creature was kind of visible yet non-visible. I’m in the flight path of the Jets that come in to land at the Salt Lake City International  Airport, it was about the same height of the jets that come in to land but slightly higher and just west of me. My thumb held at full arms distance would be able to cover this object. The sighting was less than 4 to 5 seconds. See the 1st sketch below  (2) I’m excited to see such a thing, so I stay outside and watch the sky intently. I’m on the cell phone telling one of my friends about this sighting, he lives near Ogden City, about a 45 minute drive on the freeway. While I was telling him about the 7:10 pm sighting, I see another dim set of lights come straight towards me. Except this is Huge! It was a single row of 3 lights (dim) on a 45 degree angle. It moves straight over me with no sound at all and again in a NNW direction. The sighting was about 3 ½ seconds, In 3 ½ seconds it was gone! It was as low as the lowest jets fly that are preparing to land at the SLC Int. Airport. It appeared to be having light dimly radiating from above and around  it with almost a shadow like area around it too, I could almost see a craft on one side where the row of lights was. Over towards the right was where most of the light emanated from above the thing. It was like one side of a V of lights that were visible.  This thing also seemed to be bending light making it was very hard to see. If I held my arm fully extended with the palm flat against it still would not fully be able to cover this object. Like I said earlier it was huge! The time was about 8:30 pm. I had binoculars around my neck but was so dumb founded at this object I didn’t even think of the binoculars or of the camera in my pocket, plus it was so fast! See the 2nd sketch below  (3) I’m still outside watching the sky’s (8:45pm). My neighbor comes home and see’s me outside with a coat, hat, gloves and binoculars. With a puzzled look come over and asked me what I’m doing. I tell her and she starts asking me where I seen the object etc. So I’m telling her and  all of a sudden I see another object barely visible in a sense and very high traveling in a NNW direction. I immediately remember my binoculars this time and quickly find this object in my 10x50 power binoculars. It was like a flying wing with about 9 round lights forming a slight V formation. It was fast and silent. The sighting was about 4 seconds long. Her eyes were better than mine. I asked what she saw and she also saw a triangle pattern of lights. I can’t say that I could see much more than the lights. But it did appear to be dark between the area of the lights in the form of a wing type V pattern. We also noticed it had no sound what so ever. See the 3rd sketch below  (4) It’s cold out and I’m still out watching the sky, 3 in one night! What’s going on! Anyway it’s about 11:00 pm now, I’m in my back yard now, earlier I was in the driveway. I’m looking to the south. All of a sudden I see a dimly visible row of lights in a slight V pattern but yet almost straight across. It’s coming fast and low about the same height of the jets that come in to land at the airport. I quickly view this with my  binoculars. I’m shocked! It’s not one thing, it’s a group of white triangle’s. They were moving in a, a moving formation 15 to 17 of them in triangle formations in each triangle pattern the lead one would drop back to the rear and then move back to the front again, this was happening in unison along this formation line, from one side to the other(One triangle of formation with one in between the next triangle formation with one on each side of the triangle formation. They changed pattern about 4 times). It was very strange and puzzling. It also reminded me of birds in flight but different too. The sighting was no more than 4 ½ seconds. I would guess each craft was a little bigger than a small airplane. They had no lights on them but had a white glow to them with a Ripley effect around them. They were not bright at all, dim yet very solid looking triangles. They were a perfect triangle shape with a slight V notched out the back edge of them. They were silent and fast moving in a NNW direction. They went right over me. I stared at them intently with my binoculars. The width of the formation was wider than the palm of my hand flatly held out at arm’s length. Please see the 4th sketch below. I stayed outside until about 1:15 am, I didn’t see anything else peculiar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this in one night! I will never forget this night!   I tried to attach my sketches but it didn&#39;t let me here, sorry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was underneath some light fair weather cumulus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it go southbound until it was out of sight - it did not accelerate or change altitude, estimated speed 250-350 knots based on the speed of the jet that the fleet described below was following.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About two minutes later on the same heading there was a fleet of identical objects headed south, it was not packed into one tight formation it was spread out so there were groups of two or three craft in formation.  The lead object in the fleet was tailing an airline jet on the same heading by about one mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects made no sound and emitted no light however I did notice a &#39;fuzzy&#39; aura around them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on the size of the aircraft and the fair weather clouds, I would estimate that the objects were about 3000 feet altitude and approximately 30  to 50 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried counting the craft but lost count at around 8.   I was trying to focus on viewing one group, when another group would fly into my field of vision, confusing my counting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed cross-traffic, an airline jet crossed overhead higher than the cloud and higher than the fleet at about the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday was one day when I really wish I had my camera, I could have taken really good pictures, probably could have taken closeups with my zoom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were all headed directly south towards the border.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a date of the sighting.

My balcony is on the second floor with a southwest-facing view. This was early morning so the sky was very dark and the conditions were calm and clear. As I looked to my far right I saw three lights in the sky. One white light was on the left and to the right were two white lights fairly close together. The two lights on the right were both strobing in regular frequency, but never disappearing between strobes. The three lights maintained the same distance between each other giving the impression that they were all connected. There are normally many aircraft in the sky and my location is within the southeast approach to Baltimore-Washington International Airport. I can also see planes on approach to Andrews Air Force Base to my southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My immediate reaction was that this was a C-17 Globemaster (which I have seen on approach to Andrews from my office outside the Beltway) banking very slowly away from me on approach to Andrews. As I continued to watch the lights however, they appeared to be stationary and at a slight angle – the left light maybe 15 degrees lower than the two right lights. I am familiar enough with aircraft to know that this is not a conventional landing light configuration for fixed-wing aircraft and deduced that a fixed-wing aircraft would also not bank indefinitely. There were no red or green navigation lights also making me suspicious that this was not a fixed-wing aircraft. With the distance between the left and right-side lights at approx. 150-200 feet, I deduced that this was also too large to be a helicopter. I estimate the horizontal distance of the lights from my position at about 2-3 miles at an altitude of about 1,000 feet. The configuration and position of the lights never changed; the two lights on the right continued to strobe in regular frequency. I continued to watch the lights for 20 minutes – never changing formation. I hopped in the shower and got ready for work. I was looking forward to daylight so that I might get a better view of any mass associated with the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After getting ready for work approximately 40 minutes later (60 minutes total), I returned to the balcony to find the lights exactly as they had been – same three lights, same angle, same formation, and same strobing. At this point it was now 0605. I left the house and drove across Route 301 to the gas station to fill up. The lights were still in the sky and daybreak was setting in. I proceeded in my car heading westbound on Route 50. As I looked out the driver’s-side window, I noticed that the lights were in front of me on my left-hand side (southwest). At this point daylight was setting in and I could make out grey mass associated with the lights, however, driving in 80 mph rush hour traffic meant that I had to pay attention to the road and I lost visual. While I thought this might have been a large blimp such as the Skyship 600, this was inconsistent with the grey mass which appeared more cigar-shaped from my cursory observation. When I arrived at work, close to Route 50 and the Beltway, I looked in the general direction from my office and was unable to see the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After discussing the incident with a couple of co-workers I conducted an online search for “lights over Washington DC” thinking perhaps others might have reported witnessing the same event. I came across the incident report on ufocasebook.com from October 26, 2005. This report shared similarities with my experience in terms of number of lights and formation. They were able to get close enough to see a Blackhawk helo along with two lights and witnessed vertical and horizontal movement. I did not witness any movement at all and while I did see grey mass associated with the lights, I was unable to make any concise determination as to shape while driving down the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived home that evening, I plotted the trajectory from my balcony in the direction of the lights (which obviously were no longer there) based on the corner of a Kohl’s department store across the street. The trajectory caught me off guard seeing as it crossed from the southeast side to the northeast side of Route 50 – I thought it would have been southwest. While driving down Route 50 on my way to work I witnessed the lights on my left (southwest of my position). I also did a little local research to see if any strange events were reported in the media. Well, something did happen the previous night (Feb 26) at 2200 hrs. An 81 car train carrying coal had derailed in a residential area of Bowie. In the derailment, 13 cars had skipped the tracks and tipped over including the locomotive. The incident is almost consistent with my trajectory of where the lights had been. However, the derailment occurred on the NORTH side of Highway 50, while I witnessed the lights on the south side of Highway 50. If this was a series of helicopters, how were they able to stay stationary in perfect formation for over an hour? Why would they be so high in the sky if they were monitoring an accident? And why would they hover over a residential area for that long that early in the morning? It just doesn’t add up for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what the anomalous lights were. If there is some type of aircraft that does have this lighting configuration I would really like to know. So far, I have no answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time and consideration.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

2/26/09 22:30|Rhome|TX|Unknown|1-2 min|Two red circular orbs low in night sky.|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69497.html|19|ndxe200902| Two red circular orbs low in night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SIGHTING   It was February 26, 2009 sometime around 10:30 - 11:00 P.M. while returning home from Thursday night’s class, traveling westbound on hwy 114 approaching the outskirts of Rhome, Texas, that I became aware of two red objects low on the horizon just slightly to the right of the roadway ahead of me.  These two red orbs were pulsing on and off at a rate of about 20 -30 times a minute.  The on to off timing was uniformly equal and pulsing in unison.  The size of the red orbs were slightly smaller than your thumbnail held at arms’ length and the shape was perfectly circular with a very defined edge, no fuzziness or light diffusion.  The distance between the two orbs was approximately the width of your fist at arms’ length.  There was some relative motion between the two objects:  the one on the left appeared steady on its course while the one on the right changed its altitude dipping down and then back to its level position.  As I continued driving due west the objects appeared to be drifting to the left or southward and now the roadway was turning slightly northward to a west-north-west heading and the view of the objects were being obstructed by trees.  I thought I would pull over and stop to watch these red orbs and continued forward to have a clearer view now appearing through my side window.  The clear view was now coming up, but before I pulled off to the shoulder there appeared what I would describe as a burst from between and above the plane of the two orbs not unlike a jet going supersonic with its wing producing a shock wave.  I had traveled about a mile in this episode so it was visible to me for about one minute.  I continued onward where the road crosses over the railroad tracks to view southward the moonless night sky but could see no lights or movement there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In review of this event I could not make any determination of the distance, speed, or direction involved or if any sound was made as my car windows were closed.  Looking at a map of the area shows that when I first sighted the object it could have been over Rhome, Aurora or Boyd, or beyond by 100’s of miles, or it could have been just beyond the tree line right over hwy 287 just a mile in front of me.  At the time, I thought the direction of travel was southward, but who’s to say that I was actually seeing it departing straight away from me (west) on just a slight southward track.  If that were true perhaps those who reside in Newark, Azle, Reno, or Springtown may have seen this occurrence.  I was a passive observer of this non-threatening event and I know of no other witnesses as traffic was very, very light and the only other car well ahead did not stop.<n>

The lights appeared one after another and formed a triangle shape then the fourth into a diamond shape and moved upward very fast and then formed into a straight line and separated in different directions.  The lights were yellowish orange like in color and very bright.   All this took place in about one and a half minutes. Shortly after there were what appeared to be two jets at a very high altitude following the lights.  The reason I thought they were jets is because there were blinking lights and the color of the lights were white.  This is not the first time and we are not the only ones who have seen the lights.  Other people have told me the same story at work when they saw the light.  Every time we see this it’s almost the same thing in event that happens.<n>

Her home is located in the central Denver area in the 80204 zip code.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were preparing to enter her home, she mentioned that the stronger than normal winds that the Denver metro area experienced had cleared the pollution and made the stars appear brighter.   As she mentioned the clearer night sky, we looked up, initially to the south.   As we looked up, a brighter light caught our attention approaching from the southeast moving towards the northwest.   The light initially appeared to be a shooting star, but was not as vibrant as a star and not moving as rapid as a shooting star either.   As the light moved over our heads heading towards the northwest, it appeared to be not just one light, but a group of about six lights in the shape of the letter V, or very similar to birds flying in a group.  The shape of the V formation was not perfectly symmetrical like you would see from lights on the tips of a commercial airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took approximately 20 seconds for the lights to appear and to move out of sight towards the northwest.   The lights were not as bright as the lights that are on a commercial airplane.  In addition, there was absolutely no sound.   If these lights were coming from a jet or a commercial airplane, it would have to make sound moving at that speed which it did not.  Also, the lights were moving below the clouds in the sky as the clouds did not impede the lights as they moved across the sky.  The lights continued to move towards the northwest until they were no longer visible leaving no sound.<n>

Just as a joke i mentioned to my fellow passengers that there was a spaceship on fire in the sky.  They all dismissed what i had to say and looked up to see if they could see what i had just spotted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point they turned to me and said they agreed with what i had seen and to slow down.  I took a second look because i had only joked about it, I pulled over to the side of the road as to not cause a road traffic accident, and on studying it further it appeared to me that it was a very strange shape and i started to panic that it was an aircraft on fire. If i hadn&#39;t watched it for a while i could have dismissed it as a hot air balloon.  But, what would an air balloon be doing in the skys at that time of night. Then i had the strangest thought that it may have been a handglider, or some type of air travel, perhaps motorised, on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time traffic was building up and the object had seemed to float above us.  It was quite big.  And also very low.  I grabbed for my phone to try and record this occurrence and jumped out of the car to get a better view.  I couldn&#39;t set my phone to night mode to make it more visible quick enough and in an instant it had shot upwards into the sky and disappeared into nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On analyzing what i had seen for many days and complete disection of my state of mind i have come to the conclusion that this is factual.  May not necessarily be another lifeform, but definately unexplainable.  Had i been on my own i probably would have dismissed it and never mentioned it but it was magical.  All three of us saw and eperienced it together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was too bright and low to be a star and there was many lights grouped together I thought that was weird.  Then I had noticed it had started to rise like it was almost hovering over my neighbor’s house.  I had noted to my mom there was something like a plane in the sky she didn’t seem to care so I checked it out myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I ran to the window and watched it move slowly over the trees until I couldn’t see it any more.  At this point I ran outside to my porch to get a better look.  It flew lower than an average plane and was quite quiet.  It had the high drone like that of a jet, but again it wasn’t loud my mom noted that she couldn’t hear it while she was inside.  I have helicopters that come over my house that transport people from hospital to hospital and they fly pretty low but not that low and are considerably noisy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it come over my house I noted that its bottom was in the shape of a diamond, and there were four white lights, one in each corner.  The light at the tail end was flashing a white while there was two smaller lights on either side.  Once it was more in front of me it looked liked the top of it was like a balloon, it was like the jiffy pop popcorn the kind that you put on the stove and watch it puff up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took around two minutes to pass from my neighbor’s house till it was out of my side.  It moved to the North West, West coming from the North East.<n>

We noticed five beams aproximately two feet wide protuding out aproximately three feet from tho top to the bottom.  The main body color was off white. The beams or legs had some red, grey and light blue with no other colors noticed.  We were not able to see the bottom of this craft as the bottom was hidden from view by the levi.

2/25/09 21:45|Ellensburg|WA|Circle|5 seconds|A large object at night, having nothing but reflective light, travelling at great speed.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69175.html|32|ndxe200902| A large object at night, having nothing but reflective light, travelling at great speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Wednesday night February 25th, 2009, at approximately 9:45 pm, I was going to my garage via my patio/deck and looked up to the skies, as I often do.  From that location I can see most all of the southern half of the sky (horizon to horizon), but only about 20 percent of the northern half and no horizon.  Unfortunately there is a utility company office and repair facility south of my home that has large floodlights, that are on all night and kind of fades out the horizon area directly south, but directly up and most of the southern sky is quite clear.  I am in the habit of scanning the skies at night for about 30 seconds, most every night, and sometimes more than once.  This night I did scan the southern sky and it was clear and all stars were very visible.  I looked to 12 o’clock straight above me and I saw what I would have to describe as one of those clusters of faint stars that you see in the sky on a real clear night that almost appears to be a circle of foggy light.  But, what I was seeing, was instead, an object moving very fast.  No light was emitting from the object, but most of the object was discernable by what appeared to be reflective light, but not sharp or bright.  It was a very dull, again as if it was one of those star clusters, but you could see that it was a hard object.  This object was moving extremely fast from straight above me towards the SSW horizon.  I believe that it was a very large object, very far above me.  It’s shape exactly was very hard to determine as the edges of the object were blurry and it’s apparently very fast speed.  It could have been round or triangular and appeared to be fairly flat.  If I had to guess, I would say that it was 10,000 feet or more above me, and with that size of an object, it would have to be traveling at several thousand miles per hour.  Within 4 or 5 seconds, it vanished as if it faded away.  The object made no sound.  I looked for and found a star cluster and it did have a similar size and appearance, except the object I saw, had a surface! look to it, especially in the center.  I stayed out there in the cold for about 5 minutes in the hope if it retuning, but it did not.  I am absolutely certain of what I saw and that it was as I have described to you.<n>

I pulled into the drive way and stopped about halfway down, opened the window, and turned down the radio to see if I could hear anything.  I could not hear any sounds other than the car engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I parked the car and we went inside. I pulled out my Binoculars, went to the back porch and proceeded to watch the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no visible flashing lights on the object.  It was a very bright whitish/orange and traveling at a steady speed in a North/Northwesterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed aircraft pass over my house and in the distance, all with the telltale flashing lights. This object was considerably brighter than any light on an aircraft.  Too contrast, I witnessed an airplane pass under the object, in relationship to the horizon, and could easily see the flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and brought out our telescope to get a closer look at the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not make out any visible edges, only light. The object seemed to pulse but never left it&#39;s course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My youngest daughter and I watched it until it vanished over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a clarification: We live on one of the flight paths used by Dover AFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have seen combat helicopters, regular helicopters, Chinooks, A-10s, F-16s, and C130s pass over. Growing up, I lived near Andrews AFB, and we have a small airfield on the outside of town (about 4 miles from me) and Easton airport to the south, So I have a lot of experience with identifying aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw on Wednesday night wasn&#39;t anything I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I had had the foresight to bring out a camera, but I wanted to identify the object first. (Next time I&#39;ll get the camera also)<n>

I guess about 2 months ago is reasonably close. I&#39;ve talked to several people about what I saw and was litterly laughed at each time. And reasonably so, I&#39;ve stopped discussing it with anyone at all. That is until finding this section on your website. So here goes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were late getting home one nite so I suggested we put a couple of steaks on the grill and have a quick and simple dinner and hop into bed, readying for another days ordeal. I had just fired up the grill and was still holding and folding the grill cover in my hands. I was staring out into the night sky looking at the star formations as I usually do when out at night. I suddenly noticed a rather strange light going across the sky in a West to East direction rather high in the sky. At first I thought it was merely a commercial plane at that altitude but soon realized I saw no usual vapor trail nor jet exhaust sound. But the thing that caught my attention foremost was the fact that I saw no flashing navigational lights. I thought that was especially odd. I knew it was proceeding across the sky because I could see the stationary night stars behind it. I continued to gaze at the moving light as it maintained what appeared to be a constant speed when suddenly it starting becoming brighter in appearance. As I continued looking at it, it actually took on a more distinguishing look about itself. The light started turning a brilliant beautiful color of blue, a shade of blue I&#39;d never seen before. Almost like an electric arc from a plug wire. Ok, here&#39;s the crazy part, as I watched it, it developed a wide looking ring around the outside diameter of itself. This ring was a much brighter shade of blue than the inner section appeared to be. It litterly gave the appearance of what Saturn with it&#39;s rings looked like, except it was oval shaped in it&#39;s center. The two individual and separate colors illuminated its shape completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw, and this is what I saw. I continued to stare at it, half thinking that if I dropped my gaze it would disappear from me or I&#39;d loose a visual on it. I decided to call my wife to come and take a look, not taking my gaze off it, so I called her several times but she didn&#39;t hear me in time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I did the most stupid thing of all, I decided to lay the grill cover down and walk out in the yard to get a better viewing of this object. Laying down that cover took no more than 1 second for me at the most but when I gazed back up in the sky where it last was, there was nothing to see. I mean nothing at all. Not a trace of it could be seen! From initial first sighting until it vanished was perhaps 8 seconds. But I know what I saw. My lasting regret  even till now was taking my eyes off it and missing how it managed to disappear from my line of sight. It&#39;s completely impossible for me to have misplaced it in the night sky when there were no other aircraft in the sky at that time. And how did NORAD not pick it up either, as I can see the military installation from my front yard! So call me crazy if you will but what I&#39;ve written here is the absolute and complete truth as I would derive no personal satisfaction in fabricating such a wild story just to make myself look crazy in the end. I believe with all my heart what I saw that stary night was actually a craft not from our planet but rather from some place outside our Solar System and will continue to believe so until the day I die. I thank you for reading my story and hope that you will believe me. Again, Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I called my freind out to see the lights.  He agreed with me, that it was not helicopters, planes, baloons, stars or anything we could identify.  His son also witnessed the event. My freind insists that the lights were conected.  I am not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If they were connected, it was a very big object.  It was nothing we had ever seen before.

Quickly, they stepped onto the deck and both observed the object for about a minute, sharing a pair of Bushnell 7x35 binoculars for a closer look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object, about 35 degrees above the horizon, appearing bigger than a star or planet but smaller than the moon, was moving quickly and soundlessly on a level path from south to north, eventually disappearing behind a cloud.  The object was orange in color, glowing softly in the setting sun, and was shaped like a slightly elongated ball or globe, although rounder on the top and flatter on the bottom.  No empennage or other features were noted.  There was some kind of secondary motion seen, as if the object might have been pulsating or rotating.<n>

This object was cylinder in shape and moving quickly across the shy, right over my house.  I didn’t see any lights, nor did I see any wings on this aircraft.  The color seemed to be metallic grey, without windows.

It moved rather quickly and stopped suddenly and after about 8-10 seconds started moving again until it dissapeared out of sight behind trees. the object was in the shape of a diamond with one light clearly a red colour and the other 3 were white flashing yellow in a rotational cycle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the first 1-3 seconds of the digital video clip show the object before i zoomed in to get a closer look. the shakiness of clip was when the object was moving. it was hard to capture until it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the object made no distinct sound. as showed in the video, the only noise present is the wind from being outdoors.<n>

When I was facing North, I saw a triangular shaped object.  Was matching color of the nights sky (almost could not see) traveling south from the north.  If I had not been looking at the area I probably would not have noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am used to looking at night sky and watching air traffic in the area (as there is an airport within five miles)and Wright Patt AFB is about 10 miles away.  I could see the outline of the object as it glided with no engine sound or any lights.  I estimate it was at about 1000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as it went South past my position and I could see it triangular shape and four circular lights on rear of vehicle as it traveled Southward.  The lights were very soft colored orange.  As I tried to comprehend the craft it disappeared into the night sky.  Since it was dark colored it just disapeared into night sky like a brown stone dropped into mudddy water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 10 seconds a commercial plane began to decend into landing approach.  Was totally diffrent.  Had blinking lights, I could see the airplane, I could hear the engines.  The triangle glided down from higher altitude, had no sound, and was almost invisible (shadowlike) and moved smooth and fast across sky.  It looked thick and angular unlike Stealth Bomber, ect.   Was very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I was not looking directly at where it appeared I would have never even noticed it.  I keep telling myself it was military since AFB so close.  But it flew through commercial airspace with no lights and flew with a smoothness I have never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

She pointed out something in the sky that I initially thought was a low flying plane, but soon we both realized that it was not moving, but staying in the same exact spot.  It looked extremely low, and had 3 lights that did not blink.  It was night out, so we could only make out a basic shape, which look triangular, with a dip in the side. I stopped and turned a corner to my right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend saw the shape accelerate and move out of sight, while I turned.  As soon as I slowed down I looked and saw nothing there anymore, whatever was there had left.<n>

Approxmate height in the atmospher is around the level a long distance commerical flight would fly. I thought at the beginning it was a flock of birds, but they were hard to make out and appeared to be 1/3 of the size of a commerical plane flying by seconds after they disappeared. 10-12 sphere flew in a circle 8 pattern in two separate locatioins in the air and flew at a rather high speed considering the height in the air. They flew in two separate locations for approx. 10 minutes. They disappeared as soon as two commerical airlines flew into view from the south and east. It truly an amazing sight to see with our two 2 year olds and 5 year old as we viewed the the sky from the front yard of our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We pulled up at a small business plaza and i drop him off at the front of the place.  I continued on to park and found a space a few feet fron the cell phone payment store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i was waiting for him i was looking around and looked up to my left and saw a white object flying in the sky, at frist i tought it was small business jet plane, but when i looked at the object i realized it did not have a tail or jet engines, i statrted my car and pulled out of my space to a spot where i could see the object better, and saw it was white with a strange glow and had a small set of wings 3/4 of the way to what looked like the end of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really startle me then is that it was flying real straight and then all of a sudden it sped up fast and vanished. It was a clear day with blue sky, and i know what a plane looks like, because, in this area i was located at you can see the planes after they take off or when the are begining to decend, because the airport is over 12 miles away. What caught my eye was the fact that this object was flying real low and fast and had no engines and no tail and made no sound, I was hopeing my brother would come out quicker to see what was happening, but by the time he did it was gone. I know some people are going to say it was a military drone or something like that, but i was in the military for almost 14 years and i know what airforce drones all look like. So what i saw was definetly a UFO,  I include some drawings I made of what i saw, let me tell you it realy freak me out, and at first not even my brother belived me, but when he saw i was serious he began to wonder if what i saw was real.<n>

As I observed it, trying to see its flap position as I always do, I noticed a white object that at first I thought had fallen off the plane. It slid to the rear of the plane, and then began to rise in altitude. I kept my eye on it to figure out if it was a weather balloon.  The object then began to pass directly overhead, at such an angle that I could still view it out of the side window (slightly to the east of perpendicular). I then spotted 5 more small circular shapes with a weird shadowy look, in + configuration, and one dead center.  The 6th object was then out of formation and slightly to the north of the formation. When all the objects were directly overhead, they were hazy, and not quite &#34;white&#34;.<n>

Our house faces North an at a distance on the horizon, over the tree line I could see a very, very large lighted area.  I kept watching it wondering what it could possibly be.  It was way too large for an airplane or star.  I went to 3 different windows and could plainly see the light.  It looked as if the light was lighting an area as big as a footbal field or bigger.  As I watched, this thing moved slowly from left to right or from West to East and then stopped.  I walked into the kitchen and came back and it was gone. It would take a very large craft to light an area as large as I am talking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I noticed a VERY bright light in the sky.  This UFO incident appeared over towards the pacific ocean off the coast of Oxnard/Ventura county (my position). It had the appearence of a shooting star, or small meteor entering the atmosphere.  It was like a fireball and it glowed a bright red/orange color, so I knew something was entering the atmosphere.  I have seen small meteors enter the earth&#39;s atmosphere and burn for a brief second.  Well this UFO had been burning for about 30 seconds with a LARGE tail.  After I noticed it, it had emitted an object.  The object was glowing White, and VERY bright and not flickering.  The best way to describe this object would be a flare burning as bright as magnesium. *it was a great distance away so the material must have been rather large because it was burning so brightly i could see it and could not have been a hand flare because those are too small.*  The UFO emitted 3 of these objects.  As soon as the object emitted this bright white light, it stayed lit for 3 seconds, then it died out. As soon as the first object died out a 2nd one came and also for 3 seconds. As soon as that died a 3rd was emitted, and again lasted 3 seconds and disappeared.  When the 3rd object disappeared the UFO appeared to have slowed down its entry into the atmosphere and the glowing red/orange color dissapated away as it slowed down.  I noticed it left a smoke trail when emitting the bright white objects.  It was an awkward shape, large enough that I could see its shape and draw it out.  The UFO glowed a magnificent Gold color.  Then it was just hovering in the sky, and then slowly *from my position* started moving left and away from me *south west direction*.  It still glowed a gold color, and did NOT have any lights flashing on it, nor have ANY sound.  Something traveling that fast into the earths atmosphere should have set off a sonic boom. I waited and heard nothing.  It was traveling away fr! om me, h overing rather gently.  It was moving slowly, then started picking up speed and going higher &#34;UP&#34; INTO the atmosphere.  The gold color dimmed as it picked up speed, then got brighter 2 seconds later.  The gold UFO was flying off into the sky then the bright gold light was growing fainter, but I could still see it, then all of a sudden it VANISHED. BLACK. GONE.  I was stunned and amazed that I witnessed this event and called my girlfriend halfway into this.  I looked back where I had originally seen it and it left a trail of smoke and debree in the sky.  I kept walking my dog and the smoke still remained.  It had a spiral look to it and next to it another small smoke plume.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 19 years old male college student, I am not crazy, I have my head on my shoulders. I have great eye sight and do not wear glasses.   I witnessed this event and I remember seeing this website on TV so I decided to report the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was NOT a plane, nor a meteor.  This was something significant.  It came RUSHING down into the atmosphere, then emitted objects, hovered away and disappeared going back up into the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very bright and the color was a reddish, brown solid color.  I didn&#39;t know what to make of it.  So I shined my powerful mag lite at the orb, when all of a sudden it released a cloud of white smoke.  There was no moon out, but the cloud was very bright, after two minutes it went out of the atmosphere, and then it popped back in again, and started to show more smoke like cloud.  The clouds were small and lingered for about ten minutes after it vanished.  It almost reminded my of a comet entering our atmosphere, but it popped in and out twice, I grabbed its attention after the second pop in.  Cause my flash light was on it and it traveled very slowly then it left. no strobing light and it was far enough to remind me of a star, that left a cloud in the ozone.I was the only one who saw it and I was to nervous to take a picture.<n>

You could barely make out a very faint line in a off-glow red. An even fainter off-glow red inside the formed triangle. The size was too huge to explain. It seemed far off in the distance but still  large enough to be seen clearly, but to still realize that it was humungous. Maybe hundreds of feet between each light. Maybe 20 or more miles away. It was about thirty degrees above the horizon. It looked alot like flairs but there was no smoke. They were not rising or falling. This all took place over the course of 10 minutes or so. So there was plenty of time for an elevation change. Then it sort of rotated and pitched forward ever so slowly. The rotation was the lower left light seemed to move forward or maybe the right moved backward. As it levelled out it faded from view. Sort of just dimmed out. It didn&#39;t race away and take sharp turns or anything weird like that. I say weird, because what we saw seemed weird just a short while ago. It never came over our part of the county. # witnesses.Two middle thirty aged adults. M/F, some college, both work in the medical field. One helps SNF Nurses coordinate patient placement after hospital stay. The other works in the ER of a different hospital. The other witness, my neighbor, is a mid sixtyish, retired. His wife is a Hospice nurse and he did not want to wake her once it left. Both of tried to get a picture on our cell phones. I haven&#39;t talked yet to my neighbor to view his. Mine did not seem to pick it up. I&#39;m an amateur with the five hundred billion app&#39;s that phones have. Anyway what we saw was valid.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Lights formed an equilateral triangle and then shifted sideways<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in La Mesa, CA ( East county suburb of  San Diego) I awoke at 1:20 am last night (2-24-09) after hearing a thump.  When I looked out the window to the east, I saw three bright red lights in the sky.  They appeared to be stationary  They created an equilateral triangle.  I awakened my husband. As we watched the lights; they shifted sideways, losing the equilateral shape. He went to awaken our son. As the three of us continued watching the three lights continued to shift.  Then they became dimmer. Two disappeared with the third disappearing a few seconds later.  About 8 minutes lapsed from the time I first saw the lights until they disappeared..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw a similar single bright red light in the same eastern sky on New Year’s Eve (1/31/08).  My Mom and Neighbor also saw this.  This light appeared closer than last nights lights. At first we thought it was a flare, however it never dropped. It was a bit more North (left) in the sky as it hovered.  After a few minutes, it shifted to the right (south) after several minutes it shifted even more to the right.  We never saw it move.  The next thing we knew it had disappeared.  I would say that about 12-15 minutes lapsed from the first time we saw it until it disappeared.   My 16 year old son was at a home in Fletcher Hills, a part of El Cajon (the town just north of La Mesa).  He and his friends also saw the same light.  He said that it appeared to the south of his location.<n>

I used a telescope to look and found it has a shpae of arc, the entire body is very brigth. It definetly is not a plane (moving too slow) and not a star or planet (moving too fast). Now is 8:20 pm, the brigth object is still over the sky, but about 15 degree above the horizon.

It came to a sudden stop just over I-95 near Fiske blvd. It hovered for a second, then proceeded to do a circular motion at a high rate of speed. At this time you could barely make out the silver as it was moving so fast. This movement created a cloud/smoke-like ring where the object was moving.  The center was clear and you could see the sky. The object abruptly stopped in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was then a flash, like that of a camera, and then the object shot straight up in the sky.  The object moved so fast that it was not visible within seconds. All that was left was the cloud/smoke-like formation in the sky. This all happened so fast that by the time I had my camera phone ready all that I caught was the formation that was left.  This happened in daylight with many people around.  I have never put the photos out before. I ! never really knew what to do with my information, until I saw a recent episode of the Cape Canaveral/Florida area that your show did.<n>

The moved in and out of the sky then they started to break off from a bigger light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 02-23-2009 a friend and I witness some strange lights in the sky.  We were leaving Brandon, MS and on our way back to school in Starkville, MS.  The drive is around 110 miles.  We were about 15 miles outside of Brandon when I started to see the light.  In my front windshield while I was driving, I started to see two long white objects dot in and out the sky. It was like they were moving in and out the sky or in between the clouds.  During this time my friend girl did not notice them because she was busy on the phone. After about 10 to 15 min. the disappeared from the front windshield. I didn’t want to say anything to my friend about them because I did not want her to think I was crazy. As soon as she got off the phone she asked me did I see the 4 lights going in and back and forth. They had move to the passenger side of the car. When she said that I started to freak out. I told her I seen the earlier in the front windshield but it was only 2. She started to hold the steering wheel for me while I look behind me. The were like 4 white bluish light that were oval shape. They looked an little different in shape when they were in my front windshield. The looked like 2 white bluish lights that were long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it might have been a light tower somewhere near by but I knew it wasn’t because I come back and forth on this road at night ever weekend. The lights trailed us for about 60min or 60 miles outside of Brandon. At one point and time, it looked like we were passing them but the caught back up with us in about 5 min. I believe we would have been able to see them a little better if it wasn’t cloudy. I knew it wasn’t a light house because as soon as we come in Starkville there is a tower that shines a light that goes around. It was so cloudy that when we made it to Starkville we couldn’t really see the beam the light house was putting out. These light were going in and out of each other. It seemed like their was a light in  the center that the other lights attach from. I believe in UFO’s but I couldn’t believe I seen something like this in real life. My friend girl didn’t even believe in UFO’s but this night made her a believer. I think it was either some government official stuff or it was the real thing. I’m now scared to leave Brandon at night to go back to school. I think I will be leaving during the day time hours now!!!<n>

They were in line but slightly offset from one another.These were larger and brighter than the planet Venus has been in the early evening sky the last few weeks There was no movment but I was stareing at them because I had never seen them before, I allways look at the early morning sky. While watching them they both faded and dissapered at the same time, fairly quickly, but all the surrounding stars remained. pretty strange<n>

I thought maybe it was a blimp, angled away from me, I do see blimps every now and then over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it banked (heading west) very slowly. I remember thinking I should go get my camera, but I felt it was more important I absorb the encounter accuratly.  It went out of sight and I went to the west window of my house to see it slowly fly west, thats when I truely saw how big this was.  But here is the good part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unless it did som trick maneuvers its present direction would take it over the 10-30 interchange.<n>

I know a thing or two about astronomy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the date and time listed above, myself and a fellow honors student were stargazing atop the largest building on campus.  We were both lying on our backs.  All directional references and measurements should be interpreted with this in mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the approximate time listed above, we both simultaneously noted a point of light around 4 times the size of any star in the sky.  This point of light travelled from right to left (I can obtain compass direction if needed) from appx. 60 degrees above the horizon on the right across the sky to around 30 deg above the horizon on the left.  This point of light appeared to travel at satellite speed for a duration of 3-4 seconds, covering only a few degrees of night sky.  In &lt;0.75 seconds, the object sped up, covering the remaining amount of sky in 2-3 seconds, until it passed out of our sight.  We did not observe a light trail behind the object, and needless to say, it was too far away for us to discern any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For reference, I am an International Relations major, and my friend is a Physics major with an Astronomy minor.  We are both 19 years of age, and neither of us have ever used illicit substances.  I have not spoken with this friend regarding this matter since this occurrence.<n>

It was like a falling fire star. Not very bright, but enough to see from my bed- through the thin curtains. It kinda faded as it was coming closer and made a small noise as it seemed to (I think) hit the space between my window and the ground. I tried to stay up as long as I could but I fell asleep somehow. I had a strange dream, well maybe it was more like a vision of being abducted- I remember it very vaguely.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It includes a lot of details that you might find interesting or useful, so I will include everything instead of typing a new report. I just heard that there was a report on San Diego Local News within the last few 3 days of people reporting the same sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Monday Febuary 23rd 2009  I swear to you on my life Yas&#39;...this is all true....This is how it happened....It was about 1:10 am...I went out onto the back deck to call in my cat. She didn&#39;t appear. I sat down in my usual spot and lit a cigarette to wait for her. As I looked back up I saw three little red lights way off in the distance. Jets I thought. We live right in the middle of the flight path for San Diego Airport, so I watch the incoming jets lined up in the distance 20 or 30 miles away when it&#39;s clear. Which it was this night. No clouds. But I quickly noticed that there was something different about these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They weren&#39;t staggered like planes lining up for their landing approach which I I&#39;ve seen thousands of times in my life and watched out here for the last month and 1/2 everynight. Next I&#39;m like, but the Airport is closed. It&#39;s been closed for at least an hour. No incoming or outgoing flights until 6:00 am. So I&#39;m thinking smaller private planes..? Military Jets.? Why are the lights not flashing like ALL jets and planes do..with red lights on the right wing and green on the left. These are just red. Constant ..No flash at all. And they are coming closer, but they are still all together like in a pattern. They were getting brighter and bigger, but they were moving much slower than any planes..Taking way longer to get to where they should be in the landing path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Helicopters..?  They are getting closer and it&#39;s starting to hit me that I may be seeing something very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now I&#39;m standing up going saying out loud to myself...What the hell are those ? And they just kept coming still way off maybe 10 miles or more..But defenitely coming straight towards me. It was getting weirder by the second as they kept approaching.Then I slipped in the door and grabbed the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is it a blimp..? Some kind of balloon. It was defenitely not an aircraft, helicopter or anything like that. It was coming right up over the top of the mountain ridge on the other side of the valley. And it was then I really started to kinda freak out..not really, but more like excited...what was it.... I came back out on the deck and I put the binoculars up to my eyes and focused. What I saw made my jaw drop. It was Huge..I mean the size of a Football field.One more second and that was it..Everything suddenly clicked in my brain... I had logically ruled out every possible explanation. It was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind had no doubt at that point. I was seeing a &#34;real&#34; UFO. I was wittnessing what they call a &#34;sighting&#34;. I knew I had never seen anything like this in my life and then I realised it was one soild object. A triangle. It was perfectly visible now and moving slow...floating no sound..It just hit me..NO Sound at all.  Oh my God. I was in shock. Through the binoculars it was very clear and I could now see the defenite shape of a triangle and just then it started to turn slightly and I could see the red lights..one on the nose and two on the rear tips. A giant silent floating triangle. I couldn&#39;t beleive what I was seeing...but yet I really did..I knew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept staring in amazement..And the it rotated even more and swung around completly where I could see it from the side. It was incredible.! Then it just stopped..and hung there and I focused the binoculars on it again and I could cleary see the outline of the triangle. barely visible..but it was defenitely there..It was slightly brighter than the sky behind it, but it blended in so well you had to really look closely to see it. Oh my God ! Picture..I gotta get a picture...!  By now I had been watching it for at least 7 minutes or more...It just hung there..almost motionless...completly silent...Like I said it was giant...three times the size of even our largest Jumbo Jets...Bigger than the Damm Space Shuttle..My mind was racing now...I was afraid to walk away and grab the camera in case it did someting or took off...But I made my move...Boom I dashed in the house..snatched my Mom&#39;s camera and ran back out..10 seconds....Still there...! I turned on the camera and started to take the shot, but the display menu was on the screen and in the viewfinder and it wouldn&#39;t shoot...Damm it..! I kept messing with it with one eye on the lights...I could not get it to work..I tried for two more minute I&#39;d say and then I gave up....And went back to staring through the binoculars...It was absoultely stunning. My brain is racing a million miles an hour.... With thoughts like........Is anyone else seeing this...? Can I be the only one in this entire valley that is seeing this...? Should I call someone..?...who...? 911...? the news station..?...Someone has to see this....God why is the camera stuck..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am standing here looking at a UFO just hanging in the sky and I can&#39;t get a picture..Who is gonna beleive this..?   Mom...!  I have to wake her up...I start to go inside to wake her up...What if it&#39;s gone by the time she gets out here...? She is gonna think I have lost my mind or I am drunk or on drugs or something...Anything except seeing a UFO....! Oh well..I have to take a chance it will still be here...it&#39;s been here this long and with no sign of moving..I hesitated only a few seconds more and made my move...she can make the camera work...! It&#39;s her camera.!...Boom..I ran.....Ten seconds I am upstairs at her door pounding Mom Get Up..! Mom..! Wake up.....!  She answers starteled from her sleep...Jeffrey what is it....?  Whats wrong..?     I hear her getting up...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Outside....Look out the window..!  She says while frantically getting dressed, Whatis it...?   I don&#39;t know I said....Lights..Red Lights...We gotta get a picture....!   She gets to her window and looks out I guess and says ...&#34;Jeffrey those lights are on the Road  across the hill&#34;...I had already started back downstairs and was yelling..&#34;Get down here..Hurry..You gotta see this and the damm camera won&#39;t work...!  I hear &#34;my step father&#34;grumbling in the background....&#34;What the Hell is going on ?&#34;.... I hollared back at him..Get up _____, get out here quick...get your camera..your not gonna beleive this thing...! I was gone  In less than a minute I was back out and I looked up praying it was still there. It was. Same spot. Just &#34;hovering&#34; there..effortlessly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I go back to the binoculars...It is mesmerizing. A few seconds later and Mom is beside me...Still not sure what I&#39;m seeing....She looks out and says again..&#34;my name&#34;...&#34;Those lights are on the hill over there&#34;  Kinda pointing across the valley off to her right .....I say No Mom...Up there..In the Sky......and point as I handed her the binoculars.  She puts them up to her eyes and fixes on the lights.....I waited for what I knew was coming.....Oh My God.!...Jeffrey..What is that ?  It&#39;s a UFO Mom...&#34;There is no doubt in my mind&#34;. Look at that thing...the size of it. She already knew I was right. It was undeniable. It can be nothing other than a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She just keeps staring going...&#34;Oh My God...It&#39;s unbeleivable...&#34;  I start pointing out all the details...No sound...the outline..telling her to look really close and keep the binoculars very still. She could see it all perfectly..She was astonished. I could still see it fine with just fine without the binoculars.  &#34;We gotta get a picture Mom...Fix the camera...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I practically hand to pry the binoculars out of her hand and handed her the camera.. She turned it back on and waited for it to set, but it did the same thing..and she kept messing with it but it wouldn&#39;t take a shot. It just kept getting stuck.And I knew it wasn&#39;t going to. I was frantic to get a photo and yelled for &#34;My step father&#34; again a few seconds later he was there. Still half asleep ..going &#34;What the Hell you guys...&#34;.....We just pointed...and I handed him the binoculars. All the while, Mom is still fumbling with her camera, looking up and down still shocked. Then it&#39;s ---&#34;his&#34;--- turn..After he looks at it for a few seconds....Same thing...&#34;Oh My God&#34;...That is a UFO ____...!..Look how big it is..!  We said something like Yes...Yes..Get your camera ----------This one is stuck...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another minute of mumbling words and staring at it in awe and he hands Mom the binoculars and takes off for his camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was pissed that I don&#39;t have one right now, except for on my phone, and that would not have shown up so far away. Even with their cameras it might not show up very well but I think it should be visible and it could be some kind of proof. Mom and I just keep staring and I tell how it appeared and everything. We were both still toatally stunned. What a sight. We were so excited and were convinced it was very real. Our eyes couldn&#39;t lie to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now it had been over 15 minutes since I first saw it. ______ comes back with his camera, and gets ready to shoot....But of course...It goes dead....He turns it back on...Boom...It shuts down again...Dead battery...We are all frustrated...Damm It.I don&#39;t know what is more unbeleivable..A UFO hanging in the sky in front of us or that we have two cameras that won&#39;t work....I can&#39;t beleive we can&#39;t get a picture...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another couple minutes and we realized that neither camera was going to work and we were disappointed, but still excited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We talked about calling 911...the police...fire department...But we just kept staring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am serious Baby...It was truly Fantastic..I wish you could have been here to see it yourself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as we continued taking turns with the binoculars, It started to move again. We all said something...It began to turn it&#39;s nose back toward the direction it had came from go sideways..the it suddenly pulled up until it became completely vertical...straight up and down like it was standing on it&#39;s tail end with it&#39;s nose pointing straight up in the sky. It stopped there for a few seconds, and then it flipped around and went back leveled out facing the direction it had appeared from and hovered there again. To see it turn like that we all knew that anything we have that flys in the sky can not make those manuevers...especially without making a sound....We watched...eyes wide open..fascinated....<n> <n><n> <n><n> But what happened next was the most incredible part of the whole thing and left us almost speechless..It slowly began to disappear...one light at a time....what looked like the &#34;front light&#34; slowly dimmed out...It wasn&#39;t moving away though like the way it approached. It was actually vanishing....the 1st light...then the 2nd and then the 3rd...it took about 30 seconds to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And it was gone just like that. It wasn&#39;t like it moved far away or went up or anything..it completly vanished right in mid air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We talked about the whole thing for about 45 minutes...All kinds of ideasand questions...what it was...what it wasn&#39;t...why was it here...did anyone else see it or report it..get a picture or video.....Is it possible for us to be the only people to see it....On and on.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned on the news and went through the local channels..Nothing....<n> <n><n> <n><n> We said we should report it..but to who..?...the police..and what would they do...Laugh..Probably take the report and throw it away..thats it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I said I would go on the internet and find a UFO &#34;Hotline&#34; or something and make a report and see if anyone else made any reports also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an half an hour after it had gone I looked out my window and saw several small planes flying around the area which was wierd that late at night..They flew around the area for a while and they flew off. I went back to the internet and a few hours later the next thing I knew it was 6:00 and the sun was coming up. Then I heard jets... Military jets...they were blazing around all over up there going around in a sort of big circle. This went on for about half an hour and then fly off away. They defenitely looked like they were looking for something. I&#39;m pretty sure I know what it was..!  As of now I have not found any peports from that night, but I haven&#39;t looked yet today..But I will. Someone had to have seen it too.  What an experience Yas&#39;. I&#39;m not kidding Babe it was straight out of a movie scene...but undeniably real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank God I woke Mom and _______  up and we all saw it together...Otherwise they would probably beleive I saw something..but that it was something more explainable than a UFO. But we all agree it wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 100% positive in my mind that it was some kind of &#34;Craft&#34;...Who was inside it is the big question. Extraterrestrials...?or was it the military testing a secret &#34;spacecraft&#34; which we supposedly crashed in Roswell New Mexico back in the 1947and we learned how to work and used the technology to build our own &#34;Ships&#34;. All that goes on about 600 miles or so from San Diego in Nevada at the militarys most secretive base called Area 51. People claim they have all kinds of strange &#34;spacecraft&#34; out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Who really knows. Why would they fly anything down here in San Diego..? I personally don&#39;t think it was &#34;us&#34; flying that thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I beleive it was defenitely extraterrestrial in origin. We are wondering if it will appear again.....sometimes &#34;sightings&#34; as they call them happen alot in clusters in the same area over a short period of time.....it&#39;s possible.and I&#39;m ready with a camera that works..just in case... I doubt it.  But we&#39;ll be keeping our eyes on the sky around here thats for sure.......I stayed up last night to see if it would return...It didn&#39;t. I could go on and on about all the details but I&#39;ll stop for now.and write more later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pretty wild huh Babe !?! I&#39;ll tell you one thing...It was defenitely an experience that none of us will ever forget as long as we live.<n>

I looked up and saw nothing,and kept driving.  I then looked up again and saw a blue circular light, first thinking it was a small airplane landing, then taking a second look.When i focused on the light with my eyes it sped away to fast for me to see where it was going.  The light seemed to just disappear into nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eyes immediately began to water, i wasn&#39;t crying and my eyes weren&#39;t irritated;they just started watering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got goosebumps and called my mom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When she tried to call me back there was a call failed message,and then a weird sound.<n>

We left around 9:00 p.m. so we didn&#39;t have to deal with all the traffic, it&#39;s about a 2 hour drive from where we live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the way there we were on the empty highway, and we saw something about 100 feet away from us.  At first we thought it was a large road light but as we got closer we realized it wasn&#39;t.  It was silver with red lights along the bottom and shaped like an arrow, hovering about 25 feet above the ground with a light beaming down.  There was a small building beneath it, where the light was shining. We pulled over to the side of the highway to get a better look, but as soon as we did this it sped away and was gone.  There is no way a plane could have flew away that quickly. In only about 5 seconds after it started moving, it was completely out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no trees around or anything else that could have blocked the view. I was told that planes cannot stay in one place while in the air and this thing had definitely been there for awhile before we got close. I looked on the internet for any other possible explanation of what it would have been, but have yet to find anything close.  I never believed stories about possible UFO sightings, but after this experience my outlook has changed.<n>

We were thinking it was a planet but then we saw it drop dramatically and go to the right and as it traveled away from us, we saw red lights on it and then we saw it hover over trees. Even when it has been cloudy and there are no stars out, this bright white light is still there. We got our telescope out and the next night we looked at it and the way to describe it best was it was shaped like a round fried egg, sunny side up.  I think that is the best way to describe the shape of what it looked like.  The rim of the cylinder was solid and it outlined the cylinder.  Then last night when we were traveling on Rt. 113 in Comar, PA, we saw another bright white light the same as the one we looked at with our telescope.  Usually about 9 PM everynight, the bright light, UFO, drops and travels away from our sight and it always has red lights on as it travels away from us.  We live in Bucks County, PA and there have been many recent sitings of UFO&#39;s here.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving at about the speed of a helicopter, and it was shaped like a boomerang. It appeared to be moving sideways.  It was pretty low to the ground, at about the height of an airplane about to land. There were lights running along the perimeter of it, from what I could see.  I could only look at it for about ten seconds before it disappeared from my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It appears to be moving very slowly and it has lights blinking red and blue and green.  It is appears to be near the Baton Rouge Airport.  We witnessed several planes flying, they appear to be commercial airplanes.  I recorded it with my digital camera.  I had to zoom in to capture it.

I looked up to see a ringed object seemingly tumbling or darting in and out of cloud cover. I stopped at the corner of Esplanade and Topaz Street to look up and see the vehicle perform maneuvers for about 10 minutes. It appeared to be a solid object, with a ring of blue white light around the outside. Occasionally some small strobes were visible as it tumbled and moved back and forth laterally. It appeared to be somewhere over Esplanade and Pacific Coast Highway. There was no sound whatsoever and the object rotated and tumbled about for several minutes. It was observed by dozens of other witnesses. Eventually I left and the object was last seen descending toward the Hollywood Riviera area of Redondo Beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Images can be found here:   http://www.flickr.com/photos/87499547@N00/<n>

It was around 10:15 pm. I look in the sky all the time. One of my friends that was with us is an engineer and gets into the paranormal and UFO’s. We talk about it a lot. This was very crazy and much unexpected. Over the Tucson Mountains to our west, we noticed 3 Hugh orange lights and changing colors to red and white. At the same time we noticed 2 more strange white smaller lights over head a lot closer to us. They made no noise what so ever, and there was no running lights or any blinking lights on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking back over at the 3 lights over the Tucson Mountains as they changed color and where pulsating. Just like the Phoenix UFO on the news some years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They went out one by one and out of order. Then with in a couple of short minutes later they showed up over the Silverbell mountains and did the exact same thing then disappeared. My friends where looking at the 2 over our head and did not see the lights over the Silverbell mountains. When I told them too look they disappeared that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked back at the smaller lights over our heads as they where coming closer too us. These lights where white, and pulsating and moving more up then down. No other lights on the craft. One was just hovering. The second one was moving away to the west of our position. Then it disappeared. Boom! Just gone!  I know none of the objects we had been looking at where any type of plane. Or helicopter. I live right by the Air force base and the Tucson Air Port and see and hear planes every day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last one that was hovering stayed there for a few minutes, and then it made a very wide circle and went back to where it was hovering. Then did the same thing as the other one did. Slowly moved to the west and in front of all our eyes it pulsated then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two days later on 2-23-09 I was standing outside my home looking up into the sky at all the stars and planes still thinking about the other night. When a white light with no running lights or any other blinking lights on it came from the east, very slow. As it came closer I noticed it was not making any sound what so ever. It then got Hugh so bright that it hurt my eyes. It then stopped due south of my home just with in a mile of me. I noticed 3 Air force jets circling it. The light then went down in intensity. Then flu away to the west and then it was gone in a second. The Air Force jets seam to be following it away. After it disappeared the Air Force jets just went back to the base after 5 minutes or so. All I could say is I have been around for 48 years and have been a sky watcher all my life. This was a special few days.<n>

Directly in front of me at a very far distance, a light caught my attention.  I didn’t think anything of it at first I even mentioned calmly to my girlfriend  I wonder what that light is?<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we kept driving that far light happened to have gotten a lot closer all of a sudden to where we were able to see more definition of the light and began questioning this light, and started trying to follow it. We saw it for a few seconds before trees and houses began getting in the way of our site of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I proceeded to turn right into State St. heading in the direction that the light appeared to be going.  I made a right onto smerber Rd and saw the light again in the Northeast direction, the light was definitely round but I wasn’t close enough to see the actual object, I only saw the light it was generating. After the second time we didn’t see it anymore.  The UFO appeared to be moving northeast and getting lower because houses and the mountain in the area began to get in the way of my girlfriend and my vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am convinced that I saw a UFO,  I just wanted to get closer to see more<n> <n><n> <n><n> Which was really hard at the speed it was moving and the landscape in that area that is really hilly which can block ones vision.<n>

I was headed east.  I looked up into the sky and I saw an orange beam of light that had a stretched oval shape travel across the sky from north to south.  This light was traveling much more quickly than an airplane would.  It appeared in the sky for about two seconds and then it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

That is when they spotted a large round light in the northwest section of Tucson.  They called me and I drove 10 miles out into the desert to join them.  We had a wonderful view, as the area was dark and on a hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was large, round and had a white light.  The light would very in color, from white to brilliant white.  It would also change from round to a horizontal oval shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The appeared to be at least 6 objects that came from it.  These were smaller and reddish in color.  They would circle around and then go back to the main craft or light.  This happened several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At least twice, a reddish light came from the object to the ground.  There were also two other white shears, but they appeared smaller.  At one point one of the smaller white one appeared to land and take off in a few minutes.  This continued for at least 6 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point a white light came from the object towards us.  At that point my daughter panicked and ran to the house.  At times there were light that went from the smaller red objects back to the large white one. On the bottom of the large object, there also appeared to be red, blue and green light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no doubt that I saw the same object; to the southeast of the same location I was at, about two weeks ago.  It also stayed in the same spot for hours.  There was one other incident of one of the smaller red light much closer to the house, but my daughter is too afraid to talk to anyone about that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects could not be seen from the area of Marana I live in, which is right across the street from the City Hall, but could be easily seen from out in the desert slightly northeast of here.<n>

Quickly checked e-mails and prepared to go to bed.  Still dark outside with no indication of sun rising yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned off my bedroom light and laid down on the bed, just before I closed my eyes, I saw a light in the sky.  My bed is right beside the window which faces east.  I have no curtains, and I live on the 17th floor of an apartment building.  Mind you, I filed a report one month ago.  I have to admit I have a more heightened awarness of the night sky now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The view from my bedroom allows me to see the entire eastern night sky.  To redirect attention for a second, other than the last report I filed in Late January, I have had to other sightings, one in grade eight, and the other sometime in late highschool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first sighting was at a religious retreat in Orangeville, Ontario (1987).   All the boys slept in a large room with rows of beds either facing toward the inside wall or the outside window.  My bed was facing the large lengthy window.  It was approximately half an hour after the lights had been turned off (10 pm).  I noticed a green glowing, saucer shaped object hovering above the tree line approximately 300 meters away.  There was quite a bit of fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for a few seconds when I saw a beam of green light go down into the trees, that is when I woke everyone up to look at it.  Most were asleep.  Of the 25 classmates in the room, approximately five others witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute, the green glowing object slowly disapated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting occured while drving northbound on highway 404 heading toward Richmond Hill, a small town north of Toronto.  This occured sometime in 1993.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the back, left seat of a friends car.  It was the middle of the day.  I looked up and saw a clearly orange triangular shaped object maybe 1 km high.  I pointed it out to my friends, but because of there position, they could not see it.  The driver had to focus on the road, as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered for 30 seconds then shot directly st! raight u p at an astonishing speed and disappeared out of site. Now back to the latest sighting.  I quickly determined the light I was looking at was not a plane.  There were no flashing lights, and the light was almost luminescent.  The best I could describe it, as if it was floating across the sky.  The light was approximately a km in the sky.  I stood on my bed and watched the light, it quickly sped away at an alarming speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was convinced it was not a plane.  From the vantage point of my bedroom window, planes normally take approximatel 10 minutes to completely disappear out of sight.  This object not only sped away in less than thirty seconds, it followed an angle in the sky different from an airplane.  Airplanes follow a logical direction in the sky and approach the horizon at a slow and steady speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object reached &#39;horizon level&#39; in under 30 seconds.  Fighter planes could possibly move at those speeds, but this happened 5:45 in the morning with no sonic boom to be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I saw 2 synchronized flashing lights hovering about 500 feet above a ridge that is about a mile from my house. The craft, (assuming the 2 lights were on the right and left edges), was around the size of a half dollar held at arms length. I watched the flashing lights for more than 5 minutes &amp; they did not move. Curious, I stepped outside to watch them more closely. Unlike helicopters I have seen and heard in the area, there was no distinguishable sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not lived in the house for more than a couple of months, so after about 10 minutes of watching the lights, I decided that it must be a communications tower that I had not previously noticed. I went back to bed. In the morning after the sun came up, I realized that there is no tower or any structure that could be confused with the object that I saw.<n>

I live in Oregon, so this time of year, you don&#39;t get to see the stars very often-It was a beautiful clear night.  This &#34;star&#34; was just too strange-It seemed too close to the earth, and I could plainly see it pulsating with vibrant colors.  I ran into the house to grab my digital camera, and began filming.  It did some amazing rotating, and moved several times over the next two hours.  All in all, I saw five of these in the night sky, but none as close as this one, and then this one bacame a pinprick pretty fast. This was the best footage I got.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What do you think?  I see that I&#39;m not the only one out there seeing these in the sky.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s an actual extraterrestrial vehicle, or a government vehicle, or even an entity but all I can say is that is NOT a planet, that is NOT a helicopter, and if you&#39;ve watched this full screen, you will see it rotate into three distinct parts.  Please [politely] let me know what you think of this.  My husband and I have been fighting ever since, because he insists it&#39;s a planet whose light is refracting thru the cosmos. Phooey.  That&#39;s no planet!  Like I said, it came closer and then became a pinprick, and then came closer, and moved left and right over several hours.  A UHO unidentified hovering object, if you will! =)<n>

There was a beam of light stretching over our heads, going from the southwest to the northeast.  The light appeared kind of vague and blurry but as I looked longer the light became more clear.  I&#39;m not sure what this is or how it got there but I am very curious what it is and if it will be back tomorrow night.<n>

It was bigger than a basketball – but smaller than a medicine ball.  I am going to guess it was around 200 ft off the ground.  Now, my ramp takes me off the highway a little to the south then back to the east to a stop sign.  I saw it drift through the air moving a little south then back towards the east…as it dipped down over the lights of the Petro:2 Truck Stop it came back up a little and just disappeared- just like the it been flipped off.  It was mostly clear outside with cool temps.  I looked around the cab of my truck to make sure that I didn’t see any reflections. I saw no reason to for it to be other than what I say. Although the sign at exit 76 does not say Egan-for my purposes as a trucker-that is the town-used.    I will add this tho- I have seen this kind of light before on two other occasions in Kansas and near Raton, NM.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was about 1/2 from the Chena Hot Springs exit when off to my left I saw an incredibly bright light falling.  It looked just like a shooting star only much brighter and much closer and it was green.  It looked as if it would hit the ground in the valley behind Curry&#39;s Corner.  I had my 3 children in the car with me and they were just as amazed as I was.  It looked white as it was falling then the closer it got to the ground the brighter green it seemed to get.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe it was debris that had entered our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing is that a couple of weeks ago less than 6 miles away a friend of mine reported the exact same sighting on her way to work.  There were many witnesses in both incidences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any clues as to what is falling from the sky here?  Satellite debris maybe?<n>

My brother saw the craft up close and ran back home to get his camera. We took pictures on our rooftop. The object was diming its light very low, then very bright about every couple minutes. From what my brother said it was just as big as a comericial airplane or even bigger. It also traveled very fast from east to west. The pictures reveal it to be green and purple, but my brother said it was grey up close. There are other unknown crafts in the picture that we did not see that night. These ones were in triangle formation, and when zoomed in it revealed a saucer with red lights around it. Almost all of the pictures also have little blue dots in them. It then traveled too far for us to take pictures, so we went back inside. When we went back outside 30 minutes later it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet, we suspect.

(We&#39;re figuring a deputy will show up to make sure that we aren&#39;t drug addicts :-) Kids are freaked out by what they saw, my old man has never seen anything like it before and says he is sure it wasn&#39;t a plane, I caught very short glimpse. We live in the woods and lost it in the distant trees. Drove to find it, but was unsuccessful. Made the kids and the old man draw what they saw (without being near the others while they were drawing) and all have similar pictures. Not sure what else it could have been.!?<n>

My name is ((name deleted)) and I really am not sure if I am doing this correctly, but I would like to share a sighting that my husband and I saw today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a resident of High Springs, Florida.   While I was driving this afternoon around noon, my husband and I were driving down 441 (thats the name of the road) we were heading to Gainesville to run errands and in the corner of my eye I saw this shiny object in the sky.  I asked my husband what that was and he was like I&#39;m not sure, it may be an airplane, I said no Edward if a plane was down that low it would be bigger than that and it wouldn&#39;t be that shiny.  It wasn&#39;t a bird nor a place.  This object was like a frisby and it was shiny, may have been silver or white in color, it was at a stand still for about a min or so.  I had to pull over to see if I could get a better look at it, and by the time I pulled over it was gone.  There was no resiadue, smoke or any sort of trial behind it.  I believe what my husband and I saw was indeed a UFO of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not one of those people that just go looking for these sort of things, but I know what I saw and it was nothing normal about it.  It was the strangest thing I&#39;ve ever saw in my life!  I&#39;m geting goosebumps and teary eyed just writing this to you.  Also, the sky was crystal clear, no clouds or anything.  Broad daylight and it was just plain as day!  Amazing! WOW! If you need to contact me you may do so.  Here is my information:  ((personal information deleted))<n>

As I walked I looked at it and noticed it was moving east away from me at a hight rate of speed. I stopped to  get a perspective of the object moving and it was moving fast. What caught my eye was that it was bright and seemed to be at a high altitude and it did not have any distinctive lights as aircraft would. Their were no navigation lights, or anti-collision light, it was just a bright white ball of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just watched it accelerate away, it took no longer then 2 minutes for it to disappear from my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I had seen a similar light last summer, when I had seen other unusual activity on the same mountain all summer long, always in the middle of the night.  This time the light changed SLOWLY from red to green, blink off.  Then green, red, green, blink off.  Then green only, blink off. Red only and blink off.  It varied patterns like this the whole time I watched for over an hour. The object slowly moved across that specific area of the mountain, slowly bobbing downward then up, across. It has traversed a good portion of the lower half of the whole hill/mountain.   An hour later it is now down close to the bottom of the mountain.     Police officers came to my house, upon my call, and saw the object from my front sidewalk. We could all see it as we looked south, between 2 houses, yet a mile away at the base of this mountain.  There are people, perhaps 7 houses,living on that mountain, so if it had been a helicopter, the noise would have awakened everyone living in that area.  Last year I heard that there is lots of gold in those &#34;hills&#34; and that local kids like to go on their bikes up the desert hills to find small pieces of gold. I only mention this, because a person told me years ago that some civilizations actually drink gold and need it to survive, for some reason. Perhaps there is mining going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius?))<n>

Of course a satellite can be seen to move.  They travel at not less than 18,000 mph.  The intensity of a satellite can vary, as well.

2/19/09 19:00|Stevenson Ranch|CA|Light|40 minutes|Observed with the naked eye, an unusually bright white round object in the NW sky.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68816.html|115|ndxe200902| Observed with the naked eye, an unusually bright white round object in the North Western. night sky of Santa Clarita Valley in Southern California.  It appeared to stay in the same position (approx. 10:00 position) 30 minutes or better with the intensity never changing.  During this initial observation the object never came closer or farther in respect to our viewing location; basically the object size never changed.  Orion’s belt was viewed almost due West at approximately 11 o’clock position from our viewing position. We heard no noise or saw no indication of a missile launch out of Vandenburg Air Force Base; next launch is scheduled for February 24, 2009 per Vandenburg’s calendar.  The object was than observed through the side sighting scope of an amateur telescope (D: 60mm; F: 700mm) where the following was observed: object had a dark center, with a white band with red and blue colors radiating outward from the white outer band perimeter. Object remained a full round shape 90% of the time.  However, it changed from that frontal view round shape and rotated on its vertical axis maintaining same vertical size, but it changed its’ vertical shape to half the original frontal view; then its’ shape shifted like a saucer rounded on one edge and flat on the other edge; then it rotated and titled some more and its’ shape became an oval and went into a horizontal position. Within 30-45 seconds after changing to that final position the object descended below the visible horizon.  The color lights remained the same throughout this observation.  The view through the main telescope was further validated by one of the observers.  One observer; having worked on highly secretive military aircraft; and that observer understands the maneuverability of aircraft; believes these observations are beyond any known comprehensible understanding of present day aircraft to his knowledge.  As of this date has anyone reported sightings similar to our observations?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus is very prominent in the western sky, currently, but if the object suddenly moved, it could not have been Venus.

It was an orange/yellow light that would change to red and green. I first saw it when I was some 10 miles away and I drove right past it. It was to high off the mountain to be a communication tower, there is none there. It was to slow to be an airplane, and it was far and to windy in the Cajon Pass to be a helicopter. I drove on three sides of the mountain and the light never dimmed, nor did it look like it struggled to move in the wind like an aircraft would in such high wind. I watched it move slowly a few miles when I lost sight of it behind another mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had been raining earlier in the evening. The sky was clear, except for a few small clouds. The stars where out. There was no moon visible. This is a country area, so there is very few houses, and three towers with red flashing lights a few miles away from the road I was driving on. I saw some amber colored, twinkling lights. Not flashing, it was like when you have heat coming up from the asphalt and it looks like its twinkling, but its not. Thats what it looked like. The lights where in two lines, an eighty or ninty degree angle. They were concentrated over near the middle tower. This thing was huge. It made the tower look like a toothpick. There isnt any possible thing in the area that could compare to the size of this thing. I pulled off the side of the road and watched it for at least ten to fifteen minutes. It looked like it was just hoovering, barely moving at all. It was just there, thats it. I went back the next morning to see if there was something that could have caused this. There was nothing. The tower is at the top of the mountain. It was a good distance over the tower. It couldn&#39;t have been nothing on the land. What ever this was, it had to have been in the sky.

Just as we were leaving the town of Haymarket via the Old Carolina Road I noticed a very bright light in the Western Sky. To the left or South of the light I could also see the planet Venus which was setting in the South Western horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was fire orange in color and at first sight seemed to be shining from the tree tops on Bull Run Mountain. We pulled over at the intersection of Old Carolina and Hethecote Blvd to get a better look. Now able to see unabated we were amazed to see the orb rising from the top of Bull Run Mountain. As the light lifted, which had to be at least a few hundred feet from the top of the Mountain it started drifting towards us in a Easterly direction. Incredibly as the light drifted it would stop and hover for several minutes than resume moving again, now on a more East North Easterly flight path. As the light got closer to our position it stopped, again hovered for several minutes, now just North of are position, this is when we noticed this was not a helicopter and certainly not a airplane. At this point the light gradually started to turn North and remained on this path until I could know longer see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the sighting there was a lot of other traffic that also seemed to be watching the object, I just hope they take the time to fill out a report of this fascinating sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We 1st spotted 2 white lights through the trees.  About 1/8 of a mile or less away. These 2 lights were just above the tree level.  It was a cloudy night with snow coming down.  We were in the interior of the remote 30 mile wide Drummond island in Michigan`s upper peninsula. With a low cloud ceiling and snowing lightly. We would never expect to see aircraft in the area.  The lights were white-white with the left one being about 2 times in size as the right light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be like a tower light not blinking. I first thought it was a plane that was passing by slow and low. They seemed to be moving in the direction we were going maybe slower than the speed we were going, 40 to 50 mph. I could see both lights horizontal.  15 seconds after spotting them they stayed spaced the same distance but started moving left.  After a move to the left the object banked more to the left and I could plainly see its oval shape with one side facing me lighted on the edge. The light around the edges can only be described as like a woman’s ring that has baguettes set in the band. I could see it was lighted all around the outside edge as it turned up sideways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its movement was not anything I have ever seen in 51 years. This very quickly got right out of sight in what looked like a rolling motion not like a horizontal movement. For just a couple quick seconds it kind of looked like a kid’s sparkler when you make circles without the sparks.  As soon as it was visible as the oval shape to me it very quickly went straight away out of sight. I saw it as an oval shape for about 4 or 5 seconds. We stopped right away a couple hundred feet down the trail. We both said, did you see that?  I said, I did but my family member said he did not see it leave as an oval or circle shape.  We went a short way farther ½ mile and stopped in a more clear area. My nephew 41 years old did not want to hear what I had to say about the shape I saw as it quickly shot away.  I am telling you on my mother’s grave this was nothing short of the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My nephew also said there was a collision of a couple satellites and it could have been falling debris. I got the creeps and looked over my shoulder all the way back to the lodge.  It still makes me shiver as I write this.  All I can say is I am glad it went away from us not toward us. This was truly my first time to see an object I cannot explain with movement like I have never seen. Wish we shut the machines right off to listen for sound.

When my husband got home about 7:15 pm he saw an un-explained white flash of light similar to lightening that lit up the kitchen windows.

As I pointed my binoculars directly to the ocean, West, I saw what appeared to be a white light moving steadily north.  As it got closer, it got my attention, because it had no strobelight.  It flew over the Los Angeles Airport and I was able to keep an eye on it for approximately 2 minutes till it faded north into sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen planes in the area and have become accustomed to see them.  This was not a plane. It was either a satellite, but it appeared too low and too close to be one or something unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

STRANGE<n> <n><n> <n><n> this is the second time in a 4 month period that i observed this exciting event. oddly enough both times were heavy overcast with very light rain and late in evening while walking dogs in a local state  park that is densely wooded. the dogs were even aware of the ufo hovering above us. at first it appeared as if it was only about 100 feet above us. at first i counted 4 lights giving it the shape of a triangle with the forht one in the center. the ufo had no sound yet my ears felt like they were ready to pop like when reaching a high altitude. the dogs felt discomfort as well. i never seen them lay down and cover their eyes. VERY STRANGE.my body had a feeling of extreme pressure in my chest as well. the lights were dim as if only emitting 50 watts and were like a yellow/orange with a pulsating look. i have never seen anything quite like this before. the odd part at the end of the sighting was both objects seem to have colided with each other to become one and then took off at the most incredable speed in one direction, only to stop after reaching a distance of about 200 feet and then coming back as if to get another look at us and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It rotated clockwise slowly and had 4 or 5 beams coming from the bottom of the UFO which were not very bright and were yellow in colour, but were bright enough to poorly illuminate an object.  The UFO was only a couple of hundred feet in the sky.  It moved at walking pace and looked like it had a dome on the top of the disk which was faintly illuminated red/pink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made a quiet noise, similar to a jet engine, but much quieter.

I stopped in the middle of the intersection because I was very frightened, and through the trees I saw them break off and travel slower at a more normal speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned the corner and straight ahead out the window  the lights were in sync again now traveling  faster going South.

We were traveling in a car and pulled over to observe for a few minutes.  There were other cars pulled on to the shoulders - we assume watching the same thing.  Not sure how long the event lasted, as we continued on our trip.  It looked similar to the photo that someone else had submitted and seemed to be close to the same place.

My tour is the night shift 10p to 6a. I wrote down on a note pad as it was happening so the details of what I wrote here are accurate. On 2/17/2009 at 20:47 I was driving to work on Route 80 east in New Jersey when I noticed a group of RED lights up in front and to the left of me. My first thought was radio tower lights, but these didn’t blink.. I then noticed as many as 6 or more cars pulled over on the right shoulder. As I slowed down I seen the drivers of the cars looking in the direction of the lights. Were I pulled over was highway marker 40.5 east bound about ten feet in front of me. Searching a internet map service, I determined I was facing EAST, slightly SOUTH. Sitting still on the highways shoulder I could tell that these nine (9) lights were not moving. They were bright solid red. In a pattern of what I could best describe as a bent letter H. Four (4) slightly curved to the right to make the left side of an H. Two (2) across, but a little higher than the middle as the line of an H, and Three (3) lights slightly curved to the right as the left side of the H. My estimate of their hight was later determined by the cloud formations that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Altocumulus clouds stay between 6&#39;500 and 20,000 feet. Theses lights were just under the clouds, to a point that the right side of the H patterns 2 lights seemed as if they were slowly pulsing. They were simply going in and out of the cloud formation as the clouds moved. I took a photo 20:48 with my cell phone but it just looks black on the phones screen. I am keeping the photo to open latter on my PC. I called my son at 20:48 to tell him what I was looking at, and yes I did get the (can you see little green men in the windows) attitude. Mind you there was no body structure, just the lights. As I was talking to him a Jet plane passed from South to North (right to left). Clearly saw the planes flashing lights on both wings, which told me he was banked an turning. He was about an inch in length and clearly visible. (Not sure how far away a jet is that looks an inch in length to the naked eye). Newark Airport is close by. As the plane passed under the lights, just to the hight of the lowest light. I would say that the RED lights were closer to me. I then yelled to the two men standing out side of their car if they knew what we were looking at. They were just as puzzled as I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In searching the internet, my best guess as to the location of these lights is over Boonton Town Reservoir, New Jersey.  Being late for work I left the area and lost sight of the lights at first.  I caught them again just after the 43 mil marker.  They were to my right side of the windshield top, only now in a wavy line of eight (8) across and one (1) was half the distance to the ground below and centered on the line.  Just sitting there.  I lost them as I drove and looked at my clock and it was 21:12.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please E-mail me and I will send further info/drawings if needed.<n>

Then I noticed it was getting closer and then it changed into 3 multi-colored lights, rite in a row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer it looked more like a box or building like shape.  It had a bright white light in the middle and the same multi-colored lights on its outside.  It came closer and closer until it was right over us. Thats where i saw it looking up. It looked more like a triangle/box shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thats when I got out of the car and heard a hovering like sound.  We started the car and tried to follow this unidentified flying object but ended up loosing it shortly.  Then at 11:16 saw a similar UFO going in the same North-West direction.  Ive never seen anything like this.<n>
2/16/09 22:15|Puerto Rico||Unknown|20 minutes|Pulsating Red/Green/White light off Puerto Rico.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Sirius.  We will contact source.  PD))|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69058.html|147|ndxe200902| Pulsating Red/Green/White light off Puerto Rico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were recently on a NCL cruise when I spotted something strange from the balcony one night.  It was 10:15 PM local time (11:15 PM EST), and we were approximately ½ ways between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.  My guess is we were 25 miles north of the two islands, traveling due east and closer to Puerto Rico than the Dominican Republic.  The sky was crystal clear and the visibility excellent when viewing the horizon.  Looking straight up was diminished due to the ships lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out on the balcony and immediately spotted a pulsating white/red/green light to the south, approximately 30 degrees above the horizon.  The object was stationary and appeared to be rotating.  The color changes were at regular intervals of approximately 1 second each.  There also appeared to be a solid white light just above and attached to the color changing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes my wife came out and I showed her what I was looking at.  We both confirmed the color changing and the stationary aspect of the object.  We continued to view the object for 15 to 20 minutes.  In that time the object did not move up, down, or side to side at all, nor did the intensity of the lights change.  What ever it was, it was definitely in a stationary position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not appear to be close.  I would guess it was 10 to 20 miles away as its relative position did not change in relation to the stars in the background and the motion of the ship.  I was very tempted to call the bridge and ask what they thought of my sighting, but eventually never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is worth mentioning that my wife and I live in New England, close to the ocean and just a few miles from a major airport.  We have seen thousands of airplanes over the years and often watch them come in over the water from 20+ miles away.  Never has one appeared like this.  Airplanes at a distance at night start off as a solid white light, move left/right/up/down, and then as they get closer the red and green wing lights come into view.  The object we saw that night did not move at all and was easy to reference to the stars in the background.  The red and green was also just as bright as the white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a casual astronomy enthusiast and fairly literate with the movements of the planets and constellations.  The object we witnessed was far below the planetary arc and could not have been Venus or any other planet.  In luminosity though I would say it was as bright as the brightest Venus I’ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Sirius.  We will contact source.  PD))<n>

The object had extreamly bright lights. Though the binoculars, it looks liked rows and rows of windows on a circular object.  The lights appeared to be coming out of the rows of windows, however, the locations of the lights would change which made the object appear to change shape.

Just before driving over the hill moments before pulling into my drive way I  thought I saw a blue light to my left high in the sky but I let it go thinking it was the reflection of the firehouse lights I passed on the power lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds later I realized there really was a light in the sky. It was moving incredibly fast and it was a blue light that wasn&#39;t blinking. It looked very high in the sky but it was easy to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved smoothly from the left part of the sky to the right part of the sky and there as no sound. It took about several seconds to cross over to the other side. It was coming from the south going directly north.

It stayed in the same spot just moving back and forth for about 30-45 minutes, then just disapeared.  Kind of hovering back and forth.  We kept looking at it and took some pictures, but the movie pictures just looks like a white speck moving back and forth.  The movies look nothing like just looking at it with the naked eye.  We thought it was a bright star, but it had green around it and it hovered back and forth.  We also thought at first it was a helicopter, but it never moved.  We never took our eyes off of the object, then it just disapeared.  No movement at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They flew together one broke off to the right and became stationary the other two continued together until they blended in the sky with the other stars.I have no idea what it was because i dont believe in things like this but i know what i saw.It only lasted about 15 seconds I still cant believe what i saw was real. there has to be an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But,I realized I was staring dead straight into the Southern Sky. There were a few stars off to the left &amp; then I started looking for possible planes in the sky for a reference (since we are only a couple miles form the McGhee Tyson Airport &amp; Air National Guard Post. Their were a couple planes off to the East very high ~ So this was a very , very clear night. Now the light I saw hadn&#39;t moved but say 1000 yards from where I saw it and It was Glowing Bright White light ~ NO FLASHING NO COLORS what so ever ~ it seemed to move only in left to right and right left a couple of times in very short distances ~ I watched it for about 10 minutes and then realized what I was seeing ~ I took out my phone which has a camera and clicked 4 quick photos ~ and to my amazement two of the photos showed the light as red and one of them showed blue and one showed nothing like it wasn&#39;t there ~ About this time 2 EMT&#39;S came out of the E.R. heading to the Ambulance and I yelled at them and asked if they could see that light in the sky ~ They were both like &#34;WOW&#34; what is that? Now this thing was about 2000 ft. to 3000 ft. in the air ~ I have done skydiving before and have a pretty good idea about heights , it is a guess but pretty close none the less.Neither of them had any idea what it was &amp; they both stated that they had seen numerous Helicopters at night for pickup at accidents &amp; at crime scenes with Police Helicopters &amp; they both were like &#34;That&#39;s Chopper&#34; I continued to watch the light still only white to my eyes &amp; theirs. It was so bright it almost hurt to look at it to long I watched for about 10 more minutes then &#34;poof&#34; it was gone. Nothing , it never came back and I couldn&#39;t find it anywhere in the s! ky I wen t up to the 3rd floor observatory and scanned the entire sky for 15 minutes and saw nothing except a couple small jets going in for landing at McGhee Tyson.Now I live here and we see all kinds of Military Helicopters and C130&#39;s also refueling Cargo Planes and lotsa local air traffic dailey. I&#39;m positive that this was nothing of the sort ~ It was no Comet or Meteor ~ it wasn&#39;t a weather balloon or &#34;Flares&#34; THIS THING WAS THERE WE SAW IT! Thanks for your time.<n>

Tonight I felt I should report them as something a bit more sinister happened. One of them was flying north down the canal route, flashing and such. Another joined it momentarily but dissapeared. As soon as it got over the houses to the north it dissapeared, but not before a third much brighter light slowly rose up from behind the houses. Worryingly it was in the direction of the local cow field. That then proceeded to rise up further when the other dissapeared, and flew over to the south so close to my house it musn&#39;t have been further than a few hundred feet away. It then went out of view.

It was traveling at about 10 miles per hour approximately 20-30 feet off the ground.  It was moving so smoothly in one direction (diagonal, to my left, passing from the side of me to in front of me) that at first i thought this sphere was on some type of invisible zip-line.  Then the sphere started moving in directions outside of it&#39;s original path.  Still traveling forward, it moved up and down, and then swooped very quickly as it got closer to the brick building in front of me (High School in the Community).  The sphere was small as I mentioned, but it&#39;s movements were quick and smooth.  The possibility of it being controlled somehow by remote is out of the question based on the quick, sudden movements (at one point doing a quick loop.  The word dancing would almost describe it).  I kept walking forward towards the brick building where it was fading out of my site, and then I could no longer see it as it seemed to have traveled out of site.  I continued to look for it for the next 30 minutes to no avail.  Shortly thereafter I saw a large slowly drifting  object far off in the distance, cigar shaped, but very large.  It didn&#39;t act or look like a cloud.  The only possibility I could come up with was that maybe it was a Zeppelin or blimp.  This remained in my sight for 15 minutes or so.  Also, a bright light high in the sky appeared in view.  It looked like a bright star or planet, but I hadn&#39;t seen it minutes earlier.  This made it suspicious to me.  I asked another walker on the streets if he could see it and he could.  He said maybe it was Venus.  Regardless, the sphere was very much so real, and blew my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving north on the park road approaching the intersection that enters the campground. Not high above the tree line slightly to the northeast I saw a small but brilliant white fireball (reminded me of magnesium burning) going in a slow, straight line from east to west, with an angle around 8 o’clock (slightly downward). It did not have a tail that I remember but it could have had a faint one. The tree line was only a few hundred yards away. I counted it for about 4 seconds when it suddenly disappeared in a slight black wisp of smoke. There was no sound. No fire was started on the ground (I watched that patch of woods for the next 20 minutes and never saw any smoke rising). I immediately reported it to the park office, thinking it was maybe some kids in the campground setting off fireworks, such as a roman candle. But there was no arc on the trajectory, and no color like a roman candle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I got on hwy 24 headed to Clarksville, Tn. Around exit 19 the car in front of me started slowing down. I looked up and saw two red lights and a green light off in the distance. The lights caught my attention because they were not moving. As I drove closer to the lights the craft got bigger and it was circular  with red and green lights on it. It seemed to come down closer to us. The car in front of me pulled over, I kept going but every one around me was stopping and getting out. I kept driving as the craft got closer it was very big and dark silver the lights did not blink or it did not seem to move it was like it was standing still. I kept driving I looked up as I past it and it seemed to glow brighter. I drove past  maybe seven cars stopped and people out of them or just sitting there watching. Since I was alone I did not stop. It was not a plane or helicopter. I have never seen a UFO or claimed to but this was one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It first looked like a shooting star, then started pretty much free falling from right to left, then slightly curved upward, then started accelarating up, then just faded like a burned out matchstick. It almost looked just like the texas fireball, but slightly smaller. We thought when we saw the Texas fireball news report that it was the same one, until we looked at the times, and they did not match up.

I have just witnessed an object falling into the atmosphere at 5:08 am this morning(2/15//09).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped outside to have a cigarrette, and noticed a glow  travelling due south about 45 degrees above the horizon. it proceeded to fall glowing a bright silver color, with no other color at an unusually slow rate. After about 1.5 seconds it began to dim and then the intense glow faded to see a remnant travelling for another .5-.7 seconds towards the treeline behind the water tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trajectory appeared to be heading into the East side over Charlotte, and from my astonomy background appeared unusual because of the relative speed and color. I seemed about 1/2 the speed of most meteor oblects and the duration of visibility after burning also lasted for a longer period. The color was an intense white light that would be a magnitude 5 times brighter than Jupiter ( which is visible just after sunset in the East currently around 7 pm).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This could have been a very large meteor that did not burn completely, and the remains may have reached Earth East to South East of Charlotte. This however appeared to be at a slower speed, possibly close to a speed of a visible manmade satellite. [There has been recent news coverage of a  2 satellite collision last week (maybe around Tuesday-Wednseday). Also there has been coverage of close range asteroids that were found last Autumn, and several large objects that entered the atmoshere last October-November 2008. Also, I saw one of these on 10/31/08 at 2:58 am and the color was yellow amber with a fater speed and longer visible duration which appeared to break into several pieces].<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw this morning was different than normal in speed and color from previous experiences with meteor phenomenon, and may be part of recent satellite activity. What I thought was most interesting was that it occured in Charlotte airspace, and could have been spotted on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was stunned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time would be around 0315, and I think I was between the Bow and Cook rd exit. At first I thought, ok, it’s just a satellite or a reflection on my windshield, but it came down with no angles, it fell straight I mean straight, which was really strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was much larger than a star and not like a lite on a plane.  It was the brightest thing in the sky even compared to the moon.  The dot of light floated there for about 3 seconds before it started to fly away.  It accelerated extremely fast and within halfa second was going at least 5 times as fast as a plane and just kept getting faster.  The dot of light got so fast it started to blur and then just dissapeared out of the sky.  I kept looking up the rest of the way home for the fifteen minute walk but didnt see anything else like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were taking a romantic walk around the lake and let&#39;s just say we felt really &#39;in the mood&#39; so I lay down my jacket and we got undressed. As we were &#39;canoodling&#39; I saw a flash of light, so I thought it was going to start to storm so we got dressed and headed home. As I looked around our normally busy street I noticed there was no one around. I made that comment to my girlfriend that no one was around and suddenly my girlfriend taylor froze and her jaw dropped. She was staring up at the sky. I looked up and I huge flying saucer the size of a footballl field was comiong down to earth obscenely quickly so we began to run.all of a sudden there was a screaming sound in the air and then there was a flash of light and then everuything was back to normal.

My white plastic blinds were closed only letting in a little bit of light from the street light in.  All of a sudden I saw a large neon blue flashing ball falling from the sky from left to right.  It only lasted 3-4 seconds.   I could make out the light even through my blinds, as it distracted my attention from the TV.  I’d say it was fell somewhere in southern Yukon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pointed to the sky and said, &#34;Wow, look at Mars!&#34; or something like that.  Then the object got brighter and started to move a little bit to the east.  We were intruiged and kept watching, and then the object began to change speed and move more to the north, before speeding up significantly and then curving towards the east again.  It was orange and bright at first, but once it started moving north it faded to a dull orange color and was not bright anymore.  It also did this pulsing, circular movement -- there was a brighter spot that kept circling around and around, as if it was an arm or an extension of the object that was rotating.  It had only one arm that we could see.  Like a spoke on a wheel or something -- but one side would rotate faster than the other side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have you received any other sightings like this?  It was so strange!<n>

Only one object spotted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First viewed from closed window and thought it was the way a street light was reflecting on the glass, I stood up and realised that the object was in the sky. I moved upstairs to gain a better view and opened the window so that there were no light reflections from the glass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was static in the sky at this point and I proceeded to grab my digital camera, unfortunately the batteries were flat so I went to observe the object again through the open window. It started to move in a southerly direction very slow as if a helicopter was hovering but it suddenly came back on itself in a north-westerly dirrection but was hard to tell how high or how far it was moving but was not very far at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then suddenly moved away into a south/south-easterly dirrection at speed, nothing like I have seen from a helicoptor nor a plane with its acceloration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no change in its shape, the light coming from it never changed like a commercial aircraft would with its anti-collision light being obscured as it moved but most percular is the fact at no stage was there any noise. Even when it pulled away at speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no extrme weather in the area. Wuite a calm, cold night (roughly 5 degrees celsius)   The area is used by the UK RAF as a bombing range at Donna nook but this was definately not a plane, and I do experience flights and contact with helicopters in my rangwe of work and it was again definately not a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would if possible like to know what would happen to this report as I just searched in google for UFO reporting to get this, I do not mind being contacted.<n>

The first thing we noticed in the sky was a bright pinpoint of light much brighter than a star, it was far away and I assumed it was Venus but it troubled me because I have never seen Venus so bright. We both looked at it during our walk for about 10 minutes. We made several tests to see if there was any movement, making a comparison with nearby stars. It was stationary. It was so bright that it gave  a star burst effect and it was difficult to eliminate the star burst effect to ascertain just what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both agreed it was not round but elongated, we continued our walk to a nearby hotel. Buildings began to interfere with our view of the object, at this point we made a decision to continue to the hotel with the hope that we could view it from the rear of the hotel, as it turned out we couldn&#39;t, again it was obscured by buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed in the hotel for about 1 hour, when we returned to the last siting position it was gone. There was no trace of it anywhere in the area of the sky where it was, this object was not an aircraft as there was no flashing lights just a very bright, yellowish, stable, elongated light, approx 4 times the brightness of Venus on a good night.<n>

I thought immediately about how vulnerable the earth must be in space and had a feeling like something could hit it at any time and was a bit frightened by the thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as this thought dissipated, I saw what appeared to be a slightly illuminated triangular shape very close to the same color as the sky, and three bulb like objects located at the outward ends of each of the triangular points of the shape.  The bulb like objects were either not lit at all or were very dim, but something was glowing, whether it was an illuminated track on the inner frame of the shape, or just the outline of the shape itself was luminescent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, it seemed to have appeared from nowhere, which startled me, and it moved so quickly from the far right all the way past me to the left that I could tell it was not moving in the way that an aircraft would move, nor did it make a single sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no blinking or moving lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was about five or six hundred yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving at what I could estimate at about 60 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued moving away over the tree tops and apartment complexes to my left and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very frightened because this is not my first initial sighting. I had a much more intimate sighting close to the year 1997 at a Caldors in Waterford, Connecticut. I was with my Mother and sister at that time.<n>

We just arrived in the car (parked south of the store and looking southwest)when we saw a black dot in the sky floating about 45 degrees above the horizon. The dot temporarily split into four parts for about twenty seconds and then collapsed back into a single circle. It started floating again and appeared to get smaller and smaller as though moving away (or shrinking upon itself).   Finally, as we were watching, it disappeared into the sky. Although it was late afternoon and the sun was setting, the sky was still bright.  The object definitely visible.  There were no jet trails or other characteristics.<n>

I noticed something that caught my eye to the NNW, it looked to be a dark colour, round in shape and just static in the sky.  It then moved ever so slowly and then remained static again.  I ran in and grabbed my camera and when I came back outside I managed to take two pictures taken on a Canon Power Shot, one taken on normal view and the other on a maximum 16x zoom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where this was witnessed I would hazzard a guess at others from different, neighbouring towns having seen this also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching a plane flew over at a high altitude [leaving contrails] and the object vanished.  I returned back indoors for a while but popped my head out again to see if it had returned and saw another object the same as the one I saw but more to the West.  I grabbed my camera from the kitchen but failed to pick it up on my viewfinder and when I looked at the sky the object had again vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot find a rational explanation for this, it certainly wasn&#39;t a bird as it was too high, certainly not a plane as no noise and no contrails [the plane that went past it left contrails and made a noise] and it was far too high an altitude for a stray helium balloon to be seen with the naked eye, nor a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen and reported to NUFORC on previous occasions other objects I have seen and have always been open to other suggestions, but this time I was left with a very eerie feeling and it actually shook me up compared to any other objects I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The photos are timed an hour out as I have never changed the time on it when the clocks changed.<n>

I ran into the house and called my family out. As we watched it, it began morphing and changing shapes. We then agreed at this point  that it was not a bird. My Brother In Law ran to his car and got his binoculars out to try and get a better look. By the time we got it into sight it has risen up considerably and he mentioned that it  looked like 2 parachutes connected together but was still changing shapes. The only problem with that theory, is that this object, like I said was rising up (not down like a parachute) as it moved East. The thing that really struck me was that it was &#34;SO&#34; black in color, in a way, blacker than the color black truly is. I also want to note that my Brother in Law is with the Air Force and he estimated that the object was at 10,000 feet. Towards the end of the sighting as he continued to observe with the binoculars he said that the object split into 2 possibly 3 before it disappeared from sight. He is a cut and dry Military person and this event really shook him up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Ireland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier this morning myself and my two sons were gardening.  At 11:10 my eldest son aged 7 pointed at an aircraft and asked me what make of aircraft it was.  It looked like an Airbus A321.  He then asked why it was dragging a hot air balloon behind it.  I looked up agian and noticed a small black oval, possibly 20 meters long and 10-15 meters wide which I would estimate was 1000-1500 meters behind the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For almost a minute the black oval maintained speed a distance from the Airbus, but it finally &#39;peeled off&#39; at a speed of which I have never witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I myself am a former Royal Naval Engineer and was designated to HMS Invincible (1993-1999). During this period I witnessed many military aircraft travelling at speeds in excess of Mach 1.8, usually at military exercises. If I compare the speed of the black oval to military aircraft I have worked with before, I would say it was accelerated from tailing the Airbus (400+ mph) to Mach 3.5 in 1 second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As you can imagine, at this speed the oval quickly vanished from site in the direction of Banbridge, SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not wish you to contact me, but thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I have never seen anything like it.. It was almost clear. Like looking at a mirage or a jellyfish, but in a perfect ball.  It then sped up going East for a few miles then turned West and shot off  ..  It was not a balloon..  I saw another report  from Queen Creek Az..<n> <n><n> <n><n> 25 mins before this I did see a strange flat , black  helicopter going Northwest- Right where the orb shot off to..

It was only in one direction and one place, it wasn&#39;t the whole sky like when lighting strikes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend, while on the phone with me said, &#34;((deleted))&#34;, at the same time I did. He was looking out his bedroom window and saw a horizonal cigar shaped blue object appear and disappear within seconds. He said by the looks of it, it seemed to be about a few miles away, which would be adjectent to where I was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, upon sharing the story with other friends they too said that they saw the sky light up blue while driving about 12 miles from where I was driving at the time of the sighting. They also said the sky lit up bright blue and then went away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another friend living about 35 miles from where I was driving saw the sky light up too.  He also said it lasted only seconds and was just a part of the sky not the whole thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These sightings all happened at the same exact time during the night, at about 12:30 a.m. on Saturday Febuary 14th, 2009. We all were in agreement that it did not look like northern lights nor did it look like lighting of any kind that we had ever seen.<n>

It came up from out of a patch of woods across the road from me.  It was VERY bright, and was moving very quickly.  It shot straight up and then just dissapeared into the clear, night-time sky .This was the fifth time I have seen them in that area.  I have seen a gigantic one the size of my house over in the same area, but was landed, and had red &amp; blue lights, and was an oval shape.<n>

2/13/09 22:15|Harrodsburg|KY|Light|10 seconds|Green light lit up the entire sky and a small light moved horizontally before fading out|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68665.html|204|ndxe200902| Green light lit up the entire sky and a small light moved horizontally before fading out<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was riding with a close friend and co-worker from Louisville to Burnside, KY to spend the weekend at Lake Cumberland. Somewhere close to the midpoint of our trip the entire sky lit up with a teal green light (the EXACT location is somewhat of an estimate - I used the GPS on my Blackberry to mark the location on Google Maps but I guess I didn&#39;t save the location as a favorite and lost it). I don&#39;t know what I was thinking at the time, but I must have thought it was a shooting star or lighting or something along those lines because as soon as the light in the sky faded I leaned forward so I could look up. I scanned the sky fairly quickly left to right and right under the headliner (I&#39;m estimating 60 or 70 degrees up from the horizon) I saw a greenish light fading out. It appeared about the same size as an average star in the sky aside from its color. As soon as I spotted it, it was already fading out (I watched that particular spot in the sky for 2 or 3 seconds max).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I leaned back in my seat and I didn&#39;t say anything immediately until the driver said something along the lines of &#34;what the ____ was that?&#34; or &#34;did you see that?&#34;. He described the light in the sky nearly identically to how I did and after we talked about that for a moment I realized that it didn&#39;t just light up in one spot like a flare or shooting star, but it lit up the ENTIRE sky. We were riding in his Expedition so we had plenty of surface area on the windows around us, but I couldn&#39;t fathom what would have lit the sky up to the point where I saw it out peripherally as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I guess he leaned forward before I did or locked onto the object before I did (I don&#39;t know which one as I wasn&#39;t looking at him or paying any attention to his movements because I was completely focused on what was going on) but he saw the object moving horizontally across the sky before its light faded out. He said he leaned forward just enough to see it moving (from his perspective) about 2 inches under the point where the headliner and top of the windshield meet and it moved in a line almost completely parallel to this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was slightly overcast but I did notice that stars were fairly visible at that time. We were in the car another 90 minutes and I distinctly remember the sky being almost crystal clear when we got to the cabin at Lake Cumberland (we were fairly high in the hills there and had a great view). There weren&#39;t many cars on the road at the time (Highway 127) but I did notice a car that was about 300 yds up ahead tapped their brakes a couple of times as soon as the sky lit up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As were gazing I observed a star moving in random motion at a frantic pace. I just ask him to look at it just to check if it was am illusion or not. He too observed the same and also other 5 members of our family too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To our naked eye it was like a star shining with small red illumination and moving at a differential pace randomly within a constrained space, so we took a binocular and checked it around. On magnification what we saw, it was a white spherical mass revolving in its own axis and moving randomly, in the beginning it was moving at rapid pace in a random motion within a constrained area, when ever it came away from that constrained area it started to pull back again into its own circumference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As time progressed its pace took off and then it vanished just like that in no time.

Through the trees, a large white light slowly rose vertically from the ground.  It was probably rising from an open area or road on the other side of the trees, as opposed to being right in the woods.  We heard a faint engine sound.   It hesitated above the tree line and slowly headed over our house and mountain.  It was ascending at the same time.  Looking at it from underneath, it wasn’t a huge white light anymore.  It was oval with 2 sets of lights underneath, red and white.  There were fainter lights around the circumference, because we could see it was oval.  In 2001, when my daughter was 8, she saw another oval craft fly over our house.  It was more intricate with more lights and colors on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She, like us, was dumbfounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all stood transfixed as we watched the objects move silently across the sky.

It did not accelerate or change direction, but merely fell toward the ground and disappeared behind the mountainous/hilly landscape.  It was foggy outside and dark so the object was bright in the center and the color dissipated from the center (bright in center, fading on the outer edges).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t tell how far away the object was, but it was large to the eye and easy to see.  It appeared large enough that the object would have struck the earth&#39;s surface, and it was definitely enough to startle me.  It was moving very fast and did not leave a long trail/tail of fire like I would expect from a meteor, but I&#39;m no expert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object caught my eye while I was outside with a friend. I looked over and, as I saw it falling through the sky, I pointed and said something like &#34;((deleted)), look!&#34;  Unfortunately, my friend did not see it as it disappeared rather quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not convinced this was anything unnatural from a cosmic perspective, but it was certainly unusual and I would like to know what it was.

It appeared as a fuzzy blue luminous Orb, oval shaped for the most part…it was at approximately 30 to 40 degrees arc from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just kept watching it…it was slowly moving, but then stationary…I called for my Wife whom also came out and I said, what is that?  She looked for a moment and said, “looks like a cloud, why is it blue?”  I said, “why is it stationary and there were no other visible clouds in that region of Sky?”  She returned back in the house…seconds later, it began moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching it and it had like a burst of luminosity…lasting about 3 seconds or so…then slowly moved southeasterly…towards the Pittsburg PA region…stationary for five seconds, quit moving…then, vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now know the time I seen this luminous blue Orb cloud, at exactly at the time the Aircraft crashed in Buffalo NY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 110 degree s heading from my position IS directly lined up with Buffalo NY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I believe is that I seen a Weaponized Cloud that released an Energy Drain Beam at the area and that Aircraft that cashed and killed all on board, including Beverly Eckert of the 911 Truth investigations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also had a friend in that area, but in Ohio, located at 110 degrees from my position that commented she was very tired last night, all of a sudden…went to bed early!

It was 22:00 hours the sky way full of broken clouds. On our left was the moon it was three quarters full. I was just turning around from getting something from out of the back seat. I saw a light or should I say orb due to the type of light. travel out of the clouds on our right and disappear over the treeline. I garbed at my seat because I expected a impact. There was none. I next asked my wife if she saw it and she said yes. The light was different then anything else we saw that night in color, appearance, and size. I swear it was a light green (I want to say pistachio)in color. My wife is color blind and has a problem with green and red. She says she saw orange to red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Based on the description furnished by the witness, I believe what was observed was a flight of three C-130 aircraft from the Little Rock Air Force Base.  These aircraft fly directly over my home every night with out fail between 8 and 10 p.m..  The usual flight path is from the northeast to the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Along this flight path, the aircraft pass approximately 3-5 nautical miles west of Arkansas Nuclear One (the nuclear plant metioned in the report).

The time was around 9:40pm.  I saw what i thought was a low flying plane move gracefully over the tree line about 200 yards ahead of us.  I saw another set of lights less than a few hundred feet behind it.  They just glided (for lack of a better description ) over the interstate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t think much of it at first until the second set of triangle shaped lights came to a sudden stop on the tree line just to the right (south) of us on the freeway.  We pulled off to the shoulder, I flew out of the car, and it was gone.  Silent and instantly it disappeared, as my buddy and I watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I documented it on my map and wrote down where we were at, so when we stopped for the night we could see of there were any small airports nearby.  As it happens, nothing but a lake and a state forest in is that area of rural Arkansas.  It was about seven miles west of Russellville on I-40, a few miles from a nuclear power plant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects came from the north side of the road at approximately 9:40 pm.  The object I saw first was triangle shaped, with a solid white light at front and the lower right corner, and a solid greenish colored light on lower left.  It flew relatively slow and continued its path over the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second craft was similar, following extremely close behind and had solid white lights on all three corners.  It made a dead stop less than a a hundred feet off the shoulder of Interstate 40.  It hung there for what seemed like 30 seconds, maybe shorter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM #1 OF 2--FROM VISITOR TO THE NUFORC WEBSITE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport,  I would like to comment on a sighting dated 2/12/09 near Russellville, Arkansas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live very near to the described location of the reported sighting.

While  I was on the website, I decided to look at my old posting from Feb 12, 2009. A response was made and I believe the response to be wrong and demeaning to my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68848.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69646.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up my while life on Sugarbush Road, which runs parallel to the Selfridge Air Force Base runway, here in Chesterfield, MI.  I have seen nearly every type of military aircraft make its way over my house in one form or another.  The C130 has ALWAYS got my attention when they would fly over because they were very low and VERY loud.  They would fly so low you would think that they were skipping over the trees.  So I am VERY familiar with the C130 and how they look in the sky, be it day or night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That being said, these were NOT C130 aircraft that we saw.  They were MUCH larger than any aircraft I have ever seen.  Also, I have NEVER seen a C130 fly right on the tail of another C130.  It was so close it was like it was being towed by the other one in front.  Regarding how the &#34;it can look like it was hovering&#34; comment, I understand when he meant, but that is not what happened.  We were already coming to a very fast stop on the shoulder.  The van was pretty much at a stop already when we saw it/them hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think the response to my report is uninformed and based on what he &#34;thought&#34; we saw.  He did not see what we saw when we saw it.  We stand by our story!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM #2))<n>

My wife is an educational consultant with a private school system, possessing a Bachelor&#39;s Degree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have lived in our current area for just over 20 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked down our driveway after taking the garbage cans to the road late in the evening, I saw a very bright light in the western sky. The light was approximately 30 degrees above the horizon and appeared stationary. It caught my attention because of it&#39;s brightness, clearly much brighter and larger than any stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I initially thought it might be a passenger jet with landing lights on as we are on a glide path to the major airport to the east. After 5 - 10 minutes of observation it was clear it was not a plane. It did not change position in the sky, however the light appeared to fade and return periodically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 10 plus minutes of observing I went into the house and asked my wife to look at the object with me. It was cold and she did not wear a coat so her observation was limited to about 3 minutes. She confirmed it was not a star or a plane and that it appeared stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then picked up my binoculars and viewed the object with those. I was able to determine the object was round or oval, had multiple flood or spot lights emitting the light I saw, and appeared to have at least one red and one green light. The white lights were spread across the oval/round diameter of the object in such a manner as to appear to be &#34;wall to wall&#34;. As I watched with the binoculars, it appeared the object was turning in some way as the white lights would nearly disappear and then reappear. This occured approximately every 3 to 4 minutes. I never heard any sound associated with the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately my video cam was not serviceable. I watched the object for approximately 25 minutes in total, and during that time it never moved. I was then becoming cold, there was no apparent movement or action with the object so I came inside. I have not seen the object again since that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))<n>

I was trying to find if there’s any planets that can be seen now, or a satellite; I found out the ISS is located south of the US at this moment, almost opposite of where this light is now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus.

I was standing on my balcony looking up at the sky.  I was actually looking at Orion when an object much larger than a shooting star and moving slower than I had ever observed a shooting star streaked north to south across the sky.  Im outside a lot and live in a rule community with little light noise.  I have observed numerous shooting stars, comets, airplanes etc.  This was none of these things.  The object left a trail and moved three to four times faster than any high flying air craft I have ever seen.  It was white and somewhat translucent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watch the planes come and go out of San Diego almost every night and this extremely bright orb got my attention immediately. This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve seen something like this, but this was the closest one. It was extremely bright. So bright that I couldn&#39;t make out any detail and it looked kind of fuzzy with bright short streaks surrounding it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed it around 8pm or so, and watched it for over an hour come a bit closer, go out, move a bit up and down, horizontally, and in seemingly random directions. It would slowly go very dim, then extremely bright. This was in our atmosphere and not out in space. When a cloud would cover the UFO, the cloud appeared to be glowing from within, then the light would turn into a very dim pinpoint. When the fast moving cloud would move, it seemed the orb &#34;knew&#34; and would quickly turn bright again, just after the cloud had gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a military helicopter (and living in SD, I know what one sounds like) going toward the orb, then what sounded like a military fighter jet. The helicopter seemed to have turned its lights off when it got close the the orb, but I could still hear that it was there circling around. The jet seemed to have no lights on the entire time. I watched for as long as I could, but I was cold and went to my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would look at it once in a while to see if it was still there at it would have moved its position a little. Eventually it had disappeared. I did not see how it &#34;took off&#34; or if the light just went out. This orb was near the flight path of outgoing planes. I know they must have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))<n>

I looked up into the sky to the southwest and saw a strange looking light that I 1st thought was the moon until I could tell wasn&#39;t as the moon was located obove the patio roof more to the south. I could see the moons lumination on the ground.  As I watched the light I noticed that it was moving slowly towards the direction that I was in and was getting larger. Its shape was like a shollow plate on the bottom with an inverted upside down bowl on the top.  After about 5 minutes the object slowly changed it course so that it was moving to the North.  I don&#39;t know its size but I would have to guess tht it was a few hundred feet long and possibly 75 to 100 feet high.  As it was going to the North noticed that it had a small red light on the top and a small red light in the &#34;Tail&#34; end. (south end) The lights were not flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have worked at a large Naval Air Station for close to 30 years. This craft was not anything that I had ever seen before. It made no sound at all. It appeared to be lit up from the inside as a tube light.  It was not overly bright and I could hear some of the people in the neighborhood oustside saying things like &#34;look at that thing&#34; etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the craft started in its northerly direction, I went inside and told a couple of the people what I saw and we went out to the front yard to watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching for a while longer we went inside.  I watched the news that night and nothing was said about it.  The local San Dego paper the next morning had a small article about some some fiery objects in the sky the just previous night.  I did not report it then with my view as I figured it would probably be covered up some how anyway.  I just happened to be looking at this site on the internet for the 1st time and decided to see if the incident was reported here. It was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me repeat, only one large fat (in the middle) cigar shaped object was seen from our view.<n>

It was gray in color and did not move. I went to grab my phone to snap a picture of the craft. When I got my phone and looked back up it was still there. I drove under a sign that hangs over the interstate, once past this sign the object was gone. Never did see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was perfect. No clouds in the sky, bright sunny day.

I went to get my digital camera and started taking some photos of the chemtrails as well as an airplane that flew nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes, I noticed a small white dot in a slightly different area directly overhead where you could see blue sky.  I took two pictures of the dot.  At the time my only thought was that the dot seemed to be too high for an airplane.  The airplane I saw and photographed a few minutes earlier was nowhere near the white dot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dot made no sound, but it was moving slowly westward.  It seemed like it sort of faded into view, then I spotted it and took two photos, and then it sort of faded away.  My mom was with me at the time, but she assumed it could have been an airplane, but it seemed awfully high in the sky to her too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I uploaded the photos to my computer, all I thought I had was a white dot in the sky.  So I tried enlarging the image and it appears to be a structured object, vaguely cone-shaped, but it does not resemble any aircraft I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent the images to a friend of mine and he suggested contacting The UFO Center.  All I can add is that one of the photos is better than the other, and I will upload the better photo to The UFO Center.<n>

2/12/09 08:15|Irvine|CA|Diamond|5 minutes|3 diamond shaped light configurations in the northwest corner of the sky towards Newport Beach, CA|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68681.html|236|ndxe200902| I was walking out of my Irvine CA apartment, which is on the third floor, on my way to meet a friend for dinner around 8:15 pm.  I immediately noticed 3 diamond shaped light configurations in the northwest corner of the sky towards Newport Beach, CA.  I of course stopped and just stared.  They were moving very fluidly, counter clockwise and then clock wise, back forth with no apparent set pattern- like kites would do.  The lights were a very bright light blue. They would go completely off and them come back on.   I couldn&#39;t make out exactly what type of craft they were on.  I watched for about a minute and then two of them disappeared and just one remained.  I saw it go behind a cloud and then reappear...so they had to be at least at cloud level.  They were quite high in the sky because I was seeing them way over trees and building tops.  I knew immediately that what I was seeing just by the shear movement of them was not an airplane, helicopter or military craft.  I was already running quite late so I got in the car and headed to meet my friend, while I was driving I tried to hang my head out the window to see the remaining object.  I wound up right under it when I got to the intersection and could make out a faint outline of some sort of a craft that looked grayish.  I was a little worried at that point, realizing I was right under it.  Then the traffic light turned and it was above my car so I could no longer see it.  I called two friends and tried to get them to go outside and se if they could see it as well, but didn&#39;t reach them in time.  Southern California is a big place with a huge population and I&#39;m quite sure lots of other people had to see this as well.  The whole experience left me in awe and made me feel quite small….there’s a big “world” out there obviously and I doubt we here on earth are much more than a speck.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It passed over head and then it began changing shape at about a mile away. It had red lights that didn&#39;t blink in the middle of it and other lights where wings would be but in triangular distances from each other. As it changed shape, the red lights didn&#39;t move but the other light moved from their position from the sides to the direct top and bottom! Then it was very strange to look at for a number of seconds because it looked like an airplane flying on it&#39;s side at low speed and low altitude. Then, the lights began to turn off. I lost track of it as it passed away from me beyond the tree line. I traveled straight to the only airport in the area just in case it was a plane trying to make a hard turn back to the airport, but then there was no airbourne vehicle to be found heading to the airport or in the area for that matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cellphone began turning off by itself about a half an hour before until an hour  after I saw this UFO. It was at half battery life and not low at all.

My cousin and I were standing outside.  I was waiting to hear thunder and my cousin looked up a saw a distant red light that turned white and then it vanished.  He told me to look but I missed it.  He pointed out where he saw the light.  It was between the star Bellatrix, the west shoulder (on Orion), and the star (his hand) on the &#34;shield&#34;.  We realized that the flash couldn&#39;t have been lightning since there were no clouds in the sky nd no thunder was heard. It was a very bright but brief flash of white light from above.<n>

The yard faces to the West of Tucson. Directly on the other side of the backyard wall is a Dry Wash (desert area)  As I looked I observed an object with two red lights, one in the rear and one in the front. I could not tell what shape the object was. Suddenly the object appeared to “explode” It was a bright white flash that was so bright there were other colors produced by this apparent “explosion”, green, red, etc. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had disappeared.  This sighting was approximately 2 to 3 seconds. It was very fast, but long enough to see what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 10 minutes later, myself, husband, and daughter observed 2 very large Military helicopters flying in from the Northwest, flying Southeast. Since there are numerous bases in the area, including Davis Monthan to our South, the sightings of helicopters isn’t unusual. The helos were flying slow and very, very low, in fact I don’t recall ever seeing helicopters this low before and neither has my husband. Also, the flight corridor that they were utilizing is one I have never seen them use before. They flew directly over the area that I observed the object in, which was approx. 200 feet west of my back fence. May have been a coincidence, but then again it may not have.<n>

I told my friend this star could be for me. I told her i don&#39;t know if i should make a wish or what. Well we traveled to 86th and Hague Rd back to my house and then to the southside on the interstate. All this time this star is getting closer as we head south. We were about 1/4 mile from the Raymond exit when we noticed this star was moving toward the interstate. My friend was like is that a round thing, i said OMG what is that. There were other cars on the highway that night but i don&#39;t know how to find them to see if they saw the same thing. It dissappeared. Were looking out of the windows and was like where did it go. We then both kinda looked out the whinshield window and it was just hoovering over us with no sound. we saw a rediculous amount of lights. We were so scared, we had never seen anything like this before. I just want to know what they are or were. No one believes us, i feel so crazy right now. Can anyone let me know if they saw the same thing or was my mind playing tricks on me. We saw quite a few of them that night the whole thing had to last for about 2 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours. we sat over a relitives house on the southside for about 2 hours and came back to my house on the eastside and saw another one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As the storms were moving out of my local area, I noticed some mammatous clouds, and went out to the entrance to our garage at about 5:45 pm,  to take some photos of them.  The garage faces a little south of due west.  I was using a Nikon D80 with a zoom lens, Nikon model DX AFS Nikkor 18-135 mm 1:3.5-5.6G ED, with no filters.  The clouds were coming straight towards the open garage, and there was a very light rain falling, so I was standing slightly inside the garage to minimize water drops on my lens.  After taking some photos to the west, I stepped out of the garage and looked back to the east, where there was a faint rainbow, which I also photographed, along with some tall clouds to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed nothing unusual during the photo shoot, but when I went inside, downloaded the pictures to my computer and looked at them full-screen, the cylindrical object was evident in a picture taken facing due west.  At first, I thought the object had been blown into the air by the strong winds, and only made jokes about its possibly being a UFO.  I didn&#39;t remember ever having seen images of cylindrical UFOs.  But after about a week, I got curious, and found numerous web sites with images of cylindrical UFOs, which is what I now believe the object in the photos was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a second photo that showed probably the same object, less clearly.  It was taken from the same position as the first, but facing southwest.  The second photo was taken less than 2 minutes, but longer than 5 seconds after the first.  The first photo was taken at 1/180 of a second, the second at 1/100 of a second.  In the second image, the object appeared to be somewhat larger, but the lens was zoomed in slightly compared to the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not aware of any other potential observers of this object.  I saw no objects first hand, only after displaying the photos on my computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 65 year old, retired PhD physicist, having worked as a research physicist for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health from 1975 to 2003, and then as a US government contractor until 2006.  I am active in community instrumental music groups and in amateur photography.  I have never before seen a UFO, to my knowledge, certainly not an unlighted cylindrical one.<n>

I told my son to look at it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like a round ball of pure white light.  It was moving from right to left at probably the speed of a normal passenger jet. It then stopped still and remained stationary for about 30 seconds.  It then moved off again in the same direction and passed a cloud (there was only 1 or 2 clouds in the sky). The cloud was very white but the object could be easily seen as it flew in front of it as it was a pure white colour. It passed the cloud then stopped again and flew up very fast in a semicircular movement from left to right, stopped again in roughly the original position that i first noticed it and stopped again for about 30 seconds or so before moving from right to left again before stopping.  About another 30 seconds passed and then the object did what no aircraft could do.  It suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed upwards and we watched it untill it disappeared from view.<n>

I noticed the apparent reflection of sunlight off an object in the air Southwest of our position, traveling in a Northerly direction, at what appeared to be roughly the same altitude and speed as commercial airliners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called it to my sister&#39;s attention because the reflection was much, much brighter than I had ever seen from an aircraft at that altitude and it left no contrail as other aircraft were doing that day.  My sister said &#34;Wow, that looks like it&#39;s vertical.&#34; (i.e., oriented perpendicular to the Earth&#39;s surface, rather than parallel, as an airliner is.)  We watched it for 15-20 seconds, during which time it traveled about the length of my index finger (held at arm&#39;s length, maybe 8-10 degrees of arc), then just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What made this sighting unusual was that after the reflection disappeared there was a brilliant flash of light further along the approximate track of the object.  This flash occurred maybe a half-second after the reflection first disappeared, but the gap between disappearance and flash was about  the same distance as the object had traveled during the initial (continuous) observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, during the gap between disappearance and flash, (using the formula Distance/Time=Distance per UnitofTime) the object seems to have accelerated to somewhere around 400% of it&#39;s initial speed in less than a second.<n>

I wrote it all down and have gone over it and i can still see it fresh in my mind.Ok here it goes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feb.11th, 2009, 5:40 am FTCKY.It was a very very windy morning at least 40 + knots and gusting.  It was a typical morning drive to work about 58 miles oneway.  On the last part of my drive 3.5 miles from state hwy.SR 79 i turn on Gate 10 road north,which takes me to my hanger at Sabre helicopter airfield.I am an A&amp;P aircraft technician.I work on U.S. Army helicopters, and N.G. helicopters, we modify them so they can go to the Middle East conflict.  I have been doing this for about 30 yrs.  Ok while i was driving on the back gate road i saw this very bright ball of light on my left or west of the road.  This light was just coming up from the trees near a road called Oriental Village.  On that road back is a area that has a urban town for the army to train in.It just hung there.....I thought it might be a helicopter with it,s landing light on....But no it was way to bright....plus there was a weather warning out because of the high winds.  So nothing should be flying.  What happend next convince me that this was not a conventional type of Aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball of light started to move towards the high right NorthWest,as it did i could see the very fast moving clouds by its very bright light, and as it ascended into the clouds they filtered out the brightness and i could see the shape of the object....it was a perfect white ball and i watched it as it slowly faded out of sight.  This whole ordeal lasted for about 2 minutes....my truck said 5:42 am.I was about a 1/4 mile from this object and made no sound just the wind beating on my truck.  I wonder if Ft. Campbell tower pick this up on radar.  Since no other aircraft would be flying.   I can not get this image out of my mind.What do i do next.....still shaking.  Thank you for what you do.<n>

To the right of me, a neon green oval shaped object appeared out of nowhere and moved very quickly towards the earth at a right angle. The shape of the craft was similar to the photo from the battle of Los Angeles incident. The whole event lasted about two seconds, and even thought the object was moving at an amazing speed, I could make out the shape very clearly. There was no trail behind the object. What struck me most was the clarity and color of the object. When I got home and looked at a map, I calculated that the object was headed towards the ocean near Topanga Canyon Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My three teenage and preteen children and I turned into the driveway and had stopped at the mailbox to get the mail when we saw some extremely bright lights at the far end of the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of the car and noticed it was moving slowly in a circular path.  It was triangular in shape, with 3 bright white lights at each corner.  The edges of the craft glowed with a dull silvery light.  It reminded me of the neon lights you see under cars.  In the center was an extremely large red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It began to move slowly across the field and over the far end of my driveway.  I grabbed my phone and quickly took a picture with it as it passed over the woods on the other side of the driveway.  After about 45 seconds from when we first saw it and about 5-10 seconds after I took the picture it disappeared.  It did not shoot off, or leave any trails of light because of moving quickly, and did not go behind any hills or trees (there was nothing to obstruct the view).  It simple just disappeared.  My two oldest could verify the exact experience to my husband when we got to our house, so I know what we saw.  Hopefully, once I download my picture to my computer I will be able to zoom in and have it enhanced to better make out the objects shape.  Right now, the picture looks like a massively bright glowing object and you can see some metal at the edges of the light.<n>

February 2009<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was travelling along the M25 motorway Eastbound towards the South Mimms service station when my daughter (20 years old) noticed 4 bright white lights forming a square in the sky, some 1000 to 1500 feet off the ground, to the front right hand side of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She pointed them out and as I looked at them the top right hand light moved off slowly to the right from the formation, then shot away to the right hand side at an incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the bottom two lights held position the remaining top light moved over, to form a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then noticed that there were a number of tiny red and white flickering lights around the three main lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lost sight of the lights as we came off and drove under the South Mimms intersection (M25 / A1) and turned onto the Barnet road, as we turned onto the road the lights could still be seen from this lower position (the motorway is on a raised embankment) forward of the car to our left hand side over the M25 motorway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We knew it was not a plane as aircraft are &#39;stacked&#39; in this area prior to landing at Heathrow airport and could be seen in relation to this formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then lost sight of them behind roadside trees, when we next came into a clear line of sight, they were no longer to be seen anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were noted in night time conditions (sunset was approx. 17:15) the weather was clear and cloudless, there was no wind, numerous aircraft could be seen throughout the sky (this is usual in this area of Hertfordshire as we have been driving in this area for over 20 years).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no red / green - wing or fuselage - navigation lights, no landing lights, no wing strobes??  They seemed to be either static or moving very slowly, with the exception of the light that left the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the motorway was very busy (Midweek North London Rush Hour) we assume others observed this cluster of lights and we would be interested to discover what caused them.<n>

That day there was a snow storm and visibility was fairly bad.  The UFO hovered over my house and then stopped as I got a full look at it and then it took off east/south/east so fast that it was literally gone in the blink of an eye.  The craft was circular and seemed to made of a ailver/gray colored metal.  To be honest, it looked like an older craft. Like a UFO you would see in a science fiction move from the 50&#39;s or 60&#39;s.<n>

Upon reflection, I recall having seen the same thing in the fall of 2008 while standing in my front yard and I recall thinking that it was odd that it disappeared so quickly and actually decided that it was just a reflection of some kind.<n>

While co-piloting a 1959 B-95 Beechcraft &#34;Travel Air&#34; between Mesa falcon field (KFFZ) and St. George Utah (KSGU) I witnessed along with two others a spherical craft within approximately one statute mile of our position.  While making a course correction turn over the &#34;drake&#34; VOR at 150 knots 8500ft climbing to 10,500 approx heading 330 degrees(Prescott, AZ, according to GPS right after the event our exact posistion was 17 miles due east from the Prescott airport.)  I was visually scanning the sky for other air traffic prior and during a left turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking upward (off the starboard wing as it banked upward) the object in question came into veiw. It was a silver lenticular disk, I was the first witness to spot the object.  The passenger seated directly behind me was the second.  I asked the passenger to look up while still in the turn and to simply tell me what they saw.  The witness stated &#34;Oh my god... It&#39;s a flying saucer!&#34; (or somthing to that ! effect) By this time I had turned passed my intended heading.  I made a corrective turn passed the course in the opposite direction so I could see it again in another left hand turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We reaquired the target and attempted to photograph the object with a cell phone camera, without success.  It is difficult to judge it&#39;s exact size, however if it was anything close to a convetional aircraft in size it was within 1 to 2 miles almost directly above our aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued our zig zag turns (in order to maintain a visual contact) on or about or third turn cycle the object began to climb in a spiralling arc through a broken cloud layer that was at about 12,500 plus feet at a very high rate (I estimated 500 to 700 knots possibly supersonic, I based this on my experience as a pilot and witnessing many supersonic fighter aircraft)  No condensation trail, and no visable exhaust trail and was out of visual range in under 8 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rest of the flight was uneventful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Not having my glasses on at the time, my first thought was that the moon was still out and was really bright.  I put my glasses on and immediately recognized that it was not the moon, but very similar to a very bright star exceptionally far away.  I then just layed there observing this &#34;star&#34;.  Upon observation of approx. a few minutes, it appeared that this &#34;star&#34; was in fact moving in a back and forth movement, to the right and then left.  Being that I observed this through a rectangular skylight, I did have borders from which I could tell that this object was in fact moving.  At that point I called to my wife and asked her to look at this.  As she looked at it, I asked her if she could see it moving.  She said that she could, and at that I said I thought it was a UFO.  She responded &#34;coming to get you&#34;?  She then went back to getting ready for work and I continued to watch, even having to reposition myself as this object had gotten to far to the right border of the skylight.  After a few moments passed, I then noticed this light start to diminish.  I assumed cloud coverage as it seemed to come in and out of light.  It then disappeared.  To me it appeared that this object went up as opposed to going any other direction.  I continued to watch for approx. 15 minutes longer to make sure that cloud coverage wasn&#39;t hiding this light.  My honest opinion is that this light was far to high in the sky to be a helicopter.  I thought of trying to contact the Onondaga Co. Sheriffs&#39; Dept. to inquire if they in fact had their chopper in what would have been the southwestern sky, but I didn&#39;t want to lose sight of it by going to the phone.  Also, I took note that there was not on other star in the sky.  I am sending this message out in the hopes that maybe someone could look into this, or that maybe another report was made about the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was laying in bed, looking out the eighth story window of my dorm. It was a completely clear night, with no stars or clouds in the sky. I noticed a bright disk of light. Though very far away, I knew that it could not be a plane because it did not move, initially, it just hovered for ten to fifteen minutes. The object also flashed different colors, in no specific pattern or sequence, and the colors appeared to be green and red. This object seemed to be accompanied by another object, but this second object was smaller than the first, and was not as bright either. Its color stayed the same green the entire time, and did not flash sporadically like the first. Both objects were in perfect alignment the entire time, hovering, when they both began to gain altitude at a slow rate. I am currently still looking at them now, and they are hovering at the same higher altitude as they were ten minutes ago. Another reason that these objects could not have been aircraft was because two very obviously airplanes passed by the objects, at a lower altitude and had a blinking white light, that blinked at a regular pace, like all airplanes flying at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college student, who is rather interested in this subject matter.  After watching numerous shows and reading numerous accounts, I would consider myself somewhat knowledgable on the subject.  What I saw tonight was not normal, and resembled other accounts and videos that I have previously seen. I was not able to take a picture or video of the account, and even if possible, the objects would not appear clearly because of the distance. As much as I would like to believe that what I saw was merely a star or aircraft, it did not resemble either. The irregularity of the blinking of the lights, and the rapid change of color from green to red and back, seemed very paranormal. Though I do not have hard evidence supporting this claim, I hope it will be taken seriously and maybe even confirmed by another resident of Farmville, Virginia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

The object completely bisected the moon horizontally at midpoint making the moon appear split. The object appeared in the vicinity of the moon and would have to have been about 3500 kilometers long by 100 kilometers high. The object remained in the same trajectory as it appeared to move downward against our view of the moon and parallel to it. As it moved down from the face of the moon, the object was no longer visible.

From our vantage point in Franklin, I assume the lights were directly over Milwaukee, Wisconsin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One light was leading the other as they slowly moved towards the NE and out over Lake Michigan.  Both UFO&#39;s remained an equal distance apart from one another and at a consistent speed.  Both UFO&#39;s began fading equally until they disappeared similar to a visible satellite when passing over a brightly lit city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No flashing or changing of color of the UFO&#39;s was noticed in the duration of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the episode, I searched websites to verify that the UFO&#39;s were indeed visible satellites. No reported matches were found.<n>

2/8/09 14:30|Erin|WI|Egg|3 min|I saw 9 egg shaped orbs in the sky, which than dissapeared and moments later three military jets flew by|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68525.html|285|ndxe200902| I saw 9 egg shaped orbs in the sky, which than dissapeared and moments later three military jets flew by<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday February 8th 2009, at approximately 14:30pm in the afternoon, in the town of Erin, (Washington County) WI which is about forty miles northwest of Milwaukee, WI.  I was outside alone enjoying the warm weather. The sun was shining brightly and there were no clouds in the sky.   I was looking up at the sky in a northeast direction with my back to the sun.  I saw what looked like a flock of white birds flying in an oblong circular formation around one single bird. As this is nothing strange to see in the country, I started to notice that the &#34;birds&#34; had no wings. Also, they were flying much too high to actually be birds. After closer inspection, they now appeared to be silvery white egg-shaped orbs. This realization happened within the first ten seconds of seeing them.  As I looked closer, I could tell that the central &#34;bird&#34; was much shinier than the others. Then they broke their formation and started to dart out in all directions, flying around in circles on their own. Each craft circled and stayed relatively within its own zone. This happened about 40-50 seconds after I had begun watching them.  At this point, I counted nine of them, including the shinier central one.   Then they began to move in a different series of maneuvers. They began to spread out more; flying closer back to the center and then farther out again. Then, in another change of maneuvers, they started to scramble all over the sky.  At about 90 seconds into my sighting, they started flying in what seemed to be straight lines jetting out from one another and making very abrupt and sharp turns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I started to think I should run and get my camera, but I had become so amazed by what I was seeing that I could not tear myself away. I quickly turned in a circle to view 360 degrees of the sky around me in case there were more of them. I then quickly turned back and started to watch the crafts. They started looking farther and farther away from me.  This was about two minutes into my sighting. At which point, the one that was farthest to the left disappeared.  Then, about five seconds later, the one farthest to the right disappeared as well. This now left seven egg shaped orbs to remain, still looking very white and silvery gray.  Then the orb that was closest to the bottom of their dissassembling  formation disappeared. Then the two that had been above the center one disappeared.  While the last four orbs remained, three of them made a formation in the shape of a pyramid, or triangle with the point on top surrounding the shiniest one in the center. Suddenly, all three orbs in the triangle formation disappeared. The only one left, the one that seemed to have a metallic almost aluminum shine to it, darted left, then right, then down, then up, then back to the center point. Suddenly it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stood still staring up at the sky, I then started to realize that I had seen something very out of the ordinary, and that I might have just witnessed a UFO sighting. At that point, roughly two minutes after the last orb disappeared, three grey military jets, coming from the west, flew by in a spread out formation all flying in the same direction and at the same altitude where I had seen the orbs.  The middle jet flew right into what could be considered the center of the orbs’ flight pattern. The jets also appeared to slow down a bit once they got to the exact area the orbs had been. Once the jets flew by and I could see where they were in the sky, I gauged that their altitude must have been somewhere between six and ten thousand feet.  It is also important to note that all three military jets were letting off huge chem trails. After a few minutes the sky filled with long, thin and spreading clouds. I saw birds were now in the sky and I could tell that the wind was again blowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is not strange to see any airplanes fly by at a very high altitude, or see one of the many small ultralites or hobby planes flying at a low altitude. After living in this area for the last 20+ years, I have witnessed many varied aircraft on their way to and from the Oshkosh EAA annual Fly-In as well as normal air traffic. The only times I have seen low flying military jets in this area is when they are on their way to the EAA annual Fly-In or some other public event.<n>

I felt a inclination to look up.  As I did I saw a bright reflective silvery cylindrical object (more of a line than two-dimensional) in the sky swiftly moving from West to East overhead in the clear sky.  About the width of my index fingernail at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It immediately morphed into a violent rapidly changing highly reflective shape as if it were a flat mirror randomly twisting about on three a axis gimbal.  Not a bird, not a party balloon.  The motion was violent.  No rhythmic pattern.  I expected it to move over the Giant Food store parking lot where I could see its silhouette, but instead it faded into the high altitude water vapor in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was much higher in altitude than I estimated, and much larger.  My first thought it was about 60 feet up, but after seeing it fade away so rapidly, I estimate it to be at least a few hundred feet long, at least 30,000 feet up.  It appeared to be traveling at several thousand miles per hour.  No noise.  No vapor trail. No wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 54, seen a lot in the sky I have been able to explain.  Not this.<n>

Looking up at it, it was silver/white in color and silent.   I am not sure how high it could have been, only that I figure to measure about 1 half inch in width across  the sky.  It moved in a very straight line from east to west.  By the time I could get my wife to see what I was seeing, it was already gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that makes this so unusual to me is the fact it made no noise.  If it was high enough to be  inaudible to the human hear I figure I would have seen a contrail from its engine or engines.  However there was none.  Also, this object was triangular and resembled nothing like an ordinary airplane I am very used to seeing in the skies flying over the mid-west region.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were driving down a paved road traveling toward the airport in my town. I think it was a little after 10 PM because it was dark out. As I was driving West I had to make a right. If I had turned left, this would have led me right to the front of the airport. As we took a right we traveled down another road going in a north east direction. On the right of my car was the city, the other left side was woods. As I was driving I look up,over, and to the left. Just above the tree line 30 feet feet from the road was a triangle black object. This had three lights on the bottom. When I seen this I was like &#34;Oh my god dude a UFO!&#34; my friend looked up and cursed from disbelief. I pulled the car over on the shoulder and shut it off, we both got out. The object was stationary in the air and made only a faint &#34;windy&#34; sound. I observed a regular light that was on in the cockpit. There was a guy with a helmet on reading a book or manual of some kind. (It looked to me like he was trying to figure something out about the craft)  It was driven by a human for sure, but the craft was strange. Also there is a fighter pilot station at the airport less than three blocks from where we seen this object. The craft was kind of small to, it moved as slow as a helicopter and flew out of our sight slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a hoaxed report here.  PD))<n>

They seemed to be spaced at equal distances from each other, and glowed with a redish glow.  A few people managed to take photos and video on their telephones as they went over.  Once they had moved away a short space they then seemed to rise and disappear.  Although my daughter took pictures on her phone, we are unable to dowload them onto the computer as it is too old to take modern technology.<n>

They looked just like the red lights seen in news on January 5th 2009 in the same area. I grabbed my camcorder but the lights passed behind trees. The lights were traveling very fast. I ran downstairs to capture on video but they changed direction eastwards in the direction of New York City. They stayed close together in a triangle shape and gained altitude fast. Some clouds were above them and they disappeared into the clouds. Overhead it was still clear with moon and stars. The lights did not flicker or move around, they were steady lights. There was no smoke or any trail.<n>

They were travelling in the opposite direction to us, towards Norwich.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Travelling further along the road, we noticed another pair of lights, so stopped and turned round to get a better look. We parked and watched as a succession of approximately five further pairs of lights appeared.  They were travelling at a relatively low altitude, but when we got out of the car to listen, we could hear no sound from the objects at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not see any red/white/blue navigation lights on any of the objects.<n>
2/7/09 19:30|Belmar and Wall Twp.|NJ|Formation|40-45 minutes|Four silent soft white orbs in clover formation over the Belmar Inlet and Camp Evans for about 40 minutes.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68905.html|294|ndxe200902| Four silent soft white orbs in clover formation over the Belmar Inlet and Camp Evans for about 40 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Saturday, February 7. I was out to dinner with my parents and children in Belmar, New Jersey. We were leaving a restaurant, and getting in the car. We were parked just next to the inlet, where Belmar borders Avon-by-the Sea. It was about 7:30 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right over the water, in the softly clouded evening sky, were four “fuzzy” edged looking white lights in formation about 15-30 feet across from each other, making a large box or diamond shape. They appeared to be about 300-500 feet up – not very far away from the bridge watchman’s tower.  They were faint, but you could see them.  They were silently moving in pattern, almost like a clover, but not continuously in a circular rhythm. Sometime they would stop still, staying an even amount of space apart, in their symmetry. Sometimes, two of them would cross, or come together, then quickly dart back to an exact perimeter but never leaving the initial “box&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unlike event/publicity floodlights, there was NO beam of light coming up from the ground, making a visible line up to the sky. I tried to take pictures with my camera phone, but I am not sure if anything has come out – the globes were so faint against the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents and children saw them as well. The children were actually scared.  We stood out in the parking lot while I took several photos. We got in the car and drove westward. The lights seemed to follow us. I could see them hovering now over Shark River, but they seemed to be higher up, and larger at this point. As we curved south along Route 35, and made a right on Belmar Boulevard, they stayed over Shark River. I saw them until about Camp Evans then they were out of sight as I moved westward to my parents home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove back to Bradley Beach 2o minutes later the time now 20:00 hrs., and the lights were still there along the same route over the Marconi  area of Shark River. They were even more faint though. By the time I got further north towards Bradley Beach, and away from Shark River – they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was floored, when for a second time in my life, I saw this formation of lights swirling in a clover/cross pattern – AGAIN!  I saw the very same formation(s) about five years ago over Morris County, along with my husband and neighbors. This current, 2009 formation was one set of four lights, whereas the other sighting contained four sets of the same &#34;4-OrB Clover&#34; pattern grouping of lights stretched over many miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then they would go into a triangle shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house to get a friend and we both stood and watched them for about 5 minutes.  Every few seconds the black dots would make the triangle shape again.  They looked like they were very far away.  Not sure how far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to finally fade into the sky and you could no longer see them.<n>

On February 7, 2009, I was on ramp #1 of SDF airport watching the sunrise from my vehicle. It was around 7:40 in the morning. As the sun rose above the horizon, it quickly ascended into the blanket of clouds reaching beyond me. I proceeded to drive away, then I remembered I needed to go pick up some paperwork. I immediately turned back around and drove past where I was parked. After I drove for quarter of mile I was facing the security entrance which faces the southeast. As I was driving, I something caught my eye just above the security entrance below the blanket of clouds. I said to myself &#34;I have never seen a cloud that round before&#34;. The round object stayed there for five to ten seconds and then it went up into the blanket of clouds. I saw a shadow of the object moving erratically lasting for approximately 10 seconds. The shadow then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The conditions of the day were mostly cloudy. The ceiling was 3100 feet, winds were 18 mph from the Southwest and wind gust 26 mph.

After driving one friend home, it was still in the sky, looking closer than before.  After driving another friend home, it appeared to be moving away.  On the drive home, it was still there.

As we pulled into the driveway it was south over the house and was over as we pulled in. I went back to the same place as we pulled in and it had moved to a stationary point behind us and is still there(so it was or had moved).

Like a star only flying about 20 or 30 feet over our heads.  I was with my wife and just parked my car by North Hudson (Braddock Park).  As we were walking to our apartment we both saw this small light over our heads hovering and then zipped away like a shooting star.  Only it was too low and was impossible that it could be a star.  We bothed looked at eachother, and were like, &#34;did you just see that?&#34;  We debated on what it could have been.  I began to explain that I had seen something similar two times before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time I saw something similar was in my a car with my friend.  It was about 1997 or 1998. We we going down 48th street in Weehawken, NJ on Blvd East that leads to River Rd. We both saw a green light same hight above, (20 or 30 ft), only the ligh was green.  The light looked like those firecrackers that shoot up and pop but this hovered and then zipped away exactly like it did with my wife and made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it again in about May or June, 2008 riding bike with the same friend by the Palisades up by Edgewater, NJ. We had stopped to look at the N.Y. City skyline after riding up the long hill and both saw the green light hover and zip away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never thought of reporting it because everyone takes these reports as a hoax.  I decided to report it after someone mentioned to me that there have been hundreds of reports in this area especially right by my house in North Hudson Braddock Park.  I have always known it to be 80th street park.<n>

My father was driving and I was in the passenger’s seat.  In the back seat of the Truck was my mom and my three Kids age 10, 4, and 2.  I was looking at a radio tower that was blinking off in the distance.  When all of a sudden 3 amber colored lights came on in a horizontal row.  I asked my Dad what the hell it was, to which he said” it’s the UFO.  He pulled the truck to the side of the road.  By this time there were 6 amber lights all in row.  With an additional 3 down to the left side below the 6 original lights.  The light appeared to move and change quickly.  My father stepped out of the truck to see if he could hear anything and it was silent.  And then they were gone.  I would say these light where unlike anything I have ever seen.  I posted what happened that night on my face book page.  A friend of mine blogged back that she had gotten a text message from a friend at 7:40 pm say she had seen what she described was what my family and I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had 3 white circular lights in the shape of a wide obtuse triangle.  There was just enough light out to see that it was one object and it was very large.  It was bigger than any airplane.  It was hovering over a developing subdivision.  I continued to watch it as I turned left onto Christopher rd. until it was in my blind spot and I could no longer look behind me to see it.  I returned from my delivery off of  Christopher ( I deliver pizza for extra money while I’m in school.) and it was gone.  I looked around looking for something that I might have confused it with and there was just nothing.  I returned later on coming from the same direction to see if there was anything that could’ve deceived my eyes and there just wasn’t.  There was just sky and space.  My sister went to a party the following night and she said there was a boy there who exclaimed, “Oh my god you guys you’re not going to believe what I seen last night!”  He said that he was on Butler Hill rd. about 5 miles away or so from where I seen it.  He said it was moving real slow and he described the triangle form to the lights just like I did except that the lights were pulsating very slowly.  He seen it some time close to 8 o’clock after I seen it.  I don’t know this guy, I’ve never met him, and my sister only let him know that I had seen it after he told his story, so there is know possible way of him knowing anything about what I had saw that same night.  I hope this is the right place to report this type of thing, and I hope I hear from someone because I need some closure for this.  It was nothing short of an eye opening, earth shattering sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The time was between 9:45pm and 10:00pm.  We live in a very rural, country setting.  I happened to look towards the West and noticed a very distinct, bright, orange/red light hovering in the sky, just above a mountain ridge.  We live in the Texas Hill Country between Austin and San Antonio.  I knew it wasn&#39;t a star, too big, not the right color and too low in the sky.  I knew it wasn&#39;t a plane, planes don&#39;t hover like this.  I knew it wasn&#39;t a helicopter, they don&#39;t hover for that length of time.  A few planes did fly in the vicinity of this object during the 15 minutes I stood and observed this thing.  Surely, the pilots of these planes saw what I saw.  The distance between this object and myself was approximatelty 2-3 miles.  My dogs became very impatient with me just standing there and staring at this thing.  I know I stood there at least 15 minutes.  I kept thinking - &#34;If I can see this, can they see me?&#34;  I was so scared as I had my left my 10 year old son alone in the house and my husband was out of town.  I kept thinking, I can&#39;t be &#39;snatched up&#39; as there won&#39;t be anyone to take care of our son.  Finally, this very bright orange/red light slowly sank below the ridge to where I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  When my husband returned the next night, Friday night, I finally was able to get him outside and walked him down the street to where I was when I saw this thing and told him the whole story.  I was and still am so scared about what I saw.  It was NOT normal.  Thanks for letting me share.  I haven&#39;t known where to go with this information and finally heard on a late night radio talk show with George Norie about this website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??

It was late (approx. 11:30 PM) on a dark two lane road (SR 520 East) with no street lights and almost no other cars on the road. It was a cold and extremely clear sky, with no clouds and lots of stars. At first, I noticed a small looking &#34;star&#34; object in the sky that split in two and then the two objects were ejected in oposite directions (similar looking to a fireworks display). Then a few minutes later, I noticed a small blue colored spec (&#34;star&#34;) in the sky that suddenly got larger and brighter and continued to do so until I began to wonder if this larger (now white looking object) was going to actually land. But just as soon as that thought entered my mind, it shrank into it&#39;s original small blue spec size and color. I thought it was strange but ignored it until it happened again, then I began to really wonder what was going on up there! The show in the sky ended when I entered I-95, where there were more cars and street lights, etc. And when I arrived home, I rushed in my house, grateful I had made it home safe. P.S. sorry, no photos!<n>

There also was a white trail following after it. The trail was sparkley like diamonds that began to fall and fade out of the sky. The object remained in the sky for about 30 seconds.The craft seemed to move slowly in a slow  clock-wise fashion in a straight line from South to North and then suddenly took off with unbeleiveable speed before it disappeared. The white trail remained for one minute or so after the UFO was out of sight. This is diffeent than the one I saw before. It made my windows vibrate with the low humming sound that came from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to take a picture of it with my picture phone but the phone was saying &#34;Error&#34; Every time I tried to take a picture, and I had enough space avalible!<n>

I thought it was just bright stars at first but when I watched them closely, I noticed they where moving closer and closer slowly. So I sat there and watched them until all of a sudden 1 disappears.  A few minutes later another one disappears.  And finally as the last one got close enough, I could see 2 small lights spinning around the big one.  But as soon as I saw that it kind of faded away very fast and shot off in the opposite direction as it faded and disappeared.  I didn’t know what to think because it was the first time I ever saw anything like that.<n>

She noticed a huge bright light in the sky towrds Mcallen Texas to the west. She told me to go outside to see it.  I was in Weslaco, Texas about 7 miles away. I noticed it and took out my binoculars to observe it.  I saw  a bright white light with small red dot in the middle. Light was stationary for about 15-20 minutes. I called my mom who lives five miles away to the west. She also saw the same thing.  My son also saw it earlier about 10 minutes before I did.  My friend called me later and told me she observed the light from her home with binoculars very clearly. She said she saw a bright light with yellowish lights in the middle and some kind of mist/smoke coming out from it. I must say the light was about 15-=20 miles away from us.  After observing it for 15-20 minutes,the light slowly moved towards the west.  I lost sight of it due to trees etc.  I have never seen anthing like it before. Not even the others who saw it.  I wonder if anybody else saw this light.  I called our local tv station and they said nobody had reported anything.  A plane ? monrning star ? I don&#39;t know. Anyone out there saw this light ?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Venus?  PD))<n>

It really startled me because it didn&#39;t look like it could be more then 1,000 feet high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking directly at it the size might have been the size of 2 basketballs put together.  I used my neighbors roof peak to give the fall a direction.  If the peak of their roof was 12 o&#39;clock the fireball fell to 3:30 in 10-15 seconds.  I ran from the porch to the sidewalk.  Just when I thought it was going to crash into the houses about 1/2 block north of where I was standing it went poof and was gone.  By poof I mean that it got dim and just disappeared.  It didn’t shatter or fall apart, it just got dim and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireball itself was a bright white and the flames around the outside were neon lime green closest to the circumference then neon yellow and finally a very bright orange.  (The orange wasn&#39;t as intense as the other colors.)   I have never seen anything burn with those colors, as you are familiar with flame at the orifice of a gas burner it is the hottest at the very brightest blue, the gets cooler as you move away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the San Diego newspaper the Union Tribune for 2 days and there was nothing mentioned about what I saw.<n>

I noticed a plane with 3 lights in the shape of a triangle, something about it intrigued me and I could not stop looking at it. As I was driving I noticed the plane was not moving and coming towards me as it should have been. So, I keep my eye on the plane and when I got to Heritage Elementary I saw that the plane was hoovering over the school about 5 to 10 feet above tree line. I could not understand how a plane could do this with out falling out of the sky. I noticed it was a gray military plane with no markings on it. I was so weirded out by this I literally had my head over the steering wheel looking at the plane and was wondering if I was the only person that saw this plane hoovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After leaving the vet I was not thinking about it and drove right past the school and then I thought to myself I wonder if the plane is still there after seeing a smaller plane flying in front of me. As I looked in my rear view mirror I saw that the plane was now flying and going south down County Line Rd. towards the airport. I keep watching the plane the whole time and felt like it was following me, it stayed 15 feet behind me the whole way. As I turned East on Palmer Rd. I thought the plane would fly over me, but no it proceeded to go down Palmer Rd. with me and the weird part is the plane did not turn left like I did, it stayed facing South but flew side ways down Palmer. At this point I was terrified and thought my mind had to be playing tricks on me. I speed up and after passing the Palmer park I came into the group of trees and the plane seemed to have stopped, almost like it couldn&#39;t see me anymore. At this point I slammed on my breaks next to the Madison Water Dept. and watched the plane. It proceeded to start flying &#34;normal&#34; and going South towards the airport. I keep my eye on the plane as I drove towards Sullivan &#34;Wall Triana&#34; and once I turned going South on Sullivan I could not see the plane. A plane this big would still be visible from Sullivan, but it disappeared and was no longer in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However, due to the proximity of the intersection to the overpass and the heighth of the trees at the freeway level I could not have seen it until it was only slightly right of my position.

2/5/09 01:00|Kearney|NE|Circle|10 minutes|Large, round, red light sighted in Kearney, Nebraska silently flying very low and slow to the ground.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69268.html|325|ndxe200902| Large, round, red light sighted in Kearney, Nebraska, silently flying very low and slow to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to share with you a sighting I had about 2-3 weeks ago in my home town outside my apartment.  I am not saying it was a UFO or anything, but I have never seen something like it and was wondering if you have heard about anything similar to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To start out, I live in a small town(about 25 thousand people) in central Nebraska no where near any large busy airports and airplanes are not a normality to see.  During the day, the only planes we see around here are small privately owned planes or crop dusters.  Within my town, there is also a large hospital with medical helicopters that often fly through the sky, what I initially thought it to be.  However, they have a distinct chopper sound and can be easily heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving my apartment walking out to my car.  When I got in and started it up, I noticed a strange large round light in the sky.  What confused me was the fact that it was sort of a reddish amber color in the sky AND it was flying very low and very slow.  I stopped and just stared at it.  It took forever for it to traverse the sky.  I got out of my car to get a clearer look of it, and also noticed that there was no sound.  Seeing this light completely perplexed me because it couldn&#39;t have been any aircraft normally seen around my town especially at that time.  I don&#39;t know of any aircraft that ONLY has a red light either.  Furthermore, I have never seen anything fly so slow or low to the ground.  The fact that the light was so large (I would estimate it to be 60-75 feet in diameter) was even more strange because it didn&#39;t match any aircraft known to me.  I stared at it for a good 5-10 minutes because I didn&#39;t want to miss anything else if it were to happen.  It finally got too far away for me to see.  As stated earlier, I am not saying that it is a UFO, but to me, I can not personally explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what I saw that night and have never seen anything like it.  I would just like to know if this description matches any known aircraft or if what I saw truly was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

We noticed lights in the sky coming towards the shop that were flying low. The lights stopped just over us.  It was hard to see the shape of the craft because the lights were so bright.  It was 3 crafts, 5 lights on each in a triangle pattern and close enough to the ground that the lights shined to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They hovered over us for a very short time and then all lights went off.  About 5 seconds later the lights came back on.  The crafts changed position each in line behind the next and took off.  Moving at a very high rate of speed.  There is a tree line about a mile north and it took all off about 2 seconds from a dead stop for the crafts to disappear behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise, no sound from a motor, just complete silence.

I&#39;m sure it was an odd number (7 to 9) because first there was only one light, then more turned on two at a time on either side of the first light until there was a line of them.  Then they went out 2 at a time in the opposite order until they were all gone.  After maybe 5 seconds they repeated the pattern and then disappeared.  Whatever it was, it appeared to be either hovering or moving very slowly.  I had no reference point to establish size, but it was definitely an airborne object (or objects).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing lasted about 10 to 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over a few minutes later after crossing into AZ and stood outside on the side of the road looking up at the sky.  I could make out airplanes and their faint smoke trails but no sign of anything unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A string of lights makes us wonder whether the objects might have been some type of flare, released from an aircraft.

The sky was clear with only a few stars|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72921.html|336|ndxe200902| It was right after dark, Wednesday,  February 4, 2009.  I had just let the dog out for a run.  The sky was clear with only a few stars visible and the moon was not up yet.  It was unusually quiet.  There were no airliners, private planes, helicopters or military jets in the sky at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was alone, standing at the edge of the walkway, in the dark at my rural home, looking at the stars.  The only light was my yellow porch light which was 35 or    40 feet behind me.    I was looking toward the north west and noticed a large very bright round object moving toward me very slowly.  I thought it had to be either the ISS or STS so I ran into my house to get my binoculars so I could watch it clearly.  I also made a note of the time.  It was 18:59.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the object approach I noticed that it appeared to be flying at an even altitude and it was traveling in a weaving pattern, moving from the left then back to the right.  The object made no sound.  It had no navigational lights and no FAA red and green strobe lights.  It emitted a steady white light.  I have no idea how far up this object was.  I had difficulty looking at it. It was so bright it hurt my eyes.  It did appear to be the size of a dinner plate  The object came to a dead stop right across from me and sat still for about 10 seconds.  Then it blinked out and moved to the south west, right above me.   Needless to say, I almost panicked and ran but I couldn’t move.  I was frozen and I could not breath.  I felt as if it was staring at me while I was staring at it.  I immediately thought, what is this thing and how can it see me in the dark?  It sat there for almost a minute, then it started moving again, to the south east, at a faster pace and in a straighter line.  When it was almost out of sight it veered to the left and disappeared.  I got my dog and ran into the house, closed and locked my door and looked at the time.  It was 19:03.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived either on or outside of military bases  my entire life and I have seen some pretty unusual objects in the sky and in the water, but I have never experienced this before.  I sincerely hope that I continue to see UFO’s, but only at a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not report this sighting to any law enforcement agencies but I did contact NASA in Houston to ask if they knew what this object might be.  They did not know but they did say that it was not one of their satellites.    Their satellites do not zig zag across the sky and they do not stop in mid air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope reading this helps anyone who has had a similar experience.<n>

The shape was similar to a blimp, but I was not able to see any sort of fins on the back or anything underneath it. It was also narrower in the body than any blimp I have seen.   It had absolutely no trail behind it at all.  It was low enough that I could see it had no wings, but was higher than any of the local small planes fly.  It traveled across the sky at about the same speed the jets were also traveling.  It lit up brightly when it went through the sunlight, as the jets had also done.  Then it was out of sight behind the building I was facing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were talking about airplanes and military wepons as we walked. just an average day really. a few minutes after we started we notieced a group of peaple standing nere the beach. It was about 10-15 peaple in this group. then when we asked why they were standing their they said they saw multiple disk shaped crafts flying threw the clouds. I imideatly thought it was just the air force testing new air crafts like the insedint in Roswell. but then when I took a look for a few minutes. Just before I got sick of it I noticed some flashes. Then when the clouds cleared the flashes grew brighter and brighter. before long I noticed a disk shape and saw the silouete of the craft. there was about 4 or 5 of these crafts, I was&#39;nt sure how many because they were disapearing and reapearing threw the sky. I could&#39;nt tell how large they were or how far away they were. the colors of the flashing lights were white and vilet. they were moving very quicky. Im an athiest so I dont beleve in God, Ghost or Aliens. I was speachless. there were about 2 or 3 smaller oness around this much larger one. for about 20 minutes they were like this. than a flash upove the crafts made all of them dissapear. After they were gone, we walked home talking about extraterestrials and UFOs. I explained to him Roswell and Area 51. later I got on the computer and found this website and read some reports. than I filed this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I immediately looked through my binoculars and didn&#39;t notice any strobe or wing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving rather quickly.  As it came over the apartment building it began moving toward the south I ran down to the parking lot to see if any strobe or wing lights could be seen as it moved away.

I then wondered if it was maybe a large jet turning and possibly reflecting light. Then it began to ascend at, what looked like, a 40 or 45 degree angle then after a few seconds it faded out!  I have to say I’ve always kept an open mind but have been skeptical not having seen one myself.  I’m willing to hear anything  that may explain what I seen because I’m a bit stunned. I understand the laws of science and it did not seem to fit anything that I have ever seen before.<n>

(Distinct shape)<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were sledding at approximately 12:00AM on February 5th, 2009.  It was a particularly beautiful night, snowing kind of heavily, so we went to the park.  Everything was completely normal, so we proceeded to sled with no strange thoughts or fears.  After about 15 minutes of sledding, we were both resting at the top of the hill.  Suddenly, we saw a giant flash of blue in the sky.  It was an intense blue-white light that lit up the whole sky.  I did not see anything but the light as I was looking down.  However, my friend claims to have seen a black, non-solid, ovaly-rectangular shape in the sky, omitting the light (unexplainable because she saw it so quickly.)  She says that the shape was not completely solid (picture an open black folding chair, upside down but more oval-shaped.  The sky was visible through a hole in the shape.)  The object flew over the horizon.  The event was about two or three seconds.  It scared the living hell out of us.  We quickly left, assuming the incident was some sort of terrorist attack.  When we returned home, we called the news (they said nothing else had yet been reported.)  We are terrified with no explanation of what happened.  This seems totally unnatural.  We were sober and drug-free during the period of this event.  No other notable events happened except the wind blew a bit more heavily and there was a plane that passed by (we did not see it, but we heard it.)  Also, no other noises accompanied the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Flaw in date.  We suspect that the event may have occurred at midnight on February 04, and we have amended the date above.  PD))<n>

It stayed there for 20 minites and was changing colors every few seconds.  I went and got my wife and had her look at it and we were both estonished by it.  I went and got my hunting rifle and looked at it through the scope and saw it a little better.  It was very bright in the scope and I could see it change colors better, but I couldn&#39;t really make out the shape that well. It moved slowly toward the south west and then eventually disappeared.  It was obviously something out of the ordinary, because as soon as I saw it, I was stunned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??  PD))<n>

I decided to show my gf once I got back in the house and she was like &#34;Oh its the north star&#34; But it was to the west and usually the star is north of where im at. Anyway, I showed her and then watched this bright light for about 10 more minutes and it just sat there. I checked online to see if there were any planets tonight visible and from what i came up with, Venus is supposed to be visible. So I was like cool, its Venus!! I went outside and looked at it a little while longer and didnt think much of it besides the fact that I thought it was a planet. Anyway, i just went out to look at it again and it WASNT THERE??? Its a clear sky tonight and if that wasnt a UFO, i have no idea what else it could have been.  Wish I would have watched it longer.  Didnt realize it was anything other then the planet I thought it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Venus.  PD))<n>

The only light coming from it seemed to be as a result of reflected ambient light from the city, sort of grey or stone like in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This &#34;thing&#34; was moving so fast, as they always are. Sort of looked like a stealth fighter with no lights on, no sound, bigger and much faster and more maneuverable than anything I would expect to see. Words cannot describe<n>

She stopped the car about 2 miles east of Watson on the side of the road , I stepped out to do what I needed to do, and was looking toward the east night sky. I spotted a bright light that I thought was the very bright planet that is in the night sky this time of year. I then thought , No, The planet is over this way and looked over my shoulder and was correct in my thoughts and called out to my wife to look at this light in the sky. It was a stationary light at that time, but started moving from the NE to the SW. It was not moving very fast at that moment. My wife got out and we watched it move across the sky , then it just rapidly flew straight up, out of sight. It was as big and as bright as the very bright planet we see every night, white light, with no other lights visible. I thought at one point it was a helicopter but dismissed this notion as soon as It did the star trek zoom into the night. We , neither one use the UFO term as we never have seen one, possibly until now. We do not know what it was, but I can honestly say, it was not a plane, jet, helicopter, satellite or weather balloon. Something was up there, and it wasn’t from around here. We plan on carrying our cam corder with us everywhere from now on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I left the ranch and turned onto the service road of I 35 heading north. The clouds were dark but the sun was breaking trhough somewhat to the west,on my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that it looked like the sun was also setting to the north as well!  The entire northern horizon was lit up in a pale violet blue light.  The light seemed to come down from the clouds and fan out over the horizon.  The city of Fort Worth, Texas was directly under the light.I looked at the light for several seconds and then to my astonishment it simply turned off!  The sky was entirely black in front of me!  I was so shocked I immediatley drove home and turned on the TV expecting to see something on the news about it, but nothing.I am a teacher and mentioned it to my 5th grade class the next day to see if anyone else in Fort Worth had seen it and one student who is fairly level headed told me she and her mother had seen it while driving and didn&#39;t know what it was either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it was not lightening or some kind of power surge as the light was coming from above. It really scared me and it still does because  it was huge!What ever it was it covered an entire section of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Driving north on the service road of I35 toward Fort worth Texas at dusk after an ice storm, the northern sky was lighted from above in an arc shape to the ground covering a good portion of the sky.  It stayed that way for several seconds(it was lit up as soon as I turned on to the service road) and suddenly as if someone turned off a switch, it completely turned off.  The sky was then dark.  I know it was not lightening or anything like that.  It was so incredibly unusual that it really scared me.<n>

2/3/09 14:28|Yorktown Heights,|NY|Circle|3:30 mins.|"What the heck is this thing I'm seeing!!"|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68968.html|355|ndxe200902| &#34;What the heck is this thing I&#39;m seeing!!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking alone through a backyard during a usual routine of exercise I had stopped for a glance in the sky as I ordinarily do on clear days when in the air straight up above me at an altitude of about 3000 feet I had spotted a round ball-like object hovering in a slow but steady glide toward a southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This visible object did not in any way appear as what would normally have been a bird or plane, no wings or tail were seen.  With the extreme force of wind current and at it&#39;s estimated height, it would not have been possible for any winged creature or balloon to hover so sternly, as they would have shown an air pattern in a more turbulent or vibrational path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional note:  Using my very sharp and accurate vision I was able to depict that because of the slow steady movement it presented, this was not a star nor even a meteor.  Either one would have displayed a more split-second sparkling streak or no movement at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained in sight for at least one minute and as the cold wind began to water my eyes I glimpsed away briefly and when I quickly returned to what was a very open part of the sky, the object was nowhere in sight.  After another whole minute of observing that area of sky and with the awareness of how the sun will divert things at different angles and colors, there was nothing visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In retrospect from what similar reports have stated, it seemed very possible that the object must have made itself off at a high rate of speed.  It is unknown to me as to what it was or why I had come to observe this, other than for me to account for it and being clearly seen and recognized as a UFO.  I&#39;ll be recalling this experience until the end of my days.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Since 12/19/08, having seen and reported a very up close UFO, I’ve felt almost paranoid to be truthful. I’ve found it best not to say too much to too many people, as they are justifiably skeptical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since, my husband and I have been constantly looking to the skies over Highlands Ranch, CO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning, 01/03/2009, at 05:42, I was in our bedroom with the lights off. The skies were pitch black as I could see stars, and to the north, airplane’s lights approaching DIA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking out the window, in a southwestern direction, toward the mountains, quite a ways out in the distance, I saw an extremely bright light &#34;falling&#34; straight down. At first I thought it may have been a comet (however, the light was &#34;brilliant&#34; and there was NO trail) and then it stopped...just stopped...and the brilliant white light suddenly disappeared and a horizontal strobe of varying colored lights came on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still not certain of what I was seeing (I thought it may have been an airplane that had a close call and perhaps the lights were on wing tips as I was admittedly trying to talk myself out of what I was seeing) when suddenly a very long, diffused looking white light shot straight down from the object for about 2-3 seconds (the light was about 1/3 the distance between the object and the horizon from my viewpoint) and then that light went away. (If it had been daylight, I’d say it looked like a long, large jet-trail--going straight DOWN!)  As I noted the object had been in one location for a while now, I quickly went to the living room and opened the blinds and was relieved to STILL be able to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The view from the bedroom had been better, so I went back and as I was watching it, 2 very long, diffused looking white lights shot out horizontally (one to the left, one to the right of the object) again lasting about 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There had been no movement of the object now for a number of minutes. About 2 minutes later, the 2 horizontal lights came on for about 2 seconds again! Then, all of the lights just disappeared.<n>

It had been raining but had stopped earlier in the night and the sky was mostly clear. The constellation, Orion, was it my 11 o’clock position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason, I happened to look up at the sky and at about the 1 o’clock position, I observed what appeared to be a rather large meteor traveling west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> he object only lasted about 3 seconds and had an almost fluorescent green trail that followed but wasn’t very long. On a comparison stand point, if I were to hold a corn kernel about 12 inches away from my nose, that’s about how large the object was that passed by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel pretty confident that it was a meteor that just happened to miss earth due to it’s trajectory but it did bring concern as to just how big it really was. I have seen several “shooting stars” in my life but this observation certainly was a first for me.<n>

I blinked my large flashlight 2 times..pause..2times again(Navy Seals communicate this way @ night)instantly it changed direction a bit SE and as it moved off the pacific over the ridge it seem to vanish in a haze and never came out of the haze heading east! I stayed looking for about 1/2hr and saw nothing. This was NOT a aircraft, small plane, drone, chopper, sat. or weather balloon. (All of which I&#39;m very familiar with) I&#39;m not a UFO nut or druggie just a regular guy that finds it hard to believe in all this stuff, although my mom and I saw a bright light with no tail, moving across the southern sky in the early 50&#39;s in south Miami Fl. that was never ID&#39;d! One theory I have on this recent sighting is the craft produced some kind of Hologram in the haze that made it appear like it vanished!! (BWDIK) The stars looked like Led lights that night so the orange lights really stood out, and so did the hair on my body!! So now every night weather permitting I mill around for this to show up again with no avail so far.<n>

I had time to say, &#34;Oh my God...&#34; fairly calmly before it was gone.  The shape was a bit of a crescent, at an angle to myself and my car.  It was not moving towards me, and not heading at a steep angle towards the ground.  It simply moved across the sky.  There was a brighter light at the front, a dimmer one above and an even dimmer one below the brightest.  They were the color of bright embers and did not flicker or blink.  There was also no tale.  The object seemed large, if I had looked at the end of my thumbnail and held it against the sky with my elbow a bit bent, it would have just covered the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not certain if this is related or not, but my cell-phone reception has been rubbish ever since even in places it was perfect before.<n>

From the corner of my eye (towards my right) I noticed something coming in fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned to see what I had seen, the object slowed down and glided across Dinuba, CA.  I would guess about 1 ½ from where I was standing and about ½ mile up in the sky.  I know that this was not a plane because I have seen planes go across the sky and this did not move like an aircraft.  It had four red lights and it was in shape of a triangle.  Three lights coming down one side and one on the other side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside the house and got my mom to go outside.  My mom also seen what I had seen and she was just saying, &#34;What the heck is that?&#34;  It glided for about five minutes and then it just speeded off.

It was in the Western Sky.  We drove out of our small town to the west to get out of the surrounding town lights and To make sure the light was not close to town so that we could judge the size.   The unknown light stayed the same.  It still looked the same size as we traveled west on country roads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description:  Large white light.  At intervals very small red lights would flash.(around the edges) These red lights were so small and hard to see that I had to watch for awhile to make sure I was not seeing things.   The intervals were not constant.  The light would undulate, getting larger and smaller ( or brighter and dimmer?)  The light did not move.  The stars were out and clear.  DFW airport had multiple planes flying and there were 3 helicopters that we could see in the distance.  We used these to compare with the large white light.  The large white light was nothing like I have ever seen.

We looked at the light with binoculars, but could only see a bright light.  One night as we watched, there were a few dim blue lights. These blue lights would shoot along the middle of the white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light is too high to be a part of a tower.  We also have multiple towers with lights on top that we could compare.  Nothing in the area looked as bright or as big as this light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning, we noticed on Fox news that someone else had seen the light.  We have called several news agencies in the area and no one seems to know what it is. Thought we would pass this on in case it is of interest to you.

I couldn&#39;t tell how far away it was, only that it was large enough to know it wasn&#39;t a star.  I watched it for about 20 seconds then I went inside to get my husband.  It took me about 10 seconds to get back outside, and it was gone.  I waited for a couple of minutes, then I saw it again.  It was in the exact same spot.  I called out for my husband again but then it slowly disappeared behind the mountains.  I waited again then I saw 2 lights appear out of nowhere.  The larger light was there and a new, smaller light.  The smaller light began to disappear, but the larger light stayed in its position.  I called out for my husband again and he finally made it outside in time to witness the light.  I asked him what it was, and he said he didn&#39;t know.  I asked him to get my cell phone so I could record it.  The light then slowly began to dim and finally went out.  It didn&#39;t go behind the mountains.  The light just started to dim and then disappeared.  I was unable to catch the light on my cell phone.  After it disappeared, I didn&#39;t see it again.  I came directly inside and got on the internet to see if anyone else had reported it.<n>
2/2/09 19:12|Hoquiam|WA|Triangle|20 minutes|At one point I could see underneath the object clearly and it appeared to be very large, gray or silver with a completely flat bottom a|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68652.html|366|ndxe200902| I was driving west and as I approached the river I saw a cluster of lights (red and white, flashing) directly above the east bound bridge on the other side of the small river. My first thought was that there must have been lights attached to antennas above the new bridge station because it was very low and hovering above the bridge. (At this time I could see no solid shape, only the lights.)  As my road turned, I could see that this was now slowly moving closer (northeasterly) and was in fact a narrow triangular shaped object.  At one point I could see underneath the object clearly and it appeared to be very large, gray or silver with a completely flat bottom and had a series of two lights at each point of the triangle, flashing red, white and now I could see blue as well.  It also seemed to be very quiet as I am used to planes and helicopters in our area, but this did not make the noise like they do at this low of an altitude. (This object was only between 7-10 stories up and I could not hear any sound from it.) I was not in an area to pull over and my destination was less than a mile away. I could still see it slowly moving east-northeast above the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon reaching my destination I could still see the flashing lights very small in the distance directly eastward, but no longer moving. At this time I told another of what I saw and we watched for another few minutes with binoculars as this flashing never moved. The lights were still flashing over the hill when I left at 7:35 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been completely shocked that there has not been any talk about this in our local media. I simply cannot believe others did not see this too as I was not the only one on that road and there are many homes in the area.<n>

I walked out of the house towards the car and looked up to the southwest and saw an amber-colored light. Almost immediately, it split into four amber lights in a straight line. After less than five seconds, the lights were gone. A few seconds later, I saw the same thing a little to the south - I believe this one only showed two lights. I quickly knocked on the car window and my family got out. We watched for a minute or so and finally saw a single light to the south for two or three seconds. Within a few seconds, we saw a single light in about the same place where I had seen the first one. This light quickly split into the four lights again. Within just a few seconds it was gone. During this whole period we also saw several white lights slowing blinking and moving around slowly in random directions. These lights were not real bright, about what you would see from a plane, but the blinking rate and random movement appeared very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if the bright planet in the west in the evening is Jupiter or Venus, but the amber lights we saw were several times brighter than this planet. The distance between each of the four lights was probably about the same as the distance across a full moon. So the distance between the first and fourth lights was probably 3 to 4 full moon diameters.<n>

No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Marlton /Medford, NJ UFO Observation Report February 02, 2009  I have been observing an object in the evening sky which strobes occasionally (white, green, blue and red), and is almost impossible to focus in on with binoculars (7X35 power). When close to focus the object looks like a cone or jellyfish with colors continually changing. No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object moves erratically and quickly, up, down and left right also in circles but, stays within a boundary of approximately 5 miles (educated guess).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects position is typically trailing the constellation of the Big Dipper in the Eastern skies starting at approximately 15-20 degrees above the horizon at 18:00 hours and then moving in the same trajectory as the Big Dipper later into the evening. A guess that it is at 50 to 100,000 feet above sea level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has been observed for the last 60 days by me and others that have observed it with me, so I have decided to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we walked through the parking lot, I glanced up at the sky as I usually do.  I first noted Venus, then turned to look at Orion (roughly to the East) and said &#34;Look, Orion!&#34; (typical behaviour for me).<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the left upper side of the constellation, I noticed a very bright star that didn&#39;t seem to belong there, but I shrugged it off and  turned to get into the car, when my boyfriend, who was still looking up at the sky said &#34;A UFO!&#34;  I turned back to see that the white dot of light that I&#39;d first mistaken for a bright star was slowly moving downward through the field of the Orion constellation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light zigzagged slightly as it moved downward and toward the left.  The lack of blinking and coloured lights, as well as the pattern of movement made both my boyfriend and myself remark that it couldn&#39;t be a place.  The light was also far too small/far away to be a helicoptor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute or less, the light had reached the area right below the constellation, when it began to dim until it had disappeared entirely.  We waited a bit to see if it would return, then got into the car.  As we were exiting the parking lot, I looked up toward Orion again, and this time I did see an airplane traveling northeast, though I doubt that was related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 23 year old female and have lived in Paducah, Kentucky my entire life.  My boyfriend is 32 and originally from Guadalajara, Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was an overcast day, with intermittent showers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was opening my umbrella, I noticed something in the air.  Looking carefully, I see a boxy, rectangular, dark gray shape tumbling through the air.  There was no sound coming from it, and it appeared to be a long way away.  It, for all intents and purposes, looked like a bag inflated with some lighter than air gas that had been released, and yet it did retain its shape rather well.  I reached for my digital camera in my pocket, and took three pictures (I will include these as attachments).  I also took a short video clip (about 1:01), but nothing was obvious when I watched it later.  Approximately 3-4 minutes after I first sighted the object, it disappeared into the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must say that I may not be the ideal witness for such an event.  I am a science fiction fan, as well as an amateur digital artist.  I have also been described as, &#34; slightly out of touch&#34; with reality.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However,  I do not make up stories like this.  I am not a glory hound, nor do I believe that aliens visit our planet.  Based on our present understanding of physical law, visiting even a relatively near star (like, say Alpha Centauri, 4.3 LY away) would be a tremendous undertaking.  So, my personal beliefs belie an extraterrestrial origin.  However, It was definitely something that was flying, and I have no idea what it really was, therefore it meets the requirement of being a UFO, in my book.<n>

On his way he notices a bright light hovering above the high school football field. He picks me up and tells me to check out something  and we go over  the hill on iowa avenue  and   he says &#34;look&#34;  i see it right over what i can say is either the field itself or over the center of town.  It is a bright white light and sitting there , i think is this a helicopter  coming dead on at first. I roll down the window and no sound and so sign of red or blue lights ?  So we turn the corner and shortly after the thing begins to Pulse and turns from white to  a amber color  with a white streak to the left  and is gone! We are looking in the same area and then look and see it way off to the south west of town but dimmer .    It is in the direction of the mall , now we begin to trip out !!! Now this is where we are not sure it is the same thing or another craft . So we head towards its direction and this thing moves to the north west and then hovers over from what i can tell is the tree line and descends in a fielded area where mostly corn fields should be .  I have portions of this footage on my digital camera and him on his cell phone  during half the chase. Unfortunately i did not record the footage from when we first saw this thing at it&#39;s brightest. I will say it was as intense as the moon but smaller hard to say what size it was. It clearly was not a conventional air craft , planet , and performed excessive speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a Chopper a Plane or Venus this was a moving object that traveled in 4 directions and changed color and defied what we know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend wanted to chase it in to the country side and i was against it. So we abandoned the chase.<n>

I asked my brother if he had seen it, and he said &#34;yes, absolutley&#34;. The light was brighter than the north star and was getting brighter. It was also moving to the left and away from us. It slowly got dimmer and eventually disappeared. It looked as if a ship from a movie was taking off into light speed. This was a very convincing moment for me that there is something else out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looked like a very bright star at first, but made significant quick movement indicating it was not.  Object was very bright and difficult to make out shape.  It bounced back and forth across the sky in small increments and then would move in various directions at a quicker rate and longer distance.  At times it would change position and appear to have a red light on one end.  Could have been circular or rectangular depending on the angle.  At one point a second light object entered the area, disappeared, then reappeared and shot off to the right of the other-leaving a light trail.  This continued for at least one hour.<n>

I found nothing, and I decided to go and sit down again. I sat there for the next 20 minutes,with a growing feeling of uncertainty and discontent washing over me. That&#39;s when it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The air around me grew very warm, a high pitched sound reached my ears.  Unsure of what was happening, I stood up.  A bright light, with a red tint to it surrounded me.  I felt myself loosing consciousness, and I fell to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drifted in and out of consciousness, each time I awoke, I remember seeing a bright light and blurry silhouettes all around me. The most apparent thing to me was that the figures were very short, no taller than a meter or so, and the table I was lying on was very close to the ground. I remember that occasionally the abductors would speak to each other, always in a high-pitched, rushed sort of way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many hours later, I woke up. I was outside. I stood up, and I felt dizzy. Stumbling, I looked around the small clearing I was in. I finally found my tent, after walking around for nearly 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t exactly sure of what happened. I packed up my tent, and other camping gear as fast as I could. I drove back to my house and went to bed. My dreams were disturbed with strange dreams of symbols I&#39;d never seen before, as well as that same strange high-pitched noise I heard the previous night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then, I had a psychological evaluation done, and it came out completely fine. I am thoroughly convinced that I have come into contact with extra-terrestrials of some kind. Before that incident, I was like many people, a skeptic. I write this now as a believer, one who has experienced abduction, and has to live with it&#39;s horrible repercussions for the rest of my life.<n>

It never moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An hour later, my friend Carol who works with me went out to smoke, and came inside to ask me to see something.

It always appears out of the western hemisphere, and does nothing but sweep from north to south for roughly one hour at a time then just disappears. The way I know it is not a series of stars is because even when cloudy outside the lights are still there, and they create a shimmer on the clouds as they are passing by them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here lately a second set of lights has appeared over the sky so that there is now a total of 6 lights between 21:00 and 23:00. Have not seen any more than that but do know that every night the lights are again out and about doing whatever it is they are doing. The formation they tend to fly in is an over and under type formation with a slight stagger in between the two. The first ship will by slightly higher in altitude and a good bit above the second while the second tends to move a little bit slower almost as if to be scanning for anything the first ship did not pick up or see. Each night they move closer and closer towards the actual city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the object is really hard to tell because of how far out it appears to be, but at the best estimate I would give the object roughly 1mile in length due to the size it appears and the distance it seems to stay at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two people who I know may have seen it would be myself and brother. Both of which are completely fascinated by it because we have some sense of background with airplanes and knowledge of the air force from family history. I myself have studied planes because I wanted to be a pilot and this object is nothing like any air plane I have ever seen or ever even thought about. Its movements are the biggest reason it comes across peculiar to me because it does not move like any aircraft known to man can move it moves almost as if its just floating from point A to point B. The other unique thing is that unlike most aircraft that make a slight noise when flying even from a distance this object makes no noise, and seems to draw almost no attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

2/1/09 21:00|Frankfort|IL|Teardrop|30 mins|Very bright lights in the sky that would stop, rotate, fly away, come back...almost like they were playing in the sky.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68400.html|385|ndxe200902| Very bright lights in the sky that would stop, rotate, fly away, come back...almost like they were playing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, Sunday February 1st, 2009 my husband and I witness a very bright light in the sky and it looked like it was slowly rotating, but it was staying in the same spot.  Then came 2 more lights.  They were not planes that we normally see in the sky.  One of the lights seems to stop, then turn on a dime and zoom off.  Like it was playing in the sky.  We did capture this on video, but we think we were pretty far away and are not sure if it is worth it to show anyone.  I could copy the disc and send it to someone.  We live in Frankfort, Illinois; the lights looked liked they were over Tinley Park or Orland Park, Illinois.  It lasted about 30 to 45 mins.  Bright lights, with sometimes a red light interchanging.  It was pretty cool to see.  This is the second time we have witnessed these lights, planes or whatever it is.  I wish I knew what it was!<n>
2/1/09 20:30|Berkeley|CA|Sphere|15-25 min?|Light-distortion moved methodically across San Francisco Bay to above Treasure Island, dropped, returned along same path.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68418.html|386|ndxe200902| Light-distortion moved methodically across San Francisco Bay to above Treasure Island, dropped, returned along same path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 of us were sitting on a rock outcropping with a good view of San Francisco after dinner. Persons 2 and 3 were busy discussing classes. Person 1 noticed a strange shimmering that seemed to appear in front of the Golden Gate Bridge, after which it began to move south. As it passed in front of the city lights, the lights in a small spherical area would become distorted (brighter and wavering), and return to normal as the object moved farther left in the field of view. Person 1 pointed the object out to Persons 2 and 3, neither of whom could pick out the object until Person 1 told them to look at the TransAmerica Tower and told them exactly as the object passed in front. They then all followed the object with their eyes as it continued to move slowly southward over the Bay. The object stopped directly above the island that cuts the Bay Bridge in half (Treasure Island I think it&#39;s called?), and we lost sight of it as it dropped directly down and out of our line of sight to the buildings (again slowly). We started talking excitedly about what we had seen before Person 1 again noticed the object; it had risen back up to roughly the point from which it started its descent. The object then returned along the same path it originally took. As it came in front of the Golden Gate Bridge again, it began to shrink rapidly and move slowly upwards in our field of vision until it no longer distorted the Golden Gate Bridge lights. It seemed to be moving away from us at this point, but we could be wrong as well; we could not, after all, see the object, but only the circular pattern of distorted light. I am &#34;Person 3.&#34;<n>

No one else in my home witnessed the event - could not get to the window fast enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting lasted approximately 3-4 seconds.  The object was a bright silver white light traveling northwest downward toward the San Francisco Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1st thought it was a private aircraft but then the light (large brilliant silver white, maybe 12 ft. in diameter from my vantage point) shone so brilliantly then instantaneously disappeared.  It seemed to be a light in and of itself.  Not a light coming from a separate source.   Approximate height from ground--100ft. and approximately ¼ - ½ mile away.  Also thought it could have been a falling star but too low to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date and time of this sighting is Feb. 1, 2009 7:38 p.m. PST.  Clear night sky and a little over a quarter moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were aircraft flying much higher and farther away in the sky (very probably approaching or departing S.F. International or Oakland International airports).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

At first I thought it to be the planet Venus (as I am accustomed to seeing this planet in the sky at around this time of night during this season) but it was very reddish in appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then spotted Venus off to the right and lower in the sky than the object in question. I then went into the house to get my binoculars to have a closer look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After retrieving my binoculars, I looked again and the object began to emit what appeared to be flare-like objects which were the same color as the object and they drifted downward, appearing to be affected by gravity but had some velocity to them as well. I could not resolve the object any better with my binoculars than I could with the naked eye. I could not see any detail besides the color which was an orange-red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally the object began to wane and then it would come back brighter then wane again. Finally it disappeared altogether. During the episode, the object did not appear to move across the sky, but remained stationary. A neighbor saw it as did my daughter-in-law. The neighbor said he saw it change position in the sky but did not think it to be an aircraft as it moved very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it, I thought it was Venus. Then I thought it might be a distant star undergoing some sort of change but when the flare-like objects started to emit from it I was reminded of a combat aircraft dropping flares to avoid heat-seeking missiles. However, there were only about six flare-like objects released from the main body of the object, and they were not brighter but rather they were the same color and brightness as the main object. There were no flashing lights or different color lights. The only change in appearance that I witnessed was the eventual fading of the object and the reappearance of the object only to fade again and finally disappear for good.<n>

Then 77 fed onto I37 from Corpus Christi to San Antonio.  I was driving along and noticed a dark object moving about the same speed as I was.  It seemed to increase in number from 1 up to 4 from time to time.  I took notice of the next mile marker which was 42.  I then rolled my window down to see if perhaps there was something on my window creating the affect, plus to listen for noise.  The spot(s) were still there, but I heard no noise other than my car and general traffic noise.  The spot(s) were dark and the best I could describe the shape was from a cigar shape to a disc (flat)shape.  I flashed my lights on and off to signal I had seen them... and anytime a car passed me, I pointed my arm out the window towards the spots... hoping someone else would look in that direction.  I watched the spots for about 6 miles... then they dissappeared.  I made mental note of the time, 7:17PM and the next mile pole, which was 48.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spots did not reappear.<n>

Keep in mind this area was marked as a no fly zone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To me it did not look like any plane that I have seen and it moved Relatively fast.  What I am wondering is did anyone else see this?<n>

We live in a house with a lot of trees around it so I had to position myself just right to see the stars. I had been looking up for about 30 seconds and then I saw something that caught my attention. It appeared to be a star slowly moving across the sky. I could tell it wasn&#39;t an airplane and it was moving to slow to be a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I blew it off for a few minutes thinking my mind was playing tricks on me until I saw another one.  After I watched this one slowly drift across the sky, I raced inside to get my sister to come see this.  She walked with me outside and we looked up at the sky.  I explained to her what I saw and she wanted to go back in.  I told her just stay a few more minutes.  Sure enough about a minute and 30 seconds later, we saw another one!  We watched as i behaved just as the other two and then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we sat there a few more minutes we watched a few more pass over us.  We finally grew tired of watching and went into the house.  About 5-10 minutes later we went back out side.  We began watching the sky again and saw a number of airplanes now circling above.  We saw no more &#34;UFOs&#34; after that so we went back inside.<n>

At arms length the object was 3 inches wide as seen between index finger and thumb.  The object is estimated to have been 1/4 of a mile away from the reporting officer&#39;s location at the beginning of sighting.  The object was moving in a southerly direction at a very slow rate of speed.  The object stopped and was stationary for close to 2 and one half minutes before it continued to move on.  The object had on one side a rotating blue light, the other side had a rotating white and yellow light.  The center of the object had a larger red light that rolled in an vertical manner, not a rotating horizontal manner as the other lights.  The reporting officer was outside and no sound was heard.  No shape was noticed, though the lights were appearing to be on opposite ends on each other, with the center light centered between them and slightly lower.  The event lasted 9min 30 seconds to 10min.  I am a deputy sheriff in the same parish as the sighting.<n>

I had blinked my lantern light on it to see if would move&#34;   And it had moved to my wife and my direction very fast.  So my wife was scared that it would pick us up.
