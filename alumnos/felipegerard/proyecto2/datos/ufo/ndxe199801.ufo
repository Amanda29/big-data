Appeared in Southwestern sky, arched almost across my zenith and faded out in the Notheastern sky. I&#39;ve found reports of the same ufo after I sighted it:http://home.fuse.net/task/TWA-800.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had 4 white lights from the side I could see, the were flashing in pattern. When I checked through my binoculars, I could barely make out the lines of the craft, which appeared to be a disk. I watched for maybe a minute as it made it&#39;s way higher, going almost directly over our house, then switched windows and continued to watch. My mom was nearby, I called her over and she aggreed the light pattern was like none she&#39;d ever seen (we get a lot of overhead traffic. Helicopters and such). We lost sight of it behind the treetops.<n>

Base Disclosure&#34; planned an all-night long research event on the nights of Jan. 30th and 31st of 1998. In an area known for unusual UFO activity, the researchers set up their equipment on an isolated hilltop near the Bradshaw Ranch (which has been featured on the TV show &#34;Sightings&#34;). One man driving a Jeep Laredo, and a married couple in a Suzuki sport-utility eventually joined our party, and we built a camp fire as we gazed the night skies. The first sighting came at dusk, with a few stars beginning to show up. An object, descending from the east, was spotted. The object was bright white in color, approximately 10,000ft. in altitude, and about three times the size of Venus. It seemed to be a solid object. Adjacent to the object, at an est. distance of 1,000 ft. was a smaller object traveling synchronously with the larger object. We all witnessed these objects travel for about 1 minute, until they disappeared behind 6,500ft. Bear Mountain (3 miles to the east of where we were). The objects were very unusual, and did not look like any conventional aircraft. The second &#34;sighting&#34; was witnessed throughout the night: a bright light flashing numerous colors was seen low on the horizon near Camp Verde, a town about 15 to 20 miles south of our location. The light was quite clear, thus suggesting that it could not have been very far away (maybe 20 miles in distance from us). The light, when first seen, was moving up, and left and right slowly. Then it ABRUPTLY vanished. The light would then reappear in the same location...then it would eventually vanish. This activity went on throughout the night. The light simply was not an airplane due to the bright blinking colors it emitted, what&#39;s more, the light was not located near any known flight path for airplanes or near any known airport.

1/30/98 18:50|Dallas|TX|Light|3.5 minutes|Time: 1850 CST; location: 40nm SSW Dallas; altitude: 6000feet I am a pilot. I was flying into the DFW metroplex on the evening of Janua|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03069.html|5|ndxe199801| Time: 1850 CST; location: 40nm SSW Dallas; altitude: 6000feet I am a pilot. I was flying into the DFW metroplex on the evening of January 30, 1998. It was a clear night. At approximately 6:50 local time, I noticed what appeared to be a very bright star above and slightly to the right of my course. This object was very high and accelerating, albeit slowly. I thought that it was a meteor, at first. I noticed its acceleration and gave extreme notice. It was then that I noticed the second object ahead of the first and traveling in the same direction (north). The second object was much smaller and less bright. Both objects moved to within a few degrees of directly north. The first object began a slight, curving turn to the left and began to fade away ( as if to move into the earths shadow ). A few seconds later, the second object faded from view and with no turning noticed, as with the preceding object. They disappeared in the reference vicinity of two stars to the distant left and &#39;below&#39; teh orion constellation. I notified a friend who was behind me by some miles in his aircraft (40 - 50 nm). He remarked that it was probably an aircraft, given the large number of them in the area. This was not possible. I have seen aircraft all of my life. These objects had none of the characteristics of aircraft and were either in the extreme upper atmoshere or in space. They looked very similar to satellites moving overhead. This is unlikely, in my opinion, due to the fact that the first object began a slight, parabolic turn to my left. Approximately 2 minutes after the initial sighting, the objects reappeared in the same fasion as before. They moved in the same fashion and direction as previously noticed. The smaller object was in the lead, as before. I noticed them this second time directly above. They moved in the same direction as before in almost an identical path. The fact that I saw them a second time is why I am writing this. If these objects were satellites, they would not have been seen twice, moving in identical fashion along the same route. During this second sighting, the! re was no turning motion seen. They were directly in tandem and some distance apart. My friend behind me observed the same phenomenon and stated that he saw the objects turn slowly to the right. I did not observe this. I did observe that they &#39;faded&#39; from view in virtually the same position as before. They were not seen again. Approximately 2 minutes after the second sighting, I queried ATC to the effect of &#39; did they see two objects very high directly above Dallas aand at extreme altitude&#39;. The response was &#39;negative&#39;. I have a question for my reader-Does the space shuttle move south-north? Is it capable of retracing its path in a very short time, in what must have been a large distance? Can it turn in orbit to appear to be curving to one side? This is the only possible solution I can give. Given the fact that there were two objects, I am at a loss for an explanation.<n>

It looked like a VW on fire very bright and moving very slowly downward.  We lost sight of it behind a hill.  We were within a 1/4 mile and it was low we watched it from about 1000 feet to about 25 feet off the ground before we lost sight of it.  I stopped the car thinking we would hear a crash but did not.  We went home and called the police reporting what looked like a VW Car on fire falling slowly from the sky.  We went back but could not see anything.  My son is on crutches and could not go the terrain at night and I was too afraid to walk over the hill on my own.<n>

I am scared as I am writing this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in early 1998. It was in Akure, Ondo State Nigeria.  It was in the night around 9pm. I was waiting beside my car in front of my friend’s House.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I accidentally gazed up looking at the sky and I saw this saucer shaped huge ship moving horizontally but slowly in around the altitude of a stabilized large aircraft with light wave trailing it from the sides, but joining like a tail at the back, fading away as the ship moves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ship was similar to the one described in the drawing I saw today on your website.  It has very bright lighted windows surrounding it arranged like a double deck ship.  I met it moving horizontally for about 4 seconds and as if the occupants knew I was watching them, it suddenly sped off vertically up in blazing speed and disappeared into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was afraid because I concluded that they are more intelligent being in that ship and I felt they saw me and knew I was watching them.  I always think they will come for me if I report to anyone because I believe they are on a spy mission.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As I walked into the backyard, I noticed an odd looking light in the Western sky. The light was amber/white in color, and was not blinking. It was located approximately 35-40 degrees above the horizon, and moving in a Southerly direction. I watched the object traverse the sky from due West to approximately W/SW. I was watching the light pretty intensely, and all of a sudden, it vanished. The color of the light reminded me of the color and quality of a vapor street lamp. You know, the kind that is supposed to reduce shadows. It appeared to be moving fairly fast. I have seen many airliners flying in the skies around here, and the object appeared to be moving faster than they normally do. It appeared to be out over the Everglades.<n>

Approx. one-second intervals color would switch from red to orange,red, etc.  The craft hovered directly above our rural property, one teal light turned off.  The poultry, neighbors&#39; horses, and dogs all stopped in their tracks.  One dog, Butch, sat down and stared up toward the craft. The craft flew straight up, paused for a moment then zipped away toward Mt. St. Helen&#39;s NW side. All animals resumed normal activities when craft was gone.<n>

I estimated the object to be about twice as big as Tampa Stadium. We pulled over and got out to see if we could tell if it was moving,because we were doing 85 across the desert and it was hard to judge it while we were moving.  We stood there for about a half hour looking,pointing and basically freaking out on the fact that we were seeing something that was very obviously way too huge to be man-made. It was a couple thousand feet up in the air and a few miles from us to the south. We saw other cars pull over and other people were standing on the roadside watching it to. We got back on the road and we watched it until dark. We first saw it between 4pm &amp; 5pm. We basically drove INTO and OUT OF sight of the object. We watched it for THAT LONG!!!! While we were getting further into dusk, almost dark, we saw tiny lights in random patterns begin to blink. The lights were not bright at all, but they were visible after it was dark. I was on my way to a trade show in L.A.,coming from florida. The date was tuesday,Jan.27th 1998. I am giving this report on monday,Aug.17th 1998,because I have looked in all of the UFO sighting report sites on the net and I have not found one single report of this event that I and at least 8 other people witnessed. We even saw a plane flying in the area. Are there any other people who saw this too????????<n>

The first contact sighting was at 9:28pm. et.  It was a matter of minutes to get to my house and to get the camera.  We jumped back into the truck, and drove to a clearing where I could park and get a picture.  I took several pictures from there, turned back for my house, and while driving down the street that my house is on, the object rose higher in the air, so I stopped to take a few more pictures.  I was coming back to my house this time, to grab my cam-corder, but when I tried to use it, the battery was dead.  We observed the craft for a few minutes longer, and it travled out of site in a steady, &#34;floating&#34; manor.  We decide to take the tapes back, and as we were driving, we noticed red lights where the craft once was.  We parked to take pictures of this as well, but there was no sign of the craft.

Wife,son, and daughter arrived. We observed the object moving in a northern direction. It was a metallic cylinder object, 100 - 150 feet tall, that stayed vertical without any rotation such as would occur if any part was, or acted as, an axis. Was observed through binoculars. It traveled at a constant speed, which was slow enough that when we followed it, we stayed with it easily without breaking the speed limit. We followed it on US Hwy 183 heading north to 2243 E. We then traveled on 2243 E. and pulled off the road. It passed over us. We used binoculars to again observe it. We then commenced east again intending to go to IH 35 and intercept it again. A dark helicopter was observed flying from the south at a high speed and at an altitude of about 500 feet (unknown if involved in incident). A small, low flying Cessna Skyhawk 150 was making signals to possibly a ground crew (not believed involved in incident). A jet fighter using afterburners was heading southwest at possibly 20,000 (unknown if involved). No military base close. We traveled to IH 35 and looked about but found nothing. We traveled west on Hwy 29. Observed (3) jet aircraft that appeared to be going vertical in v formation, in a flight path that would intercept the object, had it continued in the same direction of travel last seen by us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This report submitted by an individual who would be regarded as a responsible member of the community.

I notice behind him 3  huge balls of lights coming toward us. (They were the color of what the sun would look like at sun rise). They kept coming close I said  ufo&#39;s before my son turned around he thought I was kidding. But when he saw them he said &#34;what the hell. He got his camera to take pictures. I went across the street to tell my neighbor, she got her camera and also took photos also her children where also watching the 3 strange balls of lights. Then my son&#39;s friend drove up in his car and also watch the lights do movements in the sky. When my son and I frist saw them I was terrified I actually thoght it was the end of the world, because they looked so big, perfect circles of lights. As soon as they went higher in the night skys I felt more at ease. One of the lights went to the east and then disapear the other two stayed side by side then they also disapear without a trace. I have never seen anything like that nor has my neighbor, or my son nor his friend. Also that night I called  the sheriff dept to see if anyone reported these strange objects in the sky, nobody did and I contacted a T.V. station nobody reported anything and nothing his been reported in the local paper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 balls of lights the color is like when the sun rises in the morning. The night was clear.  They where huge like 3 full moon coming towards me and my son. They where coming from the south of the sky. Then they stayed above my house for awhile moveing around  then they went higher in the sky, one of the ball of light went east the two other stayed south the one in the east disapear without a trace then a jet or airplane was going towards the other two then they disapear. There was 6 witness to this event . My son took a whole roll of film and there is nothin on the film. My neighbors photots of the object is also blank.<n>

Then second craft about a mile above us racing over our heads at an incredible speed that came to a dead stop unlike any aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Saturday morning 1/24/98. The time was 5:45am. It was unusual I was up so early (for some unknown reason) after having a long 15 hour work day. I was wide awake so I turned on my television and sat on my couch when I noticed a peculiar bright light in the corner of my eye coming from my kitchen window. I got up from the couch to get a closer look and it did&#39;nt seem to be moving. It was a very large (size of a school bus?) bright light in the sky just hovering above a nearby mountain (apprx.4 miles away). From my distant view the light was clearly shaped like a very wide letter &#34;A&#34;. I immediately told my wife who first thought I was teasing then responding with a jump out of bed after my unsettled behavior. She quickly acknowledged this was definetly no plane, no helicopter and  no weather balloon. We both ran outside to get a closer look. I then called my brother who lives next door, who joined us with his 3 children aged 12,13 &amp; 15. All eyes were totally glued to the sky for a good 2 hours as the craft very slowly ascended. It&#39;s movement was so slow it took the 2 hours for the craft to become just a speck in the sky, at which time it came to a dead stop. It was about 10 minutes later after the craft had stopped that we then were alarmed by a second craft about a mile above us racing over our heads at an incredible speed that I have never seen before from any aircraft. I had been to air shows before watching such events like Thunderbirds &amp; Blue Angels and is somewhat familiar with jet speed. To better describe the speed at which the second craft was moving is to take your hand and put it on top of your head and fling it forward as fast as you can. By doing this you can experience the same feeling we all had from the second craft. It was the speed from the second craft that  confirmed that the first very slow craft was a genuine UFO. To continue with the second craft maneuvers - after streaking through the sky it came to a dead stop and then also hovered over the same mountain as the first craft di! d. Now we could see both craft within our sight of view. The first in the very very far distant and now the second craft which we could&#39;nt determine it&#39;s simular shape until it had come to a stop atop the mountain. The second craft hovered for about 5 minutes and just disappeared. We did&#39;nt see it streak off or anything; we just could&#39;nt see it anymore. We all just said &#34;where did it go&#34;? The first craft was still just a speck in the sky and just stayed in the now bright sky (getting hard to maintain a constant view in the daylight) by which time our eyes were irritated and we just got tired of looking at it so long. But before I went inside I remebered it&#39;s location in the sky by using some telephone wires to refer to as a guide to where it&#39;s location was. 3 to 4 hours later I went outside and it was still there. Went to work told some fellow co-workers, made some more phone calls in addition to earlier conversations with the police station and a military base (felt foolishly uncomfortable) to see if anyone had reported any sightings to no avail - bought a telescope came home that night 9 hours later and it was still there. Frantically I set up the Celestron scope with a 4 1/2&#34; (114mm) x 910mm accommodated by a 10 &amp; 25mm lense and 1/2 hour later went outside with it where we had a clear view but not a satisfied magnification of it. My wife and I was sure and precise to it&#39;s location but we lost interest after a couple of hours when it would no longer perform for us. As I sit and type this report 42 hours later from that first moment I saw that bright light outside my kitchen window......(pause) I stopped to look at my now frequent favorite spot in the sky between the telephone wires and see what looks like a distant star in our exact location......will it move again? Who knows? You can bet we will keep looking. But, it has been nice to tell our experience to someone after those foolish sounding phone calls. However foolish, to see what we saw was fun and exciting and a  previlege to have had a little disc! overy channel stuff right in our backyard. Thanks for your time - we are your newest fans of your great web site and the job that your doing.....maybe you can reccommend a quality telescope with photographic capabilities. Thanks again!<n>

Glowing object stationary for 6 to 7 minutes. Object turns on end, then turns to show triangle shape with bright light on one end then disappears instantly to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving down Hiway 6 heading to Holstein with my son.  We noticed a very bright light ahead in the west.  It was about 6:05pm and the sun had gone down, but the sky was orange and clear with no clouds. We noticed that the object was not moving, there were two jets farther west behind the object, which I used to judge size. The object was very large and was stationary for 6 to 7 minutes.  As we turned south off of Hiway 6 on to the junction road that leads to Holstein we kept our eye on the object, which seem to be turning in place on end, to give it a long shape that look like a long glowing cylinder. Then the object turned again and we could see that it was a triangle shaped object, with a very bright light on one of the points.  We were head for the next gravel intersection road to turn west to watch the object.  We turned right and while we were watching the object, it seemed to dim a bit, then it was gone instantly.  We proceeded down the road further, but there was no sign of anything.  This object seemed to be very large and was definitley triangle shaped from our last view of it.  It was very impressive.  It was not dark out yet, and the sky was clear, so there is no doubt that we saw something very unusual.<n>

We pulled the car over into the breakdown lane to observe the lights. As they passed overhead there was no sound, and I couldnt make out any shape of a craft, as they seemed pretty high up. After they passed over us we got back into the car and continued driving down the highway. The color of the lights had changed to red, and they seemed to have doubled. They coninued to move west until the lights faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

All started one night on the way home from work where I dont usually get off until 12:30AM.  I have tried to rule out airplanes and stars but the light never moves and is too big to be a star.   I understand about &#34;gases&#34; on survice of stars and how they give off color.   What I have been seeing are different colors together but they are in a straight line with usually a bright white light slightly below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve pointed these lights out to my Son and Husband but their reaction is..it&#39;s a star.  Well, tonight I saw the biggest and brightest one of all since Christmas Eve, 2008.  The light was much, much lower then previous lights and therefore was bigger they most lights I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came out my back door around 8:30PM to go to town to grocery store.  I watched the light for several minutes before pulling our of driveway and it never changed position.  Went to townm did my shopping and when I came back out the light was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove home (going West out of Denton, TX) I continued to observe the light.  When I arrived at home it appeared to have gone further West of where I had first observed it but still very bright and low.  I mentioned it to my Husband when he came outside and he confirmed that he had seen it earlier...about two hours ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been seeing similar lights now over the past 10 months.  They appear for several nights in a row and then disappear only to reappear later.  Sometimes they come back in different location.  They always have the same appearance.  A even level of colored lights with a singular white light slightly lower to the left.<n>

We were approimately 5 miles on interstate I-20 (west bound) out of fort jackson looking toward the city of Columbia. I noticed an object in the air that I could not identify. (I am a licensed Pilot) I attempted to look at it further to identify the object as I do often to practice (scanning technique) for flying. The object was cone shaped with what looked like a flare on the top 1/5 of the object. Silverer in color and seemed to be vibrating (car was stable so this was ruled out)Car = Nissan Maxima. It was also near dust so an aircraft should have had it&#39;s lights on. I do know there was helicopter activity in the fort jackson area due to an over flight of an apache attack helicopter earily at the RC Field (gave us a little scare). But this object did not look like a helicopter. The object did not appear to have any kind of velocity. We passed the object, it was on the drivers side I was in the passenger seat, I leaned over to see the object from the back seats and it was gone. The other witness is a RC Pilot and grew up with airplanes his father was a light bird in the army who flies to this day. I am sepectical of this object, I am thinking about calling columbia&#39;s approach control and asking them if they had anything on radar for that area.<n>

Both performed unlimited climbs until disappering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That morning, was warming up for a fitness test at a local track. I was facing West when I noticed two red lights cruising at a high rate of speed from the North (the direction of Jacksonville) to the South Southwest(towards Orlando). Best guess of altitude was +20,000 feet. Sky was completely clear, morning twilight was beginning in the East. Initially thought the two lights were from the same aircraft and the red lights would have been position lights on the left side of the aircraft. However, I noticed no strobe lights, beacons, etc. which are normally present on aircraft. At exactly the same time, a passenger plane took off from Daytona Beach Int&#39;l giving me a visual reference in the sky. I realized the two red lights were moving even faster than I thought and were two distinctly seperate objects. As they passed the due West position in formation, they shifted, without changing speed. Object #1 made several sharp turns and course reversals, then shot straight up into the clear sky until completely fading away. Object #2 stopped and stayed stationary during the manuevers of object #1. It then spiraled around the first object as it climbed out of view. Both lights diminished as they traveled farther up into the sky (unlimited climb). Aside from the momentary noise of aircraft taking off, no other noise during the quiet, calm morning. I am a civilian and military pilot and familiar with various types of high speed/highly manueverable aircraft. Absolutely none have that capability. While observing, I immediately was able to rule out any known aircraft, atmosphereic phenomena (clear sky, stars visible) and due to the maneuvers, rule out anything like meteors, pulsing stars, etc.<n>

I have become quite familiar with the many aspects of our universe and especially sighting meteors in all their various shapes and sizes. What I saw the morning of January 15 , 1998 was different than anything I have ever observed.  At approximately 5 a.m., I spotted what appeared to be Venus in the southern sky.  Realizing that that couldn&#39;t be the case, I stared intently at an object which grew at least twice the size and brightness of Venus.  Then, as if someone turned a dissolve switch, this object reversed its growth to nothing but dark. I did not observe any other light source after witnessing this remarkable phenomenon.<n>

I was about 15 at the time and was awake in my bedroom with a friend (with the lights off) waiting to fall asleep.  Suddenly and silently, an electric green filled my room, coming in through windows that looked out over the road.  The green was an aqua shade.  As I recall, the light seemed to pan across the room.  Both of us became immediately frightened and confused.  There was no sound and we could see (while still lying on the bed) no source for the light.  The green light filled the room for approx. 5-10 seconds, and then suddenly and completely shut off.  We listened but heard nothing (like a plane or helicopter flying away, and a quick glance at the moonlit road revealed a smooth and unbroken bed of snow; no vehicle big or small had disturbed it in quite some time.  As soon as the light went off, we noticed that the house had experienced a brief electrical problem as we could hear the answering machine resetting, and the electric clocks were flashing 12:00.  There are power/communication lines that run from nearby towers to the house, but never before or since have I witnessed any phenomenon similar to the green light.  My friend and I were frightened and excited, but decided to try to go to sleep.  Less than 10 minutes later, my friend alerted me saying, &#34;It&#39;s happeneing again&#34;.  I opened my eyes to find a much softer glow, this time appearing to be focused somehwere outside my room.  I said, &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; and jumped out of bed and went to the window and looked out to see the house across the street completely aglow; the entire back of this two-story white home was extremely bright.  The light, this time, was much whiter and seemed to me to be pulsing at a frequency of about 1-2 nodes per second. (My friend would later describe the second light to be changing from white to brief spots of green and red.) For the entire duration of this second light (20-30 seconds), my friend (now joining me at the window) and I searched for a source for  the light, and found none.  The house was glowing as if some very bright light was pointed at it from above the house about 20ft from the rear wall and 20ft above the roof, but nothing was visible.  Again, complete silence throughout, and again, suddenly the light was gone, as if it had never been.   Though my friend and I were very freaked out and certainly studied the possibility that we had just witnessed a close encounter, I later became convinced that the lights were nothing more than electrical surges or what-have-you caused by heavy snow/ice on the wires in the area.  Now, however, I am unsatisfied by that explaination, as I have never heard of or seen anything similar before or since.  I never saw an object.  I don&#39;t know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

All of the lights continued moving in the same direction as the original light; none appeared to fall, which I assume they would have had they been flares dropped from the original light (well, airplane, in that instance). Also, each of the lights--the original, as well as those that came &#34;out&#34; of it--were identical in apparent size--they were point sources--as well as color, luminosity, etc. They were identical, so far as I could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The original object was traveling much too slowly to have been a meteor or other bolide breaking up in the atmosphere--or so I would judge. I distinctly remember that I had the impression that it was not a natural object of that sort, but rather an object--objects--under intelligent control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I had written down precisely what happened right after I saw it, because the details are now a little fuzzy. For instance, I cannot recall now if all of the subsequent lights &#34;merged out&#34; of the original light, or if each new light then split into another one; it may well have been the latter. In any case I remember being very perplexed by it. It was certainly out of the ordinary. I am an amateur astronomer, and this was something I had never seen before. I don&#39;t know what it was--I&#39;m not prepared to say it was an alien spacecraft or anthing of the sort--but it was definitely something I could not identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a skeptic, but I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m interested in the topic of UFOs. One point that may interest some: one often hears from (other) skeptics and debunkers that astronomers--i.e., people accustomed to observing the night sky and familiar with its various phenomena, from eclipses to apparitions of the planets to meteors, etc.--never report seeing unusual objects in the sky. Well, I just did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

A cell phone call to my wife following in another car confirmed she saw same lights. Similar to lights seen Mar. 7, 1997 in same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were driving separate cars home together on Estrella parkway which heads south at the point where I saw two amber lights through trees and low on the horizon over the area of Rainbow Valley south of Estrella Mountain Ranch. They appeared to be dropping below the crest of the hill up which we were travelling. As we arrived at the intersection of Elliot and Estrella Parkway they dropped below our line of sight into the area of Rainbow Valley. The area is southwest of the Estrella mountains. They lights were seen intermittently as we traveled from the beginning of the Estrella Mountain Ranch property until the intersection of Elliot and Estrella.  A time of about 5  minutes and a distance of several miles. I spoke to my wife by cell phone and she confirmed that she too saw the lights.  She thought they might be flares.  I had seen similar lights about 6 days before the March 13 PHX event in the same general area. I have reported that event in a separate correspondence with Peter,q.v. These lights are similar to those described and observed by others in the March 13, 1997 10 PM event over the Estrella Mountains.  The observer is a court reporter, a MUFON member and, a private pilot since 1949 with 30 plus years as a flight crew member with a major airline.<n>

Me, and another car behind me(I apologize for I never asked for his name) stopped and gawked for a few moments at this beautiful sight. It hovered silently for roughly five seconds, then, without warning, the ball suddenly zipped off into the night sky. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed in my life.

As we descended from Hancock&#39;s Summit, I noticed a light skirting the ridgeline that surrounds Area 51 to our left several miles in the distance.  We took app. 8 minutes of videotape of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object is reddish-orange, and appears to be a typical disc-shaped UFO turned on its face.  At first I thought the camcorder was out of focus, but later in the footage, half of the object is clearly obscured by the mountains.  The object was a minimum of 13 miles away (I need to get a detailed map of the area with correct scale to figure out an exact minimum distance).  The object blinks, changes in luminosity, disappears and reappears, gets enormous, moves a great distance to the right and back again in an instant (although this may be camera motion), moves quickly to the right and disappears.  The object&#39;s structure is readily apparent in the video:  a disc with a ring around the outer edge, and a darker &#34;hub&#34; in the middle. I was shown another video clip of the same object in Rachel the next day--much better quality, but without the mountains as a frame of reference.  There are four groups doing analysis on my tape, and the footage will be posted on my website and several others when analysis is completed.<n>

Eventually the light starting moving as if an aircraft was traveling towards me and veering away.  It began to accelerate rapidly and disappeared during the time of a quick glance at my watch. There was no sound, no wind. There was a band of clouds on the horizon, although I was able to see stars above me.  It was gradually getting lighter, although the light was distinctively different than a planet or star. There were no other typical hints of it being an aircraft, e.g. extra red light, or blinking light.<n>

The fireball broke apart into &#34;three, flaming-orange chunks&#34; northeast of our position on I-25.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were returning from Denver to Colorado Springs after attending the Colorado Avalanche vs. Ottawa Senators game. We were driving on I-25, headed South. The night was relatively clear and brisk. The temperature was about 20 deg F and there was fairly extensive snow cover along the interstate. I also believe the moon was prominent on this night because it was unusually light outside for the hour. My friend and I were talking and listening to the radio when, all of a sudden, all hell broke loose. The ENTIRE sky, from the Front Range to the eastern horizon, erupted with a pulsating, incredibly bright, white light.  Due to the steep angle at which the object approached us, its speed, and it&#39;s approximately S-SW to N-NE flight path (which roughly paralleled our path on I-25), we were unable to observe it directly. In other words, the roof of our vehicle was in the way of our view. However, as the object travelled NE and neared the ground, it came into view out the drivers side window. We then observed the object break apart into 3, flaming-orange chunks to our NE just beyond a series of bluffs (about 5 miles away I would guess), at which point it disappeared. We heard no sound during this event, probably because of engine/road noise and because the car stereo was on. I hate to say this, but my absolute, first thought when I saw the pulsing light was that we were being abducted or attacked by a UFO. My second thought was that there was no way it was lightening (too cold, wrong time of year, clear skies, no storms around, etc, etc.). My third thought was &#34;someone get this damned roof out of my way so I can see what the hell is going on!&#34;. And then, I finally realized that it must have been a meteorite which broke apart into at least 3 large pieces. Needless to say, this event was all my friend and I talked about the rest of the way back to Colorado Springs. Once we got to town, we started hearing radio reports regarding what we had witnessed. Apparently, it was a meteorite, complete with sonic bo! om heard all along the Front Range. Regardless of what it was, I will never forget that night and feel privileged to have witnessed (indeed, survived) it from such close proximity.<n>

It was January and it was cold, so I was sitting in my car letting it warm up.  Incidently, there was no frost, snow, or anything else on my windshield that would impair my vision, or any sight seen through that windshield.  I was just staring straight aheadand noticed movement in the sky.  A point of very bright light that was about the size that a large planet would appear in the night sky, moved quickly and deliberatly in a perfectly straight, horizontal line from the point it had been sitting at to a point an unknown distance away (it may have moved about a foot if a ruler could be held to the sky).  Upon abruptly stopping, it disappeared.  I was unsettled as I had never seen anything like this before. It was a point of light in the sky that suddenly and unexpectedly moved.  I had watched it remain inanimate for approximately 1 minute before it just took off.  It was not a meteorite or shooting star, as these don&#39;t move horizontally in such a perfect line, or with such deliberate manner.  A plane (of the kind that are seen around here, namely commercial jets) cannot possibly move that quickly.  The episode took place in the Eastern sky, the light moved from north to south, and lasted approximately five minutes....<n>

The object looked like the moon or the sun, but in completely the wrong part of the sky, shining through a slight fog/haze. I watched it as long as the traffic stayed still, it did not move, nor as far as I could hear, did it make a sound.  It did not look like anything I had ever seen before.

We saw the &#39;moon&#39; glowing a bright orange low in the sky in the east. We realized the moon was high in the sky, and that this was a total anomaly/ufo. It started moving, assuming a cigar shape/outline with a tongue of flame under it and to the the rear. We noticed other cars pulling over to get a better look and as I started to do so I looked up again and saw it disappear, leaving only a glint of light where it had been. Amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a psychiatric social worker and am perfectly healthy and sane. I am 44yrs. Have a Masters degree. Have always worked. Have never seen a ufo before. I was on holiday with my wife and kid. My wife also saw it, and she has a similar background as myself.<n>

At first it looked like a balloon in the far off distance, but then it just stopped and hovered.  I went downstairs to go outside and see it better.  I grabbed the binoculars and told my mom to come check it out. It started to move again to the  west, (coming from the north) in a straight line.  It then began to bob and weave in a way that no flying object I&#39;ve ever seen or heard of.  Through the binoculars it appeared to be very bright with a hint of a metallic, silver-type shade to it.  After about five minutes, we lost behind the clouds<n>

A more accurate report was filed with the Ventura/Santa Barbara MUFON chapter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in the car parking lot of Albertsons in Camarillo. It was the early evening and the sun had just set. The sky was sufficiently dark to see stars and it was clear exept for maybe a few cirrus clouds. I was facing NW and had just reached forward to change the radio station when out of the corner of my eye, to the right, I saw what I had first thought to be firework embers falling down from the sky. There were about 12 to 20 whight lights, about the magnitude of polaris, falling down in a ring formation. Suddenly these &#34;firework&#34; embers did something rather unusual. They stopped dead in the sky. This ring was suspended at what I estimate to be an altitude of maybe 1500 feet though I am not good at estimating altitude and they maye have been much higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 1.5 second pause, these lights suddenly started swarming around eachother erradically. If I recall correctly some were &#34;glittering&#34;. This swarm moved almost right overhead me and some of the lights left the swarm and flew around the sky while others appeared to join the swarm from higher altitudes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of the lights in this swarm started to become brighter and most of the lights in the swarm merged with these two brighter lights while the remaining ones flew out of the swarm and faded from few. These two bright lights now moved closer to eachother and then started blinking on and off in sequence. One would blink on while the other would blink off. At this point in the event, the object(s) would easly pass for a cessna. The blinking lights slowly began to move NW, parallel with the hill that runs behind Camarillo where I eventually lost sight of them behind the houses on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside the market to tell my mom what I had just saw. A few minutes later on the way home we saw three or four fighter jets, in formation, flying from the direction the lights disappeared from. I imagine the jets were dispatched from Vandeberg AFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was a military Air Traffic Controller with the rank of Captain at the time of this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first event was while I was home in bed, around 01:00 in the morning, and I awoke and looked up and there was a green coloured circle on the ceiling about 1cm in diameter and moving slowly across the ceiling for about 1 meter.  I sat up to take a closer look but it disappeared.  I thought perhaps I was imagining it or dreamt it and thought nothing of it and laid back down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About half an hour to an hour later I awoke again and looked up and saw the same light again, in a different spot, slowly moving across the ceiling.  My wife at the time also noticed it and asked me about it but like the last time, it only lasted a couple seconds.  It almost appeared to be a laser pointer but in green and a wider diameter.  I checked under the bed, in the closet, out the window, just in case someone was playing a prank, but all the children were asleep, and I could not find anyway a light could get displayed on the ceiling without us being aware.  I thought it very strange but could not explain it, so I didn’t think much of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second event happened about a week later, while I was working a midnight shift in the control tower.  It was again about 01:00 in the morning when I saw a green sphere in the east near the vicinity of Belleville.  It was hard to judge the distance but it was about perhaps 10 km away and roughly the daimeter of the main body of a C-130 Hercules aircraft, not the newer stretched version.  The green colour looked the same as the light on my bedroom ceiling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stunned by what I saw and asked the radar terminal if they had anything on their scope 10 east but they replied negative.  I asked the meteorological section if there was anything that could create a ball of green light that could hover, perhaps ball lightning, but again, Met replied negative.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the ground crew on the ramp called up to the tower asking me if I saw the light, and so I knew it was not just myself seeing it.  I was too stunned to think of recording it, which is a shame and I truly regret not having done that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 seconds of just hovering in one spot, about 1,000 AGL, it disappeared to the north.  It did not disappear in that it suddenly wasn’t visible, but it accelerated with such speed that it disappeared out of sight in less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have witnessed many modern fighter jets at full acceleration with their afterburners going and that would be magnitude of orders slower than what that ball of green light moved at. No human would be able to withstand the G-force that would have generated accelerating so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had not told anyone this story since at least half the people ridiculed me and accused me of being on drugs or making it up.  I searched to see if there were any other reports of such an event at that time but never did find any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure if you accept reports dating this far back but while I cannot remember the exact date, I will always remember the details and it gives me the chills sometimes when I recall the event.<n>

As my father and I traveled west along I-90, we saw a blue-green sphere (or light that made a large sphere shape).  It was about 2:30AM and we were headed home from WSU where we had just dropped off my older brother.  The light shot up from above the mountains making a parabola path.  It went up at about the same speed as a large firework and then came down.  At that moment I percieved the light to be a firework.  Then we saw it come out from the mountains farther to the left.  It shot out of view.  Now after this happened shivers shook all through my body.  The second look assured me it was no firework.  I looked to my dad and asked &#34;what was that?&#34;  My dad is the absolute biggest sceptic so he passed it off as a meteor.  He said &#34;it  must have been a meteor.&#34;  I replied &#34;meteors don&#39;t arc like that and fly away.&#34;  He didn&#39;t want to talk about it anymore.  It looked very large and very far away.  It was about half the size of the moon but it seemed to be right over the mountains.  This is the best part.  The paper the next morning (the next day) had an article on the sighting!  It was in the Tacoma News Tribune!  My dad showed me and the family.  The article said that seven people had called and others were sure to have seen it.  That is how big this object was! We were miles from anyone on the east side of the mountains and we saw it! These people saw it undoubtable from the opposite side of the mountains. It would be great if you read that article even though it has no description of the object.<n>

Approximately 10:55 pm in Wisconsin, USA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three people were driving from Milwaukee to West Allis on a routine 20 minute drive to drop off a companion on a cold New Year&#39;s night. While on the apex of a bridge adjacent to an industrial area, the back passenger spotted a golden light, flashing at a rate of about 4 flashes per second, moderately high in the dark southwestern sky [see FIGURE 1]. It was about the size and color of a small, golden street light, fixed in the sky behind and to the left of the vehicle. The back-seat passenger alerted the driver and the front passenger to the peculiarity of the light, and they all thought it might be some sort of &#34;helicopter&#34; or &#34;star&#34;. As there was hardly any traffic, the driver slowed the vehicle down between 10 to 15 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object conspicuously glided down towards the ground and closer to the observers. It ceased flashing and became a solid &#34;gold-light orb&#34; [see FIGURE 2]. Now seeming to be only a few blocks away to their left (west), it began to parallel the movement of the vehicle—keeping up with its exact speed.. It was fairly low to the ground because it was somewhat being obscured by some thin tree branches (without leaves) along the roadside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vehicle, now having passed off the bridge, continued to move northbound towards a major intersection. As the driver slowed even more to get into the left-hand turn lane at a stop light, a red light rotated around the left side of the object, and then a blue light rotated around to the right side of the object. Both lights stopped at the visible edges and remained fixed at the object&#39;s respective sides for only a moment—disappearing within seconds [see FIGURE 3]. At this point the object was moving at its slowest. Because of the sudden appearance of the “police” lights and its speed, the witnesses concluded that it must be a police helicopter on a mission.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the car sat at a complete stop in the left-hand turn lane, there were a few cars to the right of the vehicle. But people in those cars were not looking toward the object, which was traveling at a laborious pace very low to the ground (perhaps a 100 ft). It could barely be seen unless you were looking for it. As the object began to cross over the avenue they were going to turn onto (west), it now appeared to “branch out” into a string of five pale-white lights. It moved silently, almost at “walking speed”. The witnesses rationalized that it might be some sort of plane trying to make an emergency landing - but why land perpendicular to the street?  The lights suddenly stopped and became fixated directly above an estimated seven story factory building just two blocks away. The traffic light changed to green, and the driver finally turned left toward the object; it was just up ahead. No other cars or people were out on this usually busy street. Curiosity and perplexity filled the witnesses as they moved closer to the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, the car pulled over to the side of the road. The back passenger rolled down his window and stuck his head out of the car to observe what could be resting in the sky above. The other two people strained to get a good view from the front passenger window. What seemed like a string of lights from a few blocks away on approach were actually the lights on the &#34;front&#34; and underneath of a large, black, equilateral triangle object. The five lights shown down like &#34;baseball stadium lights&#34;, and were located at all three corners and in the middle of the two &#34;front&#34; sides [see FIGURE 4].<n> <n><n> <n><n> This large object was “fixed” in the air, producing absolutely no noise, movement, or flashing. Everything around them seemed so still, almost like they were in a vacuum and “weren’t supposed to be there.” The body of the triangle was colored charcoal-black, with a faint, grayish grove running along the front tip to the back center. There were visible sides: the edges showing a continuous grayish-black indentation with a slight overhang or lip. There also seemed to be very faint “circuit board” type etches on the body of the object. These apparent etchings were more apparent in the center grove on the “belly” of the triangle and within the groove or indentation along the sides. One witness later remarked that some of its features reminded him of a “Star Destroyer” space vehicle from the Star Wars movies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approximately 30 seconds of viewing the object, the driver became agitated and fearful, saying that they “have to get out of here.” He drove away and continued westbound on the avenue. When they left, the object left their point of view. But as they increased their distance at a block away, it came into view again in the back window, still fixated in the sky in the exact position last seen. Anyone else viewing the object might have passed and though nothing of it. It was so still and innocuous, that they probably would have thought it was part on the building complex. As the car passed over a hill a few blocks west of the object, it could not be seen any more. No other cars were observed on the road until about a half mile later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total experience was less than 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three witnesses remained shaken for the rest of the night, with one of them insisting that it must be some sort of police helicopter performing a maneuver, and never wanting to talk about it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most disturbing thing to the witness in the back seat was that even though he had been a big “UFO buff” from the time he was young, the word “UFO” or “alien” never entered his mind until after the triangle was completely out of view. He even had other UFO related experiences before this, but still cannot explain why he wasn’t “freaking out” at the time. The best explanation was that “he was denying it in his mind to keep his body from freaking out.”  The strangest element to the whole experience was the apparent personal awareness the object had to the witnesses. It got their attention by flashing, moved in and followed alongside the vehicle at a distance, changed forms, and seemed to wait for them and them only.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

The sighting took place in 97 or 98, I think.  Anyway, I was carring munitions out to the flight line, I stopped to do a FOD check before entering the flight line when a black diamond shaped object flew over the flight line and runway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The runway runs east to west and the object came from the north heading south.  I would say it was the size of a large suv.  It had no wings and made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing should not be flying.  It was in the middle of the day, nice clear sky, it couldnt have been over a 100 feet high and maybe a couple of hundred feet in front of me.  I just stood there and watched it fly south until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The flash lasted about 15 seconds from the time it came and went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flash was so bright it appeared to be coming out of my own backyard.  The four other people who witnessed it were outside and say the flash filled the sky.<n>

Vanished.|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03005.html|80|ndxe199801| Summary : 28-30 Lighted objects coming up over the city hovering and almost coliding with one another. Red lights escorting them. Vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7:30 pm witnessed over 25 hovering, soundless crafts. Bright glassey lights where coming from the objects. Low to the ground, spining, slow moving. Red lights were escorting crafts. Traveling in straight lines over the city, then dispersing on there own. A fighter plane flew overhead, and they all disappeared. 3 witnesses, sober, stable women. I am 37, and not crazey. All the dogs in the neighborhood were barking. Reported to the airport. They saw nothing. Found that hard to believe, because they were coming one after the others in regular sequences. I do not believe in UFO&#39;s, so I am looking for a solution to what we saw. Called the radio stations, no sky shows that night.<n>

She could not give me an exact date, but it was around 1997-1998. At the time she was living in a 13 story apt building. The windows of her apartment face north and you can see the Empire State Building and the Hudson River directly to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 6am or so in the morning she awoke to the noises of car horns going off at street level, so she went to the living room to look through the window to see what the commotion was all about. She noticed, directly in front of the apartment complex, three disk shaped objects hovering at maybe 300 feet or so in the air! She described the objects looking like a wheel with spokes that connected to a disc or sphere in the middle. The area between the spokes, or bars, was open space. The crafts, she said, rather looked like an old fashion horse drawn carriage wheel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were completely still in the air in a vertical position. She noticed people out in the street where also looking up at these objects and other people becoming aware of what was going on since it was very early and people were leaving for work. She had been observing the objects for 15 minutes or so when two helicopters arrived. The choppers stayed hovering in place for a while, and then began moving closer to the objects. The crafts started tilting into a horizontal position and then slowly moved up and away from the area while gaining speed till they where no longer visible. The helicopters pursued but could not keep up. The entire event lasted about 30 minutes or so, probably longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandmother immediately turned on the TV to see if there was any breaking news about the sighting, but nothing was reported. For the entire week, she followed the news, including the newspapers, but nothing ever came up about the event. I’m sure that whoever was in the helicopters must have been recording the event with video or something. Needless to say, it was an incredible event for my grandmother to witness!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>
1/1/98 04:00|Huelo|HI|Light|1 hour|I've seen many strange things, from beings in my room to faces looking down on me, and I was not alone!!|2/25/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27766.html|82|ndxe199801| I&#39;ve seen many strange things, from beings in my room to faces looking down on me, and I was not alone!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout the years this experience seems to have faded and perhaps just ahve been a dream. But the reality of it is that I was not alone, I was with my best friend, and it really happened. For about a year, during this time we were in an unpopulated area of Maui, My friend and I would nightly see strange lights moving in ways aircraft just does not. Everyone we told riddiculed us. Except for the other people on our property. They had even more bizzare stories to tell us, but those are thnere sories. It was believed to be a spot in the world were other life was drawn to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow, One evening I was asleep, my friend in the bed, and I awoke with a sound of knoking in my head, maybe ESP? I looked out the window and quite close was a spaceship with colorful changing lights shining at us. I freaked out and punched my friend in the arm until she awoke. At that moment we both saw a figure standing at the end of the bed. Wewent under the covers and screamed for a while. then got out of bed as it was gone and the ship had backed off a bit. It stayed there until sunrise slowly backing away as we curiosly shined our flashlights at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We exchanged stories with one another and we both saw a tall figure with a huge head, she says she saw big eyes. This creature from another world had paid us a visit, without even using a door, though it did susconsciously knock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on in life we&#39;ve talked about this, and also realized that many nights we had both woken up with aliens looking down at us and we were unable to move. The strange thing is how it happened to us both seperatly but only on the side of the bed that was not against the wall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
1/1/98 02:00|Elizabethtown|IL|Triangle|4 minutes|Triangular object traveling south crossed the highway in front of us hovered then turned east and left with no sound.|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13222.html|83|ndxe199801| Triangular object traveling south crossed the highway in front of us hovered then turned east and left with no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object crossed the highway in front of us coming from the north.  It was approx. 50 feet off the ground and traveling slowly.  We stopped and I got out to see it better.  It was cold and clear out with no moon.  I could see the details by the street lights.  It stopped by the water tower just yards east of it, ocillated, turned toward the east, then sped off. The only sound was as it left, it sounded like a &#34;tubine&#34; winding down during shut off.  The object was triangular shaped with the front being the base of the triangle.  There were 3 red lights. One one each corner.  The surface appeared to have a lot of conduit type fixtures on it.  When it left, it passed right over a trailer home of the Mayor of the town.  When I got home, I call the mayor and asked him if he had heard anything approx. 15 min earlier.  He stated that he and his wife didn&#39;t hear any thing but they had experienced an earthquake about that time.  He said the walls started shakeing with items falling from shelves.  I contacted Fort Campbell Ky and asked if they had any helocopters in our area.  They would not confirm.  They finally put the flight commander on the phone and the conversation went something like this:  Me: &#34;Sir, I know that you people have been having problems with the night vision equipment lately but I need to know if you or Scott AFB have any birds in the area over southern Illinois.&#34;  Commander: &#34; Sir, I can&#39;t give that information out.&#34;  Me: &#34;I understand that.  The reason I am asking is I just saw something very unusual.&#34;  Commander: &#34;What did you see?&#34;  Me: &#34;I saw something cross Hwy 146 in Harding county Illinois at Elizabethtown coming from the north going south.  It was about 50 feet off of the ground and almost hit the water tower.  With the problems that you have been having with Night Vison, they shouldn&#39;t be that low in a residential area.&#34;  Commander: &#34;Maybe it was a civilian aircraft.&#34;  Me: &#34;I don&#39;t want you to think I&#39;m crazy but I&#39;ve never seen an aircraft like that.  Your birds are always flying! over ou r area and I know what helocopters look like but this was different.  I got a good look at it.  It was low.  It stopped not more than a hundred feet from me and my wife and hovered.  It made no sound at all untill it left, then it sounded like a turbine winding down.  It had 3 red lights that did not blink.  I could not see a cockpit or windows.&#34;  Commander:  &#34; Which direction was traveling when you last saw it?&#34;  Me:  East.  I got out of my vehicle and watched it leave at a high rate of speed.&#34;  I then told him about the mayor&#39;s statement to me. The Commander said &#34;Sir I can&#39;t tell you where our birds are due to security, but I can tell you that neither us nor Scott AFB have had any aircraft in your area all day. Do you wish to make an official report?&#34;  Me: &#34; No.  I work for the Illinois Department of Corrections.  I may sound crazy but I&#39;m not.  I don&#39;t need the problems.&#34;<n>

Stayed in oproximately same spot for about 30 minutes +.  Seems to be hovering pretty high off the ground, but too low for a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We viewed this object with a 10/50 binoculars.  We can only see that it is a fast blinking light, it was too far to see, about 20 miles away.  It blinked rapidly red, green and white.  It didnt move much, just seemed to hover pretty high off the ground, not moving fast at all. But a couple 1000 feet high off the ground, deffinitely not a star.  We called the airport and they showed nothing on radar, which was a 40 mile distance, and it was with in that proximity.  There were 4 of us that observed the UFO.  First was Carl, 45, no prior arrests, and didnt drink anything all night.  Second was Phil, 15, no drinks and no arrests.  Third was Pat, a little alchohol, and no prior charges.
