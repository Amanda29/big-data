It was a bright, clear and beautiful sunny day. My brother in law had a spool of kite string on his big toe and laying on the ground. All of a sudden he said &#34;look!&#34; We all looked up and saw a formation of saucer like disks in silver color. They were just hovering over the park quietly, no noise. They in a v shape like birds fly. All of a sudden they took off at a high rate of speed. This was a mass sighting. I tried to look up sightings over the enternet but haven&#39;t found any around that time. If anyone saw this they could draw a picture without mentioning it to them, I&#39;m sure. That would prove it really happened. There were to many witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

There was a blinking light at either end about twenty feet above the ovals and aboutfifteen feet out. the overall shape could not be determined because of weather conditions. I saw and heard the craft for fifteen minutes before it moved slowly away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>
3/5/57 19:30|Jena|LA|Sphere|15min.|Heading S. in my car on two lane highway entering Jena LA saw UFO's to the S.E. many cars stopped to abserve|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03449.html|4|ndxe195703| Heading S. in my car on two lane highway entering Jena LA saw UFO&#39;s to the S.E. many cars stopped to abserve<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were heading from the South Eeast to the North East at a steady pace there were no turns or gains or losses of altitude they were completely quiet. The speed seemed faster than any aircraft known to me.(I&#39;d just completed an enlistment in the Air Force and was familiar with the then current aircraft) There were three objects and each were three spheres joined two on the bottom and one on top forming a triangle. The color was light blue and seemed to be luminus. There appeared to be a formation two flying paralel and the other flying above the one flying further to the East. These objects were very visable and many cars stopped to abserve, it was a clear night and the highway was lined with people standing outside their cars. The curious thing was that though people talked about the event in a restaurant I stopped at the next day there was no reports on the media. I know this report is very old but thank you for the chance to file it.<n>
