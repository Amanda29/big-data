They lived on a farm in a rural area in the low country of South Carolina.  It was right at dawn just before daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Grandmother noticed that the mule and the other animals in the stable outside seemed unusually agitated.  As she stepped outside to investigate she observed a huge ball of light coming at tree top level toward the farm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As she stood watching the light descended but did not change speed.  At this point it was headed straight toward the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Frightened that the object was about to crash into the house, she ran inside to get my mother and aunt out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She proceeded outside and just before the light got to the house, it went back up to tree top level and left as quickly as it had appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother at the time was only five to six years old, but was an eye witness to this and says it is the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that day several other people in the area say they saw the same light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
