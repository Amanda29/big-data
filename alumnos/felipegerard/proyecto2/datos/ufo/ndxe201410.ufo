I was driving|Triangular object sighting in Charleston.|11/6/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115039.html|3|ndxe201410| Triangular Object sighting in Charleston<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on the James Island Connector towards James Island at 10:58 pm tonight (Halloween).  I was in the left lane (the fast lane) and I got a sense that somebody or something was watching me. Not in a bad or unsettling way, just had a sense I was being watched.  I then noticed a craft of sorts that was at about the 11 o&#39;clock position from where my car was (that is to say it was on my upper left). I was in disbelief what I saw! A car behind me was driving very close to me, annoyed that I was going slow, not realizing what was in the sky. The lights on this aircraft were not too bright, about the same brightness as the lamps on the Connector. There were four lights all together- one on top and three on the bottom. The one on top was a little bigger than the other three. I was seeing this in the dark, but I could make out a pitch black background of the aircraft- it was a triangular shape. When I got home, I asked my husband what he thought it could be,! for we have a military base close by to us. He thinks I am making up this entire story. I hope you believe me that I am not telling a tall tale and I know what I saw. I am not under the influence of drugs or alcohol when I saw this. The craft was fairly low, that is what initially caught my attention. It  was about the distance away from the highway as a kite would be that was flying in the air. The craziest thing about it was it seemed not to be moving- it seemed to be stationary. I did not hear any noise. If you have any other questions for me, I will try to answer it.<n>

They were about half a mile away from each other, completely silent, and moving slow.  They both disappeared at the same time.  I tried to record video of the objects but its hard to see them.  Although they were high in the sky my dog starting freaking out for no apparent reason.<n>

It seemed that low.  I live near an emergence clinic and see quite a few helicopters with all kind of lights.  But this was not one of them.  However there was sound and the light just seemed to turn off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I viewed the light for not 1/2 second but for approximately 3 or 4 seconds. I can&#39;t tell you in degrees how much the light traveled but looking into the sky and using my thumb and pointer finger I would guess about 5 or 6 inches.  I think what I saw was a meteorite.  I have seen 2 in my time and they both had a long tail.  If what I saw last night was a meteorite it did not have a long  tail.  Again using my fingers as a guide I would say the light was about 3 inches long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if this is any help to you but I was amazed by it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

The object was as big as a house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 31, 2014 at about 8:15 p.m. in Allen, Texas, I saw a triangular shaped object in the air about 400 to 500 feet above Highway 5, near Stacy Road.  The object was traveling from the North going South.  It was as wide as a house.  It did not have any lights on it. I know it was not a flock of birds because it was a solid object and the underside showed a whitish gray color throughout the triangular form…not just the V that you normally see with a flock of birds.  There was no wings flapping like you would see with birds.  The object seemed to glide easily through the air at a consistent speed and was traveling quite fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally, the object made no noise. It was completely silent.<n>

We were sitting by our front living room window waiting for trick or treaters when we both saw a bright light fly by. It was in the form of a sparkling round light with the color of orange and white.  It was considerably low in the sky just above the tree line, much lower than any commercial airline. It also moved considerably fast, too fast for any airplane.  It flew by in a matter of 3 seconds or less.  No sound was made nor were there any vibrations to our home. We have seen several &#34;falling stars&#34; before but this was so low in altitude during a cloudy/snowy night we determined it had to be something else. It did not seem to burn out but continue on its path, making a small change in direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I had noticed that there was a half moon in the very dark South East sky.  I drove North from SW 74th  on Santa Fe street towards SW 59th  and about half the distance I suddenly saw a very bright very white spherical object seem to move very fast at a descending angle of about sixty degrees towards the East.  It lasted about three to four seconds and then vanished.  I thought it could not be a meteor because it was so bright and white and I have seen many meteors in my time.  It may have been something that crashed but lost its brilliance before doing so.  Just a few hours earlier I was taking to a man about the year 1958 and I had said that that was the year that the Russians had managed to launch a satellite into Earth orbit … it was called &#39;Sputnik&#39;.  But the next day (Nov. 1St  today) I looked it up on Wikipedia and found out it was launched in 1957 and fell to Earth in 1958.  Anyway! it seems like an odd coincidence that I would even have the discussion about the first satellite, __  and then just hours later see this strange brilliant white object move in the dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I then noticed it was too bright to be a star. I told my husband to look at it, but then it disappeared.  About 5 minutes later I again saw the same size light but this time there were a bunch of them.  My husband and I saw 5-6 lights in a row that seemed to be over the white mountains.  It started with about three lights then another one showed up in the line, etc.  It didn&#39;t last long, then they were all gone. Very weird!  Wonder what it could have been?<n>

They would circle the home then pull in together and spread out again around the whole house. This went on from about 8:15 until 10:10. pm. My father and I thought we should see if they would stay focused on the house or if they would follow us down our long drive. To our awe they followed us down the drive and then back up to the home again. At first there were 4 orbs then 5..  They stayed at that number until we started praying and calling on the name of Jesus thats when the weirdest thing happen... They turned into 8 or 9 orbs all bright white...It&#39;s like they needed to call on more help.  We watched them for about another 10 minutes or so and then went into the house.  They had been over our house for so long we were getting really bored with them.  I think they knew we were over it cause the next time we looked out the door they were just gone... As fast as they cam! e they were just gone. We have had other sights of really strange things here were where at.  Our house is tucked into the woods and there is hardly no city lights of any kind so we see a lot of sightings here.  We have seen teardrop shooting lights also really bright lights that change in color but never anything like this past Thursday night.  We all couldn&#39;t believe our eyes and there was so many of them.  It&#39;s been 2 nights now and there hasn&#39;t been anymore lights so far.<n>

When the &#34;fireworks&#34; didn&#39;t explode that&#39;s when my interest peaked.  The fireballs moved up from the horizon (did not see their origin, just moving straight up) and then hooked a left towards the Verrazano Bridge.  They were traveling for about a minute and then were no more.  There could have been more but I saw 13 objects, bright orange and red.  They all originated from the same point in the horizon but when they turned left towards the VB they have different flight patterns.  Did anyone else see them?<n>

10/29/14 20:00|Carrollton|TX|Other|4-5 seconds|Craft with two rear propulsion engines accelerates and disappeared apx 600 yards as I turned around, and previous triangle craft|12/5/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115796.html|44|ndxe201410| Craft with two rear propulsion engines accelerates and disappeared apx 600 yards as I turned around, and previous triangle craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently, I started to smoke a tobacco pipe, and out of consideration for those that can&#39;t stand the smell, made a concerted effort to go out to a field/creek nearby.  I stand and wait just to bide time, and was drawn to observe the usual nighttime activity of plane sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observing the smoke from the pipe, and even watching out for passing vehicles driving to and from their homes so as not to draw unwanted suspicion, I would resume from ducking down and proceed as usual.  Considering I was observant of regular vehicles, likewise I was somewhat inclined to turn around suddenly and witness a somewhat traditional shaped aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I must note that this was within a very short distance from where I was standing, in a sloped field near an incline roughly 10-15 feet deep, with clear observation of the surrounding area, and somewhat isolated/localized sound observation.  Clean and clear night with a bright moon, and perfect visibility, with or without corrective lenses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within the span of several seconds I was able to observe what immediately seemed out of place, was not only a craft that appeared to be propelled by an alternative (plasma?) energy compared to a jet engine, but seemed to have an audible and noticeable hum as it propelled itself, though seemingly akin to the light noise of a motorcycle&#39;s rotary engine.  It seemed stationary in the sky as I looked up, and very clearly seemed to speed off (&#34;impossibly&#34; fast) upon first being noticed, only to very clearly disappear from sight.  No cloud coverage was present, and this craft could not have disappeared simply from having flown out of ! view, or behind coverage of a building or cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as the shape of the craft, I thought it seemed smooth bodied but perhaps similar to traditional aircraft; though I did not notice any wings on it.  Perhaps oval shaped, with engines that lit up but seemed to &#34;swirl&#34; with light, giving off a noticeable acceleration with greater illumination, and an almost purr-like quiet hum, seemingly difficult to notice if I wasn&#39;t already looking up at it (the sound did not draw my attention, and I honestly don&#39;t know why I turned around when I did.)  I stared up at the sky dumbfounded and asking myself &#34;what the F was that?&#34; over and over again.  It seemed to arch upwards at an angle and turned as it accelerated away from me, with what could have been an instantaneous 1000+ mph, as it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Noticing criteria for close encounters, I do tend to wonder if it could be possible such a thing was in progress; although I don&#39;t necessarily believe I have been a victim of such an event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior sighting I had was several years ago (apx 9/2012?) in nearly the same spot (I was driving home and had arrived around 10:15pm) and despite knowing what I was looking at, I wasn&#39;t startled.  It was a pitch dark triangle with three observable clean white lights on all three underside corners (similar to what has been described in the Aurora UFO project by USAF but without the central engine &#34;light&#34; in the middle.  It was an overcast of clouds and the ufo remained perfectly stationary below the cloud coverage.  I loop the vehicle around to park along the street to get out, and noticed it was gone.  Looking back I know I should have just stopped in the middle of the street and observed for awhile.<n>

We were able to watch this object move into our view field which was blocked by a tree line to the west, go overhead and over another tree line to the east. This light was a white light that at one point had gotten bright, and then dimmed back down to its &#34;normal&#34; bright glow.  This caught my eye because I see aircraft nightly when I go outside and look at the stars and this object did not have any strobe lights. This was a solid light which I exclaimed to my friend was a rare event that I had never seen before. My friend was telling me how he thought that this vehicle was an airplane 747 or some object that had a bright light on it. Moments later while giving my viewpoints on how that couldn&#39;t be a 747, we watched as a second craft flew towards us from the sam! e western direction. I quickly pointed to the craft and said &#34;Look&#34; another one. We watched as this craft started approaching from the west and without a gradual turn the object changed direction without missing a beat or stopping and started heading South West. This second object was starting to head southwest out of our view field so my buddy and I walked towards the street that I live on so I could get a better view of where the craft was going and what it was. This craft traveled South West for maybe 10-15 seconds maximum and then seamlessly changed directions to moving in a South Eastern direction. The light continued to move Southeast until we lose site of the object over houses that blocked the horizon. At this point in time our eyes are plastered to the sky and we are comparing this light we witnessed with other obvious aircraft lights in the sky. By now we are searching for another object to appear from the west when directly above us another light pops i! nto view not coming from any direction but seemingly coming &amp;q! uot;Down &#34; into view and then starts heading what I would call directly South. This 3rd object we could only keep in our view for 30 seconds or so max before it was behind a treeline. All three of these objects were simply bright white lights that I would estimate to have been approx 10-15x the size of the North Star for perspective. I would estimate that the first two objects flew way under planes we were watching in the sky while the 3rd object was obviously much higher and a slightly smaller light. While this was happening the dogs in the area were very amp&#39;d up and going nuts barking and when they passed a good distance from being directly overhead the dogs stopped barking. This happened on the first two craft while the third craft I do not recall if this happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of these separate sighting happened within 15 minutes of eachother and I must say that I really do feel honored to get to have seen this. The third craft was really the one that got my buddy because his airplane theory went out the window when it appeared out of nowhere directly above the top of us and I mean directly.<n>

I was in a parking lot, looking south.  I observed multiple objects emitting a red colored light.  The objects would originate from low on the horizon, and travel from the southeast to the northwest while gaining altitude.  So, from my vantage point, the objects were moving from left to right and upward.  Note that, if these were conventional aircraft, they would have shown a green light, as I was observing the starboard (right) side of the craft.  The objects appeared one or two at a time, and followed the same path as the previous.  I observed several of these red light objects originate low in the horizon and move upward and to the right along the same path in the sky, over the course of approximately 1 minute.  The objects were consistent in size and velocity with conventional aircraft, which were also visible in the sky f! rom my location (urban area) however, as previously mentioned, the coloration of the light was not consistent with conventional aircraft.  The light was reddish in color and had a pulse at a relatively low frequency, also some white light was visible within the red light emitted.  The objects were at a distance such that I was not able to observe their exact shape.  I was unable to detect any sounds from the objects, as the urban area was noisy at that time in the evening.  Also, each of the objects would apparently gain altitude until it appeared as a small pinpoint of light in the sky (star).  Two other witnesses observed the objects after I pointed them out in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was 7:18pm and there was no one else on the beach but us.  All of a sudden in the sky appeared approximately seven objects that were red and orange in color.  They were placed the same exact distance apart from one another, almost forming a triangular shape.  At first it seemed to be standing still in the sky, it made no noise at all.  It seemed to slowly drift or fade and then all of a sudden it was gone.<n>

We had seen many airplanes that night flying above us, but this was orange in color, and instead of having blinking lights on the wings, this would get brighter orange and bigger in size like it was pulsating while it moved.  It would totally fade out to black,  And then pulsate again while it held this horizontal trajectory.  Finally it just disappeared.  It was very odd.<n>

In the city of Moncton, New Brunswick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were driving down our street we seen something in the sky coming towards us that was about  300-400 up in the air.  Once it got beside us it hovered over us for about a minute and started flashing a red light while we waited at the stop sign to turn left.  It appeared to have a lot of lights on it and looked kind of square/rectangle shape.  Once we turned left to go down the street it started flashing its red light faster then kind of looked a bit oval as it flew off in the same direction as us in the distance.  Then it disappeared.  Not sure what to make out of it but it certainly didn&#39;t look or act like an airplane or a satellite.<n>

There was no sound, just complete silence, and the birds or whatever they were pale yellowish in color.  They were in a bent straight line as they moved south through the night sky.  The group of pale lights “birds” did not make any sound and after about 5-7 seconds were just gone.  The sky was clear and no clouds in sight…so not sure what it was, but due to the pale glowing figures moving fast and not making a sound has me baffled.<n>

So I stared at the sky (northwest in the sky over the gulf) to see if I indeed see something (i was still remembering the previous night&#39;s experience).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light, which were flashes and illuminated by very light clouds (why I thought it was lightning) was darting and spiraling across vast distances appearing and reappearing. From the North to the West then back North East I haven&#39;t seen activity like this before. It seemed playful and carefree (?).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As it left view another moved up and across the horizon with a fifth and last light appearing the same way and from the  same direction, move south until it was out of view. It is hard to say a distance. The objects made no noticeable sound and did not blink. They almost appeared to be two lights on top of each other. My wife videoed the last two. I used a 25x rifle scope to try and view the light source. I only saw a light halo the color blending with the sky surrounding each light. They moved more rapidly and one went down over then back up in a way I&#39;ve never seen any airplane or helicopter could move to my knowledge. It was similar to the Marfa lights only they came up and went out of view in the same manner as if following each other in very timed manner other than the third which looked to dim and move straight down, though as soon as we lost sight of it, the fourth appeared and continued as the first two. Used to seeing planes. Very different. A treeline and western sky were our view.Sorry, strange lights moved a cross the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Around 10:15 or so. It was like a plane flying overhead, but totally silent, and kind of transparent. I couldn’t tell if it was 100 feet or 50,000 feet above me, as it was ghost like. Burnt orange, with some brighter spots, but really it happened so fast I didn’t get a great look at it’s physical construct beyond knowing it was wing shaped and orange and ghost like. Transparent and fuzzy.  It came and went in a matter of a few seconds, flying north to south. Seemed like it was gliding on a very straight path. Just an amazing occurrence. I saw this thing! But what I say not exactly sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Out of my peripheral vision I thought I saw movement and focused my eyes to that location. It was then that I noticed a faint outline or almost translucent triangle object moving overhead. It was traveling straight south and seemed to glide without making any sound and was moving quickly as it was out of my sight within a minute or two at the most. There were no lights on this object or if there were they weren’t turned on, and it almost seemed to blend in with the night sky. We are located in a newer development so there is still a lot of wild life like duck; geese etc. so I first thought maybe it was just a large flock but with no sound as it moved it almost seemed ghostly. I have seen this exact object once before in our old home, once again just outside in the hot tub looking up at the sky, but it was traveling due east at that time. In both instances it was there and ! gone within a minute or so, I wasn’t even sure if I could have snapped a photo if you would have been able to see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We both watched as the object moved back and fourth through the sky.  It headed to the ground like it Was going to land, but went straight up into the sky moved left and right very quick and without changing altitude. then it went below the tree line.

I was on my way to a college recitation and had volunteering to drop my boyfriend off near his place of employment before I left town.  After dropping him off and turning onto Queen Ave from a parking lot that crosses with SE Hill Street I noticed something extremely bright in the sky. As I was moving west down Queen, the object was moving from the north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance, I thought the object I was looking at must be a plane.  The reasoning for this was because of a nearby airport, as well as how low the object seemed to be relative to the altitude that planes fly at when they have completed their ascent.  The object also appeared to be moving at a rate comparable to that of an airplane.  What compelled me to keep staring what the unbelievable brightness of the object.  Initially I thought that it may be reflecting the light from the clouds which were bright that morning.  The longer I stared at it, the stranger it seemed that there appeared no colored lights on the object.  I also began to notice that the object at first glance had appeared to be plane shape, but the longer I watched it move through the sky the more I was able to define that it appeared, in fact, as a crescent shape with its widest diameter parallel with the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I began to realize how out of sync this object was with what I am accustomed to seeing from a plane, I followed it&#39;s trajectory with my eyes as I continued to make my way west on Queen.  Next something very strange happened.  The object I had been watching moved in front of clouds that were much darker, gray color.  It was then I saw that the light didn&#39;t seem to be reflecting onto the object from the clouds, but coming from the object itself.  The best way to describe it, was that it appeared to be self-illuminated.  The color was a very bright white color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved west from my perspective.  A few moments later object stopped moving entirely. It was suspended in the sky, and no longer appeared crescent like it had when it was closer to me, but appeared orb-shaped.  The only thing I can compare it to is a star.  It looked like a low hanging star in our atmosphere in the middle of the morning.  After a five to ten second stillness, the object moved at a much, much faster rate west, or backwards from where I was staring.  The movement of the object at this point was unfamiliar to me, and the best way I can describe it was like it had moved at warp speed and now was the size of a needle pinhead in the sky.  It was then that I turned north onto Pacific Avenue from Queen and was unable to further locate the object in the sky.<n>

Then the light would go out and come back as an orange light in the same spot then it would move around the sky in different directions.

Boats don&#39;t have these lights, it was almost plasma like the way it changed. A white orb flashed once.  Like a signal...  The light that varied in color came from NW and continued South for about a half hour. Almost like it was looking down on something. Maybe following something.

It was a bright white light that seemed to move upwards then grew dim and something split off from it and became bright again.  After that it grew dimmer then disappeared.<n>

It was a clear night and we counted at least six white lights that were flickering at what seemed to be a much faster rate than ordinary commercial or military aircraft.  My first thought was that maybe Tucson Airport (or possibly Davis-Monthan Air Force base) was experiencing some kind of incident on a runway causing air traffic to backup and circle in a holding pattern.  This was not the case.  Soon it was clear that these lights were not &#34;flying&#34; but hovering in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not too long after the shimmering lights had appeared, a larger, bright orange light materialized beneath them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then things got a bit stranger.  The large orange light appeared to split into two distinct orbs, each retaining the same shape and color of the original.  In a matter of seconds the two lights merged together again into a single orb before vanishing along with the twinkling background lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my wife was more concerned about my staying on the road because I was starting to swerve in and out of my lane.  The best that I could tell is that at least some of the twinkling lights flew into the larger orange light.  I couldn&#39;t believe what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I exited Houghton Rd. we parked to see if the activity was still continuing.  We saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I started driving North on Houghton I looked into my rear-view mirror and saw the orange light appearing once again.  It did a repeat performance- split in two and then melded back into one light before vanishing.  Then that was it.<n>

I saw a large bright object moving in that exact trajectory at a high rate of speed and I had my wife come look at what I thought was the rocket.  There were no flashing lights or red and green lights on this object and it was moving too fast to be a jet.  I logged onto the NASA mission control site to watch the live feed and I hear that the launch was scrubbed due to a sailboat that was in the area below the projected path. I really want to know what was I looking at?  Unfortunately, I tried to watch the postponed launch again last night and the vehicle exploded right after takeoff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I am guessing it was around the Estes Park area but may have been as close as Taft Street between Fort Collins and Loveland Colorado, and was about as high up as a small 2 person plane would be.  It appeared to be rotating and had white lights. After looking through binoculars it had a clear disk shape and with white lights around the top between the disk and bulb. The surface of the disk was smooth and silver or white. It hovered in the air a while but then disappeared completely from site leaving a small black smoke cloud in its place. A few seconds later a large black aircraft appeared in the same location. I could not get a good visual of it as it was bouncing around. This was very strange as the size of it seemed too large to be moving around so fast.I have no idea where it came from or where it went but it was gone in a matter of seconds. After it disappeared another thick black smoke c! loud appeared in the location I spotted both unidentified flying objects and then dissipated. The object did not show up in pictures due to the sun, but the black smoke cloud did after both objects disappeared.<n>

There had been some noises in the yard, branches rustling and someone with a whistle.  I went out to tell them to get lost. I shined the lantern around and the cat meowed, so I called him over.  We headed back up the stairs and I looked out towards Kealia as habit.  Right at the to of the stairs, I am looking at the stars and a really bright object drops out of the sky.  The only reaction I had was to yell &#34;wow&#34;.  My wife was asleep. I traveled from the top of the cloud deck downwards quickly. Not fast like a meteor.  No straight line.  It &#34;fluttered&#34; back and forth a bit.  Still, it was really moving. I would guess 4-6 mile away (just off shore)..very bright white..like burning aluminum. I did not see a flare go up. Just this come down.  Waited 10m. for more..went to bed. I seen enough, I just hope they don&#39;t stop by.<n>

I need to know if others experienced something like this..<n> <n><n> <n><n> So my boyfriend and I walked outside to smoke, and we saw this strange object in the sky, moving in slow motions, back and forth, up and down... It was so bright, and it seemed as if it flashes red at some points.. So we continued to watch, and then we saw a helicopter approach it,a and it shined it&#39;s lights directly down onto it..  So my boyfriend and I were really intrigued now..  That helicopter left, and about 5 minutes later, we see this other one coming, and my boyfriend said &#34; be ready to see something strange happen..&#34;  And it passed it at first, then turned right back around, and shined it&#39;s lights down straight on it, and circle it.. It circled it for about 10 minutes... And I was just, in shock..  The helicopter left, and a third one came along, and did the same thing.. So we assume that people have been calling and reporting this strange object. My boyfriend and I went inside for about, 20 minutes, and went back outside, it had vanished. I ! just want to see if others had witnessed this, or something similar. I want to know what this was, and what&#39;s going on.<n>

The lights were not pulsating or strobing, just white lights.  The inside of the triangle appeared to be a slightly different tint than the night sky.  We were in The Village on Telluride Complex in San Marcos, Texas.  The Black Triangle glided across the sky, about the same speed as a plane, until it was out of our sight.  Definitely a believer.<n>

Some were red or white or green near the &#34;star&#34;.

At 10 pm, last Sunday night, October 26, 2014, I was driving I-40 east-bound on my way home to Rocky Mount from a weekend checking on my elderly mom in Hendersonville, NC.  I left at 6:30 pm, took 26 west in heavy traffic to Asheville by 7PM, and then took 40 east.  I came over the Black Mountain Pass and stopped at the Old Fort McDonald’s for a quick break and was back on the road about 8:00 pm.  It was dark by then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove east on I-40 for about half an hour, when suddenly I noticed above me and ahead of me the thick edge of a brightly shining luminous white disk hanging in the night sky.  It was very high up, but right over the road.  It did not move.  The dashboard clock said 10 PM!  What!????  I was between a steep mountain ridge paralleling the road on my right, to the south, and a hillside to the north.  Both sides of the road were heavily wooded as far as I could see in the dark.  I could not see any houses or lights anywhere.  I looked for a mile marker, but didn’t find one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was amazing.  It was as if I Iooked straight on to the side of a doughnut, then lifted it up to about an 11:00 position.  I could see the brilliant white light and the thick wide curves of the right and left sides.  I drove under it a few minutes later, with some trepidation.  I thought the object might be a reflection of some sort off the windshield, so I opened the sunroof completely, sliding the glass back all the way.  Looking up thru the open sunroof, I could see that it was a perfect white circle with three very bright green circular lights under it.  The three green lights clustered in the center together, quite pretty.  They looked exactly like the three circular razors on the head of an electric Norelco razor.  Neither the white object nor the three green lights beneath it appeared to spin, move, or rotate, though.  There was no sound or vibration.  It was not a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was it?  The atmosphere was clear and not misty or foggy, so there were no perceptible light beams through the air.  There was not wind that night. I thought it might be a house on the mountain to my right.  However, the mountain was very steep and I could see the darker ridge line lower down to my right against the sky, farther away.  There were no lights on the mountain. So the brilliant light was not coming from anything on the mountain itself.  It was above me and not over on the mountain.  To my left was the west bound lane and heavy woods and trees and another steep slope whose top I could not see for the trees.  There were no lights to my left either. Above me, there were no clouds in the sky.  The object was against a starry sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon was up that night, but it was to the south-southwest, according to the moon app on my cell phone, and it was out of my vision range, south of the high mountain ridge to my right somewhere.  The bright object was definitely not the moon or any planet.  It was way too big for that.  The light was brilliant, but not blinding.  If I put my hands up and held them about a foot apart, that’s how big it appeared when I first saw it, as I approached it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking up through the open sunroof, I heard no sound and did not feel anything.  The object was completely still in the air, not moving, not rotating, just hovering up above and very slightly off to the side, to the right/south of I-40.  It was lower than the mountain ridge to my right.  It was closer to the road than to the mountain.  As I drove under it, I was a little scared, but nothing happened.  I would say it was at about the 1:00 position above the highway.  There was no other traffic around me on the east bound lane.  Since I was looking up, I didn’t notice if there was any traffic coming toward me on the west bound lane.  I passed a small unlit exit on my right leading downwards to the south, but passed it too quickly to catch the number.  Then, I came into trucks and had to take my eyes away. When I looked back, I couldn’t see the object anymore because the road curved. I came up to the Morganton exit, several minutes after I saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know how to explain the missing time between 8:30 and 10:00 pm. It doesn’t take an hour and a half to drive between Old Fort and Morganton!  I was driving between 65 and 70 miles an hour, so I couldn’t have fallen asleep.  I left Asheville at about 7pm, and Old Fort about 8:00, so I should have been past Statesville by 10 PM.  My dashboard clock is accurate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be 67 this month.  I am a retired school teacher and live near Rocky Mount, NC.  I don’t smoke, drink, do drugs, or mess around.  I have backpacked around the world twice and am an avid hiker and trekker.  As a teacher, I am rational, objective, and factual.  I don’t believe in UFO’s.  I have never seen one.  However, I try to keep an open mind and entertain possibilities without judgment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What did I see?  And what happened to me in the missing hour and a half?  Perhaps I made a mistake?  I think I will make the drive again soon and double check the time and my position.  I know that steep mountain ridge, just not sure exactly where it is.  I tried to check on Google Earth, but it does not give elevations, so I could not tell exactly where I was.  Surely, there must be an explanation.  I have reported the incident to the Superintendent of the Burke County Sheriff&#39;s office.  She told me that she would report it to the airport management for Burke County Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photo?  My phone was dead and charging, but it would have been dangerous to do while driving, and I didn’t feel safe stopping that late at night in such a location.  Frankly, I MUST have seen a UFO, what else could it have been?  Yes, I have lost time twice before that I know of; once at twelve years old and once in India in 1976.  I have no explanation.  I experienced a great sense of urgency both times, but don&#39;t know why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophies.”  Hamlet, Scene V -W.

I was doing a little sky gazing as we walked and happened to notice a large object that looked like a giant prehistoric bird.  I would guesstimate that it was flying at around 5,000 feet.  I said &#34;what the hell is that?&#34; to my girlfriend and she quickly looked up and just in time to see it fade behind the tree line.   We were both a little shaken by it and spent a good amount of time sitting in a park with low lighting in the area staring at the sky in the hopes of seeing it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of us are really ones that believe in UFOs or anything like that. I, having military experience believe it to be some sort of military secret, especially considered all the military bases of operation down South in Colorado (NORAD, Ft. Carson).  With that being said, I&#39;ve never seen anything, experimental, stealth, regular military aircraft that looked anything similar.  IT MADE NO SOUND.  I thought I saw faint lights, however, if there were any they were just barely visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

In my first report I thought I was missing an hour and a half because the dashboard clock said 10PM when I saw the bright light above me, but I had only left Old Fort about half an hour before, about 8PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have revised my opinion: I think the dashboard clock was affected.  I think it mistakenly said 10PM, because I arrived in Rocky Mount between 12:30 AM and 1:00 AM as expected. Its a six hour drive from Asheville.  I was right on time. It would have been utterly impossible to go from Morganton to Rocky Mount in only 2 and 1/2 hours. Therefore, the clock must have been affected by the object I saw.  This means that I was NOT missing an hour and a half. Whew! Because my cell phone battery wasn&#39;t working either, I couldn&#39;t check the time on my cell phone. Don&#39;t wear a watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for allowing me to alter my conclusion.  I just didn&#39;t think of it before.<n>

As I was driving I noticed bright lights in the sky and the shadow of what looked to be a giant triangular airplane. It was moving over the tree tops, much lower than  any airplane I&#39;ve seen in the area.  I rolled down my window to get a better look expecting to hear the roar of a usual air craft but it was completely silent.  Triangular in shape, it was formed by three bright white balls of light with a red light in the center of the triangle and much smaller orange lights around that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my car around to follow it. Realizing I had my camera on me, I pulled over into a nearby parking lot.  As I went to get out of my car, I looked up and watched it fly over me.

At first glance they looked like very short contrails but as we continued to observe them we noticed that they were stationary and not becoming longer like a contrail. I was driving and had to pay attention to the road but my wife says she counted 9 of these disc shaped objects before they disappeared one at a time.  By the time she took pictures only two remained. I think in a couple of the pictures there are three of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not only did we see these objects to the west but we both saw one blinking orange star like object which was roughly to the south of our position at approximately 45 degrees (just taking a guess on that). I saw this object looking out the driver’s side window while still traveling westbound.  It looked a lot like a very bright Mars but I am certain it was not a planet or an airplane.  It was not quite dark yet and no stars were visible at that time. It was unlike anything I have seen in the sky before. I looked at it and it disappeared.  It did not blink like an airplane and I wouldn&#39;t exactly say it pulsated. It was more like a slow steady blink with roughly 10-15 seconds between blinks until it just disappeared.  It seemed stationary and I definitely believe it was in our atmosphere and not in space.  I feel that the star like object was closer to us but it is very hard to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first I thought it was a flock of white birds or geese, but the changes in direction and the size did not seem birdlike.  Also wondered if it was a grouping of balloons that &#34; got away&#34; from a car lot or something similar, but then I witnessed several groups break away from the main cluster, accelerate rapidly and fly against the cloud/wind direction, and then rejoin primary group and this occurred several times with different groups forming and then breaking away in different directions at different speeds before rejoining the main group. At various points the group would shift and almost disappear, but during shifts they would also deflect light giving off a  metallic sheen.  I cant&#39;t explain what I saw, but I pulled my car over and watched this for about 10 minutes before the objects disappeared into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else see this as well and if so any idea was it could have been ?<n>

I had just been viewing Messier objects such as M42 in Orion when I decided to give my left eye a break.  I moved over to the table near my back door and stood there in my backyard just looking at the sky, hoping to see some meteors as it was morning.  Then about 5 minutes of looking up something odd caught the corner of my eye, thinking it might be a meteor. I was standing, looking up, but facing west, where at the northwest part of the sky (near constellation Cygnus), high above the tree line I saw this dark gray winged looking object. There were no lights and it blends in well with the background sky.  There was absolutely no sound, this thing was completely silent even after it was gone.  I doubt anyone outside would have taken notice if they were not looking up at the sky.  I could not estimate distance, elevation or speed other then the time it was visible.  It moved from the northwest corner of ! sky to the south in longer than 4 seconds.  I reached for my binoculars sitting on my table but before I could bring them up to my eyes, I lost the object after it was below the constellation Cetus heading towards Girard, IL.  I can say the wing span when it past thru Cetus, was from the star Braten Kaitos to n-Cetus.  This is about 10 degrees of sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thoughts were of bewilderment.  I don’t believe what I just saw. It was thinking of what it could have been.  It could have been migrating geese.  They do travel at night, but they move slower and often make audible quacks.  This moved much faster than geese. I also don’t believe it was close to the ground, judging by the trees.  It was much higher in the sky. What ever it was, didn’t want to be seen, because there were no lights and it was dark grey.  It had a distinct shape; I wouldn’t call it a v-wing but more like crescent shaped wing. It could have been some sort of stealth aircraft that is not publicly know.  Scott air force base is about 80 miles south of my location, but it’s not known to operate any test vehicles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed out for another 20 minutes, hoping something would happen again or another vehicle would follow its same path. Nothing happened. During this time, I had many different emotions, from curiosity to fear. Fearful thoughts started take over and I decided to bring in all my equipment. I then began to look on the internet for similar witness accounts. I found this site and composed a report. I am hoping someone else in central Illinois may have been out late like me and saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is former Navy, been around lots of naval aircraft. I have worked in the field of electronics for nearly 20 years. I am an amateur astronomer (hobby). I used to go to air shows at El Toro Marine Base before it was closed in the 1990s often in my youth in southern California. I have seen many different kinds of military aircraft including both the stealth fighter and stealth bomber flown at El Toro. As an amateur astronomy, I see plenty of high flying commercial and military flying over central Illinois at night. I also witness satellites such as the ISS to the random flare from an Iridium satellite.  I have also seen loads of meteors and bolides in my times stargazing.<n>

We then saw above us a &#34;Y&#34; shaped grouping of colored lights (red,greeen,pink,white fading in and out).It was very cloudy; we would see this grouping of lights come in and out of the clouds as they moved; motionless, hovering; the lights stayed in formation.  We then saw at different times two triangular shaped formations with 3 lights. In the distance at one time we saw 3 lights in a straight line, which later disappeared.  As the clouds moved, we would see the Y shaped lights again and again.  They were hardly moving. Later in the distance the green swirling lights occurred again, first only one, then it seemed light 2 to 3 and they w! ere &#34;dancing&#34; in swirling formations.  There was a triangle of lights to the right of it.  As this triangle faded, so did the green swirling orb like lights disappear.  We watched this for 2 hours.

I believe this had to be only a single craft, because the two lights appeared to maintain the same distance from each other while flying through the air.  One light appeared to be red and the other green, just like a normal airplane would, but it covered a distance in what must have been less than a second that is physically impossible for any modern craft to travel.  It was there and then it was gone in an instant.  I could not decipher the physical shape of the craft because it was dark out and also because of the speed it moved at. I could see the lights traveling through the air however, and it looked like they left a streak behind them as it flew through the sky, but I think that had more to do with the fact ! that the lights were moving so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked over in the direction where I thought the craft had traveled (It seemed to be heading southwest), I saw a bright blue light that was flickering a little. I pulled up an application on my phone to see if it was perhaps a planet or star rather than any physical craft I might have seen. From what I could tell on my phone, it was just Neptune. The craft I had seen warp through the sky was nowhere to be found. It was just gone an instant after I had seen it streak through the sky at impossible speeds.<n>

I couldnt believe my eyes I have never personally witness any ufo sightings in my life so I was a little spooked.  Luckly i had my cell phone on me and started taking pictures and got a video of them as well.  They were moving around making very weird signs in the sky and the last sign they made was a arrow pointing into space.  Then they slowly disappeared. There were still a couple left but slowly disappeared as well.  I am not a hoaxer or prankster and I have better things to do with my life then report ufo sightings.  But i just felt like i needed to report this in being it is real and it is not hoaxed.<n>

The object made absolutely no engine noises.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The direction of travel was from north to south. Facing the ocean, Cape Canaveral was on our left and Cocoa Beach was behind us and on our right.

As it got closer we noticed it got bigger and was treading through the clouds splitting them apart much like a boat would with water.  The aircraft then stalled in the sky looking as if it was about to land and stabilized long enough for me to notice it had a spade like shape.  It had three white lights, one in the front serving as a headlight, and two on the back corners.  Also, there were two blinking red lights underneath it.  It hovered in the air for about 20 seconds, its lights turned off, turned back on, and it took off and disappeared, and it didn&#39;t make a sound.<n>

By the time my boyfriend was driving to get on 290 west I looked up toward the Holden are and noticed another of the same object in the sky.  When we were on the highway we looked looked again and there were just two left above Worcester and the one above the town of Holden had disappeared. We have never witnessed anything like this in our lives.  We know what we saw and regardless of what some of our friends think that either it was part of the light show, it was not.  The light show was moving white light but these were actual objects and the color was far fr! om white. It was an amazing experience that we would never forget. I just regret that I didn&#39;t  take a video so I can show those who doubt what we saw.<n>

We spotted the craft while driving west bound on interstate I-10, between Kenner, L.A. and Laplace, L.A.  The craft was to our left, to the south west.  At first it looked like an airplane was on fire and falling out of the sky.  There was a long trail of what can only be described as fire followed by smoke.  At first glance I would guess that this streak of fire was somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 feet in the air, which made me initially think that it might be an airplane on fire.  We continued to watch the object as we drove west bound on I-10.  We began to realize that whatever this was it was falling at a very slow rate, almost as if it wasn’t falling at all.  After watching this object for roughly 8-10 minutes, what appeared to be fire and smoke had extinguished and the craft ! was now visible and at roughly 10,000-15,000 feet in the air to the south west of Laplace, L.A.   The best way I can describe the object is to say that it was shaped like a pistachio shell.  There were no visible wings, props, or engines.  Its’ exterior was smooth.  When the body of the craft became visible it was apparent that it was no longer moving at all.  It was hovering around 10,000 feet.  We watched it hovering in the sky for roughly 10 seconds before it started to accelerate from a stand still.  It gained a tremendous amount of speed in less than 3 seconds.  Roughly 15 seconds after it began to accelerate we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should note that the way in which it flew was eerily similar to what is portrayed in a science fiction movie.  It moved across the sky as if time had suddenly stopped and the only thing left in motion was the craft itself.  It was very strange.  I work in the aviation industry and am quite familiar with different types of aircrafts.  I can honestly say I’ve never seen anything move across the sky like I did on the afternoon of October 25th.<n>

I was driving and came in to this area where I heard an engine mechanical sound, (not a helicopter or plane) I did not see it until I pasted some trees, to the right in the air still in a distance away an odd shape craft in the air just above the trees, really questioned what I saw a brightly light diamond shape saw some tracks on the inside and reddish color, as I watched it closed to a triangle, travelled in my direction and flew past in front of me, this object have three blinking lights one in front two on each side the bulbs were cylinder shaped, there was a flat red light on the back, watched it go slowing into the clouds, I could see the red glowing from red as it was in the clouds.

Going from my 1 o&#39;clock position east to west.  I snapped out of it after seeing it for about 5 seconds &amp; ran inside to get to get my husband.  We ran out to the front yard.  It had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went to the backyard and after 5 minutes we both saw it again.  It appeared at the eve of the roof going north to south this time.  But it had undulating wings made of the same yellow colored lights.  6 of them so 3 on either side.  They were gently moving like a snake out from the center.  But the lights moved independently from either side kinda like a crawling octopus tentacle.  It lasted about 10 seconds that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reappeared again about 15 minutes later 12 o&#39;clock high moving northeast to southwest.  My husband saw it first.  It was very high this time.  It was like the first one l saw again.  It lasted about 4 seconds that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw another one about 10 minutes later.  It was completely different.  It looked like a wispy rod shaped gray cloud.  Either that or it occurred to me laster while writing this, that it could have been a gray long barrel shaped craft with no lights pushing thru the clouds.  It moved from 12&#39;oclock  high to the direct south.  It was very fast again.  It lasted 3-4 seconds.  My husband didnt see that one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then l saw the same type of wispy cloudlike thing but it was triangle shaped.  No lights.  Very strange floating motion.  It was just gliding like on ice.  It lasted about 3 seconds.  I was facing west.  It appeared   above me going west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fifth one was 15 minutes later.  My husband had gone inside.  It was another wispy rodlike cloud going from 12:00 high to the west.  It was fast, lasting 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were planes flying north to south in their usual flight pattern for this area.  Suddenly I noticed an odd light approximately 1,000 feet up flying west to east that resembled a very bright light bulb. It was rounded and extremely bright.  I called my mother to come and see it, and we watched it fly along in a westerly direction towards downtown North Wilkesboro.  It floated to a certain point and then appeared to turn right and head north, and upon turning, the light faded quickly and was gone.  It was not a plane or a helicopter, had no navigational lights, and it made no noise.<n>

I noticed something unusual and stopped walking, staring at it, trying to figure out exactly what I was seeing.  The dog seemed more annoyed I’d made him stop, he did not bark or react in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a figure ahead of me, about 10 feet away, standing in the swale area, between the sidewalk &amp; street.  It was not facing me.  It was skeletal thin or bony, taller than my 5’3”, white or light grayish skin, no hair, there was something blue near it’s left ?ear?<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought maybe it was a spiritual type being, but clearly was not human.     It  sensed I was staring at it,  looked over its right shoulder;  looked at me, then looked down at the dog,  immediately started to run, slanty into the middle of the street &amp; down the street.   It’s knees were backwards.    As it ran, it began to gradually fade, like the edges of it kept disappearing until ! I couldn’t see it any more.     A friend suggested it sounded like an insect-type alien or praying mantis alien.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m in my late 50’s, don’t drink or get stoned, and this is not a Halloween prank.

Then a plane came through the area and when it got to where the orange light was a bright cresent shaped object appeared above it for just about 5 seconds and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane just kept on flying in a southwestern direction.

VA, with my instructor, and flew southeast, possibly towards the town of Milton, for ten or so minutes.  Aircraft flown was a PA28-181 Archer III under VFR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued flight for about a minute after leveling off at around 3500 feet MSL.  Off the front of the aircraft, possibly around ten or so miles out, both my instructor and I saw what appeared to be a white light descending quickly (~1000&#39; per second) for a period of about two seconds.  It appeared to be transitioning through the same altitude as our aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After two seconds had passed, it flared out as would ash from a cigarette falling to the floor.  The skies were dark at the time so it was easy to see.  It was not clear if it had flared out before making contact with the ground, or if it had disappeared into the trees.  It may have either fallen somewhere in North Carolina, or on the NC/VA border.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the light itself, it appeared to be a pure white color, nonchanging.  From what I could tell, it didn&#39;t appear to be completely circular - I have vision corrected to 20/20 with glasses, but my eyes could have been playing tricks on me when it came to the shape of the object, due to flaws in observation or due to the fact that it was a ways out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My instructor called it &#34;round.&#34;<n>

This drew our attention to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 5 minutes later we witnessed a spectacle of many lights in a row.  There was 2 definitive sections of lights 7-10 in each strand with one light in each section continually brighter and producing a strobe effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this there were numerous single lights within the same area fade in and our appearing in drastically different areas.  This lasted for around 20 seconds and the everything disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It all appeared at about a 45 degree angle in the sky... an unbelievable experience<n>

Our house is situated on top of the hill about 400 m above the sea level, forest around. It is 40 KM north from GTA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband walk up about 3 am and looked through the window toward the East.  He noticed triangular or oval shape object, stationary with many tiny lights on the outline, blinking and changing colour.  My husband is a professional engineer, corporate director, solid ethics.  He remembers blue and red for sure.  The lights were pulsating quickly. He taught &#34;that&#39;s strange&#34;, then went to the washroom, when he came back, the object was still there hanging above the tree line, not moving.  He observed it for couple of minutes than just went to bed (!!!)  He does not believe in UFO, he is even annoyed if I bring up this topic. I was floored by his indifference to the event and was deeply disappointed that he didn&#39;t wake me up.  I have binoculars always ready, so I could check it up.  Funny thing, before going to bed I went on the balcony and looked at the beautiful clear sky full of stars and said to myself :  &#34;why don&#39;t you guys show yourself&#34; ...thinking about UFO of course. I had never seen anything interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember that the same night I was waken up because my husband was screaming while asleep so I tough he had a nightmare. I didn&#39;t check what time it was. I could send a sketch as pdf by e-mail if you are interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder if somebody else could see it, but it would be unlikely, as there is no much traffic at this early hour. Living near the airport for many years we know how airplane lights  look like. By his account, it wasn&#39;t an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listen to Coast to Coast every day and love to hear your UFO updates on the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best Regards, Iwona<n>

It stays in it&#39;s location but moves around in a zig zag or dancing pattern side to side and up and down with actually going anywhere.  It hovers in same spot for long periods.  When a plane was approaching at about the same altitude, it moved up about double and then triple the space above the plane.  After the plane passed, it came back down.  It is now (1:40 am) hovering just above the ridge.  I am between Grafton and Morgantown on Rt 119.  The UFO is in the eastern sky.  When I first started watching it was just to the right of the dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is lower in the sky now and the dipper is up above.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

An object suddenly appeared in the middle of the sky heading down towards the ground at a steady rate and out of site. The speed seemed too fast to be a normal day to day aircraft and did not seem like a comet nor a meteor because there was no &#34;trail&#34; and the light did not diminish or flicker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a circular bright green light.  The hue of green was in likeness of a traffic light. It was too large to belong to a normal aircraft one would see day to day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I take this route home from work at this time of night every night since December 2013 and have never witnessed anything like this.

This may be a memory of an abduction (time and date unknown).  At first, they were a little disturbing, but now I believe that this may be a memory of event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke, naked in a copper colored translucence room with rounded corners and indirect lighting.  A feminine (machine) voice spoke to me, answering my questions.  There was a rhythmic machine noise (or hum) in the distance and vibrations could be felt in the floor and walls of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe the craft was quite large and that a form of artificial gravity was being used.  When I dropped objects they seemed to fall into their own footprint, not off center as would happen with centrifugal force generated gravity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was large (I could only gauge its size from the rooms that I was allowed to traverse; hallways, hangars, corridors).  Perhaps as large as an American aircraft carrier. It appears to have been built for a humanoid form and the Air and climate was earth normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All my communication was with the &#34;voice&#34; whom I knick-named &#34;Mother.&#34;  It wasn&#39;t unpleasant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently the dreams have become more frequent and detailed.  I am retired Military and spent time at White Sands Missile Range where I witnessed a lot of UFO activity in the 1980&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone reported anything similar to the &#34;copper colored translucence room with rounded corners and indirect lighting&#34;.<n>
10/23/14 23:30|La Habra|CA|Circle|5 minutes|I saw 2 Green Orbs flying over La Habra California.|11/6/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114766.html|194|ndxe201410| I saw 2 Green Orbs flying over La Habra California<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thursday 10-23-2014 Approximately 11:30pm. I had my sliding glass door open and I noticed 2 bright green orbs (circular balls) in the sky side by side. I would estimate that they were about 1 to 2 miles away from my house in La Habra when first saw them. I was looking in a south west direction at them. Within a few seconds they began to separate and go in different directions. One of them went in an easterly direction the other went north. There were no visible blinking lights on them. Just a green glowing ball of light. I walked out into my balcony and continued to watch them. They both seemed to be completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one going east was going over the hills along the south La Habra and Fullerton border. This orb was not high above the hills. Maybe it was only 200 to 300 feet above the hills. The other orb going north eventually went out of my sight range when it passed beyond the hill where I live. At this point I continued to watch the orb headed in an easterly direction over the hills along the La Habra and Fullerton border. I would estimate that it was traveling about 50 miles per hour I would guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that this green orb then turned completed red for maybe 5 or 10 seconds and then back to green. After traveling about 1 to 2 miles it then came to a stop and just hovered for about 30 seconds to a minute. Then it began to descend straight down getting closer and closer to the ground. Where it was descending is about 1 to 1 ½ miles from my house. I expected that it would descend beyond the hill and out of sight but it turned out that it was on this side of the hill and I was able to continue to see it descend. During it’s descent I noticed that the other orb that had left my field of view reappeared from behind the hill and was moving directly toward the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb that was descending then appeared as 3 lights. I saw a green light, a red light and a white light. The other orb as far as I could tell passed the one that was descending and seemed to go over the hill and out of sight. The orb that was descending eventually was obscured by trees across the street from me. I waited maybe 10 minutes to see if it would reappear but it did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night I kept a watch out at the same time to see if they reappeared but I saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PLEASE READ!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have just left my mothers house and was getting into my car to head home. I live right next to her down the road so the drive is not far at all. As I left her porch I looked into the sky and saw what I would describe as a fireball sphere. It seemed to admit its own light and was mainly orange but occasionally a red a blue light would flash off. Figuring this was an airplane, considering I live a hop,  skip and a jump from a airport in Franklin at which does frequent test flying, I did not take the object to heart. I proceeded to my car and backed up to go home. As I turned from my mothers driveway I saw the object once again but it was closer. I drove very slowly and watch as the object started to disappear little by little. But considering I drove right passed trees I put that as the reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I parked my car in my driveway and looked out for the object, but did not see it again. But not long after did I hear what sound like a helicopter or airplane. Weird.! But I must tell you I have lived in this area my whole life. I have seen helicopters, planes, and even jets over the years. I know their sight and sound. This was nothing like I have ever seen before.<n>

I looked to the west and noticed a bright single light heading my way. It was as bright as the space station. The color wasn&#39;t as white as the I.S.S.  More towards amber.  I&#39;ve seen the space station many times,and I knew this wasn&#39;t it. It wasn&#39;t blinking, just constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier my buddy called to say he was looking at the eclipse.  I wasn&#39;t prepared so I didn&#39;t see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I ran in the house and called him, and told him to go outside quick, as something was heading our way from the west.  (He lives about 1/4 mile away).  We both stayed on the phone and he said he saw it right away.  There were no navigation lights, or sound, so we ruled out a jet or plane.  It was heading just slightly southeast. If you pointed your left finger straight up at twelve o&#39;clock high, and your right finger, two feet straight to the south, that is about the degrees in the sky the thing was, when, it abruptly vanished!!  I don&#39;t know if it turned &#34;right,&#34; from our vantage point, or just turned off the lights!  It didn&#39;t zip away in the direction it was heading, it just wasn&#39;t there. It was a crystal clear night, so no clouds to go behind.  We both were left wondering what we just witnessed. It was 8:30 or so. I&#39;m wondering if we were the only two people in America who saw this! It appeared to be quite high,  But hard to judge not knowing size. Incidentally, on April 19th, 2014, my wife, nephew and niece, witnessed almost the exact same &#34;light&#34;, right from the same viewing spot, our deck.  Everything almost identical, except the time.  That one was at approximately 10:30 or so.  My wife said, &#34;Look!, here comes the space station!  I said, no it&#39;s not!!<n>

I thought I saw a cigar shaped shadow behind them as if it was one large object, but I can&#39;t be sure. I thought a large, low flying, jumbo jet must be headed straight toward me and about to crash land. It was frightening at first,  but then it seemed to change directions and gain altitude.  At the same time as it changed directions each light slowly faded out one at a time.  They even seemed to flicker just a bit as if burning out.  As soon as they all disappeared they flickered back on again slowly and one at a time and in a new position (consistent with an object that would be moving).  Also there was a direction change again as they were coming back on one at a time.  I was driving so I was not able to continually watch as much as I would have liked to, therefore I only saw them fade out one more time – again one at a time, and as if they burnt out, not instantly on or off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights never once broke a perfect line formation, so if it was not a single object, it was an impossibly accurate formation of 4. This object (if it was one object) was either large and low flying, or REALLY large if it was far away. Hard to tell the perspective at night, but the lights were fairly large, round shaped and seemed almost like balls of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

One night we saw them flying northwestward, some of them moving closer to others then moving away, then suddenly one shot directly upward and out of sight while another flew off in another direction and out of sight.  On 10/23 some of the lights were stationary at various points in the sky (in a circle over Tucson) while others were flying either north or south.  Sometimes the lights appear to change direction at a 45 degree angle.<n>

Appears to travel great distance in two seconds. Possible vapor cone in second pic<n> <n><n> <n><n> This green orb wasn&#39;t seen until after I took the pictures and noticed it. I was just taking pictures of the sunset and didn&#39;t even notice the orb.  The pictures were taken from the Mukilteo to Whidbey Island ferry as it was loading cars. You can see the Mukilteo Beach Lighthouse to the left of the photos and Whidbey Island in the background, and the orb appears in the area of roughly the SW sky from Everett/Mukilteo. Two seconds maximum is the time between taking the pictures.  You can see how fast/far the orb moved in that small time frame, and there is also two birds flying together to the left of the orb that appear to have traveled ten-twenty or so feet to backup the two seconds. There is also absolutely no cloud movement at all. Also, something I found to be very interesting is what appears to be similar in appearance to a vapor cone in the second picture.  A vapor cone is what is created when a jet breaks the sound barrier at around Mach 1 speed. (I&#39;m ! sure you already knew this). I can zoom in and see some vague details, but I&#39;m sure you can zoom and see much more than my simple Dell. I would love to see anything you can find/see and hear your opinion.  Please let me know what you think. Background of the photographer is a middle aged woman that is in the medical field. Not a drug user and not too big into UFO&#39;s in general. I just thought I had to share and hope you can get some use from the pictures. That is all the details I can think of for now. Thank you for the time and effort with this site and what you do.

I was alone, and on my way home after picking up my toddler from daycare and thought it strange to see two hot air balloons in this area, but then looked down and back up and saw a third and then a fourth.  Objects appeared grey, but then shined in sunlight looking metallic.  Objects did not move.   There were other commercial airplanes in the area.<n>
10/23/14 14:00|Witch Wells|AZ|Circle|4 minutes|Metallic Circular object observed over Witch Wells, Arizona.|11/6/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114832.html|206|ndxe201410| Metallic Circular object observed over Witch Wells, Arizona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1400 on the day of the sighting I was walking my dog on my 40 acres heading towards the top of the hill on my property when I just happened to look towards the cell phone tower located on the Witch Wells campgrounds. This tower as the Crow flies is about 10 miles away so from my point of view makes the tower appear about the height of my middle finger when I have my arm stretched out in front of my line of sight. The tower is right next to the Arizona Highway 191 and approximately halfway between the towns of Sanders and St. Johns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a silver object that appeared to be circular in shape and giving off of very bright metallic appearance similar to seeing a signal mirror in the Sun. The object from my point of view was perhaps no more than 400 yards South of the tower which from my angle it was right of the tower. It was also sightly lower in elevation than the top of the tower. I was fortunate to get another point of reference when I was a white box truck driving Northbound on Hwy 191. At that point I could easily see that this floating object was in appearance no larger than perhaps the cab of this box truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought perhaps this was an optical illusion involving the Sun but as I shifted my angle in relation to the Sun and this object it remained.  I drive the 191 quite often and have done so for over 2 years now and I can tell you that there is no structure of that kind or anything else that would explain this. I quickly moved to even higher ground to get a look but after turning my head for only a second the object had vanished.  All I can say is that this object hovered for about 4 minutes in the same spot next to a cell phone tower right next to Arizona Hwy 191 and it was definitely some sort of metallic circular object that was of a decent size and then vanished.<n>

It hovered very high in the sky, then came close enough to Earth see the sun’s reflection on it, then turned on its axis, and flew incredibly fast backwards (without turning from it&#39;s position), where it hovered again.  Then another bullet/pill shaped, metallic/chrome colored object appeared literally out of thin air, and hovered with the other for a couple of minutes.  Both objects started flying in the same direction, towards a field; one stopped again and hovered in the same spot for several minutes, while the other disappeared back into thin air.  There was no sound from either object.  There was a definitive vertical line down the center of each object. We, the observers, are both in institutions of higher education, and possess sound and rational mental states.  These objects were beyond logic, both in how the looked and how they be! haved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was huge, much larger than any satellite I&#39;ve seen.  About the size of what a full moon looks like, perhaps just a little smaller.  The tentacles appeared red, but also shimmery whitish-gold light.  One appeared in the SE sky (45 degree angle from due East), and the other was 340 degrees, or 20 degrees N of due East).  Our condo complex endured an extensive planned power outage; after lights came on at 11:15, I couldn&#39;t sleep. Found myself up at about 2:15-2:30 a.m., looked out a large window and noticed this.  I have heard reports that these objects hovered over our complex at one point in the evening (waiting for more info to confirm).<n>

I was on my back deck, smoking a cigar, around 23:10 on Oct. 22, 2014.  I was looking at the clouds as they were moving from the NE to the SW.  I saw a green triangle cross my line of sight for approximately 3 seconds, traveling from the East to the West.  I did not hear a sound.  It was traveling at a high rate of speed, in a straight line.  It was a bright emerald green color, with circles of light (the same green color) on each point of the triangle.  It was not an isosceles triangle, but an elongated one.  I am a 56 year old college graduate, who has been clean and sober for over 30 years.

Also when locals were questioned some were aware of these glowing orange orbs.

I was stargazing and just looking around because it was a clear, very crisp night for South Carolina, I looked left and noticed about 4-5 lights all in a row, orange, red and white hues (almost like track lighting) just above the trees.  I said to my friend do you see that and he acknowledged the same thing I was seeing.  I got up to walk to the driveway to get a better view and the lights completely disappeared.  We may have only witnessed it for about 20 seconds.  After about five minutes of trying to figure out what we saw we walked down the driveway to the road to see if we could see it anywhere else in the sky and we didn’t.  We did however then notice about 3 white blinking lights in a line at first close together and the pretty far apart going through the sky very fast, we thought maybe fighter planes? These planes started at the area where we first saw! the lights and we watched them until they were out of site, they did not disappear just flew out of visual range.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw two at first and then as many as six. I am more than familiar with all types of known military craft.  These were unlike anything I had seen before, flying or seemingly hovering in the night sky. This was at dusk and I could see the dim light the orb type fireball would emit until they became bright for just a few moments. The objects did move up and down and at a diagonal. They seemed to be able to move at much greater speed than the aircraft that seemed to be trying to keep up and track the objects. I did count four aircraft in all trying to keep up with these things. The objects would be dim at a very light blue and then get brighter with a bright orange, fire like color and they were in a staggered formation but not uniformly staggered from right to left, one higher! than the other almost in an elongated W pattern. The objects made no sound.<n>

Then after my sister exclaimed that was exactly what she saw, me my mother and cousin were silent in this incident, jokingly questioning our soberness, but as we got in the car discussing our somewhat insane experience we were traveling down hwy 501 south as we were about to go under the 31 overpass south we saw the orb again and then observed the pattern occur two more times before we went under ! the overpass once we came out the orbs were no more and the thing is last night the skies were relatively clear with few stratus clouds. I sure many more people witnessed this occurrence last night as in 501 is a very busy highway.<n>

It was about 5:30 to 5:45. I was facing to the WNW and looking up at about 75 to 80 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (almost straight up). I noticed that Orion was very prominent and that almost straight North or maybe NNW of Orion, I noticed what looked like a big smiley face in the sky with four stars in it. It made me smile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself that it looked really cool and pondered why I had not noticed it before. I watched for maybe 15 to 20 seconds and then two of the stars (lights?) moved in exact opposite directions the one on the left went straight towards Orion and the second from the right headed what I’ll say is Northerly.  It seemed to be the exact opposite direction from the far left star.  I watched them moved for almost a minute.  The one on the right seemed to stop moving, the one on the left kept going and it seemed like maybe (since it was well far away by now and very dim) it had some sort of a tail.  The star on the right remained in the same position. I was watching it steadily.  Especially since the left one had moved and disappeared, I wanted to see what it would do.  After about 30 Seconds I noticed that it too was moving.  Only it was or seemed to be moving straight away and getting smaller and dimmer. It disappeared quickly. (10 Seconds?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Holy Cow! The only star left in the smiley face was the second from the left. It was also the brightest of the four original lights.  It seemed to be staying stationary.  I started wondering if there were other lights in the night sky moving around so I started to check out the rest of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I started watching the smiley face, there was a very very dim glow in the east from the sunrise.  So dim that if I was a rooster I would have waited a few more minutes to crow.  The sky was clear and all of the stars toward the west were still very bright. I looked all over the rest of the visible night sky and nothing caught my attention, so I looked back at the smiley face fourth star.  And it was completely GONE.  That’s it that’s all I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IT would be nice to know what this was and if anyone else saw this.<n>

At 1st glance i thought plane but as i watched the pulsating red green and white light i noticed it seemed stationary.  Hovering around Orion&#39;s belt.  As i went out onto the porch i noticed another pulsing red green and white light about 40° to the east but further away.  When i got downstairs to the street, a T intersection in which i can see down the vertical section of the T, i noticed a third green and red pulsing light that appeared much closer and more vibrant. It was low in the sky about even with roof tops about a block away.i felt almost like on the red pulse that a Laser pointer was hitting me but i could see no discernable light in my vicinity. I turned to yell to my wife asking if she could see or feel the same sensation as me. She had gone inside to find a camera when i turned back after no more than three seconds had elapsed the light direct in fron! t of me had vanished. The other two i saw remained in place for over 10 minutes. But have disappeared sometime in the 10 to 15 minutes i have been writing this on my celll. My wife says she saw as 5 lights in circular shape stretched across the sky. But can lffer little detail because it was her first encounter with a UFO and she became frightened. In all 20 -30 minutes from when we noticed the lights until their apparent departure.<n>

As I watched the object it had red, blue, green, yellow but mostly white lights flashing with no pattern but consistently flashing in the night sky. I would estimate the object to be approximately ½ mile away.  It hovered a couple hundred feet above the trees.  We live in a highly wooded area, lots of trees.  I watch it and went inside my home after about 10 minutes.  It was still hovering when I went inside my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the object I cannot be sure of but it was rectangular shaped and was big enough to see all the different colors flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen this object before in the night sky a few other times always in the west sky in the last 2 years that I have lived in Brush Prairie, Washington, but never have reported it until now.  This object was closer than it has ever been to our home.  It was not an airplane, helicopter, satellite or meteor.  I like to go out in the evening and look at the constellations and because we are 25 minutes away from Vancouver, Wa.  It is very dark and you can really see the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The objects were different sizes, one larger and the second somewhat smaller.  From the shore line, the objects were in an easterly direction over the ocean.  At the time of the sighting, the lights did not move at all and no audible noise came from the direction of the objects.  There was also no reflection of the objects on the surface of the ocean.  Within a minute of the initial sighting, the objects disappeared from view; the larger one disappeared first and then the smaller one.  No further lights were seen that night.  The next day, several customers of the same hotel reported seeing the same lights around the same time, but none of them were together when the sightings were made.  It appears these are the same lights that have been repo! rted in the area of Myrtle Beach and vicinity over the last several years, including numerous sightings in early October of this year.<n>

Approximately 21:14, he asked if I saw the lights off to our right.  He described them as 3 yellow lights, well above the horizon in a single line.  They were spaced apart and didn&#39;t move.  According to him, they remained on for several seconds and disappeared.  As they were near the landing approach to the Myrtle Beach airport, I didn&#39;t think too much about it.  There were also some clouds in the night sky, so when I looked that direction I wasn&#39;t concerned that I did not see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3-5 minutes later, a single yellow light appeared off to our left.  It was well off the coast and appeared to be 1000-2000 feet above the horizon based on airplanes seen during the day.  About 3 seconds after the first light appeared, a second light appeared to the left of the first one.  About 3 seconds later, a third light appeared to left of the second one.  Approximately 3 seconds later, a fourth light appeared to the left of the third one.  As the fourth light appeared, the first one faded out and disappeared.  As the fifth, sixth, and seventh lights appeared, this pattern continued.  Once the seventh light appeared, it remained lit until the sixth one went out.  Then the seventh faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We contined to look for another 30-45 minutes and did not see anything else out of the ordinary.  We did observe a couple of planes cross the sky from the left to right and land at the airport.  With landing lights on and marker lights, they resembled nothing like what we had seen.<n>

Each orb appeared about a second after the last and &#34;burned&#34; for roughly a second before fading away.  Visually they were each about 2 &#34;orb widths&#34; apart.  Definitely appears to be more of a flame than a filament or LED light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A helicopter with a searchlight flew over the area roughly 10 minutes after the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Decent black and white (better contrast) video on my instagram, user name: rxnbeats.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Will send unfiltered video in email.<n>

Bright red light almost directly overhead passed from roughly east to west. Definitely not a plane as I saw many others of those at the same time.  Moved quickly but steadily.  As it moved away a similar object appeared moving on roughly the same path but was more orange in color.  Tracked both objects as they moved westerly when the orange object disappeared from sight.  Continued walking my dog for another 20 minutes or so but when I returned home I noted a twinkling red object lower on the western/northwestern horizon.  Thinking it might be the object I saw before I ran inside my home and grabbed binoculars.  When I focused in on the object it appeared to be a single point of light that was moving extremely rapidly but in a very random, haphazard way within a very confined bit of space.  The movements were so rapid that it appeared to produce a &#39;stream&#39; of light with loops and zigzags, etc.  I checked  a nearby street lamp and rooflines to be sure it wa! sn&#39;t my hands shaking (they weren&#39;t).  Eventually  it moved lower and lower down onto the horizon and lost sight of it.  Have never seen or reported something like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

To the North of the flight path there was a small, white ball of light that seemed to be hovering.  By the time we found the binoculars it was either gone or went behind a cloud.  It seemed to fade away!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Oct. 21, 2014 at about 3:49PM Central Time I was in a conservation are I believed is owned/operated by the University of Missouri name Turkey Farm Lake with my dog.  I had my camera and took photos along the path leading up to the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I entered the actual lake area I saw a couple of dead looking branches and was attempting to focus on them without getting any colored leaves in the frame.  When I looked up I saw an object in the sky.  I said out loud, “What the f*ck is that?!”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not a plane, nor a helicopter, blimp, etc…  It was not extremely high in the sky.  I would say maybe a couple football fields’ lengths from me.  I was shaped like a semi-deflated football, actually, and silver in color and extremely shiny.  I did not notice a sound and it was moving slowly horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately aimed my camera and took a photo.  I then realized the branches were still in the frame, and because they were so close to me, that the object it’s self would not be in focus.  I then looked to the sky, saw the object moving away from me and stepped forward trying to get a better shot… As I looked through my viewfinder I could not spot the object so I removed the camera from my eye, looking to the sky and the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute after spinning myself in circles trying to figure out where this object moved to and feeling totally confused about what I just witnessed I opened the clock on my phone and took a screenshot to document the date and time.  It was 3:51 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I returned home and transferred my photos to my computer I saw something totally unexpected in the one photo I got of the object.  Instead of  an out-of-focus silver football shaped flying vehicle I knew should be in the photo I saw a partial outline.  It is a dark shadowy outline, boomerang-shaped, representing only the leading end of the object, probably about ¼  the size of what I saw with my eyes.  This is shocking because the object was fully visible to me even after I took that initial shot, however in the photo it appears to be almost completely transparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So far I have only told this to my mother and father… I attempted to call your hotline about half an hour ago, around 8:25 PM and I left a message because no one answered.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It did a reverse Z but with straight lines.

I looked at where she was pointing and noticed three lights moving up and down then side to side in a lazy slower way.  The lights were yellow in color and a little bigger than a big star in the sky.  They would grow brighter then fade almost to nothing. They were parallel to the horizon, in a line with each other, and close together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my binoculars and steadied them to the side if the window pane to get a closer look. Upon seeing them I also noticed four fainter light &#34;beams&#34; emitting from the UFO in a direction of NE. SE. EW. SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both excited to see our first UFO and thought it wouldn&#39;t happen again but to both of our surprises  it happened again last night, (10/24/14) which is why I am writing this report.  I got smarter and while it was happening last night I download a night sky app to see where in the sky I was seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were in between Jupiter and the star Algeiba. It has happened around the same time for two nights as far as we noticed.  Hope someone else sees them one night too!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

And this isn&#39;t the 1st night I saw it either.  It was a teal/white/red light - and it would shoot UP into the sky, move from right to left occasionally, and then float back behind some trees.  I want to say it has something to do with the airport not to far from here, but I cannot explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first night I saw it, it was pointed out to me - nor the other witness and I could explain the sighting.  It was creepy.<n>

I was out looking for Orionids, lots of airplane traffic, but this snuck in just west of me going south along front range between Golden and mountains (maybe 20,000 feet, not too high, lower than all commercial flights I witnessed).  You see it, try and make sense of what it could be, then realize it made no noise whatsoever and was moving fast.  I had once seen an unexplainable pattern of lights, a long time ago and experienced the missing time, so when I went in last night I checked the clock first thing, so unusual amount of time had past like the lst time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As I was locking the back door a bright flash of light caught my eye in the northern sky.  I turned to look to see what it was.  About 15 seconds later, it flashed again.  It was about 15 degrees above the horizon, about 5 or 10 degrees west of due north, between two closely spaced pine trees in a neighbor&#39;s yard that I could use for reference. After about 40 seconds, it flashed again (I was counting off the seconds to myself). I could not discern that it had moved at all in that time.  About 15 seconds later, it flashed again. Immediately after that, another bright light flashed to the east.  It was about 20 or 25 degrees above the horizon, and about 5 or 10 degrees east of due north, between two tall pine trees that I could use for reference.  In fact, I would say that it was in almost exactly the same location as a similar flashing light I reported to NUFORC in 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first light flashed again about 40 seconds after its last flash, and the light to the east immediately flashed again. I watched for another couple of minutes or so. The one on the left seemed to flash at 15-40-15-40 second intervals; the one on the right at 40 second intervals. Both lights had not changed their positions in that time, as near as I could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or so, I could hear a high flying jet aircraft. I looked high to the northeast and could see an airliner traveling a familiar flight path, typical of commercial flights between central or eastern Canada and Edmonton International Airport. It was about 60-70 degrees up and northeast of my position. I could clearly see that it was a commercial flight, as I have seen many on this route. The navigation lights were flashing regularly and could be clearly seen. It was then that it occurred to me that the other flashing lights were much brighter, easily 3 or 4 orders of magnitude brighter than the airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In total, I may have watched the lights flashing for four or five minutes, and then had to leave to meet my spouse. I mentioned this to my spouse, and when we returned home, about 9:50 p.m., we watched the northern sky for about two minutes, but did not see the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I considered whether the lights might belong to aircraft. I have never seen commercial flights in the direction of the first light. It is too far north and west. However, it is possible that military traffic from Cold Lake, Alberta, could be in that area, en-route to eastern Canada or overseas (the CF-18s assigned to the current missions in eastern Europe and the Middle East are stationed in Cold Lake). The other light, to the east, may have coincided with commercial traffic on a Great Circle route between western cities in the USA and Europe. It&#39;s possible that I was seeing the navigation lights at the rear of various aircraft, but I&#39;ve never seen any aircraft lights as bright as what I was seeing tonight, especially if (being perceptually closer to the horizon) they were a long distance away. But that doesn&#39;t explain why the lights did not appear to change position in the time I was watching.<n>

10/20/14 20:10|Fresno|OH|Oval|7 seconds|Stealthy object in night storm  clouds.|11/6/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114933.html|265|ndxe201410| Stealthy object in night storm  clouds<n> <n><n> <n><n> The evening of 20 Oct. at approximately  20:10 (0010Z) there were possible storms moving into my area. Lightening was reported to the West North West over Delaware, Ohio.  I observed  cloud reflected lightening in that direction, as well as to the South.  Cloud deck was reported as 3,000 to 6,000 feet at 97%.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While feeding horses and looking to the West, I observed at about 280 degrees azimuth and 25 degrees altitude,  a small dull red spot,  which appeared unmoving.  It grew somewhat brighter for about 3 seconds, but still remained dull red, the color that  heated steel  just becoming red might appear. At this time, it began moving  very rapidly across the shy towards the East South East,  heading approximately 100 degrees. It disappeared  at approximately 170 degrees azimuth and 85 degrees altitude, the whole episode lasting about 7 seconds from first seeing it until loosing sight of it. There was no sound associated with it’s passing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When this object (yes, I am going to call it an object) was almost overhead,  I had the impression  it had a rounded  shape, possibly  oval or u- shaped, and that the dull red portion was the leading part of some airframe, glowing from air resistance heating. It’s body was totally black with no lights, appearing against the clouds as an empty spot with a dull red part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My  analysis of this event is that when I first observed it, the unchanging bearing means it was coming essentially directly at me. As it got to a lower altitude, it’s linear motion became apparent, and the fact that it traversed  70 degrees of sky in 4 seconds means to me that it was  below 5,000 feet altitude and hence subsonic, disappearing into a cloud bank.. That fits with the cloud deck height. No sound means it was gliding or silently propelled. The whole thing had the feeling of a re-entry event. Re-entry into a thunder storm seems a good way to cover the sonic booms, and thick clouds providing visual cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, either  someone has a really advanced  stealth aircraft, or we are not alone.<n>

They stayed for a few seconds then disappeared. Over the next hour to hour and a half, we saw the same thing repeatidly, sometimes it was one bright light, sometimes 2.  It would move more south sometimes, light up for a few seconds, and disappear, and then the next time it  appeared in the same area that we had originally seen it in.  This happened several times. Then, at about 9:10 6 to 7 bright orange lights appeared in a half circle formation. They were visible for a few seconds, then disappeared.  This experience was absolutely amazing, I have never seen anything like this. We were all speechless.

I was walking on Bayer’s road near Joseph Howe when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. I looked up to see a small bright red light in the sky.  It was stationary and was surrounded by a larger bright blue/purplish ring. It almost appeared like a halo around the smaller light. Both light sources were constant and not blinking. It stood still and made no noise. After about a minute it started to move very slowly in an almost fluid motion that didn’t have any real pattern.  It started going left then turned around and went right, then up and down and then spun around in almost a circle.  At certain moments between changing directions it would stay stationary for a few seconds.  As it started to go right one last time, the halo disappeared and the light turned to blue before it faded and disappeared.  Then very quickly it appeared once as a bright red light with the halo bef! ore it blinked and disappeared.  I stayed around for a few minutes and walked around but didn’t see it again.  The entire experience lasted about 2-3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

He told me that there was a floating blinking light moving around the cornfield in his backyard.  As a skeptic, I told my father that I would come over and retrieve it.  I arrive at the house at roughly 1030 in the evening and head to the back door to meet my father. I look into the cornfield and can see an oval shaped light flickering roughly 120 meters away from us. It flashed like a strobe and was a milky white consistency. The light emanated from the center of the object and would rise from out of the corn and then lower back into the corn. I tried the best I could to come up with a logical explanation to the item but could not.  It was windy yet it would remain in place, if it been a balloon it would have popped or blown away. I decided to inspect the area. As I neared the end of our yard to the line of corn, I heard sounds that I could not ! identify. I could tell by the sound something was moving in the corn, but also some sort of weird watery chewy sound that I can’t exactly describe. Deciding not to enter the field I returned to the house. The light continued to raise and lower into the corn. I decided to flash a light on it from the house, and it receded into the corn. After a few minutes it came back out. We sat and watched it through binoculars and a night vision scope trying to figure out what it was. At around 100 in the morning, it receded into the corn and did not appear again. After 30 minutes of waiting we decided it had left and went to bed. In the morning, I decided to search the corn field for evidence with my father. My father and I are both military trained and have extensive knowledge in tracking, as well as being alert to our surroundings. There were no signs of activity. No footprints, no trash, no animal footprints, nothing. My father is an older man and the images are a bit shaky. It scare! d the dog which was inside the house, as it remained in the ba! ck of it s cage.<n>

To me, it appeared to be a ball of fire.  My dad said he has never seen anything like it.<n>

We live in the country and it&#39;s very wooded in this area with BLM land surrounding us.   I am always on the alert for wildlife while outside.  It was very quiet outside that night.  The sky was pretty dark, I could see stars, but mostly it was cloudy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was scanning the property, I was looking in the sky as well.  I noticed a white light low in the sky behind my house it had an appearance like a white star, but it seemed odd to be so low in this area to me for some reason it seemed out of place.  We do have neighbors behind us two houses.  The one house directly behind us is roughly  250 feet away.  The other neighbor along side them is even further from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I kept an eye on this white light for several seconds it just disappeared.  It wasn&#39;t because of cloud cover that I could see.  Seconds went by and another  white light showed up in the same area, but this time it appeared closer an! d even lower in the sky.  It was so low I saw it between the trees on the properties behind our home, but as if it was still in the sky.   Now I am certain this is not a star.  As I am watching this white light it disappears once again.  I thought that was it.   Then seconds later a white light appears again this time  on the road that runs along side my property that the neighbors behind me share.  This light is moving fast towards my direction.  I watch this light coming down the road it&#39;s going really fast and it seems higher than where I would think the car lights would be.  What I noticed next is the light appears to be crossing from the road into the trees and towards my direction then it disappears for the third time about 50 or 60 feet from where I am standing.  I waited to see if it was going to reappear again while thinking this may not be a good idea.   My dog was done doing her business, and she never appeared to notice anything that transpired.  I had a really ! bad migraine and I wanted to take a hot bath.  I did not notic! ed any s ounds coming from the light.  Not sure about the light shape appearing to be the same shape or not, it happened so fast.   The size of the light when it got the closest I would say about the size of a car headlight.   I heard no cars, I saw no cars on the road, I heard and saw no neighbors walking the road with flash lights.  Which I don&#39;t think they could match the speed it was coming down the road though a steep grade I don&#39;t think a human could even run that fast in my opinion.   Even if it was a car with no engine running, I would have heard the gravel sounds from under the tires. No usual smells.   SO it&#39;s a mystery.<n>

Light was very bright blue, at first I thought it was a star but it didn&#39;t twinkle and was too low. I was looking to the north east and it appeared farther than the houses about 2000 feet away. From my perspective it was about a foot off the roofline of those houses. After viewing for about a minute it appeared to fade out, changining to a red color then coming back to blue. As we were watching it the light went up rather quickly, while staying blue. From my perspective it was about 20 feet off the roofline. The light then dropped down below the roofline after about 25 seconds. Didn&#39;t see it anymore after that. My guess is it was either far away but there are mountains in the backdrop or it was very small and closer. Personal drone maybe?<n>

These events were  viewed from my front yard in Pomona, Ca.  All objects I viewed were a orange, and sphere shaped.  First event I assumed was military activity, from Edwards AFB or even Vandenberg AFB.  The second event was not from either site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event one:  	At 19:55 I witnessed a orange light appear from behind the San Gabriel  Mountains.  The mountain range is from west to east. I am about 10 miles from the peaks. From my yard, I witnessed a orange sphere appear from behind the range.  It was in view from 10° and rise to 45°+ above horizon.  It   began at 350° N and with straight up trajectory.  Within 15 seconds, passing through clouds it faded away.  Looked like a rocket launch, compared to ones I have seen in the past.  This one did not last long, and faded quicker than any other launch.  My thought was that it was a short range missile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event two:  	At 20:04 I witnessed my second sighting. This one was nothing like the first.  This event started on my side of the mountain range, with two orange spheres. The objects were brighter than the first.  They running together,  parallel along the mountain range.  The lights were separated by at least 20° in altitude from my perspective.  The lower of the two spheres, I believe was lower than the mountain peaks.  Or less than 10° from the horizon.  They traveled for 15 seconds or so. When they hit the 350°N line, like the first.  They both went vertical, and faded away around 45° up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can not tell what they were.<n>

On the way, we decided to stop at the oval (visible on Google Maps; search &#34;Colorado State University&#34; and look toward the NE side of campus) and watch the stars.  The sky was very clear that night, and we saw a couple of meteors.  Suddenly, a V-Shaped craft came and went.  It was a fly-over moving west and went right over our heads.  The craft was illuminated by 2 distinct orange lights as it moved, but also seemed to be outlined by that same light, suggesting that it had a light on the top side of the ship.  It moved across the sky with incredible speed, but was completely silent.  Since the fly-over, I have had high mental distress.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then for about 3 mins it changed shape and became oblong and red/green lights appeared and it looked like a Ferris Wheel.  I got out my binoculars and seen that it was pulsating light.  Bright light.  Then I looked around the sky and seen another 4 objects doing the same thing.  Bright light, red, green lights.  After 1 hour the object began to move West and hovered around for another 3 hours.  Then I seen another two objects over Superstition Mountain.  I began to scan the sky and seen at least 11 objects also pulsating light.  I also witnessed more than 12 shooting stars in the night sky.  Were they shooting stars or objects moving so fast it looked like it?  I don&#39;t know for sure.   But this was the best experience I&#39;ve had seeing objects in the sky.

The object was observed from the terrassa of a four story building.  The object was bright red and circular light.  Bigger than what  airplane lights look like at night.  The object was first observed above and near the Barcelonetta from my vantage point.  A guesstimated distance of + - 7 km. the object was moving too slow to be an airplane at that altitude.  There was no discernible sound from the object. El Prat Llobregat airport is just outside of Barcelona.  Planes can be seen and heard arriving and departing, plane can also be heard going overhead.  From my vantage point, the bright red object was too big to be a helicopter.  While going along the coast and slowly rising, the object almost came to a complete stop.  The object then proceede to go away from the Barcelonetta over the Medeterrainian Sea still slowly rising, the red light changed intensity a little bit and then disappeared.<n>

Then i went back to my house but could see past the tree line.I tryed to take a video but my phone could not make out what was going on, it was to dark.  ((DESCRIPTION) It looked like a flashlight in a foggy field but moving vary fast in the sky almost like a very bright shooting star but shooting stars don&#39;t change directions and don&#39;t happen in the same spot over and over again.  Thank you for taking time and reading my Description.<n>

When driving north, I looked to the north east to see what just appeared out of a black sky above the tree line was a pinkish-red color sphere levitating in the air.  I thought it might had been a plane exploding, but never changed it&#39;s color nor fell to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed the same color and levitated in one spot,  It was brighter then the stars. it was brighter then the red beacon lights on the towers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it lasted approximately 15 to 30 seconds, then noticed it disappeared with no sound and no movement.<n>

I looked up and saw a series of dim red lights that appeared to make a gigantic rectangle.  I pulled over to get a better look and it became obvious that the hovering lights were actually one unit.  i knew this because they moved in sync.It seemed like I could almost see the craft as it came a little closer. It gracefully went straight up in the air and disappeared.  During this time I was noticing a second craft following towards it from the Noth east.  It looked the same, but I couldn&#39;t see it as well because of the tree lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In relevance to where this happened, I was on Richardson Rd in Arnold, MO, approaching the highway 55 acceleration ramp.  The crafts were above Home Depot and Defense Mapping.  I would say that the crafts were every bit as big as a football field, if not bigger.  This was a positive sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my kids watched in disbelief for roughly 5 minutes.  I came straight home to Google it because I&#39;m sure that we are not the only people to see this.  That is when I found this site<n>

It did not leave a trail or make any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately one minute after seeing this light, a helicopter, which we could hear, rose up in the night sky and went east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They were traveling from west of West North West to East east south east. The lights traveled from horizon to horizon in approximately 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation of lights was 1 followed by 2 offset from each other and then another 2 parallel to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flew above an airliner so I know that they were at a very very high altitude and were not Satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They maintained their trajectory and heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> for the altitude that they were at they were travelling excessively fast.  Does anyone know if we bombed someone in the Central African region?  They appeared to be something like final stage rocket reentry vehicles of some sort.  There were no sounds or vibrations associated with the over-flight.  And, no vapor trails associated with them.  So, they were either traveling in near earth or upper ionosphere.  There was also no change in appearance or fading of their glow and maintained relative distance from one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither they nor the aircraft that they passed over seemed to pay any attention to the other or deviate from their course for fear of collision. normally, if I see satellites they are singular but also behave in the same way.  But the glow was more like a planet then a satellite. Possibly like a Mars type appearance but traveling.<n>

It stopped and dropped straight down.  2 seconds to where we could not see it then we saw it fly to the left at a tremendous speed the just as quick as it went to the left it came right back to the right at a tremendous speed and was gone.  We waited to see if it would come back, and it didn&#39;t.  We know when we are seeing surveillance, commercial, police, news, Tourist helicopters, and tourist sky buses in Las Vegas.  I recently move to Las Vegas, and we have never seen anything like this.<n>

The lights must have either been small or far away as they would blank out every time line-of-sight had it behind one of the power lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were unable to capture using cell phone cameras as the lights would not show up on the otherwise black screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lights appeared to be quite high in altitude, and made several back and forth flight patterns unlike what a plane would be capable of. (Helicopter, perhaps, but there was no noise)  At one point the lights changed to blue, and ultimately descended straight down behind the trees in the distance to a similar location from where it arose.  I thought perhaps it could have been a neighbor&#39;s remote-control helicopter or UFO, but was surprised at the extremely high altitude it appeared to be able to reach.<n>

Then they all separated the straight line and formed a giant square in the sky and became completely still not moving.  This all was about 3 minutes long.  While in the square one at a time the the light started to dim.  The light disappeared one at a time until all 4 fire balls were gone.  This took about another minute.  My view point was from a building 5 stories high and had a great view point of the sky.  This was a sighting around 8:55 at night and crystal clear sky.  I would guess the objects were in a southwest location from LaGrange, Illinois, maybe around Woodridge, or Naperville, Illinois.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We are both smokers, but do not smoke in our apartment, so when we smoke, we go out on our back porch.  We see airplanes constantly.   We know what they look like, we know the speed they travel in the sky and the direction they fly.  This was not a plane.  I have also seen many shooting stars and have personally launched many Chinese lanterns.  What we saw, were not either of these things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out to smoke a cigarette around 8:30 pm on Saturday night October 18, 2014.  I saw a light coming towards me which caused me to pause because planes do not come north to south towards me.  I watched the light and noticed it almost appeared a solid orange- reddish color and appeared about the altitude of a plane, but was completely different from a plane.  I sat there in almost shock as it went over my apartment.  I snapped back to reality and ran in to tell my girlfriend to come outside and look as I knew we could see it out the front door.  She quickly came out it as it was going out of sight.  The strange thing is that we could see it, but the orange- reddish light had dimmed to where you could see it, but could not tell its actual shape.  Here is the amazing part..... I looked to my right and saw two more coming.  I showed my girlfriend and we both watched as they approached.  They flew close together with the same orange- reddish light, at the same speed a! s the first, and in the same direction.  We watched as the objects lights dimmed and went out of sight.  I tried to film the last two with my cell phone, but got no satisfying results.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what these objects were, but I can say a few things..... They traveled too fast to be planes.  They flew in a completely different direction than the many planes we see every night.  The lights were different than any plane we have ever seen.  The objects were not shooting stars or Chinese lanterns.  I am hoping we were not the only people to see these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On last thing to mention....  as I stated before, we see planes all the time.  After these objects went by and at least an hour afterwards, we did not see any planes in the sky.  Thank you and I hope this will help....<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend wanted to add that the lights on all three dimmed at about the same point in the sky and these objects made no sound.<n>

Very small, yellow/gold color, somewhat like the sun the way it moves when it burns, but was a solid light, not a blinking light like an airplane light. The tail of it came out the bottom, kind of spiked in appearance. They would come as a cluster at one moment and then the next time would be one at a time, but closely following each other. At one point, they looked to make some sort of formation before the next bout would appear. Then they all stopped appearing.<n>

A thin cloud partially obscured them and their lights emitted beams like the Paramount Pictures motion logo. There was no place to pull over on the highway and I didn&#39;t want to get into an accident craning my neck and peering upward while driving so I did look only for a a few seconds.  The lights kept doing the same thing for about 3-5 minutes.  I decided to get off the highway, stop the car and look at it but after I passed Worcester it was gone. I have no idea what that was!<n>

They seemed to be connected to form some kind of craft, though it was hard to tell unless you looked very closely.  Some of them were colored red and green. The movement was irregular, it almost looked as if the craft was swimming or crawling. Pointed them out to my partner and we watched for a good hour or so.  We returned to the same field for two more nights, and the formation/lights were still there, though the object moved less and the lights seemed dimmer.<n>

Then I saw another light going counter clockwise.  It was going on for about ten minutes..   It looked like it was ether in the clouds or above them.  It was very cloudy that night.  Then, this airplane flew towards the lights then turned away from the lights then after a couple minutes the lights disappeared.  The whole thing lasted for about 15 minutes.<n>

The glowing sphere would dim and brighten regularly.  It appeared to stay stationary or slowly either drifting northwards.  I observed the object for several minutes trying to determine what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the object was way larger than any plane or helicopter that I normally see following a flight path from west to east in that area of the sky.  The object was also much brighter than any lights I have seen flashing from any conventional aircraft. Therefore I was able to rule out the source of the red glow being from a plane or hovering helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, it was difficult to gage the exact height of the object and I started guessing at other possibilities, in case the object was closer to the ground than I could actually tell, such as a hot air balloon, a flare, or other hoaxes I know of revealed on UFO type TV programs.  Nothing I could think of matched what I saw, and as I studied the object my depth perception was putting it much higher in the night sky than any of the other possibilities that ran through my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The closest match I have ever seen to this object is related to giant, colorful, glowing circular clouds produced from rocket launches, or intentionally created by a rocket for research.  I have seen these before and that was my first inclination as to what the object was.   However, 2 things changed my mind about that theory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1)  the object was in the northern sky.  I have only seen rocket launch related phenomenon in the southern sky, particular from NASA from the southern DelMarVa peninsula.  And the other is that this object had a bright light that would dim and brighten, and regular intervals, consistently  At this point I decided the object was too unfamiliar and I became too excited and decided to show my wife and ran into the house and woke her.  As we went to the window to view the object it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since checked the news for any reporting of the object to find out what it was.  I have found nothing and so decided to file this report in the hopes of someone providing an answer as to what it was, or just someone else confirming they saw it too.<n>

She was pointing at something and watching it very intently.  My husband went to see what she was looking at and he saw moving orbs of light across the street.  I went and watched.  The whole event lasted for 45 minutes.  The orbs were huge, each was about 30 feet in diameter.  They moved above a pond and were about 500 feet away from where we were.  There was no sound.  The four orbs were just above the clouds and were in the north sky.  The four orbs moved in a square clock-wise pattern, and then moved to the center as one slightly larger light, the light stayed in the center for a few seconds and then the four light orbs moved out into a square pattern again and they rotated clockwise.  It seemed almost as though they were gathering energy from their movement.  It gradually got larger and at one point there were five orbs in a pentagon movi! ng.  The clouds became a bit denser and it seemed like they were slowly moving away to the north, however, I could still see them.  Finally, the orbs moved to the center and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably advertising lights.  PD))<n>

These &#34;lights&#34; would hover at treetop or hilltop level in the southeastern sky coming up and then dipping below the treelines basically coming out of nowhere.  There would be 2 or 3 lights and then there would be 6 to 10 objects a few seconds later in various locations. I saw a string of 7 objects line up in a row at one point.  This is the second time I&#39;ve had 2 other witnesses with me lately observing this activity.  The other time was on 9-30-14, same 2 witnesses same activity and same mysterious yellow gold lights.  I am baffled as to why there are not more reports or other people noticing this although 2 reports were filed on the night of 11-10-12 that are quite interesting in this same area.  These sightings are occur! ing up to several miles away which also include San Rafael, Ross, Larkspur etc.  I will add that the 3 of us met while out walking the dog and agreed that we were witnessing something unusual.<n>

It was cloudy and cool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were moving in a synchronized fashion, 4 to 5 lights, coming together and then swooping out, circling around, then coming together again.  They would repeat this movement over and over as I traveled eastbound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were dim flashes at first, white color, getting slightly brighter as I watched.  The speed that they moved was quick, but not fast or frantic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching them ahead of me as I drove. They seemed to be moving slightly ahead of me, but not as fast as I was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I exited I465 at the I69 northbound ramp, and couldn&#39;t watch them as close, but I saw them briefly when I turned my head to the left.<n>
10/17/14 20:10|Morgantown|WV|Sphere|2 minutes|White, orb of light hovers, then darts into Western sky over downtown Morgantown|11/6/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114918.html|353|ndxe201410| White, orb of light hovers, then darts into Western sky over downtown Morgantown<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday, October 17, between 8:10pm and 8:15pm, Morgantown, West Virginia - over South Park area. Large, white orb of light hovers then darts from Northwest sky to Western sky where it disappeared in the distance.  The sky was cloudy, but there is always a great deal of ambient light in our area coming from the downtown area and a nearby mall complex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was standing on the front porch of our house, looking north-west. She noticed a large, “softball sized,” white orb below the cloud cover.  Possibly 250-400 feet above the ground and maybe four or five blocks north of our house.  It was hovering/hanging in the sky when she first spotted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As she tried to comprehend and understand what she was looking at, it darted away, and crossed the entire sky/horizon in under a second.  It did not leave a visible trail or change directions.  At first she thought it was a star or low flying plane, but realized it was a round orb of light.  It dashed across the sky in a straight line, and she thought it traveled horizontally without gaining or losing altitude.  Moved at such a fast speed, she is confident it was not a helicopter, drone or plane.  It had the appearance of a shooting star except it started from a dead stop.  It was also eerily quiet outside that evening and the object made no noticeable noise either while hovering or moving! across the sky.<n>
10/17/14 20:00|Moselle|MS|Changing|9pm-7am|A sky full of UFOs in our sight all night|11/6/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114992.html|354|ndxe201410| A sky full of UFOs in our sight all night<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we was laying outside relaxing looking at stars. I had a couple drinks and I thought my mind was playing games with me when I saw vivid objects right in front of me. The harder we looked at the stars we realized these aren&#39;t stars. I saw one distant flashing something that caught my eye.  I just knew I was imagining until Randy asked if I saw it and we was seeing the same thing.  We studied harder and harder and there was more than one of the weird flashing star.  We watched it together as it transformed into at least ten different obvious pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we talked to each other and realized we both saw the same thing,  We stood up found one in clear view looked at it and it became clear.  Like a space ship flashing blue then changing shapes, dimensions, colors, etc..  Something you thought was never possible. As we stared and talked to each other we noticed it kept moving closer but fast and all of a sudden in literally half a second it flew down in front of u! s turned around and flew back. This sent us in serious fear running inside freaking out.  We go on the front porch look at the sky only to find that there&#39;s over 100 ufos flying around us. All so different and unique but nothing we&#39;ve ever seen or can comprehend so I will use what vocabulary I have to try to describe these mystery machines. As me and Randy are looking at all this going on in the sky in the trees to our right was a strange bold orange glow circle that caught your eye. I thought well that&#39;s weird but I don&#39;t know. Later looking at it we noticed the orange circle had a red beam coming out.. We could tell it was tall rectangle and could love right and left almost as it was scanning us. As we are witnessing this we don&#39;t want to be the only ones to see it so we call over a friend to come make sure we are really seeing what we are seeing. As she pulled up and we pointed stuff out at first she only saw stars, but as you stare longer you can vividly see the objects ! and size. Kind of. She told us that she saw it and it was some! thing cr azy going on up there. We kept calling people over to come witness what we was seeing, most laughing and saying &#34;what drugs are you on&#34; like no really, please come see this. so we was up to 5 people watching in amazement, shock, and fear. As we were all scared watching from the porch Randy would get closer. Then out of no where a green laser is on his chest. He freaked and we all ran inside slowly making it back out to keep watching the magic show in the air. My paw paw who thought we was crazy and a non believer came down and as we showed him and he really saw it he actually admitted it. He was truly frightened and went home. The main things are the flashing blue &#34;mother ships&#34; there was about 18 in view. Each flashing blue and changing to a white halo form at different times or a suoer bright white thing.  Occasionally sending out red dots. The next thing we noticed we called &#34;glow worms&#34; they looked like little glow worms in the sky moving we! irdly but as any light would be shone around them you could then tell that these things were like helicopters? They flew around in no certain way just weirdly with huge wings. You can not describe the size, shape or texture everything seemed paper thin floating weirdly in the wind. We also saw the flashing blue mother ships open up and let out two flashing blue &#34;babies&#34; we watched both of them float down to our yard. When they hit the ground a white light came on them and they literally explored. We lost them as they scattered. They were literally dropped 40 feet in front of us. All of a sudden from the side of our yard just SWOOSH flashing hovercraft going so fast you could barely see it, but you could hear it. It flew out of no where right over our heads, and it sounded like a plane, it was silent and out of no where for three second just a loud jet plane sound. This scared Christy home. The flashing blue mother ships then let out a long &#34;rope&#34; I can&#39;t! describe it any other way, and somehow picked up the babies o! ff the g round and picked them up swinging them in the air like reeling them in but not all the way in. They would let the babies hang under them but thanks to the flashing blue lights you could clearly see a rope type something coming out both literally connected. as we stared at the sky and tried to connect what we could we was finally able to put together a hugeeeeeeeeeee gray ship the size of double our trailer hovering above us. It wasn&#39;t easy to spot but as we looked straight up you could just see the shadow. With all kind of compartments and lights. It opened up in weird places releasing flashes of light. Some ufos would send down a bright white light to the ground that looked exactly like a shooting star. But we watched about 15 of these so we knew they was shooting something down here.We walked inside walked out and noticed half of everything that was in the sky was gone... However some stuck around for hours almost like they didn&#39;t want to leave us cause they was watching u! s.  I would say start to finish for us we noticed them around 9 pm and didn&#39;t see them all gone until sun rise. As we watched as long as we could as most cleared out we noticed a massive platform. HUGE. We then heard weird noises coming from around us it was weight on leaves, a gargley weird notice, and the sound of a bird getting his head chewed off. Me and randy realized that we was the only two actually amazed that it was happening. Everyone else to scared to stay or admit it, they just didn&#39;t seem as interested as me and randy. Me and randy could see the smallest things and tell what they was. This was one of the most life changing experiences of my life and scariest moment ever. I fear the unknown and what we saw going on was to crazy to comprehend. As we wondered the whole time why here? Why us? Why won&#39;t they leave? Who is controlling this? I mean the ships would literally tansform into a flat line. How does it know where to fly? Oh yeah we also noticed a red light c! oming from back yard we did not look further into because we k! new for a fact we had no kind of red lights around and it was a huge red beam with white on top like on the ground it looked like that&#39;s where they landed or something but like I said we wouldn&#39;t go close enough to actually see. We did notice when we first realized it was a UFO we immediately got negative vibes. Paranoid, scared, unsure of self. The technology was unbelievable. Something my brain literally could not Phathm at all. When it finally turned daylight we went to search outside to see if we could find any evidence from where we saw the ships dropping stuff all over our land. But we found nothing. But as we looked in the tree forest not to far into it we both saw it. Yes a space ship. We both froze just thinking are you serious? Did they really park this in our back yard? We could perfectly see the tall 4 metal legs that was tall as the trees with a metal egg shaped thing on the legs with green stripes. We immediately started walking towards it and when we got there, nothin! g was there.. At All. We looked again from where we was originally standing and nothing was there. My cats were weirdly paranoid and all ran inside with a look of fear. When we was inside peeking thru the windows we also saw one of the glow worm air plane things 3 feet from us hovering right there by our front porch as soon as we went to get a picture it was ZOOOP gone.<n>

The lights and the way they were fashioned and how low it flew in the sky I knew that this was not an airplane.  This object hovered for a little bit a few feet away from my house.  As I got out of the car to take a closer look I was able to see that this was a circular craft that moved slow.  As I tried to get closer it pulled away down the street and then hovered at the end of the street.  It stayed there for a few minutes before heading towards 94.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This flare up star shaped object, was about five times the size of the original golden ball.  A few minutes after this sighting, I witnessed second golden sphere on the southern horizon.  This ball also flared up, but not nearly as much as the first one had -- maybe three times it&#39;s original size.  I never saw any bliking landing lights on either of these objects, so they didn&#39;t resemble airplanes -- plus the color was wrong for airplanes, which are usually more orange, or red in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Because I am very aware of UFO&#39;s n always watch alien documentaries all the time, and I once saw something I thought was a UFO.  But this was very close, only about 3 blocks away I&#39;d say. And its just so (I can&#39;t even explain the feeling) to actually witness it first hand, and so close. So had a really bad feeling about it.  Why in Philly?  A largely populated city where a lot of people are still out at 1 am.  That means they are started not to care if see. Which I believe is either a very bad thing.  Or a very bad thing.  No good can come of this. I even posted on a social media about it to see if anyone else seen it.  And my friend said he did. I didn&#39;t even give a description of it.  I just asked if anyone s! een that in the sky, and he said &#34;I seen it. It was a greenish light rite.  It flashed and I was waiting for the boom.  I almost ((deleted)) panicked .  I&#39;m just so overwhelmed and needed somewhere to vent where I wouldn&#39;t sound crazy.  Cause like they all say &#34;I know what I saw&#34;<n>

I know it wasn&#39;t a shooting star because it wasn&#39;t streaming across the sky it was heading inbound to the ground.  There was no sound.  It was a mile or two at best away from me. It was very bright.  The speed in which it came down was incredible.  I&#39;ve never seen anything move that fast.  My radio started to get all static like as it happened.  It was so amazing.  I&#39;ve waited all my life to see something and I finally did.  I hope I see it again.<n>

We were layer back in zero gravity chairs watching the fire and looking up towards the sky.  I noticed what seemed to be a falling star and got her attention to look up at it.  As it moved from the North kind of in a South-West Direction it got brighter as a normal meteor would when it breaches the earths atmosphere.  It was moving at an incredible rate of speed as most meteors do.  Out of nowhere, the object did a complete 180 degree turn and started heading in a due North direction.  When I saw this I yelled at my fiancé who was also watching it.  I was excited and started explaining that meteors don&#39;t just change direction.  I don&#39;t think she quite grasped how important and significant this was.  I continued to watch it and it bobbled in the sky (like a line on a heart monitor would blip downward) but still mainta! ined the same speed.  I lost it behind a tree and never regained sight of it again.  I work as a supervisor in the aircraft industry and have even worked on military aircraft.  This was not a plane.  I am not saying it is alien in origin, but nothing I have ever seen moves that fast and changes direction as quickly as this did.  If I had to venture a guess I would say it is possible it is some sort of military project not yet brought to light, but honestly I am dumb-founded by it.  I told my lifelong friends, and they just kind of snickered.  I am not the type of person who would make up stories.  I know what I saw.  Until last night I never really payed to much interest in these sorts of things, but I would love to find an answer as to what it was.  I will continue to watch the sky at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We had rented a beach front home in the Plantation area, which is at the west end of the island.  We noticed the light around 11:00PM EDT.  There is virtually no light pollution at St. George Island, and it was very clear that night with plenty of stars and you could see the Milky Way Galaxy clearly.

Again, way off in the distance and high in the sky over the ocean.  We watched the light for a while, and then all of a sudden 5 additional lights lit up one at a time in 2 second intervals until all were lit. They were in a straight vertical pattern from right to left of the main object; the 5 lights were equal distance apart, stationary and didn’t move and were crystal clear/bright.  They were slightly smaller than the main object/light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 5 additional lights were bright orange/red, but the main light was green with a slender orange/red circle. Once all 5 additional lights were lit they stayed on for 15 to 20 seconds and then went dark at the same time, while the main object/light stayed lit and did not move. Then approximately 3 to 5 minutes later the exact same thing/pattern happened again.  In total it did this 3 times and on the 3rd time the 5 lights and main light went dark at the exact same time and didn’t not appear again, just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed at the Island until Saturday, 18 Oct 2014, but we did not see the object(s) and/or light(s) again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observers: 3 females/2 males - Director of Training, Senior Software Engineer, Training Manager, Retired Small Business Owner, Retired Teacher<n>

There was one oval by itself and to the right of that oval was a cluster of five ovals in an oval shaped cluster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance, they seemed to be &#34;floating.&#34; Momentarily I thought they might be Mylar balloons, but then realized that each oval was floating away from each other &#34;on purpose&#34; and there was a very dim circle of lights around each oval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to shout, &#34;Look, look, look&#34; to my boyfriend.  As I was shouting for him to look up, the ovals purposely moved into a &#34;V&#34; formation, very similar to what a flock of birds looks like when flying long distances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The singular oval craft stayed to the left of this formation and then the entire group of ovals picked up speed.  During this entire time, there was no sound of any kind being emitted by these objects.  They did not fly like a plane...  They propelled forward, but could also move from side to side or up and down.  It took less then 2 seconds to get into the V formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time my boyfriend spotted them in the sky they were already in the V formation and flying away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flew away from where we were and just appeared to &#34;disappear&#34; into the sky, like the sky &#34;swallowed&#34; them.<n>

They said it suddenly appeared and was sitting in the same spot for several minutes.  By the time they called me out to make sure they were not seeing things, the light just disappeared. They said it did not drop, did not move, did not fly away… it just disappeared. I told them to call me out there if it came back. Not even a minute later they called me back out on the porch and showed me the light. It was bright red and just sitting in the sky above the trees. It was there for about a minute and then disappeared again. I sat with them for a few minutes to see a bright yellowish light appear, then the bright red light appear to the right of the yellowish light. The lights were sitting in the same spot, they did not move up, seem to come from below, drop, or move; they just seemed to sit in one spot then! disappear. I took video of the last occurrence and noticed just after the yellowish light disappeared, there was a green flash of light visible (only in the video; not to the naked eye) over the red light before it disappeared. I thought all of this was strange enough to share.<n>

I was taking a picture of one with my iphone, I did get 4 shots as the vehicle got close  overhead, suddenly my camera stopped working.  The close vehicle overhead had 4 lights I know red, white and green I think, the forth I’m not sure as I told my partner it made the vehicle look square.  It looked like an invasion as there were so many!

I proceeded to shut it off because I was uneasy about it.  Then my husband and I were sitting on the back porch smoking a cigarette waiting for our supper to finish cooking in the oven.  I noticed a string of lights of varying colors a quarter of a mile out which I then pointed out to my husband.  I immediately asked my husband to turn off the porch light and kitchen light to minimize light pollution.  The lights kept dimming down then growing extremely bright.  The lights began to rotate and alter color. Red and white being the most dominant.  Shortly thereafter the lights on the craft separated, turned a bright red, and formed a u shaped arc.  Then the lights dimmed, the craft sunk behind the tree line, and a bright white light pierced through the trees.  There seemed to be two of them at this point.  With no more than 30 feet in between them.  The last activity we saw was the craft rising up and producing red rotating lights around its perimeter.  At which point we became uneasy and went inside.<n>

I assumed it was a plane taking off from the Reno airport.  It made a couple maneuvers that were not possible for even a small plane.  It suddenly dropped low and then shot up at a steep angle.  It had 3 white lights that changed to 3 red lights, no flashing lights.  The object then did a loop.  It was too low for any craft I know of, even single person craft to make a loop, so I tried to pull over.  There was a lot of traffic on the road so by the time I pulled over there were trees or bushes between me and the craft.  I also observed at least 3 other cars pulled over on the right side of the road.  It was difficult to see because of the trees; but i could still see the lights as it flew up and down at the south end of the lake.  I drove up to the first off ramp and turned around.  As I was! heading south, it flew by heading north and I did not see it again.  There were still 2 cars pulled off after I continued back north on my way.  I did not hear engine noise, but there was also background noise from the traffic.  I would have noticed the distinct sound of a helicopter and I think there were lulls in traffic that I could have picked up the sound of a small plane engine.  Planes from the airport were clearly visible and completely different from the &#34;craft&#34; lights I could see which were much brighter, lights were white and had no flashing lights at all.  Planes from airport were much higher, lights looked yellower and had blinking lights and flew in a straight line.  I was a skydiver and have had a lot of experience with small planes.  I have no explanation for what I observed.  It appeared too large to be a drone or any remote controlled craft I&#39;ve seen.<n>

It moved fairly quick.  The white mist had a very long tail. I looked for a plane but couldn&#39;t find any aircraft in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat in my car and watched this object move very slow and deliberate.  At times it seemed as if it would pause and then start moving again.  The cloud cover was infrequent and what clouds there were, were wispy.  I saw the object pause several times and it seemed like it slowed down.  As the object descended downward the contrail- or whatever it was, seemed to decrease and the tail became smaller until it was almost indistinguishable from the object. It paused before going through a wispy cloud.  I sat and waited until it came through the cloud but it never appeared again.  There was no debris.  One minute it was there and the next it was gone.  And the contrail ceased to exist.  The entire incident lasted approximately 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

There seemed to be nothing holding them together.  They were moving at what seemed to be a little faster than a passenger jet.  The back headlight was going first, then they lined up, and the front headlight continued first after that.  That suggested that I saw the front and the back of the craft.  Soon after, I saw a passenger jet going in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 13 year old male that was waiting for the school bus.<n>

As I video this on my phone no matter what I saw on my phone I could not see with my naked eye.  It was very strange.

We were on N. Main Street in our car facing South in moderate traffic when we noticed a bright constant white light in the sky above the valley traveling right to left, or West to South East, at an extremely fast speed that instantly grabbed our attention.  It had no blinking lights as would normally be present on an aircraft and it was traveling so far that we immediately concluded that it wasn&#39;t a plane or jet.  It maintained a horizontal trajectory, never falling the way a shooting star would.  We watched it for approximately 20 seconds before we lost view of it in the distance, still glowing bright white as it traveled down the valley towards Soledad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were clouds in the sky, and while we saw common airplanes in the sky immediately after, moving slowly in comparison and receding occasionally behind a cloud, we both noted that the UFO never receded behind any clouds during our brief observation.  This indicates that it flew below the cloud line low enough in the Salinas Valley to rule out a satellite or missile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have an annual air show here and we both grew up watching jets race over the valley one weekend out of every year.  We both agree what we saw was by far much much faster than any jet we&#39;ve ever witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sitting on my back porch at 7:28 pm eastern time and saw a single object that looked triangular in shape. The top of it had two flashing white lights and the bottom a single flashing red light.  The three lights formed a triangle.  It was approaching me head on. The craft appeared to be about a mile away, but it is difficult to gauge the distance because I didn&#39;t know the actual size of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this is not a usual airline flight path, I assumed it was a helicopter.  I watched it for about 15 seconds and saw it change course at what looked like a 90 degree turn to its left as well as about a 45 degree trajectory upwards.  Not that unusual, I thought.  But before itdisappeared, I saw two more identically looking objects approach from the same spot the first one appeared.  They were at the same height  the first one was when it initially appeared and were side by side about the width of my pinky finger held out in front of me.  These two also turned to their left and began an ascent at about 45 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A second set of two identically looking objects then appeared just as the first set had done.  They approached me and then made the same turn to their left and about a 45 degree ascent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a total of five objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As each object made their turn, they became barely visible and looked like little dots of white  light.

Also, their approach pattern was different, appearing in three patterns, one after the other.  The original siting had them in formation, all together.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could compare it to the size of the 747 aircraft  –which I could plainly see (with the airline paint color scheme too) - taking off beneath it.  The flashing lights were at first just hovering over the airport runway (just west of the control tower) at a height of 1000 Ft, with the aircraft landing and taking off beneath it.  I at first thought it was a couple of police or news helicopters there, until I saw that there was NO RED flashing lights that all aircraft are supposed to have.  Then the lights started to slowly move; one behind the other;  in a eastern direction to where Sepulveda Blvd. goes under the runway thru the tunnel.  Then they  moved in  parallel  to each other,  and flew south over Sepulveda Blvd.  at about! 100 ft. until it was near the intersection of Rosecrans. There was NO SOUND; there was NOTHING VISIBLE between the lights; but I could plainly see that the lights were fixed to a solid object.  At that point it continued to slowly move; one light behind the other;  in a eastern direction again until I could not distinguish it among the line of aircraft lined up to land at LAX.<n>

What brought it to my attention was the craft seemed to be spinning end for end about it&#39;s center and it was shooting out a white plume in sort bursts that disipated quickly.   I was facing almost due west, the object was relatively close to the sun in the sky, but the sun&#39;s location was essentially south of the object,  The object was about 40 to 45 degrees above the horizon.  The sun reflected off the object, which made it visible for the duration of viewing, giving it the appearance of metal reflecting sunlight.  It appeared to straighten it&#39;s attitude to an East/West orientation but at the same time appeared to be drifitng to the North and slightly East until it disappeared from view.  The spin was tight- too tight even for aerobatic aircraft.  No other aircraft were immediately in the vicinity.  The craft also was silent.  Width to length ratio was about 1 to 15.<n>

We glanced over the Fredericksburg city area and we saw this enormous flashing green, blue, and yellow light.  It was over Rt1.  There is no way we were the only one to see this. If the Northern Lights could flash with many shades of yellow in it and some blue, that was it.  We didn&#39;t spot an aircraft of some sorts due to traffic picking up and our main concentration was driving safely.<n>

It was wobbling and going around in a large circle, when another one just like it &amp; flying better came to join it &amp; seemed to help it., then they both flew away together.  I saw this object by accident when I went outside to put outgoing mail in my mailbox at the curb.  After I saw it circling I ran into the house &amp; grabbed my camera.  Batteries ran low so I could not get a pic of the two of them.  Trees were also in the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they left about 15 min later I heard &amp; saw 3 small helicopters going by overhead in the same direction that the ufos left,  it was in an easterly direction, in the same direction as Cape Canaveral. Had alot of interference &amp; static on my radio when the ufos were outside. Was listening to the George Noory show on the radio &amp; when the static started that&#39;s why I decided to go outside to drop off my mail, Carried my puppy dog outside with me &amp; he immedi! ately was agitated and was growling &amp; looking up in the sky.  I could hear a quiet humming noise coming from the objects.  They were about 80 ft. in the air.  These ufos were like the ones in the movie &#34;war of the worlds&#34; but smaller &amp; not a bent shape; but had a green glow on the tips &amp; a blue glow at the center point.  The second ufo came from the NW and flew onto the top of the other one and seemed to attach itself to the one in trouble to help it out; then they both left at a rapid speed.  I was going to call the G.Noory show but it was off the air after the objects had left, you may comment on the show for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ps/  These may have been gov. drones, but I don&#39;t think they were, they acted too intelligent to be remote controlled.!

It was a bright white light and we saw no other red green lights like you do on an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was lower than a normal plane would be in that area.

It looked like the stars where moving. we noticed three different columns of lights flying slightly behind and to either side.  There were so many we lost count more than forty.  There were regular aircraft flying lower they seemed to be commercial aircraft.  We felt like it was an invasion.  They were just white lights of different sizes flying in formations at a very high altitude.  They did not make any sound they were much slower than the commercial aircraft.<n>

I noticed it wasn&#39;t moving...or if it appeared to move, was in very, very  small circles...so got out the binoculars, turned all the exterior house lights off, and held them as steady as I could against a tree, and watched this thing for over 15 minutes.  I think it was spherical in shape, but I can&#39;t be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It never really seemed to move, the light just kept oscillating red, blue, white, appearing from a single point, not separate points...but this was at significant altitude, so it could have been separate lights close together.  At arms’ length, it’s size was perhaps 1 millimeter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching for this period of time, suddenly, in a %$#&amp; instant, and I mean, in a half-second, it became a pinpoint, way far off, moving from the SSE to the SSW, and its inclination went from about 30 degrees off the horizon to perhaps 60 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At arms’ length, its size at this point was only a fraction of a millimeter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could barely make it out, but could still see a faint color change taking place, unlike the stars around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tried to keep focused on it, but it disappeared or I lost track of it.  Stayed out there for a while, hoping for another look, but the clouds moved in.<n>

Then jets proceeded to chase it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, big orange balls lit up in sky.  Flashing like a flash light on and off signaling each other, while jets kept hovering in the area like they were chasing them.  Really awesome site to see.  UFO sightings.<n>

I looked up on the side of the house and I seen what looked like an orange flashlight (globe), light right up then die and then right next to another light right up stayed lit up for little bit, then died out and then ANOTHER. While watching these i noticed possibly a jet doing circles around these lights(globes)  By this time i was like wtf??  Went to grab for phone to video tape but didn&#39;t have it so ran into house yelling lights in the sky grabbed phone and kept it on recording.  Again, it&#39;s a clear night; we can see everything.  I noticed 2 what looked like satellites flying over and then 2 jets (could tell by flashing ! lights) still flying around.  Would get quite for a few minutes and then you could hear their loud rumble roar noise.  I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s the after burners? then quite again then that noise again. They were doing circles the whole time. and then they flew off and everything was quiet.<n>

I suddenly noticed a bright silver streak in the sky as if the bright son was reflecting off of an airplane.  I kept waiting for the image to change and then the streak just disappeared.  I didn’t at the point think much of it, but a few seconds after I saw what appeared to be a fire trail from nowhere burning into the clear sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, I told my son, and we quickly went to his deck to get a better view.   Just as we arrived on the deck about 3 orbs appeared.  They were far away and looked about the size of large star.  It was daylight and you could see them clearly.  Perfectly round and moving slightly; some moving faster than others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one that was the steadiest and affixed in one place for a while as if staring at us, suddenly burst into a flame it appeared.  Making a definite light streak as you will see on the video.  On the camera it appears as white, but in reality, pink to coral was the color of the streak and quite beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a matter of seconds, the streak was gone, but the orb remained just as it was before.  It had, to the naked eye, to not have moved at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were witnessing and trying to video this astonishing sight with a camera during the next 20 minutes, we noticed a total of 5 orbs in all.  These 5 orbs started moving toward the same location.  Some of them streaked as the moved, and they were moving due west of Downtown Denver to the right of Mount Evans.  As they approached the outlying hills, they dropped from the sky and fell behind a smaller peak.  One by one they disappeared slowly, deliberately to the same point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately called the local news channels to ask what they were.  I was hung up on by two of the major channels and finally the local ABC affiliate asked for a video.  We had to condense the video to the point I am sure it was hard to see, but as we watched the news there was no mention of these events at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have called the FAA in Washington and they were helpful and told me to report these events to the local office here. Which I have done.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It does not have to be explained as aliens invading the earth, but it would be nice if the powers that be would at least tell the public they are not crazy when they see an actual event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

The 3 seemed to turn into 15 or 18.  They  darted around then seemingly began outlining what looked to be a bigger object.  At this time there were gaps between the bright lights and the trails of light created what looked to be a much larger object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the darting &#34;stars&#34; or lights, became observable lines outlining the object.  I swear it looked like a ship.  From the movies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Simultaneously as the lights became a solid outline (in between the light there were stars set exeactly how they were supposed to be, in essence it was projecting what was behind it on it or in front of it) it suddenly melded forward, then flat out blasted off from north to south following the mountain ridge line.<n>

As I traveled East, I kept thinking that it looked like a surveillance vehicle but as I turned north I realized the vehicle was facing  to see a flying object at about 100 ft above the ground that seemed to be floating. The object had intermittent white lights forming a line.  The body of the object seemed to be rectangular in shape.  It was dark so the lights were the only guide to size and shape.<n>

I&#39;m hoping someone can tell me about this one:  standing outside with a friend originally facing north watching all these strange objects, i turned around (facing South/southwest) to walk back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t even have to glance up to see 4 bright orange lights spaced evenly apart in a horizontal line traveling slowly and steadily in a south/sw direction.  I should have seen them prior to my turning around, according to the direction in which they were flying.  If it was one object, it was bigger than any plane I&#39;ve ever seen, and didn&#39;t seem to be as high as planes normally fly at night, or as fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in to get a camera and when I came back out my friend who was with me said he saw a bright red light shoot out the &#34;back&#34; at a much higher speed in a north/nw direction.  This red object was blinking and traveling much faster than a  plane (which I was trying ! to convince him it was).  It either got too far away to see, lost in clouds, or disappeared.  We lost visuals on the original 4 lights over a tree line.  There were no sounds from either the blinking red or orange lights.  I just want a logical explanation! Thank you!<n>

I was walking outside to get my work cloth out of my car to was and I notice in clouds over a dozen faint oval lights moving very fast and then they would pause in the night skys clouds. I thought they might be spot lights and I decided to call the are local dispatch Cumberland County Sheriffs.  They told me they didnt know what the lightswhere but there was nothing on the ground that they could find.  I noticed there was nothing shining on the ground or a trail of light shining up from the ground.  They would move in a pattern formation and a group of them would start to spin like a ferris wheel and then they would shoot from one side of the clouds to another.  What kept getting me was they would stop.  The police also told I was the fourth person to call at that point.  I called at 9:00pm.  The next morning I was running errands and I ran to a neighbor that asked if I had seen them! also. Several people witnessed the event.  It lasted over an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have called the local news media twice and I emailed them once.  I tried contacting the Maine Air National Guard.  I just want to find out whag I shaw in the sky.  If you research this the police will confirm that others called dispatch and reported the lights.  I just want answers.  I tried to record them with my camera on my phone but I wasnt able to pick them up.  My father and brother witness them also.<n>

Although it was overcast, I had sunglasses on so I took them off so as to get a better look and convince myself that I wasn’t “seeing things” like spots or anything.  To my intriguing surprise, they were real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were round like (as if you were to look at a tube from its side) and each had two short legs coming out of them just like what helicopters have so as to land but these had round balls at the ends.  The distance from one UFO to another looked like it may have been maybe 50-70 feet apart (hard to tell when you’re about 200 feet away).  The objects were moving westbound and it didn’t seem as if they were flying fast so as to get away but gave the impression that they were either observing and/or looking for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately the red light changed to green and I had to go.  I quickly drove into the Walmart parking lot that was right there but by the time I parked and got out of my car, I didn’t see the UFOs anymore.<n>

I heard a faint noise that sounded a little like a car or motorcycle engine, which isn&#39;t uncommon here.  When I looked out the window toward the road I saw a light about mid-way in the tree line, about roughly a foot or two off the ground.  I thought someone might have been coming through the trees in something with only one headlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made it to the road rather quickly, but as it moved and when it reached the road it pulsed or sort of glowed from bright to dim. Bright..2..3..Dim..2..3..Bright.  Once it reached the road between two signs that mark a merging side road and a &#34;No trucks&#34; (church property) sign, the humming intensified.  It was only there a moment when it made the sound that reminds me of static discharge, and sparks covered the road in a flash of white light, followed by a web of what I can only describe as lightning in nature, laced in a purple hue.  One of the branches of that light forked over and touched the light in the parking lot which made a loud static, almost sonic sound which startled me away from the window. When I looked back, it was gone. The only animal that seemed bothered was my smallest cat, who walked up to the door of my room with wide, narrowly slit-pupil eyes and ears swiveling, as if he were listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My uncle, whom was asleep at the time, heard it and thought our heat pump had blown. I went out after the rain slowed to investigate, but nothing seemed to be struck, or damaged. Not the power lines, or metal signs or light post. It was like it never happened. This last part might have been my imagination getting away from me, but as I was walking back and forth searching the area where I had seen the orb hovering on the road, I heard a rustle in the low bean bushes in the field in front of the trees just on the other side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved closer to it to see if it were an animal, or just my imagination and I heard a guttural sound. It was a gurgle, or a croak of sorts, but nothing like I have ever heard before. My uncle told me it was probably just a frog, but I have lived here for almost 6 years now and have never heard a frog make the sound I heard. It scared me so badly I ran back across the road and inside without looking back and locked the door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if this was paranormal, extraterrestrial or what, but I do know that I am officially freaked out.<n>

Then I noticed two of them were blinking red lights.  I would say near and way high above the east hills in San Jose, CA.  About 2 mins of watching these lights, I went and got the binoculars and I watched one of them and it was jumping around, moving high and coming back down.  Then all of a sudden we hear coming up from behind us (right about where San Jose Airport is) a helicopter.  He went over our heads and straight for the middle of the two bright lights. To our disbelief, he took his place in between these two bright red blinking lights and now there are 4 perfectly spaced bright stars blinking red.  Right now as I&#39;m writing this, a helicopter just flew over the house back towards San Jose Airport.  All I can say is they must be doing some kind of training or exercise .... I saw on this site others from San Jose saying some of what I&#39;m saying, so I think it might just be routine ... Thanks<n>

The night was very clear, so clear we could see the Milky Way and the small satellites that circle the earth.  We turned off all of the lights in the cabin and stood out in a field to take long exposure photographs of the sky. We rarely get to do this kind of activity, because we live in the city.  At some point, as my friend was leaning down to setup another shot and  I was staring up at the night sky amazed by the amount of stars that could be seen with the naked eye, the UFO appeared above us.  It was shaped like a boomerang and twirled quickly, silently across the sky. It was huge.  From my perspective, I would say it appeared to be about 5 feet wide, but I sensed it was very high in the sky and could only imagine the true size to be much, much larger.  And the shape was very sharp, I knew immediately it was made by an intelligent being.  It glowed green, like the color of a glow stick, and it seemed that there were markings on the boomerang: a circle near the terminus of each &#34;wing&#34; and three thin lines on each side where the &#34;wings&#34; met at the center.  The craft appeared, spun across the sky from east to west, and then disappeared in a second/second and 1/2; however, I saw so much detail because I was already staring at the sky when the craft appeared.  My friend also saw the craft, but only the brightness of it, since she was looking up through her camera.  Her glimpse was of the UFO&#39;s brightness and the last instant of it&#39;s appearance.<n>

It was not travelling very fast, so I went to the cottage to get the other person to look at this light.  The other person said it is just an aircraft.  I said it is one constant bright color of red, no noise, it is not a plane it is not blinking and is not high in the sky like all other planes and there is no wind for it to be a balloon and it is to bright red.  It is not fireworks, because the light is constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red light was moving toward the South East, and never varied in height.  Then it went out of site, miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only one bright red light.  The light was lot bigger than the normal air craft lights and was closer to the earth.  I had a clear view nothing impeded it.  The object did not leave any vapour trail.<n>

It appeared to be an airplane but there was no sound and then it suddenly descended very quickly and then, just as quickly, it started ascending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a few seconds it was rising and falling and twisting and turning erratically.  The light was white but would fade to a reddish color at times.  It moved to the northeast.  It did not go directly over me.  I would guess that it was over Loop 1604 and I-10 when I last saw it.  As it traveled, the light would sometimes not be visible but would soon appear further along in the direction it was travelling.  The strange motion is what caught my eye and is the only reason this light was unusual.<n>

I had the back lights out so I got a pretty good look at it it was dark like the clouds kinda grayish like it was blended in with them.  The shape was as  if you took 2 frisbie turned one upside down and glued them together.  It was almost silent but you good hear like a electrical kind of sound very slight.

The skies were pretty clear and for once I saw more stars than usual.  Not enough to write home about, but more than most nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, I saw a disc of bluish/white light going RAPIDLY from East to West.  It was fast and it crossed the horizon in only seconds.  There were no flashing lights as the whole thing was lit up as if from inside.  It was not brightly lit either, maybe the equivalent of a TV left on at night seen from across the neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was FAST.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like that and I&#39;ve never seen anything move that fast in the night sky before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its path was straight with no deviation whatsoever, it just zipped across the sky and disappeared in the East.  If I had to guess how big it might have been, I’d say maybe the size of two jumbo jets put together given how high up in the sky it seemed to be.  No sound.<n>

10/12/14 20:05|Wilmington|DE|Light|5-7 minutes|Lots of pulsing red lights flying in formation, against the wind, south of the Philadelphia metro area|11/6/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114497.html|473|ndxe201410| Lots of pulsing red lights flying in formation, against the wind, south of the Philadelphia metro area<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday October 12th, 2014, a little after 8pm EST, my husband had gone outside to turn off the lights in our detached garage.  He immediately shouted back to me to come outside and bring the camera – his tone was urgent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fumbled for a moment getting the camera, and when I stepped out our back door I was aghast!  The sky to the north of our home was lit up like a Christmas tree with a large cluster of red pulsating lights that were flying in formation from east to west.  I set the camera to video and started filming.  I was standing on the top step and my husband was below me, and to my left, at ground level. He told me to step down for a better viewpoint.  I had difficulty doing so because I couldn’t see the stairs in the dark.  He helped me down, and I filmed all the while.  The video jiggles around during that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sight of these lights was startling.  The lights pulsed from a dim glowing orange red to a strong, deep red.  While they moved in one large formation, each light was variable enough in its speed and pulsing that they appeared to be individual crafts, as opposed to many lights on one large craft.  I estimate there were between 25 and 50 crafts.  They moved in unison, but did not pulse in unison.  The visual effect was scintillating, like Christmas tree lights that fade in and out rapidly and randomly.  They moved slower than the average airplane, and they made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband ran inside to grab the phone during the sighting.  He intended to call our next door neighbor so there would be another witness.  As he did so, the lights began to fade out and disappear.  I called to him that they were disappearing!  He abandoned the phone and returned outside to catch the last of the crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were some stragglers that followed after the large formation was gone. These later craft were slightly different from the others; they flew more in a single file line than in a cluster, they seemed to be larger lights than the others and the color was more orange. While their color also pulsed, it seemed slower and stronger than the formation lights. I tried zooming in on one of these craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My SD card ran out of space during filming and I had to run inside and change to a new card. I resumed filming on the new card. I also tried to zoom in and take some still photos, but the shutter speed was too long for a hand held shot. (I got photos of smeared lights). At some point during the sighting, I checked my watch and the time was 8:10pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon reviewing the videos, the red craft are not as visible in the film as they were to the naked eye. The brighter ones appear in the video, but the camera didn’t capture them all; the sky was shimmering with them! Also, reviewing the video I noticed some larger, more orangeish craft on the upper right side. These look like those other craft that came afterwards – but they appear to be flanking the mass of red sparklers.  I didn’t realize this until watching the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my video, you can hear the traffic from I-495, which is nearby. There is no sound to the crafts that I could discern live, or in my video. I could not discern a shape to the crafts with my naked eye. To my view, I could only see them as lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions at the time of the event were chilly with a partly cloudy sky. The patchy clouds were semi-transparent, low, feathery type. The clear parts of the sky were clear enough to see stars. I estimate the temperature was about 55-60 degrees. NOAA wind maps indicate winds from the south at 3000’ and from the west at 6000’ this evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called our local police station to ask if anyone had reported some unusual lights, and the trooper replied that they did have a man come in around 10pm to report some unusual lights in the sky.  I also called the Philadelphia Airport to learn if they had any explanation for strange lights this evening, such as an air show, or other events involving flying objects, etc.  They said they would normally be informed of these kinds of events, but they have no such events on their calendar for this evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background: I’m 49 years old and have worked in banking most of my working life. I enjoy the night sky, sometimes with a telescope, but usually with the naked eye. While I have little knowledge of airplanes, I have lived under the landing pattern of the Philadelphia Airport all of my life. I see planes in the night sky all the time – I’ve never seen anything like these lights.<n>
10/12/14 20:05|Wilmington|DE|Light|~10 minutes|Cluster of orange/red pulsating lights vicinity of Philadelphia Airport|11/6/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114560.html|474|ndxe201410| Cluster of orange/red pulsating lights vicinity of Philadelphia Airport<n> <n><n> <n><n> From our back porch, through a clear, unobstructed opening in the trees that faces north northeast I saw a tight cluster of approximately 50 or more (difficult to count) blinking orange to reddish lights. They were in a loose cluster formation traveling east to west, much slower than an airplane and without any sound.  The sky was clear to the north with high, thin clouds coming in from the south.  The lights were below the clouds but appeared very high. There were also lights from a plane traveling north, above the clouds and above the cluster, but from my viewpoint ‘through’ the cluster. The wind was light and the direction the lights were moving seemed to contradict the wind and the cloud movement. I know winds can vary with altitude, and I do not know how high these lights were flying. Having seen a fireball recently, I stopped to consider what I was seeing and realized it was not fireball, fireworks or anything else that I’d ever seen before.  I watched th! em for several seconds, thinking they would quickly vanish, and when they didn’t, I called my wife and asked her to bring the camera.  There is over 5 minutes of video that document most of what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What they looked like to me were electrically generated lights, not flame, pulsing from a very bright orange to a not so bright red and back again. No way was it flame! They pulsed at about 1 second intervals, not in unison. The lights were moving at about the same speed and direction with some slight variation. There seemed to be two types – one type was definitely brighter than the other type.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside to get the phone to call our neighbor but stopped, grabbed my binoculars instead and returned when my wife said the lights were disappearing. The way they were disappearing was just to kind of fade out. No loss in altitude. Each one just fizzling out where it stood, bunches at a time until the only ones that were left were a handful of the brighter ones. As those last ones diminished, a few more of the brighter type drifted into view from the east. The position of our house and a large holly tree prevented us from seeing where they originated, they just drifted into our small field of view and every single one of them vanished within our sight after crossing our small field of view.  A couple at a time, then one at a time, with longer spaces in between, and then they were done. The last one seemed to change direction after crossing the opening in the sky. It seemed to move further away to the north before vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I tried looking at them with my binoculars and it appeared that the orange light was coming from the bottom of the object and the red light was coming from the top. It also appeared that they went a little faster when the red light was glowing, and slower when the orange light was glowing, though that could have been an illusion. I’d like to think this could be explained as being Chinese lanterns or something of the sort, but the intensity of the electric light, their height, the fact that they remained in a such tight formation, and that they vanished so simultaneously, make it difficult to explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve lived my entire 50+ years under the flight path of Philadelphia International Airport. I’ve worked outdoors all my life. I intentionally spend a lot of my leisure time looking at the sky, day and night, and enjoying the variety of light displays, natural and manmade.  This is a very urban area and it’s not uncommon to see distant fireworks or balloons from a party. What I saw on this date was something I’ve never seen before – and I’m just amazed.<n>

It was quite high up.  I had seen it from maybe 2 plus minutes then the red glow faded from a round shape, to a triangle shape, with 3 sections like looking at an airplane prop.  To a dull orange then went out.  If I had to draw a comparison the light looked like a flare, a highway flare glow.  Maybe it was a balloon with a flare attached, of a parachute flare but I never seen one this high in the sky as I am familiar with flares.  Witnessed by my friend in the truck.  I know aircraft, I know meteors, this was something odd.  No time to take a photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date.

If the airliners were moving at about 400 knots, then this &#34;Bright Light object&#34; must have been doing 1000-2000 knots to be able to dart ahead and behind and all around.  I did not see it the whole time of the event as it kept &#34;winking&#34; in and out of view.  It was extraordinarily bright.  In the few minutes that I saw this happen, the first time &#34;it&#34; winked out and winked back into view as a bright point of light I knew it wasn&#39;t a fighter jet.  Even a fighter with afterburners could not move that fast.  Also about midway through the event this light danced around the airliner, again, even a fighter is not that nimble.  The speed and agility and brightness and very close proximity to the airliner combined are what really caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being the only observer, I&#39;m approx. 40 years old.

I'd never seen one before!|11/6/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114484.html|483|ndxe201410| Three UFO sightings in AZ within a week.  All lights.  I&#39;d never seen one before!<n> <n><n> <n><n> A week ago, I think on Sunday, Oct. 5, I was doing yoga on a wooden platform in my yard in Prescott, AZ, in the mid to late afternoon.  I saw a white pinpoint of light move erratically around the sky.  It was moving so fast that I assumed it was a laser or other natural phenomenon.  I watched it for 1 - 2 minutes while I was in shivanansa pose (on my back) before it disappeared.  I didn’t think much about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday, October 11, my partner and I were at a campground in Cornville, AZ (near Sedona).  We had a good, clear view of the sky and were lying on our backs watching the stars sometime between 7:00 and 9:30.  We both saw what looked like a bright star in the sky (she saw it first), except that it was swinging back and forth by what looked like an inch or two, like an ornament on a tree, like it was tethered there.  Sometimes it would lurch a short ways forwards or backwards, but stayed in essentially the same spot on the sky for the 20 or 15 minutes we looked at it.  My partner thought she saw a faint dark circle outline around it.  I thought it looked more triangular.  The moving light was all we could see for sure.  Several planes tracked through the sky at the same time, but this was definitely not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, October 12, at about 5:00 pm, we were at the mall parking lot in Prescott, AZ and a guy in a Jeep was pointing to the sky out his window.  I looked up (my partner was driving), and I saw a light than seemed large and fairly close.  I thought it was a plane at first, but then (within 30 seconds) it quickly faded into the distance and disappeared, faster than any plane I’d seen.<n>

I witnessed a small object with lights all around it hovering over my neighborhood. Initially I thought it was a plane, however the aircraft was moving too slowly to be an airplane.  I then noticed the object coming closer to the ground.  I immediately became frightened because I was the only one outside in my neighborhood because how late it was. I went inside the house and heard the dog barking across the street and it would not stop barking.  I then got scared that maybe the object saw me so I turned off my lights in my room and went under the blanket.  Thirty minutes later I was touched one time and became dizzy and saw lights shining in my eyes through my blanket.  I believe the extraterrestrial is invisible to the human eye but not invisible in general. I was so scared I didnt move hoping it would leave.  I then went into a sleep still feeling dizzy.  I believe the ext! raterrestrial was touching me making me feel dizzy in hopes I would forget however when I woke up I still remembered everything that happened. Unfortunately the extraterrestrial has been coming every night for the last few nights doing the same activity.  Shining a light in my eyes, touched me one time and shocked me, and making me dizzy. I am not sure what the extraterrestrial wants or why.  I believe it wants me to forget the situation however it frightens me so much its impossible to forget.  On the last encounter the extraterrestrial dropped something in my ear.  I am reporting this to every internet site or agency I can in hopes the extraterrestrial(s) leave me and my family alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

West sky from West Valley area of Phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to iphone compass 250 degrees &#34;west&#34; saw 1 orange light roughly 3-4x the size of a typical star in the sky.  Starting moving up, called my son out.  He saw. It flickered while moving up then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Went out 5 mins later, another one in the same spot showed up didn&#39;t move up but flickered and disappeared.  We both witnessed this and couldn&#39;t get a good picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Went out again 10 mins later my son and daughter both had their phones trying to get good pictures.  Couldn&#39;t.  Two orange lights showed up.  The top one fizzled out and a third one showed up below it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tried videos but an iPhone isnt very good in the dark.  Both the remaining lights fizzled out.  I didn&#39;t see any blue or red flashing lights to be an aircraft.  And &#34;although close to Luke AFB&#34; I&#39;ve seen aircraft flares from my time in the service.  They weren&#39;t that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly just don&#39;t know.  All I know is they were orange.  Larger than a star.  Moved.  And they were in the same spot when the &#34;new&#34; one came back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s been 25 minutes and I keep checking back but haven&#39;t seen them since.<n>

Stopped at the front of a red light with no cars behind us we were both quiet not saying anything.  Then all of the sudden a bright white light appeared at the top of the atmosphere and seemed to plummet very fast towards earth, leaving a light trail for the split second that the light was visible.  We only seen the light trail for a very short distance as the light appeared from nothing then trailed very fast downwards for a half a second before disappearing from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Judging from the distance we were from the light the light seemed like it was fairly large lit up area.  The skys were clear with some stars visible. I commented something along the lines of &#34;what the heck!?  did you see that?&#34;  and my wife just as shocked as me agreed that she had seen the light as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My assumptions would be that it was a meteorite, but it could of been anything.<n>

When I looked up above my house and saw very bright reddish almost fire light.  Object was moving straight in my direction, coming from downtown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw another, and another.  In about 10 seconds, there was a straight line of 6 of these &#34;lights.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled and pointed, &#34;What is that&#34;?  My 3 family members all saw the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were equidistant away from each other moving at a steady pace right overhead, about the height of a plane coming in for a landing, but kept their pattern true.  The objects slowly &#34;faded out&#34; at about the same spot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute or two later, 5 or 6 more &#34;fiery objects&#34; came moving in, almost same straight pattern, but slightly askew.  There was no noise from these objects.  They just kept there course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time I watched very closely to see when they faded out and noticed when the light faded, a black silhouette in the shape of a triangle seemed to ascend out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, 2 more appeared and quickly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t know what to think.<n>

The light looked like a star then periodically would flash a very bright light in an irregular timing pattern however the flash looked the same each time.  The flash flashed a beam of light simultaneously from the top and bottom of the object for 1 second, nothing form either side though.  After the flash was gone, you could see the fixed star looking object in the middle as if it were the point of origin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This behavior continued for about 30 minutes.  The last few flashes became dimmer and dimmer until it was completely gone.<n>

He happened to look up in the sky and he saw something that was flashing red and white and occasionally green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He watched it for at least 10 minutes and it never moved.  He called me out to look at it and I saw the same thing.  I called our son out to look at it and he saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband then got our binoculars and he and our son went outside and tried to get a better look.  That is when they saw another thing in the sky, that looked just like the first.  Altogether they were outside about 45 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time did either sets of lights move.  There are no towers of any kind in those areas. We thought that it might have been the ISS, but we have seen it in the sky and it moves.  We thought it might have been 2 stars, but we have never seen stars flash red, white and green.  You could actually see them flashing different colors.  We were unable to tell what shape they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We honestly have never seen anything like that before.  Both lights are not in the sky tonight (10/12/14).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband has seen a UFO when he was younger.  My son and I have never seen one before.<n>

The planes had strobes on them like every other plane in the sky. I said to my husband please tell me you see that weird light coming from the Pacific area above or near Lummi Nation?  He said yeah, I do.  So this blue-ish light from a distant seem to have jumped or slipped I don’t know what to call it but it instantaneously appeared near the planes and the plane lights disappeared (confused) the light made a left turn as it was comi! ng from the pacific area and went toward Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was hard to determine the altitude since they were so large but they appeared to be moving laterally at the same altitude and not climbing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they were helicopters but then I realized there was no sound associated with these objects.  I walked into the yard to get a closer look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before the second light/object was directly overhead it began to get dimmer and dimmer until it could no longer be seen.

My wife, walking the dog in our yard, noticed a string of uniformly spaced red lights at altitude (as one would expect a Life Flight helicopter to be) spanning at least 40 angular degrees. She called me to the yard, and I also observed them. I observed (at times using binoculars) that they appeared to be rising, in a spaced fashion, one after another, from a single point in the southeast and heading to the southwest. We estimated they were rising in the vicinity of the airport. One plane observed was perceived by us to be lingering in the area, but the plane, a commercial airliner or cargo plane, subsequently flew over our house, so the perception of lingering must have been due to a great initial distance and we observed it flying into the area. Towards the end of the event, we perceived helicopters to be flying in the area of the airport near the point we witnessed the lights ascending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were red, similar to radio tower lighting. The light to the southwest most point merely extinguished, and being distracted, but not seeing the others, they too apparently went out. My initial assessment is that they were some man made thing, such as &#34;Sky Lanterns&#34; lifted by balloon or the heat rising from a candle, but problems exist with this theory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. They were launched near the County Airport, which I would suppose to be forbidden for a legal launch, as interference to or confusion of air traffic may ensue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. To suppose that they were equipped with electrical power for lighting or being equipped with a candle should have provided the most recently launched light with the ability to travel from the southeast launch point to the southwest extinguish point before itself extinguishing, this clearly did not happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned to the house and alternately listened to a scanning radio for the police frequencies in my area of Pittsburgh and to Aircraft Frequencies collectively. Nothing was heard to indicate that any others had called to report this incident, nor were pilots, in their very brief communications, mentioning it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I subsequently noted an establishment across the street from the County Airport as having a Grand Opening sign, but I&#39;m not sure how old the sign is. I drove past the County Airport travelling to work, on following days, but did not notice anything to account for the lights. We perused the media for a hint of a man made cause, but found none. We found this reporting page as a result.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am on the west side of town, and I was looking south, between Pikes Peak, and NORAD.  As I watched, the white light started going up, and getting brighter.  At this time, I asked to my wife to get my camera.  When I looked back, I now saw two white orbs, with one of them looking to be a lot higher in the sky than the other one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife came outside with the camera within a minute or two, and I started filming.  I lost track of one of the objects, and for some reason, I was having trouble keeping track of the other object.  After about one minute, I lost the object, and turned off the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:30 p.m., I saw a red light rising slowly from a cloud, in the same area that I saw the white light, and white orbs, earlier.  I called my wife outside, and I lost sight of the object, while I was trying to show her where it was.  I turned off the camera, quickly spotted the object, and started filming again.  As we watched, it seemed to change color.  I got less than 30 seconds of video, that time, before I lost sight of the object again, and could not find it again.<n>

It was 10:25 pm. I went to my bedroom window. It was a full moon and I could clearly see a huge, hexagonal shape moving from east to west almost directly above my house!  It had no lights whatsoever, but was clearly visible in the moonlight.  There were darker more complex shapes beneath it, but I only saw it for a second. It did not make a sound.  It was only visible for a second, but I could see it clearly before it moved beyond my line of sight past my house.  It completely freaked me out.  It was so close, I would guess no more than 500 feet.  I&#39;m still not sure I believe it, but I&#39;ve never sleep walked or hallucinated in my life.  I&#39;m not even a believer, or at least I wasn&#39;t.<n>

I used the term fireball but it could have been a mass of lights, orange/red in color appearing at a distance as a fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to take a pic but it was too far away.  It wasn&#39;t a Chinese lantern, but based on the distance and how big it still appeared, it had to have been huge.

Tamalpais from 7:40 until 8:30 P.M.  When I reached the top of this hill, I witnessed several bright yellow gold objects-the color of &#34;fire burning in your fireplace hovering&#34; above one of the hillsides to the southeast lighting up super bright then dimming down changing in shape and size looking somewhat triangular or diamond shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ten minutes later, at 7:50 P.M., in as long as it takes to count from 1 to 18 I counted 18 lights-objects literally swarming through this entire area.  This is the most objects I&#39;ve ever seen all at once and they were hovering at treetop level, hovering above nearby hills, suspended over the S.F. Bay off in the distance, crisscrossing each others&#39; paths, and nearly colliding into each other and hovering and approaching other objects to make triangular and rectangular formations in the sky etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t think you can blame the Blue Angels for this because not one of these objects was making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a couple of minutes it looked like a total invasion until it thinned out a bit. I was wondering what would happen if an actual plane came through the area when all of a sudden at about 8:05 P.M. a plane came through from the northwest heading right through all this activity.  The plane was flying about twice as high up as all these other objects and flew over a cluster of about 6 to 8 of these lights and 3 of these lights were forming a triangular shape above one of these hills near the water between San Quentin and Corte Madera area.  I had binoculars and you could see the whole plane and hear it.  In the 50 minutes of continuous sightings of these other silent objects I could not identify any specific shape except somewhat disc or oblong teardrop shape maybe diamond or triangular.  I did see a couple of strobing red disc like objects but 90 percent of these objects look the same -bright yellowish gold orangish lights.<n>

All of a sudden, a craft appeared in sight from the right side of the road.  It was in slow descent.  It did not appear to be a conventional aircraft in terms of it flight characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached closer it wad noted to triangular in shape.  There were three lights on each point of the triangle that were white in color.  The center of the craft had a red light that flashed occasionally but without purpose.  I could see the surface of the craft as well and it appeared dark and possibly reflective.  The craft as it descended crossed the road and I made a uturn in my car to try to get a picture.  It was then noted to be hovering at treetop level (for about 10 seconds ) and was silent.  I estimate the craft to be around the size of 3 sedan sized cars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I had made my uturn and parked, the craft then started moving again and crossed the highway once more and all of a sudden disappeared.  It did not descend or ascend, it just went out of sight completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw the craft I thought it was plane due to a blinking light in the center, then noted it could be a helicopter as the light pattern didn&#39;t look typical.  Then noted it couldn&#39;t be a helicopter due to the fact it was traveling so smoothly.<n>

They seemed to be very high and I think they went out of view due to the height they reached rather than going behind clouds as their light burned through the cloud cover, or having burned up in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I brought my wife out to see them, and I recorded them.<n>

It was not a Chinese lantern, typical aircraft, star, or shooting star/meteor.  The only logical explanation seems to be some kind of unusual craft, either from this world or another (and I find the latter to fall into the category of “what’s left after excluding what you know it is not, no matter how extraordinary, must be true”.....though I still find it difficult to consider this possibility).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was camping in the Finger Lakes Region of New York.  While looking east about an hour after sunset, I saw a large bright orange light moving at approximately the same speed as a satellite that one can see by the sun’s reflection as it passes overhead.  The orange light was moving from NE to SW and was inclined at about a 45 degree angle from ground.  There was no sound coming from the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for about a minute as it moved through a clearing in the trees.  I thought perhaps it was a satellite, but it was much brighter and a different color than other satellites I have seen, and at one point it appeared to slow down and its course appeared to shift slightly and briefly before resuming its previous speed and course.  I thought it was possibly a plane, but there were no navigation lights or beacons.  When I saw the speed/course change, I thought possibly it was a helicopter with a search light, though not sure why it would be orange, and it did not seem low enough or bright enough for searching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light appeared to glow like a star or planet. There were no shimmering or fireball effects, and no tail as from something falling through the atmosphere. The brightness was constant. Again, no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 to 15 minutes later, I retrieved my 10x50 binoculars to do some star gazing when I saw a second orange light that appeared in the same location and on the same course as the first light. When I looked at it through my binoculars, I saw that the orange light was actually three orange lights clustered in a tight triangular formation. (This triangular formation was not visible without the binoculars.) These three lights appeared to just be glowing; no shimmering or fireball effects. It made me think of the glow of rocket engines when you are too far away to see the flames (or the engine glow of spaceship engines in countless sci-fi movies/shows).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the second light for about a minute as it also moved through a clearing in the trees. The second light did not appear to change course, speed or brightness.  I started to ask my friend if he saw the lights when he asked me the same thing.  He also has an engineering background and is very logical and not prone to wild assumptions.  Unfortunately there was not enough time for him to view them through the binoculars, so only I saw that the second light was not just a single light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been periodically checking on-line for the past few days for other reports of sightings or news of these lights.  The only thing that I have found that is similar is a UFO report in MA (orange light traveling NE to SW).  This other sighting date/time/description seems right to possibly be the same lights I saw assuming they transited over both MA and NY.<n>

The house is directly on the ocean front.  Suddenly I saw flashing lights in the sky over the ocean.  There was a group of 3 sets of lights, traveling together going South.  The lights were white, and each group looked like sparklers almost because all of the lights were quickly flashing on and off, and not in unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a little bit stunned, because I didn&#39;t know what it was.  The whole thing didn&#39;t last long, maybe 10 seconds, and then disappeared.  I can&#39;t tell you how high they were or how far away they were.  But I would say 20 degrees if straight up is 90.  It was a fairly clear week except for spotty clouds and I had a very good view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and told someone else about it.  The next day he told me that he had seen something about it on the news and that the Army had said that they were doing some maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This past week I read an article on the internet by David Wilcock.  He mentioned some secret spacecraft that he has heard about from whistleblowers.  (see attached below).

They were stationary and disappeared as suddenly as they appeared.  Right before seeing them I thought I saw several smaller white lights blinking off and on for a few seconds.  I am a retired RN and have never believed in UFO sightings prior to this experience.  As I got up to get my husband, they disappeared.  I opened the balcony door and said, &#34;I just saw four UFOs.&#34;  I then came online to see if I was crazy and found all these reports of similar objects and decided I needed to report what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I began to look at the sky during this time but did not see anything.  It was a bit cloudy and I thought perhaps I would indeed have to wait for another time.  I have never witnessed seeing it, and I continued to look at the sky in hopes I did not miss it, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 9:00 p.m. my friend and I were walking to her car from our homes.  I again looked up, and there in the sky we both saw a triangle shaped flying object with flashing red lights that alternated with turquoise blue when it slowed down or changed speed.  At one point it for a moment hovered a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We realized then, it was perhaps a UFO.  The pattern it flew was like it was “mapping” the sky.  I mean, it did not fly straight and then away.  It would come back from the North and then South again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend ran into her home. I continued to watch it from my window.  Perhaps 30 minutes or so later, after it disappeared, a large airplane or craft of our own flew close to where we had seen the other object.<n>

There was a jet that traveled completely across the sky near the object.  The jet moved from horizon to horizon while the object stayed stationary in the sky.  The light size and intensity was very much like the jets.  The lights also flashed at about the same interval as the jet.  The sighting lasted about 5 minutes.  It was in the eastern sky as the moon was coming over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I come close to finish my shift I walked into the jury room to clean as schedule.  The room is in the sixth floor the last floor in the building and it has the biggest windows and it faces the CT River with an amazing view.  I’m usually contemplating the view out these windows whether is night or day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well as I enter the room I right away see the full moon Big and bright, shade in the water and a planet or big bright star next to it (so I thought) just stunning and beautiful.  I wanted to take a picture but for some reason I thought to get my co-worker because she has a bigger and updated phone and it could take got pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well before I decide to go get her I was staring at both the moon and what I thought it was a big bright planet or star beside it.  I started to notice a small light getting closer and closer to it and maybe even going in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I right away ran to get my co-worker exited and at the same time a! little weird out about it that I forgot to take a shot with my phone just in case.  Eight minutes went by and I couldn’t find my co-worker anywhere so I returned to the sixth floor to the same window view and I couldn’t believe it……it wasn’t there anymore!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I regret not taking a picture I was so mad.  But I took a picture of the view anyways.  I should of took that shot it was as bright as a planet or star next to the full moon.  I wonder if anybody else reported seeing something similar tonight as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well that’s my story I am excited I had two ufo sittings back home in Puerto Rico when I was twelve years of age and experienced a bright light in my home that lasted about an hour and then went away.  I believe, by experience not because.<n>

After recording the object, I went inside to upload the video on my computer.  When I started to watch the video in 1080p HD, you can see another smaller orb power up and leave the first larger orb.  Clearer this shocked me because, I don&#39;t know of any craft that can do something like that.  I am an amateur when it comes to recording so excuse the shakiness.

We have a high end HD surveillance system and a monitor next to our bed.  We both got up and were watching the monitor and talking about what just happened when about 4-5 minutes went by and a bright light pulsed again and lit up the screen.  My wife and i were freaked out by it since our house backs up to trees. I grabbed a flash light and went outside and i started shining my flash light on the video camera to see what it looked like versus what we saw. It wasnt even close!  The angles were different as well since i was on the ground and the light that flashed on our screen was from an angle higher than our house.  We played back the event about a dozen times and saw a bright light (round) in the top part of the screen.  What is even more intere! sting is that you can see the back yard light up just before it comes into the screen (both times).  It was also bright enough to look like a repeated flash on the screen (very bright)...it looked like it moved very fast but seemed to go in a circular motion (quickly)..at first i thought someone might have shined a flashlight on the video camera but i ruled that out by testing that theory...my flashlight is very bright and could not duplicate the intesity, pulsing, motion or brightness...weird :-)<n>

It looked very similar to previous sightings of the ISS but the object was getting darker as it approached the West horizon (should be the other way around...brighter going towards the sun).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was no longer visible once it was too far to the West.<n>

Airport is very near sighting.  There appeared to be one light from a second object following behind though low clouds may have obscured other lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought a light then two then the third were stars but then noticed they were moving and not quite white like the other stars.  Then I thought it was a plane but first the plane was too high to be landing and it was a strange flight pattern coming directly west from the Atlantic ocean.  Then I noticed the lights jumping directly up and down a number of times.  I followed the lights over too long a distance for it to be a searchlight and the lights were distinct like distant stars or maybe aircraft lights.  It seemed strange and especially with the single light from another craft following close behind at the same low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions were not ideal because of the low clouds over the horizon.  The lights appeared visible to me intermittently through the clouds.  Don&#39;t know if they were satellites or even how far away they were but I was not looking high in the sky at all.  Wasn&#39;t super alarming but strange and no obvious explanation.  No one was nearby on the beach at night and no one with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was around 9:30pm when my friends frantically called me outside. (I am a lover of all things UFO, so they couldn’t believe they were seeing it and I was missing it.)  They saw 6 diamond shaped shadows with bright red-orange lights in the center. They lit up one after the other, all in a row, and each light lasted 5 seconds before fading out, one after the other.  They started almost directly in front of our condo 1-3 miles out from the shore and much higher in the sky than the advertisement planes that fly over in the daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That first time two of my friends both got to see them through the binoculars and saw that the light in the middle seemed to change like an LED light- red, orange, green, yellow.  As the lights were going out, my boyfriend called me out, and I just barely missed it.  They said the diamonds appeared to be close enough they were touching and as soon as the light faded they disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were discussing it- they were all very solemn, I was more excited/upset I missed it- and a little less than 10 minutes later it happened again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It gave us all cold chills. There was something so ominous about it-maybe just because the unknown of it was terrifying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw as 1 red-orange light lit up, a second, a third… there were 6 again, though they appeared to be in a slightly diagonal line from our perspective, but still lined up. I was not able to see the shape of the crafts.  They seemed to be farther and farther apart from one another which each sighting. There was also a group of folks who came from our condo out on the beach taking pictures. (Unfortunately the only clip we were able to record was as the last two lights were going out.)  After the lights went out and theories started circulating between us I told them to watch for military jets- as they are often seen trailing UFOs in many reports. Within 5 minutes a black jet with a blinking white light came soaring over the beach. There were at least 5 or 6 jets flying- circling over the beaches and out in the spots where we had seen the lights. This gave us some perspective on the size of these crafts, which  were very easy to see even that far out, whereas we had to strain to try and count the blinking lights from the jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had given up seeing anymore, though we remained on the balcony, shaken, and maybe 15-20 minutes had passed, the jets had all vanished, and we saw them again, even further down the beach (toward Myrtle Beach, from North Myrtle Beach). This time I only remember seeing 5. Each time we saw them they lit up one at a time and disappeared 1 at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened a few more times- At least 6, but maybe 7.  Though, by the last time or two there were only two red lights visible. There were about 10-15 minutes between sightings- more if the jets were circling. It seemed that intermittently between sightings there were more jets scrambling around. Its as if these crafts disappeared as the lights faded. Over all the event lasted about an hour and a half.  There were 4 of us outside after the first sighting (for which there were three) and my boyfriends mother saw it happen one time, making 5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried our best debunking different possibilities. It wasn’t fireworks as it didn’t move. Mother tried to pass it of as kites or flares, but there was no smoke, no movement, just blinking lights of different colors.  And the three of them saw diamond shapes with their naked eyes. It certainly was unlike anything we had ever seen before and from my search, seems it is definitely NOT the first time something like this has been seen over Myrtle Beach.<n>

They also said that the lights went from ORANGE to WHITE then disappeared.  This must have occurred on our quick walk to the balcony  Another gentleman (AIRCRAFT MECHANIC) claims he saw them moving around, and then they became stationary, which is how they appeared to me, i.e. stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Distance from shore:  it seemed close, maybe less than a mile…but I cannot be sure  Size:  again, I really cannot be sure.

There were no clouds in the sky, stars were out (but very faint, probably due to the brightness of the moon).  We were sitting at the Folly Beach Pier looking toward the moon which was in the Northeast.  To the west of the moon toward the opening of the Charleston Harbor, I saw three orange/yellowish “fireballs” in a triangular formation (one on the left, one on the right and one on the top).  I pointed it out to my wife and she noticed it as well then the images disappeared.  The first to disappear was the eastern most light, followed by the western most then the top one.  The entire sighting lasted for about 2-3 seconds, just long enough to spot it, point it out and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought right away that maybe it was fireworks, but we saw no signs of a trail or evidence of the lights fizzling out like a falling light would.  We then thought it may have been a plane, but the lights were too far spaced out.  We sat there for a few minutes discussing what we saw and decided to record what we saw on our voice recorder on our phone.  We continued to monitor the sky around us, but did not see it again or anything that resembled what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We finally went along the pier and asked a couple people (fishermen and families walking the pier) if they saw it and nobody else witnessed what we saw.  Someone joked that they must not have been drinking what we did, but we had only had water and sweet tea earlier in the evening; no drugs, alcohol or medicine that would have been a factor.<n>

It did not flash like an airplane.  It was very high in the sky so I could not see the shape but it seemed to be more circular due to way the lights were going.  It did not seem to be flying either.  It was more like soaring ..  I&#39;ve been around long enough to know what planes look like and how the fly and this was NOT no plane or helicopter or anything.  I was driving so I had trouble keeping an eye on it but I was trying to watch it as long as possible.  I kept an eye on it about every 10 seconds and the last time I looked was completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Distances is hard to estimate, but if I were to guess, I would have use my thumb to equate about an inch of separation between each.

I study them for as long as I could, and then decided I had to stop trying to figure out what they were because I was driving and having to divert my attention to the right of my vehicle and off the road to watch. I considered pulling over, but then justified to myself, that these must be some sort of collections of lanterns or something  being lit and let go into the air by the college or something (though realistically I think they were to high for that).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly have no idea what I saw, they were slow moving little balls of light, almost hovering and had a glow that did not appear to really match conventional aircraft wing,nose,tail lighting, just a single glow which seemed to hover and move slowly in a type of formation, but ever so slightly in varied directions (again why I thought perhaps lanterns of some sort. For the first time in my life I did have a bit of fear about it, but again having a father that did flight test, I quickly began to rationalize what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been trying to figure it out now by looking online for some celebration that may have occurred or something, but I truly have no concrete answer. They eventually just sort of dissipated (again why I thought perhaps lanterns) yet justifiably they were really high and it was just the oddest feeling...I just don&#39;t know (seen while driving towards Whitewater on  HWY 59 about a few miles outside of town watched until I was almost to the first set of buildings)  Any explanation, or thoughts are appreciated.<n>

10/8/14 18:30|Waterbury|CT|||Fireballs.|10/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114359.html|597|ndxe201410| Last night October 8 at approximately 6:30pm I was watching the sunset as I sometimes do. I live in northern Waterbury atop the highest mountain with a beautiful view of the mountains and also surrounding towns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking out the window, I saw a large orange glowing object that almost resembled a lightning sphere, but without the jagged edges.  I&#39;ve lived here for 13 years and have never seen anything in that area that would be light play or a reflection of any type.  I called my 9 yr old son over to the window to see it.  As we were looking at it 3 distinct objects started descending from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, they looked like giant orange fireballs but we were able to clearly see that they were actually a orange glowing trail behind 3 solid objects that were quickly descending down towards the ground.  You know when you see a plane fly by and it leaves the trail in the clouds behind it?   Well, thats what these looked like.  I could clearly see at the beginning of the orange flame like trails, 3 solid masses.  They appeared to be black or dark grey in color.  They were descending from above the unmoving large glowing orange object that we first saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would imagine a meteorite or anything else crashing into our atmosphere would look similar to what I saw.  I was immediately scared and actually called the Waterbury Police to make a report and spoke to the officer who responded and came to my home.  Whatever they were they each left a trail of what looked like fire behind them.  Within 10 minutes there were helicopters that proceeded to cover the general area where I saw the strange lights.  It would have been over the Naugatuck/Waterbury line near the I-84 interchange with Rte 8.  I heard and also saw at least 2 army blackhawk helicopters that seemed to be working together that scanned that area and all the way into Thomaston or atleast thats as far as I could see from my view.  They had extremely bright lights on though not the entire time as though looking for something.  At one point I could see at least 4 helicopters (some not loud like the army ones) covering the general area at the same altitude they were originally vis! ible from and then lower to the ground.  They did this up until close to 12:30 in the morning. There is no way they would waste that much money on fuel and man power on a phone call from one citizen.  Clearly something came down that shouldn&#39;t have.  I have noticed strange lights and irregular movement in this area before but nothing at all like what I witnessed last night.  I&#39;m actually still scared about what I saw and would feel better if anyone else saw what I saw or has any information on what it was.  I wish I could just shake off the feeling that whatever came down last night wasn&#39;t good.<n>

Tonight we saw an orange light coming quickly from east to west. As it got closer it shifted into three lights. It appeared to be 200-300 feet long and maybe 100 feet wide.  It made some sound but was not loud like a jet. It looked similar to jets flying in formation but when it was directly overhead we could see it was solid and blocked out stars as it passed in front of them.  It was maybe half the altitude that the planes fly above our home.  When it was roughly 1/2 mile past us it made a 90 degree turn and went northeast quickly.  My 14 year old son also saw it. His take was it looked like a star destroyer from Star Wars.  The two light in the rear were rectangular and were taller than they were wide.  The light on the front was thin and horizontal.  This all happened with a very bright full moon so we could easily see the shape.  Needless to say we are all freaked a little.  We got on google to see if anyone else saw anything and found this site.<n>

I took my attention off the lunar eclipse.  I started looking at the stars at 5:55AM for a moment.  I notice 2 identical stars looking like they were both moving as small thin clouds were moving past them both.  The stars were both on the other side of the sky far away from the lunar eclipse.  The clouds were moving past in front of them at a medium speed.  They both suddenly diminished as the clouds finally past by in front of them both.  All the other stars were still there till I went inside at 6:17AM. I noticed them both there for 25 seconds and they could of have been there for a longer time then the time I noticed them both there.  The sky was clear to the left of the diminishing stars as if those were the last clouds to pass. They were not stars.  They actually may both weren&#39;t moving and the clouds moving made it look like they were.  They were trying to pretend like stars and were UFO&#39;s that looked exactly like 2 stars.  I will never forget this happened. There was a helicopter around the area at the time and was flying around maybe because of a car accident in Crestwood next to Oak Lawn.  I don&#39;t trust stars after this happened.   They diminished after I noticed them and know they probably knew to leave before I took a picture or filmed with my windows cellphone. They were intelligent to disappear like that.  I am not surprised that this happened.  I use to things like this happening.  They made no sound.  All I could hear was a helicopter in the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The night of the lunar eclipse I couldn’t sleep so I went out side for a walk.  I wanted to see the eclipse, and it was a perfectly clear sky.  I sat in a chair on front lawn and watched and took pictures. I could see the planes going into Austin airport, very specific flight patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a large disc form come from above left of the moon.  It came down and then around to the right of the moon, seemed to stay to the right for a moment or two and then took off at an angle to the left and up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it paused near the right side of the moon it looked to be about 20% the size of the moon itself.  This was as the moon was finishing the eclipse at 5:55 AM, I put my camera on long exposure, but I shook a bit for that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been given what this was through communication with them, immediately upon looking at my camera that night/morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background:  I AM in communication with various ET’s.  I have been most of my life, but never made this public before.  My parents, husband, daughter and extremely close friends know of this and have been present various times when this has happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen several ships in my lifetime.  Some recent dramatic sightings:  3 years ago at Enchanted Rock, TX, when we made it to the top and were resting,  I lay down on the summit and they (several) appeared for me.  It was late afternoon.  My husband was there and saw them as well.  There were no others around on the summit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 yrs ago in Galveston, I was sitting at poolside I was speaking on my cell to my friend back east, 2 AM, and a golden-brownish color ship flew over.  It was very low, just above the buildings.  I projected my thought to it … “wait” and it stopped, hovered, so I could get a good look at it, and then it flew on out over the ocean.  The friend I was speaking to also has communicated with ET’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 years ago and last year I was interacting with some Beings from the inner Earth.  There were 12, and they followed me when we went into the caves outside Austin.  I have pictures of that communication underground.  They came back above ground when I was outside one night at my daughter’s house, very interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attended and assisted for the entire week, the Paradigm Research Group at the Citizens Hearing on Disclosure, April/May 2013 at the National Press Club in DC.  I fully believe in the fact there are benevolent ET’s close around Earth and in our immediate Solar System.<n>

It came out bright white changed to red &amp; yellow with 5 visible lights always staying parellel to the moon.  In some of the pics you can actually see a gray metallic saucer shape with the 5 white lights. Definitely is a U.F.O., and i am glad we witnessed it and videoed it.<n>

I thought it was strange, so since I had my binoculars (eclipse) I put them to my eyes and what I saw was like nothing else.  I first noticed there were now three lights, in between and in the back of a cigar shaped object. It was moving fast and quiet.  That lasted only two seconds, then it was gone.

I even tried a few exercises of placing a firmly planted piece of wood to block the image out and eliminate the possibility of the movement being an illusion/autokinesis - only to have it emerge on one side or the other several times.

I am 33 years old, and have never seen a UFO before until 2010.  I am a mother of two children (10 and 8 years old) and do not use drugs or alcohol.  I am a stay at home mom who homeschools.  Along with myself, my husband and two children have been co-witnesses to the sightings.  One of my neighbors was also present during one of the sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In October 2010, I moved to Goldendale, Washington.  We had just bought our 5 acre property and were living in a fifth wheel while developing the property for a home.  Our property is 15 miles outside of town and is in the woods.  We had a small campfire and it was about 8pm at night.  My husband and I were standing outside around the campfire and the children were there as well.  It was a clear and cold October night sky.  My husband and I looked up, and right above the 70ft pine trees about 100 yards away, appeared a bright yellow light about the size of a washing machine and round in shape.  It was noiseless and moving towards us fairly slowly.  As it got above the trees that were right around us, it shot up straight into the sky as fast as you could blink and disappeared.  There was no noise.  We both saw this and the encounter lasted about 10-15 seconds.  My children did not see this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting was in the winter of 2012/2013.  I got up in the middle of the night and went into my living room and looked out my windows.  Across the road, was a ploughed wheat field about 80 acres in size with pine trees flanking the sides and back of the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed another yellow orb hovering above the trees in the back of the wheat field.  It hovered for several minutes, and then it shot up in the air and disappeared.  I did not know if there was noise, as I was inside.  The orb was the size of a basketball from where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day my neighbor, who lives about 15 acres down the road from me, came over and asked if I had seen the orb the night before at the back of the wheat field.  I verified that I had, and his description was the same as mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third sighting was the same time, winter of 2012/2013 and I was driving home from town with my two children. It was about 9pm.  To the north of town, there is a small mountain range called the Simcoe Mountains.  The children and I saw a huge neon green fireball shoot across the top of the mountain range and disappear.  The light was very bright and noticeable and lasted about 3 seconds.  It started out bright green, then turned a brilliant orange.  I do not know if anyone else from town saw this, but there were at this time, several places around the world on the news reporting fireballs in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of 2013, my children were playing outside in the middle of the afternoon. They came bursting inside the house and said they saw a UFO and wanted me to come and look.  I went outside, and to my amazement, there was a metal, cigar or blimp shaped craft hovering above the woods.  It was not directly above us, but aways off and hovering about as high as a low flying helicopter.  It looked about the size of a washing machine from where we were but cigar or blimp shaped.  The sighting lasted 10 minutes and it just dissolved away before our very eyes.  It made no noise, and it hovered in place the whole time.  The children and I saw this same craft about 3 more times this summer.  At the last sighting, my neighbor was over talking with me in my backyard. The children who saw it first, pointed it out to us in the sky.  We all stood and watched it for about 10 minutes and it too dissolved and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The recent sightings were June of 2014.  The weather was warm and the children and I decided to camp outside on our trampoline for the night in our backyard.  There were clear skies that night. The stars were brilliant as we lay on the trampoline. The children and I witnessed about 100, what appeared to be &#39;stars,&#39; moving about the skies.  They moved sporadically and they would get brighter and then appear to burn out and disappear after moving around the skies for several seconds.  There was one after another.  They would appear and carry on in the same fashion.  We called them &#39;bobbles&#39;.  This went on about an hour and a half, in which we then decided to sleep in the house instead.  This was the week before the war in Israel started with Hamas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> October 2014, on the night of the blood moon, I decided to stay up all night to see the moon eclipse.  At 3:30am, at the height of the eclipse, I woke my family up to come outside and see it.  My daughter and I walked out our back door first onto our back deck with my son and husband following behind.  As soon as my daughter and I reached the edge of the deck, we turned back towards our house to look at the moon which was above the house. At the ridgeline of the roof, a bright, white light appeared and flew along the entire roofline of the home.  It was an orb, very bright, brilliant white, and kind of had an appearance of a &#39;sparkler.&#39;  The kind I used to play with on the fourth of July as a kid.  It was not more than a foot above the roof, and was about the size of a cantalope.  It lasted 3 seconds and my daughter and I gasped in amazement having both seen it.  My husband and son had not looked up in time, having therefore missed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We marveled at the moon and described the orb we saw for several minutes, and at that point, my husband went back inside.

I went outside, saw nothing unusual but after about 5 min., heard sirens for several minutes.  I stood on the porch with my grandaughter for a few minutes more then returned to my bedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 23:40 our electricity turned off again with no flickering or warning.  We went outside again and neighbors from two other houses were also outside.  I called the local police department to ask about the electricity situation and they explained that there had been a large accident on Taylor Street that had taken out several telephone poles and electric lines and that Oncor was working to fix it.  I wondered why we had not heard anything with Taylor Street being four blocks away but did not think much else about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The neighbors and I were in the middle of the street talking and I told them that it would be back on once Oncor fixed the poles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The neighbors from one house went back inside.  The neighbors from the corner and I stayed outside talking.  I told them I could see better outside than in my house because the moon is so bright tonight.  She looked up and said, &#34;Oh my God!!  It stopped in the air&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked behind me, to the North and saw what at first I thought might be a plane, but very low and it was just stopped in mid air.  It started to move slowly and made no noise.  It appeared to be either triangular shaped or at least the lights were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 3 lights in a triangular pattern.  One was white, one was red and the other flashed from blue to green.  It flew over us and to the South going very slow and never made a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it passed over all the electricity came back on.  We all just stared.  Her husband said &#34;I think it is a plane&#34;.  She said, it made no noise and was a triangle and just stopped in the air!, planes don&#39;t do that&#34;. I said I saw it stopped also.  And we just all went in the house.<n>

I was outside on the front porch with my mother for a cigarette.  She pointed toward the sky behind me, suddenly very animated.  I turned around, still sitting, and saw what looked like huge glowing orange lights in a perfect V formation moving in sync over the trees across the street.  It was silently heading our way in a cluster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We hurried to get a closer look and stood watching from the highway.  About three more appeared as if out of nowhere; if anything they were already up and lowered to meet the rest as opposed to floating up or rising.  They were moving together, the first three more in sync though the spaces between them were not perfectly in unison as we continued to watch them head our way.  My mom was panicked and thought they were actually coming to us, since we were the only people out watching (it was a little before 11pm and we are mostly surrounded by shopping cente! rs that were closed.)  They had to be either very big or not that high, though higher than the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first three then began to curve around and turn away, going over the lake and disappearing.  The rest followed suit one by one, becoming more of a line and getting smaller as they travelled away from us.  They all vanished into the sky except for one, which slowly glided away before it was blocked by the top of some buildings or condos over on the further side of the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have heard of orange lights before but until you see it, you don&#39;t understand how far out and perplexing it can be.  My mother kept saying how she felt like it was aware of us and though I do not like to make such quick assumptions, it felt a bit eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had tried taking a picture but they didn&#39;t show on the camera preview on my phone, possibly because of street light glare. I did a search online and am going to keep checking to see if anyone else saw this but so far (its been 30 mins since it happened! ) nothing else has come up for tonight though I&#39;m reading acco! unts fro m five days ago around NY and before that the same description was in Britain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I read &#34;explanations&#34; blaming Chinese Lanterns.  These were not Lanterns.  I&#39;ve seen Lanterns set off in the sky at night, I&#39;ve seen balloons with flames set off at festivals, air balloons, sky divers, flares, this was nothing like that.  They moved with precision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My stomach is still fluttering.  It was like a one time event sighting.  In my mother&#39;s 56 years she has never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My window faces the sky where she first spotted them. I think I&#39;ll be on watch all night...<n>

They were not traveling fast, but erratic.  And once they got behind the tree line, they sped up to where they were out of sight in seconds.  I have a minute video of the event.  And when we I looked up orange UFO sightings on the internet, the images were exactly what I saw.  Weird stuff.  Could they have been droids?  One never knows, but the speed and range, they would of had to be sophisticated.  Also, they made no sounds what so ever.<n>

I called for my wife to ensure I wasn’t just seeing things.  It was about 500 yards away and a few hundred feet off of the ground.  The light sat motionless for almost 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then started to travel straight up at a slow rate of speed.  It then traveled westbound in our direction.  It also began descending as it moved in our direction.  It was moving very slowly and leveled out at about the same height I first observed.  It flew right over head and continued out of sight.  It was a very large almost V shaped craft.  It had a very bright white light on the front of the craft.  On the back was 5 smaller lights.  One on each “wing” tip and then one halfway between the tip and the center ( on each side).  Then there was a light in the center of the “V”.  On the bottom of the craft was three red lights.  The thing that bothered me most was the total lack of noise from this craft.  Had it been a jet of helicopter I would have heard it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still at a total loss as to what this thing could have been.  It was unsettling to say the least.<n>

I turn to the north eastern part of the sky and see this cylinder shaped object moving at a slow speed from north to south.  It&#39;s about the size of a quarter at arms length and pure white in color.  When it got just past halfway middle of the sky it appeared to change shape, like the front half had slowed down and the back end had to catch up and it had a more cigar shape.  Its direction changed to a slow arc toward the sun.  Then in an instant it starts to shape shift probably because the sun was reflecting off of different surfaces, it gave the appearance of rapid movement back and forth and from side to side violently, it would appear in one spot then disappear and instantaneously appear in another spot near to where it previously was then again and again and again maybe 7 or 8 times  looked like it had a different shape each time while continuing in the same direction.  T! hen it shifted 3 or 4 times more only less rapid and growing brighter as it approaches the sun.  It stops at a distance of about a dime held at arms length from the sun and by this time is as bright as the sun like a mirror held up to it, only much smaller.  It stays in that place for about five to six seconds then it appears to back away a little and all of a sudden it&#39;s not glowing any more, it is still close to the sun and should be still glowing but it&#39;s not, it has stopped reflecting any sunlight at all and  become a darker greyish color thin horizontal bar shape, much less visible than when I first saw it but can still be seen.  It held that position briefly, then it punches out, to a dot in the sky then gone.  I was oblivious to time but I think 4 minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I heard a commercial passenger plane flying overhead on approach to PDX.  Which isn&#39;t unusual.  I couldnt sleep that night so I went to my window to take a look.  I watched it until it passed over the trees and out of sight.  Then I started looking at the stars that were visible that night, then I saw three red pinpoints of light, that were arranged in a triangle formation. They did not flicker or twinkle and stayed locked in that rigid triangle formation. Then i noticed that it seemed like one solid object, because it blocked out the stars as it moved from dead south to dead north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds, i thought I heard a low hum as it passed overhead.  I watched the object for what felt like a solid 2-3 minutes, but when I looked at the clock, the time just turned to 1:30 in the morning...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started watching the object at 10:30.

It looked like it fell from the sky - like dropping a ball from your hand to the ground.  This was very much like a meteor sighting but the object was much larger and could be seen clearly (the sky was very clear - no clouds).  The object looked whitish blue in color.  There was a full moon to the southeast that was very clear.  You could see the object clearly but the object itself looked kind of faded or blurred (I am not sure if that was because of the sharpness of the moonlight).  A comet is often very small when you see it.    This object was much larger and was the same size or a little smaller than the full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look up in the sky quite frequently, often times listening to Coast to Coast or other similar shows, but I have never seen an object like this (this large).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting itself was less than a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

While I was on duty this evening I was in the apparatus bay washing the ambulance when I heard a dog barking, which seemed out of place as I have never heard a dog in this particular area before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about that same time, the radio station I was listening to went from clearly audible music to static, the digital radios in the ambulance started to &#34;bonk&#34; no signal, and I felt an eerie presence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped around the front of the ambulance and out the overhead door where I saw a large, orange orb type object streaking from a south-southwest direction to the north-northeast at a very high rate of speed.  There were no sounds as the object passed and no visible landing or navigation type lights.  There were also no other aircraft visible in the area at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this area is very close to both Detroit Metropolitan Airport and Toledo Express, air traffic is very common place and the sounds of various aircraft extremely familiar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the object was out of sight, the dog stopped barking, the digital ambulance radio returned to normal operation as did the music station I was listening to.<n>

The back end had red, blue/green, and white lights.  There were other aircraft in the area that were clearly smaller as if they could fit inside this huge object.  When they looked like they might be going towards it the large object would brighten and flash 3 large red lights in triangle formation.

The sky was slightly misty at that moment.  The orange ball eventually faded away gradually.  I tried to film it with my camera on the cell phone but it was not showing on it.  I imagine the light was not bright enough and also, due to the strong street lamp next to where I was trying to film it.<n>

Motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of October 5th, (I am not sure of the time as we had no clock) my wife and I saw a very bright light flare up, far brighter than any stars, Venus, or Jupiter, out of nowhere, due North of us.  It remained quite bright for perhaps 30 seconds, then it dissipated, and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First thought was a star going nova, but probably not bright enough, or long enough, and just not likely at all.  There are no stars in the position we saw this, also.  I checked Vandenberg AFBs launch schedule and nothing was scheduled, also the directions of the launches from us is about 70 degrees to the west, so also quite unlikely.  My best guess is that it was a meteorite/fireball with a trajectory of zero from our position, making it look absolutely motionless, coming, basically, directly at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other possibility might be a satellite in a geosynchronous orbit, which had not yet passed the terminator.  We see a large number of strange things up here (mostly military) but I am at a bit of a loss on this one.<n>

It was a bit bigger than your average car but a lot smaller than the giant UFO i saw before.<n>

I woke up with strep throat, which had started kicking in last night.  I tried all types of medicines and finally gave up and went to the hospital.  After being diagnosed and given my prescription for antibiotics and pain meds, I went to a diner and had breakfast while I waited for the pharmacy to open.  At the diner I check my Facebook page and I read a message from my sister; Dad has cancer and is not going to do chemo.  Then crying.  Then pharmacy to pick up meds, call dad, he is too sick to talk, and eventually drive back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am one block from my house though and see this disc in the sky. It is a white disc, oval shaped.  At first I just thought, &#34;what a weird shaped cloud&#34;, but then I realized it was moving.  I passed my house and continued down the street to catch a better glimpse of this thing.  I quickly reach for my phone to take a picture and it quickly flies away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I park at Memorial Park on the river and try to look for it , but it is no where to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second alien sighting I&#39;ve seen in the last 6 months, and last time I was with two other friends (all of us sober!) who saw it as well.

The curtains of my north-facing window are open, as is the window. I happened to look up from my Mac and glance out the window, only to see a pulsating red light.  The pulse is almost exactly one per second, rhythmically, like a dimmer being turned all the way up and then all the way off.  The pulsating light was quite a bit larger than a blinking red wing light on a jet, at least three times as large.  As best I can judge the distance, it appeared to be within five to ten miles of my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving — slowly and without variance in speed — pretty nearly due west, at maybe a third or a fourth the speed of a low-flying light aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The experience lasted twenty minutes.  The object gradually moved out of sight to the west, never changing course or speed, never altering the rate of pulsation for its light, never changing size or growing dimmer except insofar as distance altered its visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no noise whatsoever, not of jet engines, nor of helicopter blades, nor anything else.<n>

It happened while I was on duty and preparing to do my last patrol of the shift before ending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 0025hrs(12:25am), I observed a blue and red light flying over the Ko&#39;olau Mountains near Tantalus/roundtop drive.  My first thought was that it was a plane coming over the mountain, but I quickly ruled that out when it changed course, moving slightly to my left.  It was much to sudden to be a plane, so the next thing I thought was a helicopter, which was quickly ruled out soon after when I observed the lights make a sudden change and begun to fly in a zig zagging kind of path in the sky, and not to mention that there was no sound of helicopter blades chopping through the air at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon that sudden course of action it conducted I was most certainly interested now.  I continued to monitor the lights and even repositioned myself on the property to try to get a better view and continue to observe it&#39;s strange and erratic movements.  It then proceeded to appear to descend towards the ground where I could no longer observe as my vision was obstructed by trees and structures.  It&#39;s movements were like someone pointing a laser pointer and moving it all over the place except much more controlled and not as fast, but faster and able to do things that a plane or helicopter could do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly there after it&#39;s descent out of my view, my Supervisor shows up at my site to check up on me as usual during my shift, and almost soon after he arrived the thing shot back into the air and proceeded to fly erratically as before, I quickly pointed it out and even he was baffled by it and we both continued to watch it until it descended again to the ground where we couldn&#39;t see.  My Supervisor is a former U.S. Marine and he said he had never seen any aircraft do things like that, not even a remote controlled device.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I was thinking when we watched it, but I waited to hear him say it first. &#34;I think we just observed an Unidentified Flying Object&#34;.  We ruled out cars that might have been on the road on the mountain as we both saw the object fly high enough that we could see there was space between the outline of the mountain and the lights, so it was definitely in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw it shoot straight up suddenly and we thought it was gonna zip away, but it hovered for about 5 seconds before shooting back down towards the ground where we couldn&#39;t see it.  And that was the last we saw it. Immediately after my shift at 0100hrs I got in my car and drove up to the Military Cemetary at Punch bowl to try to get a better view. Once up there I saw a group of 4 young people hanging out overlooking the area where my workplace is and so I asked them if they saw it, if they saw the lights. One of them, a girl, admitted to seeing a red light shoot up from the corner of her eye not long before I arrived.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And that was the last time I saw it, I waited for about 15 minutes more to see if it would return, but it didn&#39;t.<n>

Last year when I did this I did not see what I saw this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 2.6 miles southwest of the shore of the Jolly Roger’s RV camp, Marathon Florida, I spotted a bright dot in the Gulf of Florida (appears to be underwater).  The spot had a tail that appears to be about 1.5 miles long at first glance.  After closer inspection it appears that the bright dot came from a garage type object under the Gulf and traveled about 5 miles.  May have gone further, but Google Earth plotted area for just a short period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Further investigation of the bright object was difficult as Google Earth pixilates as I zoom in, however, I was able to estimate the size of the bright object.  It was the about 160 feet wide by 180 feet long with a path signature about 150 feet wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The underwater garage appears to be a crescent shape about 160 feet wide at the opening –almost the exact width of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The coordinates of the object on my Google Earth are:  24.47.16.28N  80.58.55.35W  The coordinates of the Garage on my Google Earth are: 24.48.58.70N  80.54.39.00W<n> <n><n> <n><n> Image from Google Earth 20-5-2014<n>

10/4/14 23:00|Tucson|AZ|Unknown|6 minutes|6 orange slow moving objects in western Tucson sky.|10/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114236.html|685|ndxe201410| 6 orange slow moving objects in western Tucson sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming home from dinner, saw six separate orange lights in the sky.  The objects were moving in an up and down type pattern.  Some going up, some going down, all in a slow motion.  Thought it might be helicopters or aircraft, but no sound and maneuvers were not patterns aircraft would be doing at 11pm at night, if at all.  Then, five of the orange lights shifted to form a triangle and slowly drifted down the skyline in a very tight pattern, more like a &#34;V&#34; actually.  A &#34;V&#34; shape that resembled more of a &#34;&amp;gt;&#34; symbol.  Then those five orange lights turned off, but you could still see the objects maintain their shape, but remain completely still and stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sixth orange light then floated slowly up and to the left, and then slowly shifted to the right and eventually stopped in it&#39;s tracks as well.  It remained lit for a few minutes after that, but then it also went dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I am writing this, the objects can still be seen sitting in the sky, unlit, stationary, and almost seeming to blend in with the normal sky constellations seen to the West at night.  The lighted portion of the even lasted about 6 minutes or so, but total time so far has been about half an hour.<n>

I&#39;ve never been real sure if I believe in alien ufo&#39;s but that may be because I&#39;ve never seen anything that could be one.  This was the first time I&#39;ve even witnessed anything like this and I can not explain it and it was unusal.  I believe it was a ufo<n>

10/4/14 22:30|Lisbon (Portugal)||Diamond||40 small illuminated craft seen flying across river in Lisbon|10/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114365.html|692|ndxe201410| 40 small illuminated craft seen flying across river in Lisbon<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not reported this to anybody else.  I am a retired (30 yr) Met Police Officer (UK).  My wife and 2 friends were walking along the river in Lisbon, on the north side, (approx opposite the huge Statue to Christ).  An elderly man who was clearly fishing was pointing at the sky excitedly. saying &#34;the Portuguese airforce just went that way, they are bombing Syria&#34;.   We all laughed at him.  I noted that a few other strangers had stopped because he was so exciteable, and I said to them (they were Dutch or German), &#34;He has had a bit too much aguadente&#34;.  Then 5 minutes later, after we had moved on about 50 yards, I saw something I wish I had never seen.  I would rather not have seen it.  About 1000 to 2000 feet up, and maybe 3 to 5 thousand feet away, were about 40 &#34;craft&#34; (my friend thinks 60) .. diamond shaped with white lights around the edges.  They were &#34;flying&#34; no noise, from my right to left. I saw purple and green in the! middle of one or two of them.  The others say they cannot recall that.  Our two friends are responsible adults who live in the USA (details supplied if requested).  Some of the craft hovered in one position. Others jerked down and upwards. I joked to my friend, &#34;are we being invaded&#34;. But truthfully,we cannot think of an explanation.  We thought maybe they were some kind of &#34;projection&#34; by a prangster, but there was too much up and down movenent of some of these, while others remained on course, and the area covered was too big for a projection.  I know you are going to think I have been drinking! (any lie detector would show that this is a true account).  Like I said, I wish I had never seen it.  And we watched them all fly over the river and disappear into clouds.  I swear I saw the rear of the craft.. there was a double dimension to this.  How big were they?  Because of the distance, I would say, maybe as large as an estate car.  If you have any questions for me, please contact me.  I will tell you more, and who we are, if you wish.  We did have phones/cameras with us.. but each one of us was awe struck, and didn&#39;t talk to each other about taking a photograph, so we didn&#39;t photograph this, which I now regret.  And because of that fact, we may not be believed.  I have googled &#34;UFOs over Lisbon&#34;, and this appears not to have been reported.  There was a young couple standing just a couple of feet behind us, and they did not photograph it either.. they seemed equally bemused.  I am open to any logical suggestion as to what this was ... &#34;please&#34;.  My friend&#39;s wife said, &#34;It must have been drones&#34;.. but there was &#34;no noise&#34;, they were all illuminated. And besides, doesn&#39;t one &#34;drone&#34; cost millions... so 60 of them... in close proximity... I do not think so. I saw an aircraft approaching Lisbon airport travelling from left to right...  These things did not move like any aircraft I ever saw.... It is all bizarre !!!! The night was clear and crisp. I looked at my w! atch.. it was 2230 hrs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have just realized that your centre is in the USA... (does that matter??).. Our two friends, are US citizens, and later, perhaps you could speak to them...<n> <n><n> <n><n> e mail me if you wish .. and perhaps I can respond with my contact details.  I cannot see any UFO society in Portugal, although there possibly is.. and if there is, we are happy to speak with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did email one of my ex colleagues a day or so later .... to tell him about it. (he probably thinks I am mad!!)<n>

Some objects did not continue to climb and appeared to land nearby.  5-8 objects were observed over the course of 20 minutes or so.

However, on Saturday evening around 8:00 pm there was a flying object like we&#39;d never seen.  It had a blue light on top and a red light on the bottom.  At first I thought it was one of the drones that flies over the valley every night, but then it started going up and down, then sideways and stop in mid-flight.  It wasn&#39;t a plane and it wasn&#39;t a helicopter.  I have never seen the drones act in this particular fashion either.  It lasted around three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We did not observe any strobe lights, navigation lights or hear any engine noise.  We both noticed the object wobble and descend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object started to come towards our direction still descending.  The object stopped then immediately shot up in altitude and the light became red, pink then went out and changed back to red (very small) as it went out of distance in a great climb in altitude.<n>

We went there to spend time with my mother and sisters who came together to enjoy a much needed get-a-way and they invited us to come join in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My younger sister and wife and I were walking along a popular strand of beach there at the end of the island on the 4th which was a Saturday.  It was getting late in the day so we decided to go in order to avoid the rising tide and the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as the sun set, we approached the public parking lot.  Then we all spotted a peculiar orange orb just appearing there in the night sky and it was very out of place to the natural order of things.  As we were watching this “UFO” for several minutes suddenly a barrage of “Chinese Lanterns” were being released over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were quite startled at first.  We realized this had nothing to do with the actual unknown orange orb situated in the skyline to the left of these “Chinese Lanterns” releases.  At the time, we did not know that the party patrons had launched off the “Chinese Lanterns” but my younger sister had proclaimed they were in fact just that as she was familiar with the way they appear when launched off.  My older sister who was bringing us our supper from a restaurant trip also came upon the “Chinese Lanterns” display as she was driving up to were we were staying and verified to us it was from the occupants of a beach house two lots down from the beach house we were at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night I was really startled by a bright object that lit up the dark starry skies but both my sisters explained to me that it was just “The Space Station” as they see it all the time.  However they all agreed that the first orange orb was what has been a horrific ordeal for years at the Ocean Isle/Southport NC area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They began to tell me of their own multiple encounters of these orbs and other related stories, particularly a sinister revelation from a woman friend along the end of island who tells of huge cigar shaped UFO with smaller craft that appear there on a constant schedule all year round!  I was reluctant to report this but after speaking to someone who explained to me the importance of revealing this information, I now relay to you this report and hope it helps shed some light on something going on in this region.  I think that this place needs proper investigators to look into these activities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were heading out to go shopping for a Halloween costume.  The sun was just beginning to set, when we came to a red light, in the residential section of Fairless Hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we sat at the red light, a rectangular object flew just above the tree tops, to the right side of our car.  The craft did not seem to make any noise.  It was long, and dark gray in color.  The underneath was completely covered by two, side-by-side rows of about 10 round, white lights.  The lights reminded me of spotlights. I&#39;m not very good at guessing the length or distance of objects, but my best guess would be that it was about 80-100 feet in length, and about 30-40 feet in width.  It was so close to us that we really couldn&#39;t tell how tall it was.  We mostly got a view of the underside.  As it began to move away from us, it didn&#39;t seem to appear to have much height to it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft moved at a moderately fast pace, and disappeared behind the tree line across the street very quickly.  My daughter and I both looked up and pointed to the object at the same time, and it was gone that quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The traffic light turned green almost immediately, and we traveled in the direction that we saw it disappear behind the trees.  By the time we reached a clearing in the tree line (probably about 100 feet away from the light we were previously at), the craft was so far away that it could only be seen along the distant horizon.  Neither of us could figure out how it could have traveled what looked like several miles, in less than a minute.  Though it was almost out of sight at that point, we were still able to make out it&#39;s shape and lights, even from that distance.<n>

I could clearly mark out the shape of the craft and follow it&#39;s path.  It was greyish but more like camouflage with the night sky above.

At approx 11:55 tonight, myself and another witness heard an extremely loud roar pass over the area.  I was sitting under an open window, and this clearly came from the sky.  We are in a direct path for Detroit Metroit Airport.  At first, i thought it was a jet coming in.  But the rate of which the sound approached and dissipated was far too fast for a commercial jet.  Not to mention so loud, it would have been at a much lower altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ive witnessed large meteorites witnessed over multiple states. I&#39;ve also witnessed jets breaking the sound barrier.  This did not sound like that at all.  No impact, shockwave or sonic boom was heard.  The third witness, approximately 1.5 miles west, and outside during this event, heard it, but did not notice any lights either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strangely, this past winter, we heard what sounded like pulse jets on occasion.  Usually at night, once during the day.  Think Nazi V1 buzz bombs. Internet searches yielded no results pertaining to aircraft making such noises in cold dense air.  Somethings definitely going on over Southeast Michigan the passed few months.<n>

The sightings have become more and more frequent.  I am starting to see two on the same night.  I have entered only my latest above because the form only accommodates one sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is my log:  I reported the first one I saw this year to MUFON (case #55584).  I saw it in the early morning hours of March 7.  I did not send the report until April because it took me that long to work through it in my head.  I had a similar sighting several years prior at my previous home ten miles to the east of my present location but did not know where to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been keeping a log of the sightings since March (dates, time, shape and direction of travel) and just found your site.  Last night I saw two within 3 minute of each other and want to see if anyone else is reporting the same activity.  My husband saw one in August and is convinced that they are military drones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is my log.  Please note that each of sightings are silent, high altitude, and fast. By fast, I mean seconds to cross the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> March 7, 2014 12:45am – 1:15 am (Original report to MUFON case # 55584) I was facing south on a clear night with no moon, looking to the southeast when a very large, high altitude vessel blocked my view of the stars.  If I had not been looking where I was, I don’t think I would have seen it.  It was dark, no visible lights and almost seemed transparent or as if it was reflecting the starlight, almost invisible.  It was a large, triangular/boomerang shape that had rounded corners and the back was indented (not a typical straight lined triangle, but not a typical boomerang either).  It was completely silent and was moving faster than the high altitude planes I see all the time.  It passed just slightly to the east of me, moving south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> July 16, 2014 10:33 pm Very fast, dark, silent, V-shape moving W to E.

I witnessed the object for 25 to 30 seconds. The fireball then flickered out to reveal a white pulsating light on a dark metal looking object which flashed 3 times and then extinguished all while the object turned course toward the south east and  appeared to accelerate at a high rate of speed. I thought what I was looking at could possibly have been Chinese lantern but there were no real true signs of fire and the lantern would have been traveling against any wind currents present from the south.  Also, when the object burnt out, it did not fall to earth but accelerated away holding its altitude until it disappeared out of view just as an aircraft in level flight would. I attempted to video the object with the camera on my pho! ne for about 20 seconds zooming in on the object at the midpoint of the filming. The video actually recorded was only two seconds.  I was able to get a few good stills out of the 2 seconds of video that I did capture. I have witnessed the approaching fire ball which seems to drop its cargo and run once before on 09/30/09 at around 22:50 hours. The first sighting was far more dramatic and I had two witnesses with me who to this day, still do not believe what they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From the North a light white fuzzy streaked and decelerated. it blinked into existance, it then opened up into an echlon formation with 9 indivudual lights on all sides of the triangle and proceeded on a direct southern course. it was out of sight in no time at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No pattern or formation just a random group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived on the porch there were at least ten in sight passing directly overhead with many more coming into view. Not a sound could be heard from these things.  Two or three turned to the east. Most stayed on course passing overhead and out of view.  At least two or three just vanished as they were coming towards us.  One stopped a few hundred yards  in front of me and ejected four tiny balls one at a time which fell in a spiral like motion but went out before reaching the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have no idea how many passed over before she walked out, but we did see easily over twenty of them. I did get about 16 bad photos of the last two.<n>

10/3/14 20:00|Swindon (UK/England)||Triangle|3-4 minutes|Triangular Craft seen at the Magic Roundabout Intersection|4/8/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/118/S118258.html|729|ndxe201410| Triangular Craft seen at the Magic Roundabout Intersection<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer:  One male adult pedestrian<n> <n><n> Location of observation:  Drove Road (near Magic Roundabout Intersection), Swindon, Wiltshire, SN1, UK<n> <n><n> Visibility:  Very good<n> <n><n> Ambient light:  Just after dusk. Streetlights in the area<n> <n><n> Description:  A triangular craft was seen floating above the quiet residential area immediately to the east of Drove Road Swindon for a short period of time before moving away, in a manner inconsistent with a sighting of any conventional craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was seen to be floating perfectly still and in complete silence very close to Drove Road at a low altitude above houses.  It is difficult to estimate the altitude of the craft but it was perhaps ~50ft from the ground, and certainly what would legally constitute ‘low flying’. The craft was very close to the observer and so it could be seen with great clarity.  It was very conspicuous and easy to observe.  It was clearly not any form of conventional aircraft or any other known object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The planform of the craft was a perfect triangle in shape and was larger in area than any one of the houses over which it loitered although it did not appear as large in area as two such houses.  At each of the vertices of the visible underside were very large, powerful circular lights (one at each vertex).  The character of the light was very similar to that of the surrounding street lights. I.E. a bright flame yellow hue.  There was a subtle difference of colour between the light and that of the street lights.  Namely, it was of a slightly more brilliant character: less burnt and slightly more saturated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft itself was of a dark or black colour and with no noticeable surface features.  It was not possible to make out the texture of the surface. There were no signs of landing gear or wheels or indeed any other protrusions.  The triangle was perhaps a bit broader in the axis of motion.  At the centre of the underside, seemingly fixed directly to the bottom of the craft, was a pulsing red light far smaller than the others. This appeared to be very similar in character and frequency if not identical to a standard red anti-collision beacon of the sort used commonly in aviation.  The craft loitered perfectly still without any movement or instability and in complete silence over a quiet residential area for an observed period of approximately 3-4 minutes although it was already in-situ when first sighted and so may have been there for a while.  It could not have been present for more than 15-20 min as the area was traversed in the opposite direction using the same route approximat! ely this length of time prior to the start of the observation window.  It was obvious during the observation that the area immediately underneath the craft must have been very brightly illuminated by the powerful lights.  Anyone beneath the craft would have been dazzled/blinded.  The planform seemed to be entirely parallel to the ground while it was stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 3-4 minutes, it moved off without any noticeable acceleration. It moved very slowly – perhaps no more than 15mph based on comparisons with moving traffic on Drove Road. Interestingly, it moved with one of the vertices leading, as though that were the nose of the craft. No fins or signs of a tail could be seen. It remained horizontal as it moved away and no instabilities/roll/etc were visible.  Almost immediately after beginning to move, the large lights were all switched off.  The lights continued to glow and hence remained visible for the duration of the 30-40 seconds it took for the craft to attain diminished visibility to the observer.  The afterglow was very distinctive and allowed the craft to remain visible for much longer than would otherwise have been the case.  Perhaps a qualified lighting expert might be able to identify the type of light involved: the glow was a burnt dim orange-yellow hue and faded very slowly.  This also gave the impression that the lights were more powerful than had originally been thought. Slight concentric grooves were apparent within the lights as with powerful search lights and floodlights perhaps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was moving in a straight line of constant altitude towards the portion of Queen’s Drive near to the Magic Roundabout.  However, before reaching that position the craft banked to the right at a very steep angle (nearly vertical) giving an excellent view of the craft from below, something that would not be seen in conventional aviation.<n>

My husband was facing me so he didn&#39;t see the light, I was taking to him when I noticed this very bright start behind his left shoulder (what a assumed to be a star).  I stared at it for about 2 minutes and just as I was about to tell him To turn around to see it, it lit up extremely bright and then vanished!  All I could say was, &#34;Did you see that!  Oh my goodness where did it go!&#34;  My husband thought I was crazy, I explained to him what happen and he told me we should get in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s not the first time we&#39;ve seen something in that same area, and before he has seen things too. I&#39;m not sure what to make of this particular occurrence but it scared him and myself.<n>

It burned very bright as if on fire, and left sparks/ remnants in the air.  It was just East/ SouthEast of the Shoprite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel it was a metorite honestly, but I&#39;ve never seen one so low before.  I would say it was around 1000 feet in the air.

On October 3, 2014 around 6:45pm, while on my porch, I saw two red lights hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights looked close because the light seemed large. I live within an airport pathway in a small city,  I see planes and flight patterns as they enter airspace and prepare to land and take off.  What I found alarming was that they seemed very close together too close and brightness of same intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were bright red, they made no sound and then one traveled northeast at one o ‘clock and the other northeast at almost three o’clock.  They both were very fast.<n>

The bright white lights which were of approx equal intensity shone steady and stationary for the entire 45min or so we remained lakeside.  A mid-level opaque cloud passed over 2 of the lights, creating a slight dimming and color shift consistent with ice/water vapor, and suggesting these objects were very high in the atmosphere.  The sun moved westward over time- the objects remained exactly the same intensity (less the cloud) and location relative to the trees, for the entire period.  They were consistently spaced about one &#34;visual&#34; foot apart in the sky in a line running east/west, approx parallel to the general horizon. Wellington Lake is approx 15 miles SSW of Bailey Colorado, 1.5 hours SW of Denver.  It was hard to determine if the objects were lit or were reflecting the sun.  The even intensity over time suggests the latter.<n>

It&#39;s near Portland, Oregon; maybe twenty or so miles away.  Anyhow, I have grown up in a culture of sci-if loving, alien-addicted &#34;extraterrestrial life is out there&#34; exposure and I, myself accept that it&#39;s quite likely that we are but one of many civilizations of advanced life in the vast universe.  Lately in Washougal, the sky has been pristinely crystal-clear, and a few times, I&#39;ve tried to remedy my chronic insomnia at night by going outside, in the chilly October air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 3, at around 4:14 a.m, I was looking up at the stars when I noticed something unusual, in the southernmost part of the sky.  As I focused on it with my eyes, I could see that it was roughly cross-shaped - but instead of being totally straight, the arms of the cross angled downward in an arch, and they emitted a blinding light.  During some &#39;bursts&#39; of light, I looked away, to avoid the bright light.  There was a solid, oval-shaped ring around the cross, which would occasionally strobe rapidly with every color in the rainbow... It was an astounding and mind-boggling display. I could not make sense of it, if it truly was an earthly aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object for well over an hour, and it stayed -hovering- in the same general vicinity... A part of the sky in-between two massive Douglas Firs, which were clearly visible to me, well over two miles away.  I suspect -with that point of reference- that the cross-shaped object was about three-to-five miles away...  It was hovering unsteadily (it seemed to struggle at times, sinking as though it was losing power; and then darting upwards, unexpectedly - going speeds that could not possibly be achieved with our current technology).  It wobbled around unsteadily in the same vicinity for an hour and a half, before it began to gradually ascend up, like a rocket, except without any atmospheric resistance... It just cut right through - the object shot straight up into the sky. It&#39;s light-trail was so bright, large liquid-like streaks trailed behind the object, like nothing I&#39;d ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when I noticed that the bright light seemed to move much like a fluid, acting with many properties of water. As the object rose higher and higher up into the atmosphere, it&#39;s silhouette very rapidly disappeared... It was gone at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I entered my house, it was 5:52 am, and I held an uneasiness in my stomache. I had always considered ETs to be out there, but experiencing an actual UFO in the sky, so near you... it changed the way I feel about a lot of things. I understand the persistence and perseverance of the UFO community after my experience. I&#39;d like to tell family and friends, but I know that I&#39;ll be judged harshly for it. It&#39;s awful, how so many ignorant people laugh believers off the stage. At the very least, I&#39;m happy to be able to share my first experience with an identified flying object.<n>

Then about 1 minute later a second round orange fireball following the same path as the first one silently glide across the sky.  The second one disappeared into a cloud.  Neither object blinked or flashed but just stayed solid in color.  The sky was dark, but planes were flying at a much higher level in the sky, but not close.<n>

It was not very high maybe a little higher than a plane pulling an advertising banner at the beach.  When I looked a bit closer I noticed the object had 3 slightly smaller red lights trailing behind it blinking in unison about every other second as compared to the lead white light which did not blink at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curious I thought to myself maybe the lead light was a small plane and the trailing lights may be some sort of helicopter escort but at that moment I realized none of the objects made a sound! I also noticed way off in the distance an actual plane and was reminded of the typical blinking lights you normaly see on a flying vehical and saw that the objects I saw did not display anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still unsure I continued to watch as they silently worked their way from north to south along the coast and as my perspective changed to a view from behind I noticed I couldnt really make out th! e lead white light but the 3 trailing red lights now being viewed from behind kind of seemed to now be in the shape of an odd triangle. As this triangle got smaller and smaller as it moved farther away I noticed that they still were blinking in silent unison. I watched until I could no longer make them out in the sky, the whole sighting lasted just under 10 minutes!<n>

I thought it was a star until it zipped away really fast.  It was like it was hovering and then it moved a little, stopped and then zoomed off.  It was really really fast when it moved.  Too fast for anything man made i think.  It was a bright light.  If I didnt see it move i would probably never had noticed it cause it definatly looked like a star in the sky.<n>

This may have been a meteor or satellite fragment, and was falling more like a huge burning ember and not like a typical meteor streak.  It appeared to be relatively close but the other person who saw it was also in Erie, and I&#39;m unaware of additional reports from other nearby cities that may help to triangulate the exact location.  I noticed it start falling at about 45 degrees below the horizon and it &#34;fizzled out&#34; about 20 degrees later (about halfway to the ground from the time it was first seen).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen a good number of fireballs and meteors, but only a handful of these close ember-like balls over many years.

The camera which took the photo is an Olympus Model VR-320, &#34;HD 12.5x Super Wide, 14 Megapixel&#34;, although I had it set on a relatively low resolution, so as to save space and be able to snap more photos during my trip to California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Bird with wings folded.

We were sitting in a spot of grass near the library, which is a fairly open space with a clear view of the sky. Both having had a long day, we were reclined in the grass staring up at the sky when at about 4:40PM, we both noticed something white making its way across the vast stretch of blue. At first glance, it appeared to be a feather being pushed by the wind, but we soon realized it was at much too high of an altitude and was moving far too fast. Upon further inspection, we could see that it resembled a scalene triangle, and spun about and tilted at odd angles while it flew across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We brushed this off somewhat nonchalantly at first, laughing at the absurdity of the sight. After all, it had been a long day, and we assumed that it was, indeed, just a feather or some other spec of debris, and our eyes were playing tricks on us making the object in question look stranger. That is, until the next object came in. It had only been 10 seconds after the first, if even that, when another white object hovered across the sky in the same manner. This object was perfectly spherical and was not moving about in the same sporadic way as the first. That is, if it was, it wasn’t noticeable because of its shape. It was at the same altitude and was within our view for the same amount of time as the other, a mere 20 seconds or so of a quick and soundless hovering as it made its way across the plain of our vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We reported the sighting via hotline right when the incident was over. My friend tried to capture photos and videos of the 2nd object in question, but it was so high up and thus appeared so small that it wasn’t picked up by their iPhone camera. Being that these two objects were so small and were silent, we’re unsure of whether or not there were any other witnesses.<n>

It appeared at first to be an all-white airplane moving very, very fast. As it flew, we could see it turn over and around a few times, like a plastic bag would when blown about by the wind. It seemed to be in the shape of a scalene triangle with it’s tip bent back on itself.  We watched it until it appeared to fly down and disappear over the horizon.  I pulled out the camera on my cellphone but the object wouldn’t show up against the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object appeared about 5-10 seconds after the first one disappeared. Again, my friend pointed it out to me. This one was a sphere, the same color and size at the first one. It only reflected a small amount of light.  It followed the same trajectory and again disappeared over the horizon.  Event took place at Sacramento City College, and the objects were viewed while lying down in the grass in the courtyard. Both objects were smaller than the sun.<n>

But then I noticed it was moving in a Northwest direction.  A few months ago I watched the space station move across the sky at night over southern california.  It resembled that to me as in the size and speed at which it moved.  But then I noticed once it got from directly overhead to a slight northwestern direction it seemed to stop and then move in a flat eastern direction slowly for about 2 minutes.  If I had to judge distance the movement from the beginning would have been 3 feet in line of sight from southeast to northwest then about 9 inches in line of sight eastern direction before continuing northwest out of my site behind a obstructing tree.  I saw several plans flying at high altitude flying near or directly underneath this object and it was obviously way higher than them. Like I said it looked like a mid day star but moving. When it was directly over my head at the beginning of my sighting it seemed to shimmer as if it was reflective.  Which in turn would kind of make it look larger and smaller.  The last I saw of it, it was getting fainter but as if something that moves away gets smaller.  I have always been into ufo sightings but never had what I felt to be a genuine sighting.  I would not report something that I did not feel that needed to be genuinely looked into. I am excited to find out if it was something explainable or not.  I wish someone else could verify my story.<n>

It was Thursday, October 2, 2014, between 2:30 am and 3 am.  I was looking out of my bathroom window towards the southeast sky as I sometimes do to admire the night sky.  First I noticed that the Big Dipper was very bright and then something right below it, near the horizon, I noticed a ball of colored lights twinkling.  At first I thought it was an airplane but it didn&#39;t move. It just twinkled bright red and green lights.  I knew couldn&#39;t be a star because all the stars are bright and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the livingroom to get a pair of binoculars to go outside to view it from my patio. My husband was still sitting at his desk at his laptop as I told him what I was doing. He went outside with me to see if we could view it better. Sure enough, there it was...still shinning brightly with red and green lights, like a small ball just twinkling on the horizon looking southeast of our house. It never moved from the spot just below the Big Dipper and the rest of the stars. In other words...its position only moved with the earth&#39;s rotation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since my husband works nights and doesn&#39;t get home until approximately 12:40 am, I&#39;m usually up waiting for him to get home. We don&#39;t head off to bed until some time after 1:30 am and 2:30 am. So we will probably look again for this bright twinkling ball of light tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, my husband called a friend who is a deputy sheriff on duty until 6 am. He acknowledged seeing the same ball of red and green lights in the sky in the same direction as we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope I&#39;ve provided enough information that is needed to investigate this unusual sighting. Thank you.<n>

However I have never til last night seen a craft or anything that I would call a UFO til last night. it started about 11 pm when the Apt I live in shook and rumbled. when i walked out my back door there was a very low flying military black hawk chasing three low flying objects that had no sound coming from them.  The black hawk had no other reason to be in area and was not searching or looking for any thing or anyone,  It was chasing the objects.  it is however possible that it was just one object with lights.  I am shocked how low it was but it was very dark and only saw the lights. Three.  I even thought it may have been three black hawks but it was not.  they the lights in front made no sound and the black hawk had a hard time keeping up with it as they banked from NNE to SSE in a manner that made no since to me .  the objects were maybe 600 ft to 800 ft high at the highest till the object or objects in front just were gone. It cause me to lose sleep and my wife did see it for a short time because I woke her.  I did tell our Adult daughter who then told me that her and her boyfriend had just seen something the night before which seem to land this happen about 5 miles from where i saw the objects being chased. when they banked it was towards where my daughter and her boyfriend saw something the night before.  They were not going to tell anyone til I mentioned what i saw to her , it left them very afraid.  i watched News and searched net to see if anyone else reported it, i lost sleep over this.  It was so low yet i could not even grab my phone however the black hawk chasing it means someone knows about it .  Also  20 mins later i h! eard what may have been a Drone searching same area.  That is about it  Oh I almost forgot both my dog and birds in my house reacted to it and would not sleep afterwards.<n>

One was close and flew over head the other was distant and hovered in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not sure how this page works but I had a 100% definite UFO encounter last night and thought i would share it!  Me and my roommate had gone outside(it was about 9-10 pm) to smoke a cigarette and let our dogs out...after being out there for a few minutes we start looking at the stars and notice one seemed very low to the earth and VERY red. It being so red is what initially caught our eyes.  After watching it remain perfectly still for at least a couple minutes we write it off as a weird star and move on...then all of a sudden we see something coming towards us to our right.  Next thing we know there is something very large starting to fly over us.  It had 3 white lights in a triangle shape with a softer, larger, red light in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was flying extremely slow and low...enough so that we were able to make out the shape, a definite triangle. It made a deep, low hum noise very different from a plane or jet (which we hear often living close to airports and runways). We know it was not a plane as it was WAY too low and WAY too close to make such little to no noise. The &#34;UF! O&#34; continued in a straight line until it was over the tree line and out of sight. Once it was out of sight we both started to freak out and something told me to turn back to the unusually red star we had seen. As soon as my eyes looked at the star it started to rise in altitude. I smack my friend, &#34;dude, dude, dude...look!!!&#34; as soon as he saw it moving he said see i knew it wasn’t a star!  The second &#34;UFO&#34; continued flying up a short distance and then started at an angle to the left (opposite direction of the closer &#34;UFO&#34;). It continued at a pretty fast speed until it was out of sight. I feel i should mention the entire time this was happening several of the dogs in the nieghborhood were going crazy and would not stop barking for several minutes after. We know we didn’t see a plane and know we saw a triangle shaped craft but have no answers beyond that...<n>

I pointed it out to my wife and she noticed immediately it was not moving.  It Sat in the same spot for 15 minutes.  I went to get our binoculars and could see it was changing from white, blue, green, orange, red.  We called the neighbors and they came out to see it also.<n>
10/1/14 20:00|New York City (Brooklyn)|NY|Light|30 seconds|Undulating orange light.|10/3/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114129.html|773|ndxe201410| Undulating Orange Light<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking to my car at about 8 PM on October 1 2014. I am located in the Flatlands section of Brooklyn. The sky was overcast. I looked over the my left and saw an orange light undulating from North or Northwest to South or South East. It wasn&#39;t going very fast, but I only caught it from the time it took to travel in between two buildings in my field of vision. The best way I can describe the light is that it looked like an orange flare. It would dim from time to time and then flare up again. I thought it might be a helicopter, but I&#39;ve never seen a helicopter undulate like that (and they generally have running lights, etc, instead of a single orange light). I am not sure at what altitude the clouds were, I don’t think they were particularly high, but this object seemed to be just underneath them. I viewed the object for 30 seconds or less. I&#39;d be interested to know if anybody else witnessed this. Thanks!<n>

It was a dark mass that held a shape that had no sharp corners and yet wasn’t round. It possessed a unique color that seemed to mimic camouflage, but each shade of brown, gray and black was unique to certain protrusions or forms this object held.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no lights on it. It moved from about 50 feet above the neighborhood street, over the line of homes and into the fields to the east of the homes where I lost sight of it. Its movement was slow, smooth, steady, and yet at certain times it would change, dipping down and then to one side or the other, never changing its orientation or “facing” direction. There was one section that did protrude further than the rest and it was this section that was always facing the direction of travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no sounds from this object and due to the calm weather it would’ve been easy, at that small distance, to hear any sounds.  The total time of observation wasn’t more than 15-20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ll email a rough drawing of this object with the title of “black object”.<n>

It had 4 lights -- one mustard-yellow light on each corner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark and I was driving home from work and was almost home when a strange object in the sky dipped down just ahead of my car and then gracefully soared upward and through the tree tops.  As it went through the tree tops in turned sideways at an angle and then straightened out after going through the trees and disappeared behind the trees.  It was the shape of a SQUARE with 4 mustard-yellow lights (one light on each corner) that were very bright.   When I first saw it I was almost to the stop sign near my home so I stopped and watched it until I could no longer see it.  My first reaction was “what the heck is that!”  It was so close to me that it shook me up.  I can’t stop thinking about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s hard to say how big it actually was, but I can tell you that it looked like at least a 50’ to 60’ square.  I had my car windows down on both sides and even stuck my head out the window and could not hear any sound whatsoever.   It moved so gracefully through the sky. It was a strange sight to see, certainly not the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Didn&#39;t look like another helicopter or airplane that the helicopters were chasing or following.  It really struck me as odd.  It was the middle of the afternoon, a clear day. I watched the activity until all of the helicopters disappeared behind a hillside covered with trees.  I was at sea level, so I lost sight of everything.  Could have been nothing, but didn&#39;t look normal.<n>

The trail of this craft twisted like a vortex or curly-cue pig tail.  It moved from E to N, crossing over the mouth of the Carson Valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At times during its trajectory, it stopped in time and space and as it did so, its particulate trail reduced in length and width.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, it stopped and its tail completely faded, leaving an oval or circle of light that reduced in size until no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a though the light craft pushed back into space or folded it.  Overall, it seemed to be an oddly slow moving fire ball.<n>

I saw a single blue flickering light at street level on Algonquin Ave. in Clearwater, FL.  It was small like a flashlight and would flicker from blue to white to off sporadically while it flew around similar to a moth.  From a foot or so above the street to 20 or so feet up.  I could see the trees across the street behind it, it was very close.  I watched if fly around for at least a minute while moving toward it then it went out and I didn’t see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At closer attention at a closer look at these lights appeared to be multicolored and in a stationary position appeared to be multicolored. The object was not moving and seem to be very high in the sky.not sure of what I was saying asked three friends to come and look with me and they confirmed the flashing lights.  They then brought to the attention that the object wasmoving. It seemed to randomly movebut not great distances. The object did not appear to be a helicopter or airplane as it was stationary most of the time that we saw it. We then moved to the front of the house to get a more clear view. It appeared the lights were rotating in a counterclockwise rotation around the object. We watch this object for approximately 35 minutes. It did not appear to move when we change locationat the house and my friends went back inside when we were not able to identify what it was.<n>
10/1/14 02:00|San Jose|CA|Formation|Present|Multiple variations of blinking and or fluttering objects that hover up higher or fly lower inbetween trees and buildings at night.|10/3/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114104.html|781|ndxe201410| Multiple variations of blinking and or fluttering objects that hover up higher or fly lower in between trees and buildings at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been seeing these for weeks now and I know they are not stars, planes or satellites. They hover around in the night skies and some are higher up an some come as close to the ground as flying in between taller trees.  Most of them kind of flash a color that looks likes red, white, and blue at the same time (instantaneously) some of them are a lot more active, almost as if they are patrolling areas.  I can&#39;t describe the shape because they seem to shift and some of them blink just red.  As weird as it sounds, I feel like they can tell when you stare at them and when you pay attention to one or two for a long enough time and then turn around there is almost always another new one that pops up in sight that you can tell was observing you when you were paying attention to the other one(s).  There are also more circularish ones and square ones too with multiple lights.  These are the ones that cruise closer to the ground in an almost sneaky manor.  The ones highe! r up almost look like a fleet. As hard as it may be for some to believe, these things are really out there and if they were something easily explainable like planes or satellites believe me I would not keep ending up trying to follow them around and observing them with such interest.  I don&#39;t know about you but I grew up on one twinkle little star that stayed put and not tens and tens of them that move around and react to my actions.  My stars never hid hovering behind big trees and buildings in different colors, fly to different  locations, and react to some of my movements(chasing or walking away).  These objects seen to be very small by the way too.  Can anyone else relate to anything I just said in this giant paragraph??<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we were not convinced that he was looking at anything but stars.  However, we cannot be certain.  PD))<n>
