6/30/47|Tacoma|WA|Other||This might of been in the same time of year as the Maury Island and Kenneth Arnold Incident.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77568.html|2|ndxe194706| This might of been in the same time of year as the Maury Island and Kenneth Arnold Incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sited a flame shaped like a welding torch; the flame was stationary above my head.  What made me look up was this pointed flame was making a loud roaring noise.  The flame began to rotate 180 degrees and as it did it gave off a very loud ugly roaring noise.  When the flame completed its rotation it then went clear across the sky from over my head to the horizon in the snap of a finger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This might have something to do with the Maury Island Incident by Vashon Island right in the area where I lived or the sighting by Kenneth Arnold.  The only way I know this name (Kenneth Arnold) is I downloaded an article last night on my computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 72 years old now but when I was a young boy I lived in the Point Defiance area in Tacoma, Washington right by Puget Sound and about 5 miles as the crow flies from Maury Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening I was going to my next door neighbors and just as I entered their yard when I heard this noise above my head as previously described, the noise was loud enough to bring my neighbor out of his house and ask me what the noise was.  I can’t remember what I told him.  All these years as I have told friends what I saw and heard I have always finished the conversation with gee I wish I could be hypnotized and go back and find out how old I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, last night while watching a program about USO, underwater flying objects the program kept flashing this person’s name so I tried to get in touch with him but he turned out to be an author and I was unable to e-mail him.  I wanted to notify him of my incident because it is the only one where there was noise involved.  So while on the internet I was paging around and found a site UFO sightings I say Asia, and as I paged down I found sightings in the USA, I remembered I always thought I was in grade school when I saw this flame, heard this noise then watched as it flashed across the sky.  So I looked in the 1940’s and lo and behold there was Maury Island staring me in the face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened the site and read for the first time in my life about the man, son and dog seeing flying objects while snagging logs for lumber and firewood.  Their incident happened June 21, 1947.  If my incident happened in or around the same time that would make me 10 years old for I was born in 1937.  If the noise was loud enough to bring my neighbor out of his house maybe others saw a strange light/flame and noise and called the cops, military, Tacoma News Tribune or others.  If I was 10, I would not have read about the Maury Island Incident or the News paper about the noise and flame.  Maybe Fort Lewis or the Tacoma Paper has articles about what happened that night.  I might be a person that helps substantiate what others saw.  Sorry it took so long to get in touch with someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also I can remember the pointed flame rotated counter clockwise while looking straight up from 9 to 3 on a watch face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s funny if I would not of been from the Point Defiance area I never would of found this article because I would never of recognize Maury as being Maury Island which is now part of Vashon Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Three gold colored disks appeared out of the clouds and slowed to a stop when reaching zenith.  They appeared to be looking down at a beautiful scene below of a broad river set in a valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandfather, a friend and myself could detect a slight motion as they stood in rather tight triangular formation above us, kind of wobbling.  After some 5 to 10 seconds the lead ship slowing began moving Southeast towards Madison and the others brought up the triangular formation.  I would estimate their elevation at about 3-4 thousand feet and they looked about the size of a penny at arms length. They soon accelerated at a tremendous rate and were out of sight on the horizon within 3 to four seconds.   It was a daylight sighting I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date probably is approximate; source remains anonymous.  PD))<n>

It was only about 20 feet above us, and what was unusual, it did not move at all. This is totally un-natural. Normal flight for a hawk flying thermals is to fly in circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fired a one shot from a .22 rifle. The hawk did not move at all. Then we both shot dozens of shots until we were out of ammo. The hawk did not move except it seemed almost imperceptually higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to abserve the &#34;hawk&#34; until it disapeared from sight directly above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This took about an hour. In that hour the hawk did not turn, did not flap it&#39;s wings, and did not move in any direction except up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was very young like about only 4 years old at the time and I am 55 now this was one of the two times I was a wittness of UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects did not move enough  for me to notice.  They were not like the weather balloons that were prevalant during those days but because these were right over head and not like the side view that the weather baloons were.  None of the characteristics below fit the objects that I observed.  We were poor people that had to raise as much food as we could in the summer months to have enough food for the cold winters we have here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mom was a mother of 8 and practicly alone in her indever to raise us.  So we spent a lot of time in the large gardens we had at that time.  For the most part we ignored the objects and went back to our task of hoeing the strawberry plants growing in that particular garden plot.<n>

About half way down the road was a little shanty they called their &#34;gardenhouse&#34; where they cleaned and prepared their produce for market.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached the shanty, we met the elderly woman coming up the road, heading for her home on the edge of town. We stopped to talk, she wanted to express her sympathies ad to ask about the funeral.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were facing north, the woman facing us, as we talked. We noticed a small bright light coming toward us out of the north. It was moving very slowly, but coming down, growing larger and brighter as it decended. The old woman saw the look on our faces, so she turned and looked up. By this time it was very large and a very brilliant blue-white. The old woman fell to her knees, muttering something in her native tongue, Italian, and &#34;crossing&#34; herself. We were paralyzed with fear! Suddenly, after hovering for a few minutes, motionless, it began to go around in wide circles, then shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The woman ran up the road to her home. My husband and I ran to my parents&#39; home, where my husband called the Observatory in Pittsburgh to ask what this &#34;thing&#34; was. They could not give an explanation, but that it &#34;could not have been a plane or weather balloon, nor any invention existing at that time that could have done what this object did.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few weeks later, reports started coming in on radio news about people in the west seeing strange things in the sky. Some were calling them &#34;flying saucers&#34; and &#34;UFO&#39;s,&#34; and some were wondering if some other country had invented some kind of new scientific weapon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never completely got over our fright and have watched the sky ever since. My husband had been in the Navy in the war. We have see many natural things, such as meteorites, northern lights and man- made objects, but never have seen anything to compare to what we saw that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: The week before we saw the strange object, we were on our way to North Carolina to attend my Grandmother&#39;s funeral, traveling Route 11 through the Shenandoah Valley. We were traveling staight through, without stopping for the night. During the night we had a flat tire. Th five of us, my parents, my brother, and my husband and I got out of the car while the tire was fixed. While we were standing on the dark road, a very bright meteorite sailed across the sky, leaving a greenish trail and a &#34;swishing&#34; sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object we saw in Pennsylvania a week later did not resemble this meteorite in any way. It traveled slower, at first, then much faster than the meteorite, was a different color, and made no sound even though it got much closer than the meteorite did. The meteorite streaked across the sky, but the strange object moved slowly and then hovered over us before shooting straight up, lightening fast!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

6/1/47 02:30|Cleveland|OH|Light|about three hours|It was about 2:15 in the morning when my wife woke me from a deep sleep and began to complain of stomach problems. As I was getting out|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17372.html|10|ndxe194706| It was about 2:15 in the morning when my wife woke me from a deep sleep and began to complain of stomach problems. As I was getting out of bed to get her something to drink, I heard what seemed like a strong gust of wind banging the shutters against the house very loudly. As I approached the window to see if it had been raining, a light of some sort, so blinding, appeared out of the darkness. The windows then violently thrashed open and I went completely paralyzed. All I could hear was what sounded like a thousand sirens ringing and my wife screaming in the background. All of a sudden I began to levitate. My wife had also been paralyzed and was floating, in midair right next to me. I cant remember what happened from that point on but when I came to, I found me and my wife outside, in the middle of our yard. When I looked over at my wife I could see she wsas screaming but I couldn&#39;t hear anything coming out. All of a sudden there was a complete silence, and let me tell you, I remember to this day that I have never heard a silence as silent as it was at that moment. Next thing we knew we were transported by a beam of light into what seemed like complete darkness. I couldn&#39;t see my wife, I couldn&#39;t feel my body, and I didn&#39;t know wether I was floating or strapped down. But I could feel this pressure, this invsible force, that was compressing my lungs to the point where I couldn&#39;t even breathe another breath. When I tried to scream, nothing came out, I didn&#39;t even know if I was breathing anymore. I began to hear my wife gasping for air and once I could hear her, the pressure got stronger and I tried to take a deep breath but inhaled nothing but some sort of fluid that filled my lungs so much I could feel my skin burning as if it was tearing off my body. It was then I began to hear my wife screaming the most awful, horrifying screams and I could do nothing for her. I began to weep as a sharp pain engulfed my entire body. It almost felt as if someone carved from the bottom of my legs through my spine, and up! my body with a dull knife. I have never felt pain so terrible in all my life. I passed out for what seemed like eternity. As I regained consciousness, I&#39;m sure I saw my wife standing in front of me, and it seemed like she was reaching to embrace me, but when I tried to reach out for her, it felt like I had been thrown back and slammed into a brick wall which turned out to be the ground in my yard. I looked over and saw my wife laying next to me motionless. All the pain was gone and I looked over again to see my wife turning. I got up as if I was never even touched or moved or thrown around. I went over to help my wife up, and as I saw the expression on her face, everything inside of me burst  because I knew that they had taken her from me forever. My wife died that night and to this day everyone believes that she passed in her sleep because the coroner could find no trace of injury and no sign of trauma that could have caused her to die. I never told this story to anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/1/47|Minden|LA|Unknown|10 seconds|High altitude sighting in 1947|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16010.html|11|ndxe194706| High altitude sighting in 1947<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the 7th grade. One summer afternoon I was lying in the hammock in our back yard, when a small dot appeared on the horizon, flying in a straight line roughly from north to south. I was extremely interested in airplanes, being able to identify everything flown by the USAF, and being familiar with the speeds they can attain. This was at the time of the first operational jets, and it was 15 to 30 times faster than a jet. It only took about 8 to 10 seconds to traverse the entire sky, horizon to horizon, a distance I estimated at 25 miles, more or less. The speed must have been 10,000 to 15,000 MPH. I had excellent vision at that time, being a little farsighted. The craft was too high to be able to determine shape, but there was no doubt as to the fact that it was real, and that it was fast!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
