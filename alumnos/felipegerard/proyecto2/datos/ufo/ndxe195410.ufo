Craft was a yellowish white in color, no flashing light&#39;s, there was no sound at all, however it did make my hair slightly stand up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking up the hill on Pine St, about half way up, something made me turn and look to the north,  the street is around 25 feet wide, and the craft&#39;s diameter was wider than the street.  The craft was approximately 250 feet over my head, my estimation of speed would be around 700 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then I spent 39 years in the Military, I know aircraft when I see them, this Craft was a Saucer.  I saw no window&#39;s, no humanoids.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never talked much about it, and not at all for about 25 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had two other encounters since that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Mr. Darling, our bus driver stopped at a creek and the four of us kids jumped out.  He did not exit the door, but called us back on board.  We drove off with the object remaining motionless.  There were four kids ages 7-9 and the driver in his late 40&#39;s at the time.  He is deceased and all the kids are adults now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/1/54 19:00|Flatwoods|WV|Circle|1 minute|I saw the craft go across the horizon.  It appeared to be on fire, I first thought it was a plane going down.  It landed near a farm.|4/12/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96518.html|3|ndxe195410| I saw the craft go across the horizon.  It appeared to be on fire, I first thought it was a plane going down.  It landed near a farm house and it was observed there.  After a short time it took off.  It did not need a runway to lift off, the area was very hilly and wooded.  Why has very little been reported about this sighting?  EBAY has a video about the Braxton County sighting.  Mention it on George Norry next time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
