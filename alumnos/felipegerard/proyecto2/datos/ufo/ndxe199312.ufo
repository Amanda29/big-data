12/24/93 21:00|Bellflower|MO|Light|5 minutes max|Strange glowing lights hover and then streak across the night sky in Bellflower, MO|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42463.html|2|ndxe199312| Strange glowing lights hover and then streak across the night sky in Bellflower, MO<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking from my grandparents&#39; house to my parents&#39; house (across the street) on what I believe was the evening of Dec. 24, 1993, I saw a strange light over our neighbors&#39; house (approx. 100-200 yds distance between where I stood and their house).  What intrigued me about the light was that it changed color from blue to red to white and back again but not in any particular sequence or order.  Also it seemed to hover over the house.  I would estimate that the light was several thousand feet in the sky.  I located it as hovering over the house because the house itself was the nearest landmark that it appeared to linger above and because I could, of course, see nothing beyond the house because it impeded my view of everything else behind it.  But as far as the light goes, I would estimate that it far up in the night sky.  What was strange to me though, besides its changing colors, was its hypnotic quality which cause me to stand and watch it for quite some time.  As I did, it came closer to me (I know not how much it actually moved) and then retreated a few times.  It also seemed to zig zag from right to left and back again during this process.  I was afraid to leave it for fear that it might be gone when I got back, but I was ultimately able to pull myself away long enough to run in my parents&#39; house and get my mother who promptly followed me outside.  I quickly pointed it out to her.  As soon as she spotted it, the light quickly flashed across the night sky from horizon to horizon in the matter of a split second much in the same way that a ship in science fiction movie would go to &#34;warp&#34; or &#34;light&#34; speed.  And that was the end of the encounter except for my mom calling the county sheriff to report strange lights in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The main change is the date.  Please revise date from 12/20/93 to 12/23/93.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &lt;---- Updated Report (not many changes besides the date) I also emailed photos ----&gt; Date of sighting: Thursday, December 23, 1993 - approximately noon Location of sighting: Valencia, CA @ hilltop near I-5 and 126 interchange (34° 26&#39; 50N&#34; Latitude 118° 36&#39; 10W&#34; Longitude) I only have one sighting to share but it has kept me thinking for many years now. I think a sighting can be very informative if the observer notes not only what was seen but also the circumstances under which it was seen. I used to work for an amusement park in Valencia, California called Six Flags Magic Mountain. I was a senior in high school at the time and worked the summers, weekends, and holidays. This week the forecast called for thunderstorms and a high probability showers. It was only a few more days before Christmas and one of those days when I knew the park would be empty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That day I was on my lunch break when I sat in my usual quiet spot not far from where Batman the Ride would later be built. It overlooked our employee facilities in the foreground and the intersection of the I-5 freeway (north/south) and the 126 (east/west) in the distance. My view was to the east and toward a small range of mountains on the other side of the I-5. The mtn peak is about 200 feet above the I-5 freeway. At its base now sits an extension to the Valencia Industrial Center and the northbound I-5 to 126 off-ramp. On the other side of this mtn range is a field of gas wells in what is called the Honor Rancho Plant (owned and operated by Southern California Gas Company).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At lunchtime there was a thunderstorm moving from north to south. It had already passed where I was but I could still see the lightning in the distance and the sky was entirely overcast. About 15 minutes after I sat down I had finished what I was eating and looked out at the freeway, at the range beyond, and then to the clouds. I was just passing the time I had away from my work when I saw something moving in the lower layer of the cloud formations. It was situated across the freeway and just above the mtn range (about 100 ft above the hill&#39;s peak). At first I thought it was a shadow. As it came into clearer view I thought maybe it was a helicopter even though I didn&#39;t see a tail and its shape wasn&#39;t quite the same. It was in nearly zero visibility because of the clouds and was inching southward (left to right), much slower than the clouds around it. This is probably why it caught my eye. It was a grayish tone (maybe metallic), elliptical in shape with the long axis parallel to the horizon line, about 25ft in width, 12ft in height, and had no distinguishing extrusions. If it had any markings on its surface I couldn&#39;t see them from this distance (1.4 miles). Patches of cloud would make it appear and disappear over what was to be 2-3 minutes. I watched almost unblinking at what I couldn&#39;t identify. I might add that the only sounds I heard included a light thundering to the south and the hum of the traffic on the I-5. I would normally have also heard the occasional yell from someone on a ride some distance away, but because today was a few days before Christmas the park was virtually empty. Then at one point clouds passed in front of it, obscuring it completely. I thought I&#39;d lost it, but I kept watching. 15-20 seconds later it reappeared the cloud having passed it. Now it was clearer than ever and it hadn&#39;t hardly moved. I still couldn&#39;t see any detail and my mind was a blank as to what this object could possibly be. It was kind of small to be a blimp and kind of big to be a balloon but I guess it could ha! ve been one or the other. Then it did something no blimp or balloon I&#39;ve ever seen could do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 2-3 minutes, the object shot up into the clouds instantaneously, like it had been attached to some long extended rubber band that I couldn&#39;t see. The speed was so fast (and the fact that the object was already nearly engulfed by the clouds surrounding it) that, had I blinked, I would have certainly missed this last maneuver. There was no deformation in the object that I noticed in the 2-3 minutes that I watched it. What I did see however was the deformation of the misty cloud as the movement of air suddenly displaced it. This was the one key piece of information that convinced me what I saw was actually there. A fraction of a second before the object lurched upward I also saw it drop ever so slightly like it was &#34;changing gears&#34; or transitioning from one mode of operation to another. The speed of the final maneuver convinced me that what I was dealing with was not a object of any kind I had ever seen and I thought this maneuver was the last of this sighting and that I&#39;d never see anything this unusual again. I was wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately looked at my watch hoping to record the exact date and time of the sighting, but all I could manage to remember was the placement of the second hand and only for a moment at that. This is why. I continued to look in awe over the freeway for some hope of an answer. Then, about 10-15 seconds after the object had shot into the clouds, a small bolt of lightning that I couldn&#39;t hear at that distance struck EXACTLY where the object (above the hill&#39;s peak) had been situated. I was sure this was no coincidence and I&#39;ve thought about this sighting (the only sighting I&#39;ve ever had) for years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have no prior report for Castaic Junction for December 1993, or a report from the same witness.   We are somewhat confused by the witness&#39; request, but we assume the alleged event occurred on December 23, 1993.  We have amended the date here.  PD))<n>

The night before was a crisp clear cold night. We were standing around the fire, talking, listening to music when my brother called us to, &#34;Come look at this!&#34;  We went to where my brother was standing and looked to where he was pointing into the sky across and above Rock Run.  We saw an extreamly large triangular shape moving over the ridge of the mountain across from us (McIntyire Mt.).  My husband quickly went and turned the radio and generator off.  The triangular shape continued to slowly follow the top of the mountain. We could clearly see stars in the heavans until this shape moved between us and the stars.  The form was a solid mass that blocked the light from the stars. We all noticed that this huge thing made absolutely no audible sound. I saw that it had three bluish white lights, one on each corner. My brothers also noted a red light.  I did not take notice to a red one. It&#39;s hard to put to scale how big this was, but I can tell you my opinion is that it was at the very least the length of two football fields long and one half of that wide.  It dissappeared over the mountain and that was the last time we saw it.  It was unnerving to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Singular object splits in two, lights fly across sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On one evening around Dec 19-20 1993 (approx the date of Hubble&#39;s first repair mission, either the launch evening or the evening of the repair) a friend and I witnessed a Ufo fly over the area of Ottumwa, Iowa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had heard on television that NASA were working on the Hubble and we wanted to see if the shuttle was visible at all, my friend and I grabbed our binoculars and stepped out into the driveway of my home. We were looking all over (we really had no idea where the shuttle or telescope would be, we were simply enthusiastic teens looking around)  5 minutes or so go by... my friend was looking Southeast and I looked toward the Northeast for a while and paused, I then saw what appeared to be a shooting star, instantly it splits into two balls of light (i then told my friend to look at it) we both watched as the two lights flew in formation from Northeast to Southeast, their behavior was very bizarre and exciting to watch, they flew as if a ribbon had been placed up in the sky and they were following the shape of it, going up and down irregularly, the lights flew from left to right across the horizon like this. My friend was clever enough to grab his binoculars and watch as it trailed off into the horizon, all he could say was &#34;no, way! no, way! because we both thought at the time we had just seen a Ufo. He reported the object was disc shaped through his binoculars after he watched it trail off into the distance.. I can&#39;t verify that it was, as all I saw were two lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were witnessed for approximately 8-10 seconds, they crossed our field of view in that time and emitted no noise that we could hear. From our point of view the object entered from the Northeast, splt in two, travelled south and exited Southeast..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many years later I heard of the phenomena of ball lighting, I thought perhaps that was what we had seen but the two light sources seemed to fly with each other the entire time. If I were to guess the altitude, over 1,000 feet above ground, probably anywhere from 1,000 - 5,000 would be my best guess, it appeared to be rather close from where we stood. There is a communications tower near here, it flew above and behind that at a distance. Speed, most likely over 1,000mph, It crossed our field of view in 8 seconds or so. I can&#39;t remember the color of the lights, all I remember is thinking the object was a shooting star at first..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can provide an illustration of what we saw or a high quality animation if needed. I am an artist, it is actually easier for me to show what we saw than describe it. It would be an approximation however, I can&#39;t remember the exact details as it has been many years, the memory is still fairly vivid though..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just thought I&#39;d report this incase there was a similar sighting in the area on or around that date. This is 100% for real, no bs.<n>

Object in cloud hovers/manuevers then lightening bolt strikes at same location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following was taken from a post I often send to alt.ufo.reports: I only have one story to share but it has kept me thinking for about seven years now.  A sighting can be very informative if the observer notes not only what was seen but also the circumstances under which it was seen. I use to work for an amusement park in Valencia, California called Six Flags Magic Mountain. I was a senior in high school at the time and worked the summers and weekends (during school). This weekend the forecast called for thunderstorms and a high probability of showers. That Saturday I was on my lunch break when I sat in my usual quiet spot away from the crowds. It overlooked the intersection of the I-5 freeway (north/south) and the 126 (east/west). My view was to the east and toward a small range of mountains on the other side of the I-5. The mtn range is about 500 feet in height. At its base now sits an extension to the original industrial center (at the time a small plot of crops was growing at this particular location). At lunchtime there was a thunderstorm moving from north to south. It had already passed where I was but I could still see the lightning in the distance and the sky was entirely overcast. About 15 minutes after I sat down I had finished what I was eating and looked out at the freeway, at the range beyond, and then to the clouds. I was just passing the time I had away from my work when I saw something moving in the lower layer of the cloud formations. It was situated across the freeway and just above the mtn range (about 200 ft above the hill&#39;s peak). At first I thought it was a helicopter even though I didn&#39;t see a tail or rotor.  It was in nearly zero visibility because of the clouds. It was moving from north to south as though it were following the storm but from a safe distance (or so it seemed). It was inching southward (left to right), but at a speed non-constant and different from that of the clouds around it (this is probably why it caught my eye). It was a grayish tone (maybe metallic), elliptical in shape, maybe 25-35 feet in length, and had no distinguishing extrusions. If it had any markings on its surface I couldn&#39;t see them from this distance (it still seemed close). Patches of cloud would make it appear and disappear over what was to be a 2-3 minute interval. I watched almost unblinking at what I couldn&#39;t identify. I don&#39;t know why but the thought of a balloon or a blimp never came to mind and it could have been either if not for one last awesome maneuver. I might also add that the only sounds I heard included the occasional yell from someone on a ride some distance away, a light thundering to the south, and the hum of the traffic on the I-5. After 2-3 minutes of this, the craft shot up into the clouds like it had been attached to some long extended rubber band that I couldn&#39;t see. The speed was so fast (and the fact that the craft was already nearly engulfed by the clouds surrounding it) that, had I blinked, I would have certainly missed this last maneuver.

This is why. I continued to look in awe over the freeway for some hope of an answer. Sixty seconds after the craft had shot into the clouds a small bolt of lightning (I couldn&#39;t even hear it at that distance) struck EXACTLY where the craft (above the hill&#39;s peak) had been situated.  I was sure this was no coincidence and I&#39;ve thought about this sighting (the only sighting I&#39;ve ever had) for years. I&#39;m 25 and a student of architecture. My interests include design, models, computers, and tennis. I don&#39;t normally follow UFO sightings but I do post this story once in a while. I&#39;ve lived in New Jersey for two years and in California the rest. I don&#39;t have a religion and I&#39;m not superstitious. I like to keep an open mind, but I&#39;m often skeptical.  This was just a story for others to read and I hope you found it interesting. I don&#39;t expect I&#39;ll ever see anything like this again. UPDATE (8/28/00): I decided to hike up to the top of the hill to see for myself what interest anyone would have with this particular location.  From the top of the hill I could see both the I-5 and 126 extending into the distance.  I could see one of Southern Calif. Edison&#39;s power stations (a whole bank of power line towers), the Rye Canyon Industrial Center, Six Flags Magic Mountain and basically a lot of new development.  I also found the well (a Wayside Equivalent Zone Unit) that was recently installed and which I had mentioned above.  It turns out Southern Calif. Gas Co. has a plant (and a few dozen wells) on the other side of the mtn range.  I think Southern Calif. Gas Co. probably owns the land this craft was hovering over.  I spent about 30 minutes on that hill and saw a lot of aircraft flying right over head (mostly civilian but also some military).  Both Burbank and Santa Paula airports aren&#39;t terribly far.  There has also been some controlled burning of brush on the site (typical of dry brush areas).<n>

Not much along the lines of UFOs has happened in my life since becoming a teenager years ago, though I do find myself drawn to UFO/extraterrestrial investigation on a regular basis.

I have only told 3 people this story.  I saw what I saw as clear as the laptop i am looking at right now. Absolutely no mystery to me. I could care less if people believe me but after seeing you i thought a valid sighting was worth recording with someone. I don&#39;t tell anyone about it because they would think me odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My name is       . I am a 41 yr old business owner now living in Santa Barbara, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In October of 1993 Orange Couty CA was ravaged by fires.Hundreds of homes in Laguna Beach CA burned to the ground. 400 approx. Hundreds of other homes burned in the area as well. Orange County was on fire. I mention this because it seems a rather significant event that may have caused some interest to something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We owned a wonderful oceanview home in the exclusive gated community of Emerald Bay. Our home burned down that month, October 23rd I recall. With all we had left being a lot full of ash we would come from our rented home to walk on the beautiful private beach of Emerald Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On approx Dec 15, 1993 there had been light rains that day and the clouds were light, and very high, but mostly it was clear. We were walking down the beach for about 15 minutes towards the north. The bay is about one mile long from end to end. When we walked to the North end we turned around and walked back to the center to watch the sun go down. The visibility was fantastic, we could clearly see the Island of Catalina and beyond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the sun actually set over the horizon we got up and started to walk back towards our car when I looked strait out, over the ocean, to the south of Catalina perhaps 15-20 degrees up from the ocean horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We witnessed an object in the air that had the sun still reflecting off it. No blinking light. It looked round or oval, i think metalic in it&#39;s reflection.  At first it just stayed there, for about 3 or 4 seconds.  We both thought, plane, and were about to look away. It seemed like a far away plane was having the sun reflecting off it. Just before looking away the darn thing shot off at an extreme angle and stopped! This thing moved so fast all we saw was a blur.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed in that position for maybe 2 seconds and shot off again at an extreme angle to another position. OK, now it had our ATTENTION. I looked at my wife and said &#34;Does anything we have move like that?&#34;. We watched this thing for about 40 seconds or so. It did about 7 angled moves before shooting off again at an extreme angle only to not be seen again. It appeared to be farther out than Catalina, more than 20 miles out at least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an extremely skeptical person. Nothing I know of could move like that, take the g forces.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is my story for what it is worth. I will say this. I absolutely believe that object was not of this earth, I saw it, would swear by it, take a polygraph, etc. I also definately believe in what I saw. I only wish I could have filmed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can anyone tell me what can move like that? Since this time I have become an amateur astronomer and though I know I will probably never see something like this again I have become very interested in all subjects having to do with our universe. Esp. observing deep sky objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My equipment includes a 25&#34; Newtonian and my hobby has close to $30,000 in equip. to give you some idea of how interested I have become.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was driving my girlfriend home one night, on Humboldt Rd. just passed over the highway heading away from the city. As we were driving up to the left I saw this circular light. The best way I can describe it would be that of light coming out of a lampshade that angles downward. This object was not very high, had absolutely no other lights such as a tail light on helicopters or any wing lights, and made absolutely no sound, or no sound we were aware of. The object travelled exactly the same speed as traffic. As soon as I saw it and realized it wasn&#39;t a glare or reflection I asked my girlfriend what the hell that was. She looked and watched it in awe. As we drove down the road watching it, it suddenly literally just took off. Instantly flew forward out of view, I&#39;ve never seen anything move so fast in my life. It was very eerie, I felt excited because I knew I saw something that is very rare to see and something some people simply can&#39;t believe exists as they haven&#39;t experienced it themselves. I dropped her off and she too was shocked and knew she saw a &#34;UFO&#34;. I haven&#39;t seen anything of that nature since. However, in summer of &#39;99 I was swimming in the backyard of a friends house around 3-4 a.m. when we saw a blinking light as far as the stars. Now, this blinking light we found very odd, especially the individual whose pool it was because he watches the stars a lot, because this light changed direction numerous amounts of times. We would watch this light blink once in one area of the sky. About a minute later it traveled I would say the length of the big dipper and blinked again. Then another minute later it would blink up in a total different area as it had changed course. We watched this object for approximately 20-30 minutes. Very odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date, time, and duration of sighting all appear to be approximate.  PD))<n>

As I was headed home going north on 95 between 1:30 and 2:00 am I saw &#34;something&#34; that was traveling at an extremly fast clip leaving a florecent green trail in the shape of a triangle and there was this orangish white light object traveling in a tight corkscrew path through the bottom middle of the triangle making a lazy &#34;J&#34; that was the color of a modern day streetlamp. Each side of the triangle was, at best guess, 15 to 20 miles long, and it had to have been 25 to 50 miles away from where I was. About 3 days later I was traveling down the same hwy at about the same time in the same direction when I saw what looked like a propeller from a helecopter(again florecent green)whizzing by me on my right(West)side with two more orange-white sentinals on either side of the &#34;propeller&#34;. And about five days after that, I was getting out of my car in my apartment driveway when I saw a single orange-white sentinal light make another lazy &#34;J&#34; into the nightsky and disappear.<n>
12/10/93 19:30|Morganton|NC|Circle|20 seconds|Red Object over my backyard.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32748.html|12|ndxe199312| Red Object over my backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this date, I was putting wood in my woodstove, which is located in my den. The den has a window which is level with the front yard. The ground was covered with snow, about an inch, maybe a bit more. As I was putting the wood in, I noticed the whole front yard was red. Assuming my chimminey was on fire, I ran upstairs and went to the deck which is located in the back of the house. As I went past my mother, which at that time was living with my wife and I, I told her, &#34;I think my chimminey is on fire!&#34; Once I opened the sliding door which leads to the deck, she was behind me. As I looked outside, the whole back yard was bright red. Looking toward the chimminey I realized it was not on fire. I looked around and saw a bright red round object over my backyard. It looked like a red spotlight, but big. I would say it was about 100 yards above the backyard. The exact size is hard to decribe due to the brightness of the light, as if looking into a spotlight. But it was bigger than, let&#39;s say, a full size van. It hovered there for a few seconds and shot straight up, faster then anything I have ever seen, a loud boom followed and it disappeared going up. It disappeared in less than a second or two. Being ex-U.S. Army, a Sgt (E-5) with the 82nd ABN, two combat tours, I know it was not a military plane or helicopter. The boom, it is my opinion was the sound barrier being broken due to the speed it went up. I have seen many weapons and planes/helicopters in action, I have seen F-15&#39;s and F-16&#39;s fly over my head low, but nothing will compare to how fast this object shot straight up, even faster than missiles being shot from a MRLS vehicle. The speed was undescribable. One curious thing is that it did not emit any sound, as in a motor running, only the boom as it went up. My next door neighbor came out to his deck and yelled at me, &#34;Did you shoot a shotgun?!&#34; I told him no, I didn&#39;t but had heard a noise, not figuring he would understand what I had just seen. My mother saw the object also. I know it ! was not a military plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure about the exact date, but I am sure it was around December of &#39;93.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

12/5/93 01:00|Poughkeepsie|NY|Unknown|10 minutes|Five lights over my car in the Catskills.|6/12/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22889.html|13|ndxe199312| Five lights over my car in the Catskills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving north on the Taconic State Parkway, early in the morning, the fog very dense in patches, I noticed a light shining down on the north side of the parkway about 50 yards in the distance. The light seemed to come from what I thought was very late night construction. As I drove closer I noticed how strange it was that there were no cars behind me. I slowed as I approached and stopped directly under five lights that were in a pentagon pattern about 10 - 15 feet apart from each other and about 20 feet above me. I stared up through my windshield and opened my window to see better. My heart was racing. I noticed no sound, from anywhere. Everything seemed very quiet, strangely quiet. Fear overcame me and I drove off, watching the light fade in my mirror. My normal travel time for this trip was always about 2.5 hours. That evening it took me 4.5 hours to arrive. Never thought I sat there for more than 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

The ship was located roughly 200nm West of the Maldives.  We were at about 22,000 feet flying at 250 knots, so a medium altitude and slow speed.  What was most important is we were in the middle of nowhere, and being a radar surveillance plan had a good track on everything around us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With no nearby tracks from multiple sensors, a bright light shown into our aircraft from directly above.  It was an intensely bright white light that illuminated the cockpit and shown through the small cracks in the radar shielding in the rear aircraft windows.  It traveled with us for about 5 seconds and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We submitted a report to a Naval Intelligence Officer we debriefed after the flight.

12/1/93 14:00|Arlington|TX|Oval|5 to 10 minutes|Enormous UFO Arlington, Texas|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50228.html|15|ndxe199312| Enormous UFO Arlington, Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I have given the date of my sighting as December of 1993, I am unsure of the exact date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving East on Arkansas Lane in Arlington Texas in early afternoon.  As I topped the hill and approached the intersection of Park Springs and Arkansas Lane I saw an enormous oval shaped disk that appeared to be made of highly polished silver, hovering over the City of Grand Prairie, Texas, which is the City to East of Arlington and about 10 miles from the intersection I was approaching.  It seemed to me to be about the width of a football field or two and was much larger on the horizon than the Dalworthington Gardens Water tower that came into view as I approached the next traffic light at the corner of Spanish Trail and Arkansas Lane.  The strange thing about this sighting is that the UFO appeared to be appearing and disappearing as it sort of wobbled while sitting there in the sky.  Although I did not see any airliners at that time, The UFO seemed to be sitting well above the trees that were visible to me and just under a landing flight path to DFW Airport that I generally always see a plane or two making a final approach when I travel East on Arkansas Lane.  Sometime before this sighting, I remember hearing about some one or some group trying to project a picture of Christ in the skyline above New York City and at first I thought that because the UFO was appearing and disappearing that perhaps that was happening here also.  However, this was in broad daylight.  I looked to my left, intending to honk at the white pick up truck to my left and call the driver&#39;s attention to what ever this was.  However when I looked at the driver, I could see that the gentleman driving the truck had his mouth open and was looking at the same sight I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued down Arkinsas Lane and the UFO continued to hover and appear and disappear until I reached the intersection of Bowen Rd. and Arkansas Lane.  Then the UFO disappeared and never appeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, I was again in my car listening to either the local Classical or Oldies but Goodies Radio station, when the announcer made the following addition to a short news break, &#34;All you people in Arlington, who called in to report what you thought was a UFO yesterday were actually seeing a weather baloon.&#34;  I was not one of those people who called in, but I do know that what I saw was no weather baloon.  At the time of my sighting, I did not have a computer.  Two years later when I did purchase one, I began a search that continues today for someone, anyone who saw this same UFO  I am unsure of the date and even the exact year, but I know that others must have seen it and either called the authorities or a radio a station to report it.<n>
12/1/93 02:30|Windham|NH|Other|1/2 hour but not sure|Lights inside a cloud-like covering over a pond. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60522.html|16|ndxe199312| Lights inside a cloud-like covering over a pond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am about the most skeptical person you will ever meet but after about 15 yeas I am going to recount an experience that I and my wife had. I have only spoken about his with my wife since but it is still very much in our memory. Extremely clear and, in fact about the most clear memory I have from my past. That in itself is very odd to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was early winter (Dec/Jan) 1993 and we were living in a rented house on a pond in Windham, NH. I was sleeping at about 2:30 am and was awoken by light dancing on the ceiling of our bedroom. It was not that unusual as the pond water would reflect car headlights going by. The odd part was that I felt threatened and actually a little scared and I am not sure why. I am a pretty big guy and not much scares me, but this was very creepy. I do not know why, but I got up and went to the back yard. When I looked up I saw what appeared to be a round cloud (like a big cotton ball) about the size of a tractor trailer, slowly rising and hovering at the other end of the pond. Inside this cloud were several lights that were pulsing on and off. They were blue and white and the “cloud” material seemed to expand and contract around it, almost like liquid. There was absolutely no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I actually do not remember getting to the shore of the pond or even leaving the house but when I realized what I was looking at I was completely amazed. I do not remember being afraid at all but what is a bit frightening now is how I got to the shoreline of the pond. This loss of memory has never happened to me before. That really haunts me because I have no absolutely no memory of it. At this point I went back into the house and woke my wife up. I asked her to come outside and she did. It was still there and she saw it. It had moved a little further away and higher in altitude (I would guess it started at 100 feet and when my wife saw it, it was at 500 feet) We stood there for a few minutes and didn’t say anything. She looked at me and said “let’s go in”.  As we went back to the house I do not remember if it was still there. That is another thing that really haunts me. We went back to bed and looked at each other and were pretty much too amazed to talk. I do not remember falling asleep but I did and as soon as I woke up for work I asked my wife if she remembered it and she just said, yes. I asked her to describe it and she did to a tee. After that she asked if we could not talk about it. She was clearly shaken by something neither of us could explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every now and again we do talk about it but never with anyone else. I know this sounds weird but this is coming from a guy who just does not believe any of the UFO stuff. Even today I find myself doubting every report I hear but I listen closely to see if what is being reported is described as a cloud with lights pulsing inside of it. I have yet to hear a report that comes close to what I saw so I will just leave it at that. I am a professional manager with a large software company. I still live in NH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
