It is located near the local airport which services both airlines, general aviation and some military training flights so I was used to seeing aircraft of all types take off from many, many vantage points, including the front living room where I was this Saturday night (i know it was a Saturday becasue my parents and my dad&#39;s boss and his wife were playing pinochle in the kitchen as they did every Saturday night). We had a large picture window and as I watched out of it, I saw two orange (not red) lights leave from the vicinity of the runway and rise in a very shallow takeoff. Halfway up, they made a sharp lateral 45 degree jag (not the usual banked turn but a true 45 degree right hand veer in their horizontal course) and immediately made a return to their original horizantal position (that is made a similar but counter 45 degree jag to the left). They then promptly changed attitudes so that their climb was about 60-70 degrees and left the area. There is a road 1 house down from ours that could have casued car tailights to reflect on the glass with a gust of wind making it appear as if they deveated from their path. However, again, the lights were orange, not red as expected on tailights or position lights of aircraft. Additionally, I did not see any vehicles on the second road before or after I saw these lights. I was watching out the window as I listened to albums so was not distracted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I went to the edge of the back yard and looked down and saw a saucer shaped &#34;craft&#34; in a clearing below. I saw being milling about and the next think I knew there were a group of them coming up the hill and in the back yard.the next thing I rememberd was being alone in my apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

2/15/70|Colorado Springs|CO||4 WEEKS|THREE FLIGHTS OF FOUR CONTACTS ON RADAR IN 1970 AS SEEN AT NORAD, CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN.|10/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25777.html|5|ndxe197002| THREE FLIGHTS OF FOUR CONTACTS ON RADAR IN 1970 AS SEEN AT NORAD, CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I WORKED FOR NORAD INSIDE CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN IN COLORADO SPRINGS. I WAS IN U.S.ARMY. I WORKED SHIFT WORK SUPPORTING THE COMMAND DIAS. AT NIGHTS ON WEEK ENDS IT IS ALWAYS QUIET. WE MONITORED REPORTS FROM ALL RADAR STATIONS MAKING UP THE EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS. THE NEXT TO THE LAST WEEKEND IN MARCH OF 1970 DURING THE HOURS AFTER MIDNIGHT, WE STARTED RECEIVING REPORTS OF FOUR CONTACTS CROSSING THE BERING SEA AND THEN FOLLOWING THE COAST OF ALASKIA AND BRITISH COLUMBIA AT AN ALTITUDE OF OVER 25,000 FEET AT SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF 2500 MPH. A FLIGHT OF 2 FIGHTER WERE LAUNCHED IN ALASKIA, THEY NEVER INTERCEPTED THE CONTACTS. THE CONTACTS WERE THE SIZE OF FOUR ENGINED BOMBERS. SHORTLY BEFORE REACHING VANCOVER THEY TURNED AND EXCELERATED STRAIGHT UP AND OUT THE TOP OF OUR D.E.W. SYSTEMS. THERE WERE CONTINIOUS REPORTS FROM THE THEN NAMED SPACE DEFENSE CENTER, OTHER THAT NOTICE OF THE REPORTS WE (THE DEPARTMENT WHERE I WORKED: FORCSTAT/MDARS-MILITARY DAMAGE ACCESSMENT REPORTING SYSTEM) DID NOT RECEIVE THE INFORMATION IN THE REPORTS GIVEN TO THE DIAS. THE NEXT WEEKEND I WAS NOT ON DUTY, BUT IT HAPPENED ALL AGAIN, JUST THE SAME WAY. THE THIRD WEEKEND(THE FIRST WEEKEND IN APRIL) NOTHING HAPPENED. THE FOURTH WEEKEND IT HAPPENED AGAIN, WHILE I WAS ON DUTY. FOUR CONTACTS CROSSING THE BERING SEA AND DOWN THE COAST. I WAS 19 AT THE TIME AND NAIVE. ALL THE OLD TIMERS WHO WERE MOSTLY RADAR TECHS AND FORMER RADAR SYSTEM TECHS WHO HAD WORKED DIRECTLY ON THE D.E.W. LINE RADAR STATIONS LET ME IN ON THE SECRET. THIS KIND OF THING HAPPENED ALL THE TIME. BUT YOU LEARNED TO NEVER REPORT IT IN ANY WRITTEN REPORTS. AND TO NEVER QUESTION IT. ONE MAJOR WHO WAS A FRIEND (AS MUCH AS A 19 YR OLD SGT CAN HAVE A MAJOR FOR A FRIEND) TOLD ME OF THE TIME HE WAS ASSIGNED TO WORKING IN GREENLAND. THEY WERE UPDATING AND EXPANDING THE THULE GREENLAND BASE. THEY HAD COLORED LIGHT DISPLAYS ON AN ALMOST DAILY BASIS. ORANGE BALLS WERE THE LARGEST; FOOTBALL FIELD SIZE IN DIAMETER, REDS WERE HALF THAT SIZE. BLUES WERE TWENTY TO THIRTY FEET IN DIAMETER AND G! REEN AND YELLOWS WERE BASKETBALL SIZE. THE SMALLER ONES ACTUALLY ENTERED AND FLEW DOWN THE LARGE CORRIDORS OF THE BASE. THIS WAS THE TIME THAT A NUCLEAR REACTOR WAS INSTALLED TO SUPPLY POWER. IF I COULD GET ANY OF THE TECHS TALKING THEY ALL HAD THEIR OWN STORIES. I HAVE NEVER REPORTED THIS TO ANYONE OR PUT THIS INTO WRITING BEFORE, KNOWING ALL THE TRUTH WILL NEVER BE OUT THERE IN PRINT.<n>
2/10/70 20:30|Los Angeles|CA|Disk|app. 10 min|I sighted a disc shaped object hovering above the trees in a residential area of southwest Los Angeles in early 1970|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17554.html|6|ndxe197002| I sighted a disc shaped object hovering above the trees in a residential area of southwest Los Angeles in early 1970<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting took place in the Baldwin Hills/Crenshaw area of Los Angeles in February of 1970.  While traveling north on LaBrea Avenue, coming down the hill toward Coliseum Ave, I saw very bright lights, resembling lights in a stadium, but they appeared to be too high up to be from a stadium (there was no stadium in that area.) These lights seemed odd so the driver of the car decided to investigate.  We went in their direction into a residential area that was on the north west side of Rodeo Rd and LaBrea Avenue. I&#39;m not possitive of the exact location because I was new to Los Angeles at that time and didn&#39;t know the area well.  I did, however, know LaBrea and Rodeo Rd intersection. When we approached the area that seemed to be the source of the lights we traveled down a residential street that had a &#34;T&#34; intersection.  As we approached this intersection, and turned right, our car headlights turned toward a very large object hovering above the tree tops and electric wire poles. As our lights turned toward this object, it flashed two lights back at us as if signaling back in response to our headlights shining toward it.  This object was at the corner of this intersection and was large enough to cover the full width of the street as well as part of the house nearest that corner.  We immediately drove under it, which enabled me to see the bottom. The bottom was a light color that appeared to be either sand color or a light beige and it had the appearance of a wheel with a hub and spokes radiating from it, so my assumption is that it was disc shaped.  These &#34;spokes&#34; appeared to be dimensional rather than painted and at the center was a light that was red when we passed under.  I couldn&#39;t determine the actual shape of the top because it was very dark outside, and I couldn&#39;t see the outline due to the bright lights that flashed back at us. I assumed that the lights were on the front of the vehicle but cannot say if there were other lights. This object made absolutely no sound and was completely motionless when we encountered it. We drove under it, pulled over to the side of the street just beyond it, at which time the driver of the car became hysterical because she recoginzed it to be a UFO. I wanted to get out to have a better look but the passenger side of the door was jammed due to a previous accident and wouldn&#39;t open. I could not get the driver to move to let me out. By the time she pulled herself together, started the car engine and made a U-turn to head back in the direction of the UFO, it was gone.  It made no sound when it moved off.  I don&#39;t know whether it moved sideways or straight up but it must have taken off at a fast speed because the whole episode seemed to be very brief.  When we reached the corner where it had been hovering, I tried to look in the sky and spot it.  I did see lights in the far distance, west of our location, and at the time I assumed these lights could have been the object.  In retrospect I cannot say for certain.  It may have moved sidways, up or it may have vanished.  I don&#39;t know. About a week or two after this event, while returning home from evening school in downtown Los Angeles, I was a passenger riding on the Santa Monica Freeway, heading west of downtown.  Needless to say, I was watching the skys trying to see this object again.  I did see a bright stationary light in the sky, to the left of the freeway in the area of Normandie or Western Avenue and south of the freeway.  As I looked at it, wondering if this was the same UFO, the light &#34;winked out.&#34;  It was like someone turning off a light and then there was nothing. The day after my initial sighting, the driver of the car and I called several places, including Goodyear just to confirm it was not a blimp we had seen, although we knew it wasn&#39;t. Also, it was not a helicopter, as you can hear them a mile away. Goodyear confirmed that no blimps had been in the air at all because of the wind conditions. The car driver called an office of the Air Force and was told they knew nothing.  Upon making further calls she was told this was a vehicle being tested by Hughes Aircraft, and that the neighborhood had been notified. This was 1970 and to my knowledge we had no vehicles that were shaped like this or that could perform in this manner.  To date, we still don&#39;t unless they are really more secret than some of the black projects.  I got a pretty good look at the bottom side of this UFO as we drove under and there were no wings or apendages that I could see and it was totally silent and motionless until it moved away from the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
